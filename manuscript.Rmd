<!-- Emotion regulation in adolescence is important -->
A key developmental challenge in adolescence is acquiring mature emotion
regulation skills [@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012;
@zimmermannEmotionRegulationEarly2014]. Emotion regulation is integral to
mental health[@aldaoEmotionregulationStrategiesPsychopathology2010;
@schaferEmotionRegulationStrategies2017; @braetEmotionRegulationChildren2014]
and social functioning [@reindlSocializationEmotionRegulation2016]. For as many
as one in five people, adolescence marks the onset of emotion
regulation-related mental illness, which can persist throughout the life course
[see @leeAdolescentMentalHealth2014]. It is therefore crucial to identify which
risk factors and environmental hazards render some adolescents more susceptible
to emotional difficulties than others. Although there is an abundance of
empirical work on adolescents' emotion regulation, the literature is somewhat
fragmented, as the topic has been investigated from different (sub)disciplines.
This study seeks to overcome this limitation by mapping all factors currently
thought to be relevant to adolescent emotion regulation, based on a systematic
review and bibliographic analysis. <!-- Ergens anders: Similarly, although
there are several *relevant* theories, there is no specific theoretical
framework to guide research on adolescents' emotion regulation. Although theory
development is beyond the scope of this paper, we set out to generate a
proto-theoretical nomological network of the potential risk factors,
manifestations, and outcomes of emotion regulation in adolescence. We discuss
how this nomological network relates to existing relevant theory, and conclude
with recommendations for future theory-generating efforts.-->

## Why adolescence is an important life phase for emotion regulation

Adolescence is defined as a life phase ranging from pubertal onset to
adult-like independence [@steinbergAgeOpportunityLessons2014]. This definition
invokes both biological- and socio-cultural factors. It has been argued that,
due to accellerated pubertal onset and delayed transitions to adult roles,
adolescence now ranges from 10-24 years in the modern Western world
[@sawyerAgeAdolescence2018].

<!-- From Barriola:
* adolescence, more than adulthood or childhood, is characterized by frequent
and intense emotions (Larson et al. 1980; Larson and Lampmanpetraitis 1989).
* signi?cant psychosocial changes that call for an increase in sophistication
of ER strategies (Steinberg 2005)
* novel stressors associated with social relationships, including pressures to
conform to adult expectations relating to maturity, educational achievement,
gender appropriate conduct, and other socially competent behaviors (Yap et al.
2007)
* Additionally, adolescents have an increased orientation toward autonomy
(Spear 2000) including autonomous emotional regulation-->

Adolescence is increasingly seen as a developmentally sensitive period for
mature emotion regulation skills. During this period, children experience rapid
biological, cognitive, and social changes that prompt new emotional
experiences, and tax existing regulatory abilities
[@steinbergAgeOpportunityLessons2014]. At the same time, the staggered
development of motivational-emotional and regulatory brain circuits gives rise
to a maturity gap, where youngsters pursue new experiences in life and love,
without being fully prepared to cope with the emotional outcomes
[@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012]. Due to these coalescing changes,
adolescents display a restricted repertoire of emotion regulation strategies
compared to younger or older individuals
[@zimmermannEmotionRegulationEarly2014]. Consequently, adolescents experience
more frequent and intense (negative) emotions than children or adults [see
@silkAdolescentsEmotionRegulation2003]. The literature thus paints a picture of
adolescence as a chrysalis for emotional development: Children enter this stage
with emotion regulation skills adapted to the challenges of childhood. During
adolescence, emotional systems are rearranged substantially. These changes
render adolescents temporarily vulnerable to emotional dysregulation, but
ultimately serve a functional role in acquiring mature emotion regulation
skills. Eventually, most adolescents emerge ready to take on the challenges of
early adulthood. Unfortunately, a sizeable proportion of adolescents instead
manifests enduring emotional difficulties.

<!--
* intense negative emotions in daily life (Silk, Steinberg, & Morris, 2003) 
* unstable peer or romantic relationships (Furman & Collins, 2009)
* decrease in perceived support from parents (Furman & Buhrmester, 1992).
* early adolescence is characterized by a higher rate of conflicts with parents (Laursen, Coy, & Collins, 1998)
* higher variability of negative emotions compared to late adolescence (Larson, Moneta, Richards, & Wilson, 2002).
* relative to other developmental stages, adolescence involves a particularly large number of transitions, novel situations, and new stimuli, physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development—particularly in early and mid-adolescence (Seiffge-Krenke, 2000)

## The consequences of difficulties in emotion regulation

<!--Acquiring mature emotion regulation abilities is important, because t-->The
consequences of difficulties in emotion regulation are extensive,
well-documented, and persist throughout the life course. Meta-analyses indicate
that such difficulties are associated with externalizing, and more strongly,
with internalizing psychopathology
[@aldaoEmotionregulationStrategiesPsychopathology2010;
@schaferEmotionRegulationStrategies2017]. Individuals who engage in maladaptive
emotion regulation strategies also experience more negative emotions,
diminished well-being, and greater strain in interpersonal relationships
[@grossIndividualDifferencesTwo2003a; @bellRelationshipsInputsOutputs2000].
<!--Adolescence also appears to be a key period for developing mature emotion
regulation skills - but not all adolescents do so successfully. As many as one
in five adolescents instead develop severe emotional difficulties.--> Given the
prevalence of emotional difficulties and their extensive implications for
individual mental health, wellbeing, and social functioning, and downstream
cost to society as a whole [@leeAdolescentMentalHealth2014], it is essential to
have a solid understanding of the risk factors associated with adolescents'
emotion regulation difficulties.

## Existing relevant theory

Theory is of paramount importance when seeking to understand or explain a
phenomenon. Although there are many relevant theories, none have specifically
addressed emotion regulation development in adolescence. Several recent
publications have undertaken the monumental task of comprehensively reviewing
theory relevant to emotional development
[@bussTheoriesEmotionalDevelopment2019;
@riedigerEmotionRegulationAdolescence2014]. Thanks, in part, to their efforts,
we can provide a summary review of the theoretical landscape as context for our
empirical contribution.<!--Several recent publications have undertaken the
monumental task of providing a comprehensive overview of theories of emotional
development [e.g., @bussTheoriesEmotionalDevelopment2019;
@holodynskiDevelopmentEmotionsEmotion2006;
@riedigerEmotionRegulationAdolescence2014], and of the empirical work
pertaining to emotions in adolescence
[@coe-odessEmergentEmotionsAdolescence2019].  -->
Two theories widely invoked to frame research on development, including
emotional development, are Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model, and Sameroff's
transactional model. Bronfenbrenner's model
[@bronfenbrennerBioecologicalModelHuman2007] describes how the environment
shapes individual development. Each individual is imbued with certain
biological predispositions, and develops over time, in interaction with
contextual influences. These influences range from the microsystem, composed of
those people close to the individual, to the macrosystem, consisting of
indirect political and economic influences, to the exosystem, consisting of
cultural norms and values. Sameroff's model is somewhat compatible with the
bioecological model [@sameroffUnifiedTheoryDevelopment2010], but focuses more
on the interplay between nature and nurture. It conceptualizes development as a
product of reciprocal influences between the child and the environment.
Sameroff distinguishes between proximal influences, for instance, through
parents (the microsystem in Bronfenbrenner's model), and distal influences;
structural factors indirectly shaping development, like socio-economic status,
schools, and the community (macro- and exosystem). With increasing age, distal
influences gradually gain ground on proximal influences.

Turning now towards theories specifically addressing emotion regulation in
adolescence, Hall's notion of "storm and stress" is one of the oldest [see
@arnettAdolescentStormStress1999]. It describes how hormonal changes diminish
self-control and increase reactivity, leading to difficulties in emotion
regulation, conflict with parents, and risky behavior. Recent work provides a
more nuanced perspective on this theory. For example, although the notion of
diminished self-control and increased emotional reactivity has been upheld, it
has been recast as a necessary change that facilitates emotional maturation
[@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012], at the risk of emotional
disturbance [@arnettAdolescentStormStress1999; @leeAdolescentMentalHealth2014].
More recently, Sroufe [-@sroufeEmotionalDevelopmentOrganization1995] presented
a theory focused on normative emotional development in early childhood. It
argues that, as children grow older, their increasing self-regulatory abilities
drive a transition from external emotion regulation by primary caregivers
towards autonomous emotion regulation. This theory focuses on two drivers of
development: social and cognitive influences. Social influences mainly occur
through parents' co-regulation, parenting behaviors, and parent-child
attachment. Cognitive influences occur through the development of the central
nervous system (CNS), cognition, and self-regulation. Several other theories,
introduced below, have extemporized on these sources of influence.

The emphasis on neorocognitive development as a driver of emotional
development, including emotion regulation development, is echoed in several
other models. For example, polyvagal theory closely links emotional experience
- and regulation - to autonomous nervous system functioning
[@porgesOrientingDefensiveWorld1995]. A more recent neorocognitive theory, with
substantial relevance to adolescents' emotion regulation development, is Crone
and Dahl's model of social-affective engagement and goal flexibility
[@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012]. This theory is based on the notion
of a "maturity gap" in middle-adolescence, arising from a developmental
asymmetry between motivational and inhibitory brain circuits
[@craccoEmotionRegulationChildhood2017;
@caseyBrakingAcceleratingAdolescent2011]. However, it sets out to explain - to
a greater extent than other writings - adolescents' diverging destinies; the
question why some youngsters flourish while others languish. Crone and Dahl
argue that adolescents' cognitive engagement is dynamically responsive to
social and motivational goal salience. This flexibility, on the one hand,
prepares adolescents to effectively engage cognitive systems in novel
challenging situations in a way that facilitates developing mature regulatory
abilities. On the other hand, it places them at risk to act impulsively in
pursuit of peer approval. This theory focuses primarily on cognitive factors
and the role of peers, with less attention to factors such as parenting.

A theory focused specifically on parents' role in emotion regulation
development is Morris' tripartite model [-@morrisRoleFamilyContext2007]. It
describes three pathways through which parents shape emotion regulation
development: Through observation and modeling, parenting practices, and the
emotional family climate, which in turn involves attachment and marital
relationship quality. Morris and colleagues also emphasize the relevance of
fathers and siblings, and others have adapted the tripartite model to describe
the role of peers in adolescents' emotion regulation development
[@reindlSocializationEmotionRegulation2016].

Aside from theories of emotional development, theories of the phenomenon of
emotion regulation are also somewhat relevant. One influential theory is Gross'
[-@grossHandbookEmotionRegulation2013] process model, which describes the
process of emotion regulation, from eliciting cue to ultimate response.
Individuals modulate the different stages of this process using strategies,
consciously or otherwise. The effectiveness, desireability, and consequences of
different strategies depend on the cultural context [see
@bariolaChildAdolescentEmotion2011]. Similar to Gross' theory, the social
information processing theory of emotion also describe the role of intrapsychic
processes and strategies in emotion experience and reulation
[@lemeriseIntegratedModelEmotion2000].

Another theory worth mentioning in this context is
@holodynskiDevelopmentEmotionsEmotion2006's internalization model of emotional
development. It applies Vygotsky's theory of development to the domain of
emotion, and presents a detailed integrated model of emotional experience and
regulation. Like Sroufe's work, this work describes a transition from
interpersonal to intrapersonal emotion regulation. Other important features of
this work include the interplay between emotion and communication, and the
internalization of the socio-cultural symbolic function of emotion throughout
development. <!--Theories like this are particularly relevant to a fine-grained
understanding of the process of emotion regulation, but their developmental
relevance has unfortunately not yet been considered (REF Buss). -->

<!--Parents are widely considered to be the primary proximal influence driving
emotion regulation development.

Yet several limitations remain.

The present study instead takes an inductive approach to map the correlates of
adolescents' emotion regulation based on all available literature. From this
mapping, we proceed to classify correlates as potential risk factors,
manifestations, and outcomes of adolescent emotion regulation. The results
provide a conceptual overview of the existing literature, can help identify
blind spots in existing theory, and might inspire new hypotheses to guide
future deductive research.

Several limitations emerge from prior efforts to provide an encompassing
framework of this literature

These efforts at unification have, thusfar, been conducted in a top-down,
theory-driven manner.

which motivates most youngsters to seek out challenges in life and love, but
renders some of them vulnerable to emotion dysregulation.  -->

## Shortcomings of the theory

Existing theoretical models have several limitations. One crucial shortcoming
is the lack of explicit attention to the life phase of adolescence. This is
unfortunate, as empirical research consistently indicates that adolescence is a
crucial life phase for emotion regulation development. Adolescence differs
qualitatively from infancy, childhood, and adulthood. It is therefore
insufficient to simply extrapolate theories focused on these ages. Other
theories do focus on adolescence specifically [e.g.,
@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012], but only address emotion regulation
in passing. A second, related, shortcoming is that some relevant theories lack
a developmental component <!--, and thus lack a well-substantiated
understanding of developmental processes--> [see
@bussTheoriesEmotionalDevelopment2019;
@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012]. A third shortcoming is that theories
vary widely in scope: Some are very broad and all-encompassing, but somewhat
non-specific, such as the biopsychosocial models of Bronfenbrenner and
Sameroff. Others describe a specific phenomenon in great detail, but are not
embedded in a larger unifying framework. Examples include Morris' tripartite
model, Crone and Dahl's model, and polyvagal theory. It would be beneficial to
bridge these two levels of theory. One limitation echoed across many
publications in this field is that more theory formation is required to provide
a unified framework that could guide future empirical work. The present study
seeks to aid such theory development, by providing an inductive conceptual
review of the field.

can give rise to concrete, testable predictions. "either is not guided by
hypotheses of an explicit theory or cites a theory but does not explicitly test
the theory." (Buss) (Smaldino)-->
<!--Unfortunately, there is little theory about which risk factors and
environmental hazards render adolescents susceptible to emotional
difficulties11-->

<!--Initially, much of the research on emotion regulation focused on either
adulthood or early childhood. In recent years, however, a substantial body of
research on emotion regulation in adolescence has accrued.-->

<!--What are the predictors of emotion regulation in adolescence?-->

<!--Emotion regulation can be defined as the ability to modulate emotional
experience and expression through automatic or deliberate processes. -->


<!--


## Why focus on theory?


A focus on theory is becoming increasingly important, given the concern about
the replicability of social scientific findings [@KLEIN].

Several authors of comprehensive reviews have noted that developmental theories
of emotion are still in their infancy [@bussTheoriesEmotionalDevelopment2019].
Several specific limitations of the theoretical landscapes precipitate the
present study. First, although there are many *relevant* theories, few are
focused specifically on emotion regulation. Second, the phase of adolescence is
rarely addressed, although empirical research has indicated that this is a
crucial period of emotion regulation development.
"emotion theory has largely focused on adults, and emotional development theory
has largely focused on infancy and early childhood (see Chap. 24 on adolescent
emotional development)." Buss et al 2019:20

## Why inductive -->

## Bottom-up insights from narrative reviews

While theory provides a top-down understanding of an area of research,
literature reviews can provide a bottom-up, inductive understanding. Given the
noted absence of a single overarching theory, reviews might provide additional
insight into factors considered relevant in the etiology of adolescents'
emotion regulation competencies. For example, a review by
@bariolaChildAdolescentEmotion2011 addresses individual psychological factors
such as temperament, and biological factors like neurocognitive development and
genetic predispositions. Furthermore, they address proximal social influences,
including parents, teachers, and peers, and specific mechanisms through which
these individuals exert their influence, including parenting and modeling.
Finally, they address distal factors, including the role of culture and the
media. Barriola and colleagues also offer recommendations for future research,
<!--most notably, they call for a robust theoretical framework to guide future
research.--> calling for research on the role of parents beyond early
childhood, and including the role of fathers - a limitation which has since
been addressed by a new wave of empirical research on fathers' role in
emotional development [@vanlissaRoleFathersMothers2019;
@vanlissaMothersFathersQuantitative2020].

Another review, by @coe-odessEmergentEmotionsAdolescence2019, offers a nuanced
discussion of several issues that complement prior publications in this field.
For instance, the authors cover the implications of physiological changes in
detail, including neurocognitive development and pubertal maturation. As
adolescents become increasingly individuated, conflict with parents peaks. This
conflict, in turn, impacts emotion regulation, both in terms of day-to-day mood
variability and dispositional emotion dysregulation [see also
@vanlissaCostEmpathyParentadolescent2017]. As parental importance diminishes,
adolescents become increasingly oriented towards peers. This includes increased
sensitivity to social status and norms, along with the associated increase in
peer pressure and risk taking. Pubertal development also initiates the
emergence of sexual and romantic behavior, and the intensification of both
biological sex differences and gender stereotyped behavior. With regard to the
process of emotion regulation, Coe-Odess and colleagues discuss the importance
of strategies, and point out that, in addition to negative emotionality,
positive emotionality also peaks in adolescence. Relatedly, the authors
describe how hormonal changes precipitate an increased stress response, which
might help explain adolescents' greater susceptibility to emotion
dysregulation. Finally, going beyond the implications of cognitive development
discussed in other publications, the authors discuss how an greater capacity
for abstract thought relates to identity formation - a key challenge in
adolescence [@meeusStudyAdolescentIdentity2011] - and to increased emotional
understanding, and by extension, empathy [see also
@vanlissaLongitudinalInterplayAffective2014].

There are notable parallels between the relevant factors highlighted by these
narrative reviews, and the aforementioned theoretical literature. Nevertheless,
these literature reviews also touch upon issues that have received little
attention in theoretical work. This highlights the value of both top-down and
bottom-up approaches to understanding the phenomenon of adolescents' emotion
regulation. One remaining limitation is that, to date, all reviews in this
field have been unstructured narrative reviews. The present publication seeks
to further complement preceding work by conducting a comprehensive empirical
literature review, and mapping the factors associated with adolescent emotion
regulation.

Influences on emotion regulation (Riediger Klipker)

Despite widespread interest in emotion regulation in adolescence, there is a lack of explicit theories about which risk factors and environmental hazards render adolescents susceptible to emotional difficulties. Some theories can be considered relevant, but these theories are rarely explicit enough to generate specific predictions. 
As many as one in five adolescents experiences severe emotional problems. A key question is therefore which factors render adolescents at-risk for difficulties in emotion regulation. 

Unfortunately, relevant theory on adolescent emotion regulation development is limited27–29.

My work addresses this lacuna by taking an inductive approach to theory formation; paying special attention to between-person differences. This paves the way for a new wave of person-centered research


Key questions:

Why focus on emotion regulation specifically, instead of other aspects of emotional development?

* Biological determinants
* Social determinants

* Existing developmental theories do not focus on adolescence (rather, on adults, or development in infancy and childhood). However, many interesting emotion-related things happen in adolescence.

## The present paper

The present paper aims to develop a nomological network of the constructs
related to adolescent emotion dysregulation, based on a systematic review of
the literature. A nomological network is a diagrammatic representation of a
phenomenon; a proto-theoretical device that describes relationships between
constructs relevant to the theory [see @alaviAligningTheoryMethodology2018]. It is a precursor to a more
explicit theory of the phenomenon. The present paper uses an inductive approach
to develop this nomological network. First, we conduct a systematic search to
elicit a corpus of relevant literature. Second, we use text mining techniques
to extract relevant constructs from the corpus. Third, we use a dictionary to
pare down the extracted constructs to meaningful superordinate categories.
Fourth, we map interrelations between these constructs. Fifth, we classify
contstructs as potential predictors or outcomes, and we categorize predictors
by level of analysis<!-- (CJ: Sameroff, which level of biopsychosocial)-->.

# Methods

## Search strategy

All searches were conducted on Web of Science. The search strategy was based on
procedures described by Staaks [@staaksSystematicReviewSearch]. First, we
manually constructed a reference set of 15 articles. Then we constructed a
search string to retrieve these articles from Web of Science. The search was
overly inclusive, returning 29 records. As these were all highly relevant, we
updated the reference set to include all 29 results. Next, we tested our search
string, which consisted of synonyms of emotion regulation and adolescence: <!--
### Reference set Our reference set is documented in `reference_set.bib`. -->
```
TS=("emotio* regulation" OR "anger regulation" OR "sadness regulation" OR
"emotion* competence" OR "emotion* adjustment" OR "emotio* dysregulation" OR
"anger dysregulation" OR "sadness dysregulation" OR "emotio* problem*" OR
"emotion* maladjustment") AND TS=(adolescent* OR teen* OR pubert* OR youth)
```
This string returned 6653 results, and matched 25 of the 29 records in the
reference set. Three search terms could be added to match all 29 reference set
items. The terms `"emotio* socialization" OR "emotio* processes"`, as synonyms
of emotion regulation, added 191 new hits. However, many of these hits were not
directly relevant to emotion regulation. The term `"development*"`, as synonym
of adolescence, added 3628 new hits, many of which were not focused on the age
range of adolescence. We thus deemed these terms to be overly inclusive, and
proceeded with the original search string above.

}
rayyan_res <- read.csv("rayyan_exports/articles.csv")
rayyan_dups <- nrow(unique_recs) - nrow(rayyan_res)

```
Duplicates were identified based on exact DOI matches (`r dups[["dup_doi"]]` 
duplicates), and title similarity (`r dups[["dup_title"]]` duplicates). 
Manual screening in Rayyan resulted in the removal of an additional `r rayyan_dups` duplicates.

## Screening

```{r, message=FALSE}
screen <- read.csv("asreview_result_sysrevemotprob.csv")
screen <- screen[screen$key %in% rayyan_res$key, ]
screen$drop_these <- FALSE
screen$drop_these[which(screen$included == 1 | screen$rayyan == "False")] <- TRUE

if(!file.exists("recs_final.csv")){
  recs_final <- unique_recs[screen$key[!screen$drop_these], ]
  write.csv(recs_final, "recs_final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
} else {
  recs_final <- read.csv("recs_final.csv")
}
```
Papers were screened based on two main criteria:
First, papers had to address emotion regulation, emotional problems, or similar.
Second, the target population must overlap (at least in part) with adolescence, defined as the age range from 10-25.
Thus, for example, an article reviewing the role of hormonal changes in emotional adjustment throughout the entire life course, including adolescence, would be deemed relevant.
Screening was initially conducted in Rayyan QRCI [@Ouzzani2016].
Papers were sorted using Rayyan's ranking algorithm.
To train the algorithm on exclusion criteria, screening focused on abstracts most likely to be excluded.
After coding `r sum(screen$rayyan == "True")+sum(screen$rayyan == "False")` papers, screening continued in ASReview - a free, open source alternative to Rayyan QRCI [@van_de_schoot_rens_2020_3828293].
This program uses text mining and active learning to build a customizable machine learning model for article inclusion.
We used a naive Bayes model, and focused on exclusion of irrelevant papers.
In ASReview, an additional `r sum(table(screen$included, screen$rayyan)[, 1])` papers were screened.
Screening again focused on articles most likely to be excluded, and continued until, among the most recently screened 100 papers, only 6 were excluded.
The screening procedure is detailed in Figure \@ref(fig:prismachart).
In total, `r nrow(recs_final)` papers were retained for analysis.

# Analysis 1: Keyword mapping

```{r}
source("study1.R")
if(run_everything | !file.exists("Study1_lda_dims.txt")) source("LDA_analysis.R")
lda_dims <- read_yaml("Study1_lda_dims.txt")
```
The corpus for this first analysis consisted of the author-provided keywords for the selected articles.
We extracted keywords by document, and used a dictionary,
created specifically for this study,
to classify related terms.
The dictionary describes `r length(dict)` terms using `r length(unlist(dict))`
regular expression queries.
The lead author composed a first draft of the dictionary based on prior knowledge of the field.
This draft was subsequently updated in two ways:
First, while writing the introduction for this paper, key terms from the theoretical and empirical literature were added to the dictionary.
Second, by including commonly occurring uncategorized words during preliminary analyses of the data.
An exclusion list of methodological terms and other non-substantive words was generated using the same procedure.
After applying the dictionary and exclusion filter,
and removing records with no (remaining) keywords,
the resulting corpus consisted of `r number_docs_words["docs"]` documents with `r number_docs_words["words"]` unique words.
As term-document frequency is irrelevant in the context of keywords (i.e., keywords should not occur twice within the same document, except when two synonyms have been recoded using the dictionary),
the term-document matrix was dichotomized.

## Structural topic modeling

To assess the homogeneity of the corpus, we conducted topic modeling using latent dirichlet allocation [@bleiLatentDirichletAllocation2003].
For this analysis, we used the term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to select terms
not used frequently in the corpus,
which could therefore be more diagnostic of subgroup membership.
Selection terms with an TF-IDF greater than the median resulted in a corpus of `r lda_dims[1]` documents and `r lda_dims[2]` terms.
We considered a range from 2-20 topics, evaluating fit based on the BIC, and interpretability based on the entropy of the posterior document/topic probabilities.
The BICs followed a near-perfect linearly increasing trend, indicating that no subcorpora could be identified.
Congruently, all entropies were near-zero, which means that the posterior document/topic probabilities were effectively uniformly distributed.
Thus, no interpretable subcorpora could be identified,
and we proceed with an analysis of the whole sample. <!-- Probably because each set of keywords has only a few indicators. -->

## Mapping the literature

Next, we mapped the cooccurrence of terms within documents as an undirected graph.
When examining cooccurrence,
it is pertinent to select the most common terms, instead of using TF-IDF.
We retained terms present in at least $0.5%$ of the entire corpus,
resulting in a selection of `r dim(dtm_top)[1]` documents and `r dim(dtm_top)[2]` terms.
The marginal occurrence of the selected terms is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:study1wordcloud).
This indicates how frequently each term occurred in the corpus, and illustrates what this body of literature is about.

```{r study1wordcloud, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Wordcloud of terms selected for Study 1 co-occurrence analysis. More common words are centered and printed in larger font."}
knitr::include_graphics("study1_wordcloud.svg")
```

Based on our theoretical review, each of the selected terms was coded as being either a putative 'Cause', 'Outcome', 'Protective factor', or 'Indicator' (a closely related construct) of emotion dysregulation.
We stress that this is a simplification; many of these associations are likely to be bidirectional [e.g., emotion dysregulation is known to be both cause and consequence of conflict with parents, @vanlissaCostEmpathyParentadolescent2017]. Figure \@ref(fig:study1network) displays the term cooccurrence matrix as a force directed graph.
<!--The classification is presented in Table \@ref(tab:study1table1).

r study1table1, results = "asis"}
df <- tapply(pretty_words(categ$name), categ$category, function(i){paste(strwrap(paste(i, collapse = ", "), width = 90), collapse = "\\\\")})
df <- data.frame(Category = names(df), Terms = df, row.names = NULL)
apa_table(df, escape = F)
-->

```{r study1network, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Force directed graph for Study 1 co-occurrence analysis. Vertex size represents term frequency; dashed lines for co-occurrences not involving dysregulation. Two different layouts are presented to aid interpretation."}
#knitr::include_graphics("study1_network1.svg")
library(cowplot)
fig_svg <- cowplot::ggdraw()+cowplot::draw_image("study1_network1.svg")
plot(fig_svg)
```

## Results

```{r}
notingraph <- names(topterms)[!names(topterms) %in% unique(c(edg$term1, edg$term2))]
notingraph <- categ[categ$name %in% notingraph, ]
notingraph <- tapply(tolower(pretty_words(notingraph$name)), notingraph$category, function(i){paste0(paste(paste0("*", i[-length(i)], "*"), collapse = ", "), ", and ", i[length(i)])})
```

Inspecting the co-occurrence graph for the keyword data,
it is evident that there are relatively few interconnections between elements,
with a matrix sparsity 
it becomes evident that emotion dysregulation is the most common and central construct,
as could be expected based on the search terms.
Most of the other constructs in the corpus are directly linked to emotion dysregulation,
which suggests that our search was successful in identifying factors considered to be relevant
for adolescents' emotion dysregulation.
The fact that only few of the constructs were interrelated substantiates our impression that this literature is somewhat fragmented.
One emergent cluster of interrelated constructs pertains to the mental health-related outcomes of emotion dysregulation, most notably anxiety, depression, and externalizing symptoms.  

A more surprising finding is that some of the most prevalent terms were not connected to emotion dysregulation -
for example, *Rumination*, only showed a direct link with *Depression*.
Other prevalent terms are entirely absent from Figure \@ref(fig:study1network), as they were not related
to any other terms in the main network. 
These terms, which are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:study1wordcloud), include the potential causes `r notingraph["Cause"]`, the potential outcomes `r notingraph["Outcome"]`, and the potential protective factors `r notingraph["Protective"]`. 


## Discussion

Several of these constructs represent active ongoing areas of research - such as the role of fathers in adolescents' emotional development [@vanlissaRoleFathersMothers2019], *identity* [@campbellFriendsEducationIdentity2019], *friendship* and *social support* [@bukowskiPopularityFriendshipEmotional1993], *autonomy* [@vrolijkLongitudinalLinkagesFatherunderreview; @brenningPerceivedMaternalAutonomy2015], *sexual risk* [@brownDepressiveSymptomsPredictor2006], and *Loneliness* [@spithovenItAllTheir2017].
The absence of these terms from the graph thus does not reflect so much a lack of importance.
Rather, these constructs - being important, but not yet well-integrated in the literature,
are prime candidates for future research;
particularly in conjunction with more well-established constructs.

# Analysis 2: Abstract text mining

This second analysis focused on the abstracts of our corpus. Keywords are
carefully chosen to capture the core tenets of a study. However, as authors are
typically limited to 5 keywords, some of a study's nuance may be lost.
Abstracts offer greater freedom of expression, which is a challenge when it
comes to extracting relevant information. We took a two-pronged approach to
extract relevant topic terms from the abstracts. First, we used the natural
language processing technique part-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging) to identify
nouns in the abstract. Using nouns only in text mining can lead to more
interpretable models [@martinMoreEfficientTopic2015]. Secondly, we used
stemming to reduce these nouns to their root form. Finally, we applied a
dictionary approach as before.

# Discussion

<!--it is worth noting that many different theories of *emotion* exist, and yet there is relatively little attention for the subtleties of 
distinct from theories of emotional development, and that there is no one-to-one relationship between theories of emotion (regulation) development and theories of emotion. This issue is beyond the scope of the present study -->
