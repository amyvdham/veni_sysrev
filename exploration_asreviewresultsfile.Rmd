Check what the file asreview_result_sysrevemotprob.csv contains. 

```{r}
library(data.table, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# load .csv file into object 
asreview_results <- read.csv("asreview_result_sysrevemotprob.csv")

# convert object into data table
asreview_results <- as.data.table(asreview_results)
unique(asreview_results$included)
summary(as.factor(asreview_results$included))
asreview_results[, c('included', 'asreview_ranking', 'record_id')]
max(asreview_results$asreview_ranking)

# check to recs file that is used in analysis to compare
recs <- read.csv("recs_final.csv")

# convert object into data table
recs <- as.data.table(recs)

# try to merge the datasets 
total <- merge(asreview_results, recs, by="doi")
total$included
summary(as.factor(total$included))

# -> if I merge the two datasets all the documents that were coded with a 1 (i.e. relevant/included) in the column included are dropped as well as so articles that had the value NA on the variable included? 
```
