  abstract = {When a theoretical framework (and its components) is not clearly linked to research methods, researchers risk designing flawed studies, wherein the stated research question is inconsistent with the research design. Explicitly identifying one’s theoretical orientation can provide an orderly schematic for linking observations from separate investigations (i.e. qualitative, quantitative) thereby facilitating understandings and guiding research designs particularly in fields of social and health sciences where complex phenomena are an aspect of the subject of inquiry. Although this has been established, how researchers might position their research theoretically to guide mixed methods research is less clear. In this paper, we propose the Before Design Theoretical Placement as a general guide for specifying and locating studies in a broader theoretical grounding, and discuss how it may inform overall study considerations. We then use this approach to illustrate how theories and methods can work together to facilitate professional knowledge development from a relational perspective.},

The author provides a brief history of the storm-and-stress view and examines 3 key aspects of this view: conflict with parents, mood disruptions, and risk behavior. In all 3 areas, evidence supports a modified storm-and-stress view that takes into account individual differences and cultural variations. Not all adolescents experience storm and stress, but storm and stress is more likely during adolescence than at other ages. Adolescent storm and stress tends to be lower in traditional cultures than in the West but may increase as globalization increases individualism. Similar issues apply to minority cultures in American society. Finally, although the general public is sometimes portrayed by scholars as having a stereotypical view of adolescent storm and stress, both scholars and the general public appear to support a modified storm-and-stress view.

  abstract = {This paper reviews current literature relating to parent and child emotional functioning, specifically their emotion regulatory skills and emotional expression. Included are considerations regarding theoretical, methodological, and sampling strengths and weaknesses of existing literature. On the basis of the review, several directions for future research are proposed. First, it is argued that consistency in the measurement of emotion regulation is necessary, including assessment of more refined theoretical conceptualizations of regulatory types, skills, or strategies. Second, it is argued that emotion regulation developmental research examining the post-early childhood period is necessary in order to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of youths’ emotion regulation. Finally, it is argued that greater examination of paternal influences on child emotional functioning, in addition to maternal influences, is required. Consideration of these issues in future emotion regulation research will ideally contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in child and adolescent development of optimal regulatory capacities.},

  abstract = {The emotion regulation (ER)-specificity hypothesis assumes that a specific psychological problem is characterized by a specific maladaptive ER strategy. This hypothesis will be investigated for six child-DSM symptom clusters (Study 1) and for depressive symptoms (Study 2). We also investigated whether certain emotion regulation strategies can be detected through different forms of symptom clusters. Study 1 includes 432 school aged non-referred youngsters (60 \% girls; age range between 8 and 18 years) and Study 2 includes 128 school aged non-referred youngsters (55 \% girls; age range between 10 and 14 years). A self-report questionnaire, FEEL-KJ investigates a wide range of adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies. DSM symptom clusters (affective, anxiety, somatic, conduct, oppositional and ADHD problems) were measured by parent report on the Child Behaviour Checklist; depressive symptoms were measured with the Child Depression Inventory. Youngsters with emotional problems have specifically less adaptive ER strategies. The relation with maladaptive ER strategies can only be detected with self-reported depressive symptoms. ER strategies problem-oriented action and acceptance are transdiagnostically related to both internalizing and externalizing problems. For affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems the ER-specificity hypothesis is confirmed. Investigating ER strategies could be of clinical relevance specifically in children with affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems. Next, training deficits in the ER strategies Problem-oriented action and Acceptance can be considered as important in the treatment of all children with emotional problems.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become more and more an open multi-lingual task instead of being held back by language, country and legal boundaries. With the advent of commonly used open data regarding natural language processing tasks as available at http://universaldependencies.org one can now relatively easily compare different toolkits which perform natural language processing. In this post we compare the udpipe R package to the spacyr R package. UDPipe - spaCy comparison A traditional natural language processing flow consists of a number of building blocks which can be used to structure your Natural Language Application on top of it. Namely 1. tokenisation2. parts of speech tagging3. lemmatisation4. morphological feature tagging5. syntactic dependency parsing6. entity recognition7. extracting word \& sentence meaning Both of these R packages allow to do this where  spacyr is an R package around the popular spaCy NLP toolkit: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy  udpipe is an R package around the less known UDPipe NLP toolkit: https://github.com/ufal/udpipe   Comparison In the comparison, we will provide general feedback on the following elements  Languages which are covered by the tools Ease of use Annotation possibilities Annotation accuracy of the models Annotation speed~~~   Annotation languages   udpipe provides annotation models for more than 50 languages (afrikaans, ancient\_greek-proiel, ancient\_greek, arabic, basque, belarusian, bulgarian, catalan, chinese, coptic, croatian, czech-cac, czech-cltt, czech, danish, dutch-lassysmall, dutch, english-lines, english-partut, english, estonian, finnish-ftb, finnish, french-partut, french-sequoia, french, galician-treegal, galician, german, gothic, greek, hebrew, hindi, hungarian, indonesian, irish, italian, japanese, kazakh, korean, latin-ittb, latin-proiel, latin, latvian, lithuanian, norwegian-bokmaal, norwegian-nynorsk, old\_church\_slavonic, persian, polish, portuguese-br, portuguese, romanian, russian-syntagrus, russian, sanskrit, serbian, slovak, slovenian-sst, slovenian, spanish-ancora, spanish, swedish-lines, swedish, tamil, turkish, ukrainian, urdu, uyghur, vietnamese) of which 17 languages are released under a commercially more liberal license, the others are released under the CC-BY-SA-NC licence  With the udpipe R package, you can furthermore directly train models on top of the newest CONLLU files available at http://universaldependencies.org (examples of this is provided at https://github.com/bnosac/udpipe.models.ud)    spaCy provides currently models for 8 languages: English/German/Spanish/Portugues/French/Italian/Dutch. For English and German these were trained on data which is not available on http://universaldependencies.org, for the other models they were trained on data from http://universaldependencies.org  In order to train your own models you need to do this directly in Python, the Python community is building these since the end of 2017.    Ease of use  Both packages are on CRAN  Models can be easily downloaded with both packages. For udpipe this is directly from R, for spacy this needs to be done in Python.  udpipe has no external dependencies and can easily be installed with install.packages('udpipe') and next you are ready to go  installation of spacyr will probably give you some trouble namely it requires installation of the Python package spacy which is more difficult to install on a local computer in your corporate office. You can easily get stuck in problems of Python versioning, 32 vs 64 bit architecture issues, admin rights or basic shell commands that you should be aware of does not allow to switch seamlessly between 2 languages (you need to initialize and finalize) which is a burden if you live in a multi-language country like e.g. Belgium spaCy models are constructed on different treebanks each following different guidelines which make cross-language downstream analysis more difficult to harmonise    Annotation accuracy of the models As the spaCy and UDPipe models for Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Dutch have been built on data from the same Universal Dependencies treebank (version 2.0) one can compare the accuracies of the different NLP processing steps (tokenisation, POS tagging, morphological feature tagging, lemmatisation, dependency parsing).Evaluation is traditionally done by leaving out some sentences from the training part and seeing how good the model did on these hold-out sentences which were tagged by humans that's why they are called 'gold'.Below you can find accuracy statistics for the different NLP tasks by using the conllu 2017 shared task evaluation script on the holdout test sets. These graphs basically show that   UDPipe provides better results for French, Italian \& Portuguese, equal results for Spanish and less good results for dependency parsing and treebank-specific tags for Dutch but better results for the universal parts of speech tags. For English, only the Penn Treebank XPOS tag can be compared and spaCy shows less good results than what we expected when comparing to the UDPipe model    Exact reproducible details on the evaluation can be found at https://github.com/jwijffels/udpipe-spacy-comparison. Feel free to provide comments there. Annotation possibilities  udpipe  allows to do tokenisation, parts of speech tagging, morphological feature tagging and dependency parsing udpipe does not provide entity recognition and does not provide word vectors (you can use existing R packages for that (e.g text2vec)   spacyr  spaCy allows to do tokenisation, parts of speech tagging, morphological feature tagging and dependency parsing On top of that it also does entity recognition spacyr does not provide lemmatisation spaCy also provides wordvectors (for English only) but they are not made available in spacyr  So if you need entity recognition, udpipe is not an option. If you need lemmatisation, spacyr is not an option.   Annotation speed   spacyr is in our experiments 5 times faster than udpipe for a comparable full annotation pipeline (Tokenisation, POS tagging, Lemmatisation, Feature tagging, Dependency Parsing) and comparable output (see code below)  library(udpipe)library(spacyr)library(microbenchmark)data(brussels\_reviews, package = "udpipe")f\_udpipe},

  abstract = {Dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important predictor of psychopathology. Although many clinical programs focus on emotion regulation skills, the successful application of these programs in children and adolescents requires knowledge on the normative use of emotion regulation strategies over age. To this end, the current cross-sectional study examined changes in emotion regulation throughout childhood and adolescence. The use of seven adaptive and five maladaptive emotion regulation strategies was measured with the FEEL-KJ in a representative sample (N = 1397) of Dutch children and adolescents between 8 and 18 years old. Overall, the results indicated reduced use of adaptive strategies and increased use of maladaptive strategies in participants between 12 and 15 years old compared with younger or older participants. The findings of the current study indicate that adolescence is characterized by a maladaptive shift in emotion regulation. Given that the continued use of dysfunctional emotion regulation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, these results highlight the importance of prevention and treatment programs focused on emotion regulation to shield vulnerable adolescents against mental illness.},

Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects. 3 hypotheses were tested: (1) only the reactive-aggressive children would demonstrate hostile biases in their attributions of peers' intentions in provocation situations (because such biases are known to lead to reactive anger); (2) only proactive-aggressive children would evaluate aggression and its consequences in relatively positive ways (because proactive aggression is motivated by its expected external outcomes); and (3) proactive-aggressive children would select instrumental social goals rather than relational goals more often than nonaggressive children. All 3 hypotheses were at least partially supported.},

  abstract = {Relative to children and adults, adolescents are highly focused on being evaluated by peers. This increased attention to peer evaluation has implications for emotion regulation in adolescence, but little is known about the characteristics of the evaluatee and evaluator that influence emotional reactions to evaluative outcomes. The present study used a computer-based social evaluation task to examine predictors of adolescents’ emotional responses to feedback from unknown peers. Nine-to-seventeen-year-olds (N = 36) completed the “chatroom task” and indicated the degree to which each peer would be interested in interacting with them and how good they felt after receiving acceptance and rejection feedback from peers. We examined whether adolescents’ age and gender impacted their emotional responses to being accepted or rejected by peers of different age groups (i.e., early or middle adolescence) and genders. We also tested whether expectations about peers’ interest was associated with variability in adolescents’ emotional responses to the evaluative outcome. Upon being accepted by middle adolescent male peers, females in the middle relative to early years of adolescence reported greater well-being, whereas males reported similar levels of well-being regardless of their own age. Following acceptance from middle adolescent female peers, females reported greater well-being than males. Adolescents with high expectations for being liked by peers felt better after being accepted versus rejected relative to those with low expectations. For adolescents with low expectations, acceptance and rejection were associated with similar levels of well-being. Adolescents’ emotional responses to peer evaluation are influenced by specific individual characteristics and antecedent preparation for evaluation that may serve an emotion regulatory purpose.},

  abstract = {I suggest that the recent, highly visible, and often heated debate over failures to replicate results in the social sciences reveals more than the need for greater attention to the pragmatics and value of empirical falsification. It is also a symptom of a serious issue—the under-developed state of theory in many areas of psychology. While I focus on the phenomenon of “social priming”—since it figures centrally in current debate—it is not the only area of psychological inquiry to which my critique applies. I first discuss some of the key issues in the “social priming” debate and then attempt to show that many of the problems thus far identified are traceable to a lack of specificity of theory. Finally, I hint at the possibility that adherence to the materialist tenets of modern psychological theory may have a limiting effect on our full appreciation of the phenomena under scrutiny.},

  abstract = {Emotionality and emotion regulation are presumed to interact to produce social behavior. Prior empirical evidence for this interaction has been weak. Researchers have tended to take a variable-centered approach to predicting social behavior and this may have obscured the relations between negative emotionality, emotion regulation, and social behavior. Therefore, a person-centered approach was used to examine the links among these variables. Two-hundred and three adolescents (M age=13.3years) completed measures of negative emotionality, emotion regulation, and socioemotional behavior. Cluster analysis suggested four profiles of adolescents: those moderate on regulation and negative emotionality, those low in both, those high in negative emotionality and low in regulation, those low in negative emotionality and high in regulation. LDF analysis suggested that these profiles of adolescents differed along two dimensions on socioemotional behavior.},

Mental illnesses that emerge before adulthood impose a 10-fold higher cost than those that emerge later in life (3). Mental health costs are the highest single source of global economic burden in the world (4).

  abstract = {The vagus, the 10th cranial nerve, contains pathways that contribute to the regulation of the internal viscera, including the heart. Vagal efferent fibers do not originate in a common brainstem structure. The Polyvagal Theory is introduced to explain the different functions of the two primary medullary source nuclei of the vagus: the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DMNX). Although vagal pathways from both nuclei terminate on the sinoatrial node, it is argued that the fibers originating in NA are uniquely responsible for respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Divergent shifts in RSA and heart rate are explained by independent actions of DMNX and NA. The theory emphasizes a phylogenetic perspective and speculates that mammalian, but not reptilian, brainstem organization is characterized by a ventral vagal complex (including NA) related to processes associated with attention, motion, emotion, and communication. Various clinical disorders, such as sudden infant death syndrome and asthma, may be related to the competition between DMNX and NA.},

This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.},

  abstract = {This study examined associations between parents' emotion coaching and emotional expressiveness, and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The sample included 131 16-year-olds and their mothers and fathers. Adolescents completed an open-ended interview about their parents' emotion coaching. Adolescents rated parents' negative emotional expressiveness, and parents and adolescents reported on adolescents' adjustment. Results indicated that mothers were more accepting and supportive of their children's expression of negative emotions than were fathers. Parents' coaching of emotions was associated with fewer adolescents' internalizing symptoms and was unrelated to their externalizing symptoms. Parents' negative emotional expressiveness was positively linked to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parents' emotion coaching and negative emotional expressiveness explained unique variance in adolescents' internalizing symptoms. Results highlight the importance of the family's emotional climate for adolescents' well-being.},
