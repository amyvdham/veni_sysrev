AB Objective. This investigation explored the associations of parenting (Study I) and aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship (Study 2) with adolescent emotion regulation (ER) difficulties, and the potential moderating role of adolescent gender in these associations. Method. Adolescents reported on their mothers' parenting, on negative interactions, and support in their relationship to their mothers, and on ER difficulties. Results. Results show that maternal control (especially psychological control) and the quality of the mother-adolescent relationship is significantly associated with adolescent ER difficulties in expected directions. Links between behavioral control, support and negative interaction, and adolescent ER difficulties were generally stronger for females than for males. Conclusion. It may be concluded that aspects of parenting and the adolescent-mother relationship are salient in the adolescent's experience of emotion regulation difficulties. Studies on ER in social context should account for potential gender effects.

AB The high prevalence of internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression) in children calls for the development and implementation of effective prevention programs. The issue of prevention recruitment is important for implementation as well as outcome research. This study compared two different recruitment strategies for an indicated cognitive-behavioral group program aimed at children aged 8-12 years with moderate anxious-depressed symptoms. The first recruitment strategy utilized extensive advertising in the local media, while the second strategy applied a school-based recruitment approach. Children with elevated symptom levels were offered the cost-free prevention program. While the first approach generated a satisfactory number of participants, the results for the latter were disappointing. Both samples were investigated according to enrollment rates, quality of life, psychopathology, and sociodemographic variables. The need for evidence-based recruitment strategies is emphasized.

AB Objective: Time-trend studies are required to learn about children's mental health status in changing societies. Some international studies have already analyzed secular trends over periods of 10 to 25 years, but the results are inconsistent. Our study aims to detect German time trends of psychopathology in children aged 8-11, from the first large Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-based study in Marburg/Germany 1987 until the present day (2008). Method: Parents filled in the CBCL to report psychopathological symptoms in heir children. The school-based samples from the years 1987 and 2008 were matched for sex, age, and socioeconomic status. The matched samples each consists of 212 girls and boys (girls: 50.5%, boys: 49.5%). MANCOVAs and ANCOVAs were used to test differences in mean CBCL scale scores. Results: Somatic symptoms showed a significant increase from 1987 to 2008. Similar trends were found for other internalizing symptoms, but did not reach significance. Externalizing symptoms showed no significant increase. Boys showed more aggressive or delinquent behavior and attention problems than girls. The children with the lowest socioeconomic status showed the highest symptom levels in both assessment years. Conclusions: The increase in somatic problems might be an effect of changes in expected school performance and economic aspects. The overall high rate of psychopathology in children highlights the necessity of effective prevention and intervention programs, particularly regarding families with lower socioeconomic status.

TI Low-Moderate Prenatal Alcohol Exposure and Risk to Child Behavioral
   Development: A Prospective Cohort Study EDITORIAL COMMENT
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB The detrimental effects of fetal exposure to extreme levels of alcohol during pregnancy, such as the subsequent occurrence of childhood physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits, are well known. Some investigators have suggested that there is a dose-response effect, with light drinking during pregnancy primarily affecting behavioral and adaptive functions and heavy drinking causing more serious developmental defects and problems. Accordingly, mild to moderate social drinking during pregnancy could be associated with long-term infant morbidity. The relatively few studies examining the long-term risk of fetal exposure to light-moderate levels of alcohol have failed to reach consensus, possibly due to deficiencies in study design.
   This prospective longitudinal cohort study investigated the effect of different levels of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy on child and adolescent behavioral development. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study enrolled 2900 pregnancies between 1989 and 1991, with a 14-year follow-up. Maternal self-reported data for 5 levels of weekly alcohol intake were obtained at 18 and 34 weeks' gestation: no drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week). A linear regression model was used to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure could produce changes in Child Behavior Checklist scores over 14 years that reflected clinically meaningful differences in child behavioral development, after adjustment for maternal and sociodemographic confounders. Detailed clinical assessments of study children were conducted at birth, with follow-up conducted at 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years.
   The adjusted data showed that light and moderate drinking during the first 3 months of pregnancy resulted in Child Behavior Checklist z-scores indicative of positive behavior over 14 years. The z-scores reflected a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalizing, and externalizing behavioral problems across the 14 years of follow-up.
   These findings suggest that low-moderate alcohol intake early in pregnancy is not associated with poor behavioral outcomes in offspring.

AB The trajectories of internalizing and interpersonal behaviors from kindergarten through fifth grade were studied using univariate and bivariate latent curve models. Internalizing behaviors demonstrated a small, yet statistically significant, linear increase over time, while interpersonal behaviors showed a small, yet statistically significant, linear decrease. There were individual differences in trajectories, and predictor variables accounted for some of this variation. In kindergarten, girls had more interpersonal behaviors than did boys. Children from higher SES families or with higher initial levels of externalizing behaviors had more internalizing behaviors and fewer interpersonal skills. One key finding from this study was that interpersonal and internalizing trajectories demonstrated a strong association. Increasing internalizing slopes were associated with decreasing interpersonal slopes. Establishing this empirical relation is necessary for understanding the developmental trajectory of these related behaviors, as well as important individual differences over time.

AB This study examined the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System Teacher Rating System for Children and Adolescents (BESS TRS-CA; Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007) screener using Rasch Rating Scale model (RSM) methodology to provide additional information about psychometric properties of items. Data from the Behavioral Assessment System for Children Teacher Rating Scale for Children (BASC TRS-C) norm sample (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) was used. Using RSM, we investigated the structure of the screener, the teachers' levels of endorsement of behaviors, and the performance of the rating scale to measure the latent construct of "maladaptive behavior." The results showed that the majority of items were within acceptable bounds for fit, illustrating appropriate model-data fit. The 4-point rating scale worked well for ratings, allowing for differentiation of children's behavior. Screener items showed varying levels of endorsement, with items measuring internalizing behaviors posing the most difficulty for teachers. The manuscript provides an illustration of how RSM may be used to provide additional psychometric information. Implications for using Rasch methods for scale development and evaluation are discussed.

AB Individuals with a history of depression experience more stress that is dependent in part on their own actions. However, it is unclear whether stress generation is a unique feature of depression, or a universal process that is also present in other types of psychopathology, such as anxiety disorders. The current study addressed this issue by comparing adolescents with a history of "pure" (i.e., non-comorbid) depressive disorders, pure anxiety disorders, comorbid depression and anxiety, and no disorder, on their levels of dependent and independent stress. Results indicated that adolescents with pure depression experienced more dependent stress than adolescents with pure anxiety, and adolescents with any internalizing diagnosis experienced more dependent stress than controls. Further, adolescents with comorbid depression and anxiety reported the highest levels of stress generation. The results suggest that while stress generation may be more strongly associated with depression than anxiety in adolescence, it is not unique to depression.

AB Two different hypotheses regarding the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD are described in the literature. First, it has been suggested that emotion regulation difficulties are part of the complex sequelae of early-onset chronic interpersonal trauma and less common following late-onset or single-event traumas. Second, PTSD in general has been suggested to be related to emotion regulation difficulties. Bringing these two lines of research together, the current study aimed to investigate the role of trauma type and PTSD symptom severity on emotion regulation difficulties in a large sample of trauma survivors (N=616). In line with the hypotheses, PTSD symptom severity was significantly associated with all variables assessing emotion regulation difficulties. In addition, survivors of early-onset chronic interpersonal trauma showed higher scores on these measures than survivors of single-event and/or late-onset traumas. However, when controlling for PTSD symptom severity, the group differences only remained significant for 2 out of 9 variables. The most robust findings were found for the variable "lack of clarity of emotions." Implications for future research, theoretical models of trauma-related disorders, and their treatment will be discussed.

AB This study explored the impact of disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) comorbidity on a number of theoretically relevant outcomes among 192 children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Youth were divided into three groups: OCD Only, OCD + DBD comorbidity and OCD + Other comorbidity. Relative to those without a comorbid condition and those with any non-DBD comorbidity, comorbid DBD was associated with greater family accommodation and less symptom resistance. Youth with comorbid DBD exhibited greater OCD symptom severity, OCD-related impairment, anxiety, and internalizing problems than those with no comorbidity. Those with comorbid DBD were over 3.6 times as likely to be taking an atypical antipsychotic medication relative to children without comorbidity. The present results suggest that comorbid DBD contributes to more severe illness presentation above and beyond an OCD diagnosis alone, and may be associated with differing pharmacotherapy prescribing practices.

   OUTCOMES
AB Background: Internalizing psychiatric disorders and early childhood adversity have both been associated with altered basal cortisol secretion. The aim of the present study is to investigate if early childhood adversity modifies the relationship between anxiety and mood disorders and cortisol secretion.
   Methods: A sample of 429 international adoptees was followed from childhood to adulthood. In childhood, adoptive parents provided information about abuse and neglect before adoption. As adults, adoptees completed a standardized psychiatric interview to assess internalizing disorders and collected saliva samples four times a day. Analyses of covariance were performed.
   Results: The relationship between anxiety disorders and cortisol secretion during 1 day, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC), was dependent on the experience of severe early maltreatment (p value of interaction = .03). In adoptees with an anxiety disorder, severe maltreatment was associated with lower daily cortisol secretion compared with nonmaltreated adoptees (respective AUC means: 28.19 and 36.96; difference = -8.78; confidence interval = -14.65 to -2.90; p = .004). In adoptees without an anxiety disorder, no difference in cortisol secretion was found between persons who did or did not experience severe maltreatment early in life (respective AUC means: 34.72 and 34.20; difference = .52; confidence interval = -1.92 to 2.96; p = .67). Wefound no modifying effect of severe early maltreatment on the relationship between mood disorders and daily cortisol secretion.
   Conclusions: The experience of early adversities modifies the relationship between anxiety disorders and basal cortisol seretion in adults. To understand the relationship between anxiety disorders and cortisol secretion, early maltreatment has to be taken into account.

   urinary incontinence; faecal incontinence; intellectual disability
ID CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; ENURESIS
AB OBJECTIVE
   To assess and identify the frequency and type of urinary incontinence (UI), as well as associated symptoms in persons with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, obesity and hypogonadism. The behavioural phenotype includes eating problems, temper outbursts, affective disorders, stereotypies and speech abnormalities. UI is common in children with mental retardation in general, but has not been reported systematically in children with PWS so far.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   The Dutch version of the 'Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence' was completed by 118 parents of children with PWS. This questionnaire includes items referring to day- and night-time wetting, toilet habits, observable voiding behaviours and reactions, urinary tract infections, stool habits and behavioural symptoms.
   RESULTS
   The rate of nocturnal enuresis in persons with PWS was 13.6% (16) at a mean age of 15.1 years. 3.8% (5) had additional daytime urinary incontinence, and 3.3% (4) had faecal incontinence. Lower urinary tract symptoms were commonly indicative of overactive bladder, dysfunctional voiding and postponement. Also, the rate of internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems was high.
   CONCLUSION
   Urinary incontinence is more common in persons with PWS than in typically developing children, adolescents and adults. As lower urinary tract symptoms are common, detailed assessment and specific treatment of UI should be part of the care of all persons with PWS.

AB Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of alleged early child maltreatment (before age 4) on the trajectory patterns of 3 different behavioral outcomes (anxiety/depression, aggression, and attention problems) through age 10.
   Methods: Two hundred forty-two children and their primary caregivers were assessed as part of a longitudinal study. One hundred fifty-four of these children had an early history of alleged maltreatment and 88 did not; these 2 groups were compared. Child behavioral outcomes were assessed at ages 4, 6, 8, and 10 using the Child Behavior Checklist. Growth modeling was used to assess the association between early alleged maltreatment and subsequent behavioral outcomes.
   Results: Early alleged maltreatment significantly predicted subsequent trajectories of two forms of behavioral problems: anxiety/depression and attention problems. In both cases, early alleged maltreatment was associated with significantly steeper increases in the behavioral problems over time. There was no significant effect on the trajectory of aggression.
   Conclusions: Although there were no differences between children with and without an allegation of maltreatment in early behavioral assessments, differences in anxiety/depression and attention problems emerged and grew more pronounced over time. Thus, alleged maltreatment is not simply associated with negative behavioral outcomes at particular points in time, but with a persistent pattern of behavioral dysfunction.
   Practice implications: Behavioral problems in response to maltreatment may emerge over time. Thus, children who are alleged to be maltreated would benefit from ongoing assessments, with quality behavioral health services available if they are needed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Progress and innovation in DSM-V include the proposal of a new structural organization of disorders that stands to bring childhood and adult disorders together. Specifically, many common disorders would be grouped under broader dimensions of internalizing and externalizing problems. Although this distinction originated in childhood psychopathology research, current work has drawn heavily from studies with adults. The integration of common childhood disorders into the current approach remains an important task. This article reviews evidence for a structural model of externalizing pathology with a focus on research with younger populations and highlights both commonalities and distinctions that exist between externalizing dimensions in children and the externalizing spectrum in adults. The article also summarizes 3 areas that pose key questions for delineating an externalizing spectrum that better reflects developmental concerns: the incorporation of childhood disorders, the integration of temperament and personality traits, and better accounting for relevant developmental issues, including person-environment interaction, critical developmental periods, and differentiating normal and abnormal behavior.

AB A burgeoning body of literature addresses the comorbidity of depression and OCD in adults. The purpose of this study was to extend this area of research to children and adolescents by examining the clinical correlates associated with co-occurring depressive disorders in a clinical sample of youth with OCD. Participants included children and adolescents seeking treatment at a university-based research clinic. One group was comprised of 28 children (ages 10-17 years) who met diagnostic criteria for OCD but had no comorbid depressive disorders, whereas the second group consisted of 28 children matched for age and gender who met diagnostic criteria for OCD and co-occurring depressive disorder. The two groups were compared on measures of broad-band psychopathology, internalizing problems, social difficulties, and family characteristics. As anticipated, findings revealed comorbid depression and OCD was associated with more severe internalizing problems, more extensive obsessive compulsive symptomatology, and more social problems. Youth with comorbid depression and OCD also had higher family conflict and lower family organization compared to those with OCD and no depression. These results may have implications for the treatment of youth with comorbid OCD and depression.

AB The present study aimed to assess the phenomenology and treatment sensitivity of insight, avoidance, indecisiveness, overvalued responsibility, pervasive slowness, and pathological doubting among youth with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using the ancillary items on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). These factors are believed to be relevant to the clinical presentation of youth with OCD but remain understudied. Eighty-nine youth with OCD were administered the CY-BOCS, including six subsidiary items aimed at the constructs of interest in this research. Participants also completed measures of OCD symptom clusters, depressive and anxious symptoms, externalizing/internalizing behavioral problems, and functional impairment. Associations between OCD symptom clusters and insight, avoidance, indecisiveness, overvalued responsibility, pervasive slowness, and pathological doubting are presented. Low insight, significant avoidance, indecisiveness, pervasive slowness and excessive sense of responsibility were all related to elevations in functional impairment. Clinical improvement in OCD severity was related to reductions in avoidance, doubting, and sense of responsibility. The six ancillary items of the CY-BOCS appear to be a practical and valid assessment of several constructs that are prognostically linked to cognitive-behavioral therapy outcomes in youth with OCD. Implications for clinicians are discussed.

AB The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine whether children of chronically ill parents differ from norm groups in problem behavior. We report moderator effects and overall effect sizes for internalizing, externalizing and total problem behavior assessed by children and parents. In fixed effect models, we found a significant overall effect size for internalizing problem behavior (number of studies k = 19, total sample size N = 1,858, Cohen's d = .23, p < .01) and externalizing problem behavior (k = 13, N = 1,525, d = .09, p < .01) but not for total problem behavior (k = 7; N = 896). Effects for internalizing and externalizing problem behavior were larger in non-cancer studies, in samples including younger children and younger ill parents, in samples defined by low average SES and in studies including parents with longer illness duration. In addition, effects for externalizing problem behavior were larger in studies characterized by a higher percentage of ill mothers and single parents. With exclusive self-report, effect sizes were significant for all problem behaviors. Based on these results, a family-centered approach in health care is recommended.

AB Research on internalized homophobia (IH) has linked it to both mental and physical health outcomes. Extant research indicates that IH and mental health are related in a variety of different subgroups of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) persons. However, much of this research has suffered from methodological issues. Studies have frequently substituted distress-related constructs (e.g., self-esteem and general well-being) for measures of internalizing mental health problems. Furthermore, many studies have misapplied measures of IH designed for gay men with lesbian samples. The current study used Hierarchical Linear Modeling to perform meta-analysis. Effect sizes were combined across multiple studies that used dimensional measures of internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety). The use of multilevel modeling techniques allowed for the evaluation of moderating effects on these relationships, including those of gender, year of data collection, mean age of the sample, publication type, and type of symptomatology measured. Thirty-one studies were meta-analyzed for the relationship between IH and mental health (N = 5831), revealing a small to moderate overall effect size for the relationship between the two variables. Higher levels of IH were associated with higher scores on dimensional measures of internalizing mental health problems. Significant moderating effects were also found for mean age of the sample and the type of symptomatology measured in each study. The relationship between IH and internalizing mental health problems was stronger in studies with a higher mean age. The relationship between IH and depressive symptomatology was stronger than the relationship between IH and symptoms of anxiety. Limitations and future research directions are discussed as well as implications for clinical practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) substantial overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiologic factors (e.g., familial risk, negative affectivity, information-processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) negative sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression. Basic research on their various common and unique etiologic mechanisms has guided the development of efficacious treatments for anxiety and depressive disorders in youth. Potential processes through which the successful treatment of childhood anxiety might prevent subsequent depression are described.

AB Many studies have shown that conduct disorder (CD) and depression often co-occur in late childhood and adolescence and have historically been regarded as the primary point of comorbidity between internalizing and behavioral disorders. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and not CD, may best explain the comorbidity between disruptive behavior disorders and depression. ODD typically onsets before CD and depression, changes in ODD symptoms predict changes in symptoms of CD and depression from one year to the next, and ODD in childhood and adolescence predicts depression in adulthood. Emerging evidence suggests that there are affective and behavioral dimensions of ODD symptoms, and those affective ODD symptoms (and not the behavioral symptoms) best predict later depression. These results are highly relevant not only for our understanding of the etiology of the disorders, but also for optimizing early interventions aimed at reducing irritability in some ODD children. The new findings also stimulate new questions to be addressed with future research.

AB Results of collaborations with juvenile justice agencies nationwide were examined to provide generalizable estimates of psychiatric disorder and suicidality among justice system youth. Diagnostic assessments were aggregated from 57 sites (N = 9,819) from an automated computer-assisted self-interview (Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children). Disorder was predicted from setting type (system intake, detention, corrections), adjusting for demographic and offense characteristics, and for cross-site variability within settings. Race by comorbid disorder interactions were examined in predicting substance use disorder (SUD). White youth, repeat offenders, and those with further justice system penetration reported higher rates of most disorders; girls reported higher rates of internalizing conditions only. Although presence of another disorder increased SUD for most groups, SUD was high in American Indians regardless of either affective disorder or recent suicide attempt. Findings highlight (a) varying mental health needs across settings, (b) prior justice contact relating strongly to need, (c) girls' elevated rates of internalizing disorder, and (d) racial/ethnic differences in diagnostic profiles.

AB Although literature supports the association between harmonious coparenting practices and lowered child problems, little is known about coparenting influences among family constellations in the foster care system. Via a compilation of a new coparenting practices measure, we examined similarities and differences on foster parent-derived perceptions of support/flexibility, shared communication, conflict/triangulation, and total coparenting between foster and biological parents and their independent contribution to child internalizing and externalizing problems. Self-reports were gathered from foster parents (N=80) in 2 groups: kin and nonkin. As compared with nonkin, kin foster parents reported higher perceived support/flexibility, shared communication, and total coparenting. A tendency for higher conflict/triangulation among kin foster parents was also found. After considering foster parent group, psychological distress, and harsh discipline, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceived total coparenting and conflict/triangulation contributed to child internalizing and externalizing problems. Results support the linkage between perceptions of coparenting and child problems among caregivers (foster and biological alike) in kin and nonkin arrangements and highlight training in coparenting in general, and conflict management in particular, as an important intervention focus to reduce the high level of child problems in this vulnerable population.

AB Effects of the life skills programme 'Eigenstandig werden' (Becoming independent) on life skills and on identified antecedents of adolescent health risk behaviour, childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviour were tested in an elementary school setting. A quasi-experimental controlled trial with five repeated measures was conducted. Participants were 919 students from 50 elementary schools in Saxony, Germany. Outcomes were assessed by teachers' ratings. Growth-curve models revealed that the rate of decline in internalizing and externalizing behaviour was significantly higher in the intervention group-especially for students with high baseline levels of externalizing behaviour (P < 0.01). No general programme effects on the development of skills could be found (P = 0.22). The current study provides evidence that life skills programmes in elementary school may be an effective strategy in reducing antecedents of adolescent risk-taking behaviour.

AB To enhance the prevention and intervention efforts of childhood obesity, there is a strong need for the early detection of psychological factors contributing to its development and maintenance. Rather than a stable condition, childhood obesity represents a dynamic process, in which behavior, cognition and emotional regulation interact mutually with each other. Family structure and context, that is, parental and familial attitudes, activity, nutritional patterns as well as familial stress, have an important role with respect to the onset and maintenance of overweight and obesity. Behavioral and emotional problems are found in many, though not all, obese children, with a higher prevalence in clinical, treatment-seeking samples. The interrelatedness between obesity and psychological problems seems to be twofold, in that clinically meaningful psychological distress might foster weight gain and obesity may lead to psychosocial problems. The most frequently implicated psychosocial factors are externalizing (impulsivity and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and internalizing (depression and anxiety) behavioral problems and uncontrolled eating behavior. These findings strengthen the need to further explore the interrelatedness between psychological problems and childhood obesity.

AB The association between affiliating with aggressive peers and behavioral, social and psychological adjustment was examined. Students initially in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade (N = 427) were followed biannually through 7th grade. Students' peer-nominated groups were identified. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the independent contributions of adolescents' typical peer context (between-person effect) and changes in peer context (within-person effects) to adolescents' adjustment. Typically affiliating with aggressive groups and affiliating with more aggressive groups than usual predicted higher aggression for all youth. Typically affiliating with aggressive groups predicted negative adjustment (lower social preference and self-worth, higher victimization) for girls but neutral or positive adjustment for boys. Although typical peer context was consistently associated with adjustment, changes in peer context predicted small changes in adjustment for several outcomes. Results underscored the need to adopt a more differentiated picture of adolescents' dynamic peer context and its association with normative development.

AB Anxiety and depression are common among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), highlighting a need to identify factors that protect against these symptoms. Among typically developing children, friendships are protective, and lead to better emotional outcomes. The current study examined a large, well-characterized sample of children and adolescents with ASD to examine the relations among friendship, ASD symptom severity, and anxiety/depression. Rates of anxiety/depression were high in this sample. Greater ASD severity was associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety/depression, lower IQ, and poorer number and/or quality of reciprocal friendships. Surprisingly, children with no or very poor dyadic relationships experienced less anxiety than those with existing, but limited, friendships. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective: This study addressed predictors of change in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among youths who had experienced physical injuries. The influences of pretrauma internalizing and externalizing problems, prior stressor exposure, and gender were investigated. Additionally, gender was examined as 3 moderator of the associations between internalizing problems and PTSS, externalizing problems and PTSS, and prior stressor exposure and PTSS, Method: Participants were 157 children and adolescents (75% male; age M = 13.30 years, SD = 3.60; 44% Caucasian, 39% African American, 13% Hispanic, and 4% other) admitted to 2 hospitals for physical injuries. Youths and their parents completed measures of PTSS (Child Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index), internalizing and externalizing problems (Child Behavior Checklist), and prior stressor exposure (Coddington Life Events Scale, Child) during the hospital stay; youths completed up to 3 additional PTSS assessments targeted at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed a significant average decline in PTSS over time (p < .05) that followed a curvilinear trajectory. Externalizing problems, prior stressor exposure, and female gender predicted higher initial PTSS levels (p < .05). Gender moderated the influence of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and prior stressor exposure on decline in PTSS over time (p < .05). Patterns of recovery for those with high and low levels of each characteristic differed for girls and boys. Conclusions: Findings suggest targets for clinical consideration, both with respect to identifying subgroups of children and adolescents that may warrant early assessment and monitoring and timing of more directed PTSS treatment intervention.

AB Objective: The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the replicable nature of statistical suppressor effects in coping research through 2 examples with African American adolescents from low-income communities. Method: Participants in the 1st example included 497 African American adolescents (mean age = 12.61 years, SD = 0.99; 57% female) reporting on dispositional coping, and participants in the 2nd example included 268 African American adolescents (mean age = 12.90 years, SD = 1.27; 56% female) reporting on situation-based coping. Participants in both samples completed self-report measures of coping strategies (Children's Coping Strategies Checklist and How I Coped Under Pressure Scale) and internalizing symptoms (Youth Self-Report, Children's Depression Inventory, and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale). Results: The results of structural equation modeling revealed significant suppressor effects, with active coping and support-seeking coping enhancing the association between avoidant coping and internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: The demonstration of replicable suppressor effects helps to advance coping research and intervention by providing evidence of the interdependence of coping strategies, thus increasing understanding of how coping strategies work together to predict outcomes. The current study offers recommendations for understanding associations among coping strategies within the context of suppression effects.

AB Few research studies have examined how screening outcomes may be different or similar for males and females, despite evidence that male students outnumber female students in special education populations and are more likely to experience school failure. During the 3 years of this study, 15,932 students in Grades 6 through 9 were screened with the use of a modified version of the Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD). Within this period, 1,065 nominations were collected for students identified as at risk for internalizing and externalizing problems, of which 77.4% were male. The average ratio of males to females nominated was approximately 5:1 for externalizing behaviors, 2:1 for internalizing behaviors, and 3:1 for total nominations. Reliability coefficients on the Adaptive and Maladaptive scales from the SSBD Stage 2 were comparable for both genders as determined by Fisher's z tests. On the Adaptive scale, female students tended to be rated higher by their teachers. A multivariate analysis (general linear model) was conducted to examine gender socioeconomic status, and the internalizing-externalizing dimension at SSBD Stage 1 as predictors of scores on the three SSBD Stage 2 scales (Critical Events, Adaptive, and Maladaptive).

AB This study presents results of a subgroup analysis from a randomized trial to examine whether Structural Ecosystems Therapy (SET), a family intervention intended to improve medication adherence and reduce drug relapse of HIV-seropositive (HIV+) women recovering from drug abuse, provided benefits for families with children. Data from 42 children and 25 mothers were analyzed at baseline, and 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Results of longitudinal Generalized Estimating Equations analyses suggested that SET was more efficacious than the Health Group (HG) control condition in decreasing children's internalizing and externalizing problems and reducing mothers' psychological distress and drug relapse. Children in SET reported improvements in positive parenting as compared to the children in HG, but there were no differences in mother-reported positive parenting, or parental involvement as reported by either the children or mothers. These findings suggest that family interventions such as SET may be beneficial for mothers and children. An adaptation of SET specifically for families with children could further enhance benefits and improve acceptability and cost-effectiveness.

AB The purpose of this study was to highlight associations between sexual orientation and risk outcomes in late adolescence and early adulthood using an expanded measure of sexual orientation. Recent data indicate higher levels of risk behavior in a newly identified population, mostly heterosexuals, as compared to heterosexuals. Comparisons among groups using an expanded measure of sexual orientation such as this, however, often do not include all possible groups or may restrict comparisons between groups. Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health); participants identified as heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay, or gay. Main risk outcomes were parental mistreatment, home displacement, thoughts of suicide, depressive symptoms, frequency of drinking, and delinquency. A priori planned comparisons examined differences between: (a) heterosexual vs. mostly heterosexual, (b) gay vs. mostly gay, (c) mostly heterosexual vs. bisexual, (d) mostly gay vs. bisexual, (e) mostly heterosexual vs. mostly gay, (f) heterosexual vs. gay, (g) heterosexual vs. bisexual, and (h) gay vs. bisexual. Mostly heterosexual youth were at significantly greater risk than heterosexual youth on all outcomes but did not differ from bisexual or mostly gay youth. Heterosexuals were at lower risk as compared to mostly heterosexuals and bisexuals. This study provides further evidence of differential risk associations for sexual minorities.

AB This study tested a mediation model of the relationship with school problems, social network quality, and substance use with a primary care sample of 301 urban adolescents. It was theorized that social network quality (level of risk or protection in network) would mediate the effects of school problems, accounting for internalizing problems and relations with parents, on substance use. Results of path modeling with AMOS showed that the model provided a very good fit to the data and demonstrated partial mediation effects of social network quality on substance use. The standardized mediated effect of school problems on substance use, mediated by social network quality, was 0.13 (p < .01, 95% CI [.072, .189]). An effect size measure was applied to determine what proportion of the total effect was mediated by the intervening (social network quality) variable and produced a 0.34 effect size. The results highlight the potential preventive role of social network quality in addressing urban adolescent substance use.

AB This study examined a typology of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors of 2,552 ethnically diverse early adolescents who attended sixth grade in public schools and lived in disadvantaged communities. Behavioral adjustment of adolescents was measured by teacher ratings using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). Although typologies of children based on the BASC have been available in the literature for the past decade, little research exists on typologies of adolescents using the same instrument. The present study extended into early adolescence previous classification works focusing on childhood. A series of cluster analyses supported a seven-cluster solution: well-adapted, average, adaptive skills deficits, internalizing problems, mildly disruptive, disruptive behavior problems, and severe problems. Results appear similar to prior investigations with unique features reflecting the high-risk characteristics of the current sample. Implications of this research are discussed with regard to prevention and intervention efforts implemented within the schools.

AB Relational aggression includes behaviors intended to damage the social status and relationships of others Recent work has demonstrated problematic outcomes for both aggressors and victims These behaviors have been associated with psychopathology, including early borderline personality pathology Despite the importance in better understanding these behaviors, numerous questions remain regarding the validity of different informants and methods for assessing relational aggression In a community-based sample of 330 families evenly split by child gender (50 3% female), relational aggression data was assessed via multiple informants (mother, father, and self) and multiple methods (questionnaire and interview) The results suggest that mothers and fathers show higher agreement for girls' relational aggression than for boys' and that the presence of gender differences depends on the method of measurement In addition, both mothers and fathers reports of relational aggression uniquely predicted internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and social problems, with fathers' reports emerging as a particularly robust predictor Relational aggression scores accounted for a greater amount of predicted variance in externalizing behaviors than in the other two domains Results are discussed in the context of the utility of multiple informants and the conceptualization of relational aggression in a broader externalizing psychopathology framework

AB Recent research has reported an association between narcissism in youth and a variety of externalizing behavior problems. The extent to which narcissism, conceptualized in two ways (i.e., as part of psychopathy; as a constellation of maladaptive and adaptive features), was related to internalizing problems in adolescents was examined in this study. Participants were 534 at-risk adolescents ages 16-19, attending a military-style residential program. Psychopathy-linked narcissism was positively associated with self-reported internalizing problems: however, narcissism assessed from the Narcissistic Personality Inventory for Children (NPIC: Barry, Frick, & Killian, 2003) was negatively associated with such symptoms. Perceptions of peer relationships appeared to play a role in this latter association. The implications for the understanding of youth narcissism are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Method: A selective review of genetically informative research strategies, their limitations, and key findings examining issues related to the heritability of substance use and substance use disorders in children and adolescents is presented. Results: Adoption, twin, and extended-family designs have established there is a strong heritable component to liability to nicotine, alcohol, and illicit drug dependence in adults. However, shared environmental influences are relatively stronger in youth samples and at earlier stages of substance involvement (e.g., use). There is considerable overlap in the genetic influences associated with the abuse/dependence across drug classes, and shared genetic influences contribute to the commonly observed associations between substance-use disorders and externalizing and, to a lesser extent, internalizing psychopathology. Rapid technologic advances have made the identification of specific gene variants that influence risks for substance-use disorders feasible, and linkage and association (including genomewide association studies) have identified promising candidate genes implicated in the development of substance-use disorders. Conclusions: Studies using genetically informative research designs, including those that examine aggregate genetic factors and those examining specific gene variants, individually and in interaction with environmental influences, offer promising avenues not only for delineating genetic effects on substance-use disorders but also for understanding the unfolding of risk across development and the interaction between environmental and genetic factors in the etiology of these disorders.

AB Self-regulation ability is an important component of children's academic success. Physiological reactivity may relate to brain activity governing attention and behavioral regulation. Saliva samples collected from 186 preschool children (101 boys, mean age = 53 months, 34% minority) before and after a series of mildly challenging games and again 30 min following the challenges were used to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) (cortisol) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS; alpha-amylase) activity. Behavioral regulation was measured in delay of gratification and slow-down motor activities included in the challenge task. Cortisol and alpha-amylase were related differentially to aspects of behavioral regulation. Low cortisol was related to classroom regulation difficulties. Children with greater cortisol elevations following the challenge task had poorer performance on the slow-down motor task. Children with greater increases in salivary alpha-amylase following challenge were less able to delay gratification. Results suggest that HPA axis and SNS arousal may contribute differentially to behavioral regulation ability.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the performance characteristics and validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) as a screening tool for depression among adolescents.
   METHODS: The PHQ-9 was completed by 442 youth (aged 13-17 years) who were enrolled in a large health care-delivery system and participated in a study on depression outcomes. Criterion validity and performance characteristics were assessed against an independent structured mental health interview (the Child Diagnostic Interview Schedule [DISC-IV]). Construct validity was tested by examining associations between the PHQ-9 and a self-report measure of functional impairment, as well as parental reports of child psychosocial impairment and internalizing symptoms.
   RESULTS: A PHQ-9 score of 11 or more had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 77.5% for detecting youth who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for major depression on the DISC-IV. Receiver-operator-curve analysis revealed that the PHQ-9 had an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.94), and the cut point of 11 was optimal for maximizing sensitivity without loss of specificity. Increasing PHQ-9 scores were significantly correlated with increasing levels of functional impairment, as well as parental report of internalizing symptoms and psychosocial problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the optimal cut point is higher among adolescents, the sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-9 are similar to those of adult populations. The brief nature and ease of scoring of this instrument make this tool an excellent choice for providers and researchers seeking to implement depression screening in primary care settings.

AB INTRODUCTION: Late-preterm birth (34-36 weeks' gestation) has been associated with a risk for long-term cognitive and socioemotional problems. However, many studies have not incorporated measures of important contributors to these outcomes, and it is unclear whether effects attributed to gestational age are separate from fetal growth or its proxy, birth weight for gestational age.
   METHOD: Data came from a study of low-and normal-weight births sampled from urban and suburban settings between 1983 and 1985 (low birth weight, n = 473; normal birth weight; n = 350). Random sampling was used to pair singletons born late-preterm with a term counterpart whose birth weight z score was within 0.1 SD of his or her match (n = 168 pairs). With random-effects models, we evaluated whether pairs differed in their IQ scores and teacher-reported behavioral problems at the age of 6 years.
   RESULTS: In adjusted models, late-preterm birth was associated with an increased risk of full-scale (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-4.61]) and performance (aOR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.09-3.82]) IQ scores below 85. Late-preterm birth was associated with higher levels of internalizing and attention problems, findings that were replicated in models that used thresholds marking borderline or clinically significant problems (aOR: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.28-4.32] and 1.76 [95% CI: 1.04-3.0], respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Late-preterm birth is associated with behavioral problems and lower IQ at the age of 6, independent of maternal IQ, residential setting, and sociodemographics. Future research is needed to investigate whether these findings result from a reduction in gestational length, in utero (eg, obstetric complications) or ex-utero (eg, neonatal complications) factors marked by late-preterm birth, or some combination of these factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Video game playing may negatively impact youth. However, the existing literature on gaming is inconsistent and often has focused on aggression rather than the health correlates of gaming and the prevalence and correlates of problematic gaming.
   METHODS: We anonymously surveyed 4028 adolescents about gaming and reported problems with gaming and other health behaviors. A total of 51.2% of the sample reported gaming (76.3% of boys and 29.2% of girls).
   RESULTS: There were no negative health correlates of gaming in boys and lower odds of smoking regularly; however, girls who reported gaming were less likely to report depression and more likely to report getting into serious fights and carrying a weapon to school. Among gamers, 4.9% reported problematic gaming, defined as reporting trying to cut back, experiencing an irresistible urge to play, and experiencing a growing tension that could only be relieved by playing. Boys were more likely to report these problems (5.8%) than girls (3.0%). Correlates of problematic gaming included regular cigarette smoking, drug use, depression, and serious fights. Results suggest that gaming is largely normative in boys and not associated with many health factors. In girls, however, gaming seems to be associated with more externalizing behaviors and fewer internalizing symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of problematic gaming is low but not insignificant, and problematic gaming may be contained within a larger spectrum of externalizing behaviors. More research is needed to define safe levels of gaming, refine the definition of problematic gaming, and evaluate effective prevention and intervention strategies. Pediatrics 2010;126:e1414-e1424

AB A large community-based sample of Russian youths (n = 841, age M = 13.17 years, SD = 2.51) was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (mothers and fathers separately), Teacher's Report Form, and Youth Self-Report. The multiple indicator-version of the correlated trait-correlated method minus one, or CT-C(M - 1), model was applied to analyze (a) the convergent and divergent validity of these instruments in Russia, (b) the degree of trait-specificity of rater biases, and (c) potential predictors of rater-specific effects. As expected, based on the published results from different countries and in different languages, the convergent validity of the instruments was rather high between mother and father reports, but rather low for parent, teacher, and self-reports. For self- and teacher reports, rater-specific effects were related to age and gender of the children for some traits. These results, once again, attest to the importance of incorporating information from multiple observers when psychopathological traits are evaluated in children and adolescents.

AB Research suggests that involvement in relational aggression is associated with serious adjustment problems, including concurrent and future social maladjustment (e.g., problematic friendships; rejection), internalizing problems (e.g., depressive symptoms), and school avoidance. Despite the burgeoning literature focusing on the harmful and damaging nature of relationally aggressive behavior, this research has only recently begun to be used to inform school-based prevention and intervention programming. This article reviews the developmental research related to relational aggression and presents a systematic examination of nine published school-based prevention and intervention programs to prevent relational aggression. Programs reviewed target preschool through eighth-grade students. Strengths and limitations of each program are discussed. Recommendations are offered for future research to develop and validate school-based programming for relational aggression, and implications for school psychologists are discussed.

AB Peer aggression in children is a serious issue that school psychologists often encounter on a daily basis. To develop a better understanding of aggression, it is important to look at specific subtypes of aggression and how they are related to adjustment difficulties. Past research has examined the links between reactive and proactive physical aggression and adjustment difficulties, but fewer studies have examined functional subtypes of relational aggression. Furthermore, little research has examined the associations between reactive and proactive relational aggression and adjustment difficulties in middle childhood. This study examined how reactive and proactive subtypes of both physical aggression and relational aggression were associated with adjustment difficulties (internalizing and externalizing problems) at Time I (third grade) and Time 2 (fourth grade) in a sample (n = 125) of children. Regression analyses showed that reactive relational aggression was associated with concurrent internalizing problems. Associations between aggression and externalizing difficulties varied by gender. These data suggest the importance of taking into account functional subtypes of both relational aggression and physical aggression when studying adjustment difficulties. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Research into the neural underpinnings of fear and fear-related pathology has highlighted the role of the amygdala. For instance, bilateral damage to the amygdaloid complex is associated with decreased appreciation of danger and recognition of fear in humans, whereas enlarged amygdala volume is associated with internalizing syndromes. It is unknown whether amygdala volume and fearfulness are related in the absence of pathology. We examined the correlation between normal fearfulness and amygdala morphology in 116 healthy children and adolescents (60 boys, 56 girls, age 7-17 years). Fearfulness was measured using the parent ratings on the Pediatric Behavior Scale and amygdala volumes were determined by manual tracing. We found a positive correlation between right amygdala volume in girls (r = 0.29). This relationship was more robust and present bilaterally when analyses were limited to girls with a positive nuclear family history of depression (for left r = 0.63; for right r = 0.58). In boys there was no significant relationship which may suggest that biological mechanisms differ between sexes. Given the role of enlarged amygdala volume in pathology, these findings may indicate that variation in amygdala morphology marks susceptibility to internalizing disorders.

AB Background: The polyamine system has been implicated in a number of psychiatric conditions, which display both alterations in polyamine levels and altered expression of genes related to polyamine metabolism. Studies have identified associations between genetic variants in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) and both anxiety and suicide, and several polymorphisms appear to play important roles in determining gene expression.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We genotyped 63 polymorphisms, spread across four polyaminergic genes (SAT1, spermine synthase (SMS), spermine oxidase (SMOX), and ornithine aminotransferase like-1 (OATL1)), in 1255 French-Canadian individuals who have been followed longitudinally for 22 years. We assessed univariate associations with anxiety, mood disorders, and attempted suicide, as assessed during early adulthood. We also investigated the involvement of gene-environment interactions in terms of childhood abuse, and assessed internalizing and externalizing symptoms as endophenotypes mediating these interactions. Overall, each gene was associated with at least one main outcome: anxiety (SAT1, SMS), mood disorders (SAT1, SMOX), and suicide attempts (SAT1, OATL1). Several SAT1 polymorphisms displayed disease-specific risk alleles, and polymorphisms in this gene were involved in gene-gene interactions with SMS to confer risk for anxiety disorders, as well as gene-environment interactions between childhood physical abuse and mood disorders. Externalizing behaviors demonstrated significant mediation with regards to the association between OATL1 and attempted suicide, however there was no evidence that externalizing or internalizing behaviors were appropriate endophenotypes to explain the associations with mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, childhood sexual abuse did not demonstrate mediating influences on any of our outcomes.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that genetic variants in polyaminergic genes are associated with psychiatric conditions, each of which involves a set of separate and distinct risk alleles. As several of these polymorphisms are associated with gene expression, these findings may provide mechanisms to explain the alterations in polyamine metabolism which have been observed in psychiatric disorders.

AB The information provided by parents is indispensable for the early identification of psychopathology; for this reason, developmentally appropriate, reliable, and valid questionnaires are needed to gather their information. This study was designed to examine the utility of the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), a parent-report questionnaire covering a wide range of behavior and emotional problems and competencies, in preschoolers referred for child psychiatric evaluation. The fathers and mothers of 85 children (23.2% girls; age 15-57 months) with autism spectrum, externalizing, or internalizing disorders completed the ITSEA, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/2-3 and 4-18 versions), and the child domain of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). The ITSEA showed good interrater reliability between parents, and validity was supported by significant correlations with corresponding CBCl and PSI domains. Evidence supporting the validity of the ITSEA for psychopathology was mixed across scales, with good diagnostic accuracy at the level of the broader psychiatric syndromes being achieved by the combination of subscales within the Externalizing. Internalizing, and Competence domains. The value of the ITSEA lies in the ability to systematically evaluate a wide range of problem behaviors and competencies. The ITSEA may be useful to create profiles of children's functioning in preschoolers referred for psychiatric assessment.

AB Background Rates of mental illness in children are increasing throughout the world Observational studies of depression anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suggest that zinc is an alternative treatment
   Objective We examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the mental health of school-age children in Guatemala
   Design From January to October 2006 we conducted a 6 mo randomized double blind controlled trial comparing zinc supplementation non (10 mg ZnO/d for 5 d/wk) with a placebo (10 mg glucose) in 674 Guatemalan children in grades 1-4 Outcome measures included intern timing (ie depression and anxiety) and externalizing (ie hyper activity and conduct disorder) problem behaviors positive behaviors (le socialization and leadership) and serum zinc concentrations
   Results Zinc and placebo groups did not differ significantly in any behavioral measures at baseline or at follow up At baseline 21 4% of children had serum zinc concentrations <65 mu g/dL At follow-up both groups improved significantly and zinc concentrations were higher in the zinc group Increases in serum zinc concentrations were inversely associated with decreases in depressive symp toms (estimate -0 01 points per mu g Zn/dL P = 0 01) anxiety (estimate -0 012 points per mu g Zn/dL P = 0 02) internalizing symptoms (estimate -0 021 points per mu g Zn/dL P = 0 02) rind social skills (estimate -0019 points per mu g Zn/dL P = 0 01) in adjusted models that weft controlled for child age sex, socioeconomic status household and treatment group
   Conclusions Six months of zinc supplementation did not induce differences in mental health outcomes between zinc and placebo groups However, increases in serum zinc concentrations were associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms (ie depression and anxiety) in a community based sample of children at risk of zinc deficiency This trial was registered at clinicaltrials gov as NCT00283660 Am J Clin Nutr 2010 92 1241-50

AB Objective: It is generally accepted that children of parents with schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis are at heightened risk for a range of behavioral problems. However, it remains unclear whether offspring of parents with different forms of psychosis (e. g., schizophrenia, other nonaffective psychoses, and affective psychoses) have distinct forms of behavioral problems (i.e., internalizing and externalizing).
   Method: Behavioral observations of children of parents with psychosis (N=281) and parents without psychosis (N=185) were conducted at ages 4 and 7 years.
   Results: There were no significant differences between groups in behavior observed at age 4 years. At age 7 years, compared with children of unaffected parents, children of parents with psychosis had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 (95% CI=1.5-5.6) for externalizing problems, in particular for children of parents with schizophrenia (adjusted odds ratio=4.4; 95% CI=1.7-12.5). This increase in risk for externalizing problems was observed for female children only (adjusted odds ratio=8.1; 95% CI=2.5-26.3). In contrast, male children were at increased risk for internalizing problems (adjusted odds ratio=3.6; 95% CI=1.6-8.3).
   Conclusions: Children of parents with various forms of psychosis are at risk for internalizing and externalizing problems by age 7 years. This risk varies by gender of the offspring. Implications for treatment of parents with psychotic disorders and high-risk children are discussed. (Am J Psychiatry 2010; 167:1331-1338)

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we determined whether sexually abused adolescent boys or girls were more likely to have internalizing behavior scores in the clinical range. Second, after determining boys were more likely than girls to have an internalizing behavior problem, we tested whether this relationship would persist after several other variables were accounted for: characteristics of the sexual abuse, exposure to domestic violence, self-efficacy, and their peer and caregiver relationships.
   Methods: A national probability sample of children investigated by child protective services for child maltreatment was used. The sample consisted of 127 girls and 31 boys, ages 11-14.
   Results: Sexually abused boys were more likely than girls to have an internalizing behavior problem in the clinical range even after controlling for several variables. Exposure to domestic violence, more severe sexual abuse, sexual abuse by a non-relative, and the amount of autonomy support provided by caregivers also increased the likelihood internalizing problem.
   Conclusions: During early adolescence, sexually abused boys may be more likely than sexually abused girls to have a clinically significant internalizing behavior problem. Researchers need to continue to investigate whether sexually abused boys are as likely as girls or more likely than girls to have an internalizing behavior problem in later adolescence.
   Practice implications: Internalizing symptoms warrant careful screening and assessment with sexually abused boys and girls who experience more intrusive sexual abuse, who are sexually abused by a non-relative, who are exposed to domestic violence, and who receive lower autonomy support from their caregivers.

AB Objective: This study examined evidence for personality variability in adolescents with eating disorder features in light of previous evidence that personality variability in adult women with eating disorder symptoms carries important clinical implications.
   Method: Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory personality data from adolescent girls with disturbed eating who were psychiatrically hospitalized were cluster analyzed, and resulting groups were compared in eating and comorbid psychopathology.
   Results: Three subgroups were identified among the 153 patients with eating disorder features: high functioning, internalizing, and externalizing. The internalizing group was marked by eating-related and mood dysfunction; the externalizing group by elevated eating and mood psychopathology as well as impulsivity, aggression, and substance use; and the high-functioning group by lower levels of psychopathology and relatively high self-esteem.
   Conclusions: These findings converge with previous research using different personality models in adult samples and highlight the clinical use of considering personality heterogeneity among adolescent and adult women with disturbed eating.

AB This study used a three-wave longitudinal design to investigate developmental cascades among social competence and externalizing and internalizing behavioral adjustment in a normative sample of 117 children seen at 4, 10, and 14 years. Children, mothers, and teachers provided data. A series of nested path analysis models was used to determine the most parsimonious and plausible cascades across the three constructs over and above their covariation at each age and stability across age. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years exhibited more externalizing and internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more externalizing behaviors at age 14 years. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years also exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more internalizing behaviors at age 14 years. Children who exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 4 years exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more externalizing behaviors at age 14 years. These cascades among social competence and behavioral adjustment obtained independent of child intelligence and maternal education and social desirability of responding.

AB Using data from a 6-year longitudinal follow-up sample of 240 youth who participated in a randomized experimental trial of a preventive intervention for divorced families with children ages 9-12, the current study tested alternative cascading pathways by which the intervention decreased symptoms of internalizing disorders, symptoms of externalizing disorders, substance use, and risky sexual behavior and increased self-esteem and academic performance in mid-to late adolescence (15-19 years old). It was hypothesized that the impact of the program on adolescent adaptation outcomes would be explained by progressive associations between program-induced changes in parenting and youth adaptation outcomes. The results supported a cascading model of program effects in which the program was related to increased mother-child relationship quality that was related to subsequent decreases in child internalizing problems, which then was related to subsequent increases in self-esteem and decreases in symptoms of internalizing disorders in adolescence. The results were also consistent with a model in which the program increased maternal effective discipline that was related to decreased child externalizing problems, which was related to subsequent decreases in symptoms of externalizing disorders, less substance use, and better academic performance in adolescence. There were no significant differences in the model based on level of baseline risk or adolescent gender. These results provide support for a cascading pathways model of child and adolescent development.

AB There is growing evidence that many offspring of bipolar parents will develop moderate to severe forms of psychopathology during childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this study was to apply growth curve models to evaluate developmental progression with regard to continuity and cascades representative within the context of a family risk study of bipolar disorder (BD). Repeated assessments of externalizing, internalizing, and thought problems, spanning more than a decade, were examined in a total of 94 offspring of parents with BD (O-BD), major depressive disorder (O-UNI), or no significant psychiatric or medical problems (O-WELL). Continuity was defined by the growth curve of the O-WELL group who exhibited low levels of problems from early childhood through late adolescence. Discontinuity, as evidenced by greater complexity of growth curves relative to the O-WELL group, was exhibited in the at-risk offspring groups for internalizing problems. Different patterns of developmental cascades were supported for the at-risk group with O-UNI showing a robust cascade from self-regulatory deficits (externalizing problems) to internalizing problems. There was also support for a cascade from self-regulatory deficits to thought problems across the entire group (with some support that this pattern was accounted for primarily by O-BD). This study not only serves to advance our understanding of the risks associated with a family history of BD, but also provides a novel approach to examining developmental cascades.

AB A developmental cascade model tested associations among child maltreatment, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, social competence, and cannabis abuse and dependence symptoms in a longitudinal cohort (N = 415). Nested structural equation models evaluated continuity and cross-domain influences among broad multi-informant constructs across four developmental periods: age 7 to 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, and 15 to 18. Results indicated significant paths from child maltreatment to early externalizing and internalizing problems and social competence, as well as to cannabis abuse and dependence (CAD) symptoms in adolescence. Youth CAD symptoms were primarily related directly to child maltreatment and externalizing problems. Childhood internalizing symptoms contributed to later childhood decreases in social competence, which predicted increases in late adolescent externalizing problems. Using a developmental psychopathology framework, results are discussed in relation to cascade and transactional effects and the interplay between problem behaviors during childhood and development of CAD symptoms during early and late adolescence.

AB Being the target of parental violent acts decreases child adjustment and increases the likelihood of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Our study analyses how different types of parental violence ranging from verbal threats and swearing to hitting and kicking a child, are associated with child adjustment, indicated by strengths and difficulties scale (SDQ) total problem score, internalizing and externalizing problems as well as prosocial behaviour. We also study whether girls and boys and youths in two Nordic countries respond differently to parental violence. The data consists of a large-scale community sample of 15-16-year old Finnish (n = 5,762) and Danish (n = 3,943) adolescents. The representative data of continental Finland and its Finnish and Swedish speaking ninth graders as well as representative data of Danish ninth grade pupils were collected by the Police College of Finland and in Denmark by the National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark. The results show a clear dose-response effect between parental violent behaviour and the adolescent's problems. The more severe forms of parental violence were associated with higher levels of SDQ total difficulties and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. There was also a connection between parental violence and the deterioration of prosocial behaviour. The association was gender and nationality specific. The findings imply a high prevalence of parental violence and adverse mental health among the affected Finnish and Danish adolescents. Though the laws have been set in motion to prevent the use of parental physical violence the challenges remain in several domains of child protection, general health care, prevention and intervention.

AB Musculoskeletal pain in multiple sites is common already in adolescence, and may lead to subsequent musculoskeletal complaints in adulthood. We examined predictive factors for the persistence of multiple musculoskeletal pains in adolescence over a 2-year time span. A postal questionnaire was administered to a subsample of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 1773) when subjects were aged 16 and 18. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the possible risk factors of new-onset of multiple pains at 18 years and 2-year persistence of multiple pains were obtained using multinomial logistic regression. Multiple musculoskeletal pains were common; 43% of boys and 63% of girls at 16, and 61% of boys and 81% of girls at 18 reported pain in more than one site during the last 6 months. Moreover, multiple pains had a high persistence rate, as 75% of boys and 88% of girls with multiple pains at 16 reported multiple pains also at 18. In the multivariate analysis, emotional and behavioral problems (internalizing problems, OR 2.3; externalizing problems, OR 2.2), and high sitting time (OR 1.6) among boys, and internalizing problems (OR 3.7), high physical activity level (OR 1.6), short sleeping time (OR 1.7), and smoking (OR 1.9) among girls were predictive factors for the persistence of multiple pains. No statistically significant associations between the baseline variables and new-onset multiple pains were found. Multiple musculoskeletal pains appear to have a high tendency to persist in adolescence; both psychosocial factors and lifestyle factors contribute to this vulnerability.

AB The purpose was to study how functional polymorphisms in the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF val66met) and the serotonin transporter gene linked promotor region (5-HTTLPR) interact with childhood adversities in predicting Effortful Control. Effortful Control refers to the ability to regulate behavior in a goal-directed manner and is an interesting endophenotype for psychopathology because of its heritability and the association of low Effortful Control with both internalizing and externalizing problems. In a longitudinal population-based study Effortful Control was assessed with the parent version of the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire at age 11. Pregnancy and delivery adversities and childhood events were assessed in a parent interview at age 11. Long-term difficulties until age 11 were assessed with a parent questionnaire at age 13.5. Blood or buccal cells were collected at age 16 for genotyping the rs6265 and rs25531 SNPs and the 5-HTTLPR length polymorphism. The study included 1032 complete data sets. Effortful Control was significantly predicted by the interaction between BDNF val66met, 5-HTTLPR and childhood events. The BDNF val66met val/val-5-HTTLPR l'/l' genotype was unaffected by childhood events, while having either at least one BDNF val66met met or 5-HTTLPR s' allele (l'/l'-met-carrier; l'/s'-val/val; s'/s'-val/val) made children sensitive to childhood events. Predictions of Effortful Control by pregnancy and delivery adversities and long-term difficulties were largely independent of genotype. We concluded that the l'/l'-met-carrier, l'/s'-val/val and the s'/s'-val/val genotypes showed greatest plasticity while the l'/l'-val/val genotype was unaffected by childhood events.

AB The fronto-striato-thalamic circuit has been implicated in the pathomechanism of Tourette Syndrome (TS) To study white and gray matter comprehensively, we used a novel technique called Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) combined with voxel-based analysis (VBA) of diffusion tensor MR images in children with TS as compared to typically developing controls. These automated and unbiased methods allow analysis of cerebral white matter and gray matter regions. We compared 15 right-handed children with TS (mean age 11 6 +/- 2.5 years, 12 males) to 14 age-matched right-handed healthy controls (NC, mean age: 12.29 +/- 3.2 years, 6 males). Tic severity and neurobehavioral scores were correlated with FA and ADC values in regions found abnormal by these methods. For white matter, TBSS analysis showed regions of Increased ADC in the corticostriatal projection pathways including left external capsule and left and right subcallosal fasciculus pathway in TS group compared to NC group. Within the TS group, ADC for the left external capsule was negatively associated with tic severity (r = -0 586, P = 0 02) For gray matter, VBA revealed increased ADC for bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, left putamen, and left insular cortex ADC for the right and left orbitofrontal cortex was highly correlated with internalizing problems (r = 0.665, P = 0 009, r = 0 545; P = 0 04, respectively) Altogether, this analysis revealed focal diffusion abnormalities in the corticostriatal pathway and in gray matter structures involved in the fronto-striatal circuit in TS. These diffusion abnormalities could serve as a neuroimaging marker related to tic severity and neurobehavioral abnormalities in TS subjects. Hum Brain Mapp 31.1665-1674, 2010.

AB We examined differences among 158 children, 44 with selective mutism (SM; M = 8.2 years, SD = 3.4 years), 65 with mixed anxiety (MA; M = 8.9 years, SD = 3.2 years), and 49 community controls (M = 7.7 years, SD = 2.6 years) on primary caregiver, teacher, and child reports of behavioral and socio-emotional functioning. Children with SM were rated lower than controls on a range of social skills, but the SM and MA groups did not significantly differ on many of the social skills and anxiety measures. However, children with SM were rated higher than children with MA and controls on social anxiety. Findings suggest that SM may be conceptualized as an anxiety disorder, with primary deficits in social functioning and social anxiety. This interpretation supports a more specific classification of SM as an anxiety disorder for future diagnostic manuals than is currently described in the literature. The present findings also have implications for clinical practice, whereby social skills training merits inclusion in intervention for children with anxiety disorders as well as children with SM.

AB The present study examined Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) in relation to ADHD symptoms, clinical diagnosis, and multiple aspects of adjustment in a clinical sample. Parent and teacher reports were gathered for 322 children and adolescents evaluated for behavioral, emotional, and/or learning problems at a university clinic. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) supported the presence of three separate, but correlated factors (SCT, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity) in both parent and teacher ratings. As expected, SCT symptoms were greatest in youth with ADHD Inattentive type, but were also found in non-ADHD clinical groups. SCT symptoms were related to inattention, internalizing, and social problems across both parent and teacher informants; for parent reports, SCT was also related to more externalizing problems. Findings support the statistical validity of the SCT construct, but its clinical utility is still unclear.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) is associated with a number of adverse psychosocial outcomes in adulthood. There is consistent evidence that CD is predictive of antisocial behavior, but mixed evidence that CD is predictive of other externalizing and internalizing disorders. Further, externalizing and internalizing disorders are often associated with similar psychosocial outcomes as CD. However, relatively little work has examined whether forms of psychopathology (e.g., externalizing and/or internalizing disorders) mediates the relationship between youth CD and adult psychosocial outcomes. The present study examined associations between youth CD and adult psychosocial outcomes and sought to identify forms of psychopathology that may potentially mediate this relationship. Participants completed self-report measures of psychosocial functioning and semi-structured diagnostic interviews during adolescence and young adulthood. Analyses found that most domains of adult psychosocial functioning were associated with youth CD. Adult antisocial behavior was the only form of psychopathology predicted by CD. Adult antisocial behavior appeared to mediate the relationship between CD and marital status, life satisfaction, and being in jail and partially mediated the relationship between CD and family support and global functioning. These data suggest that reducing the progression to adult antisocial behavior may improve multiple psychosocial outcomes among those with a history of CD.

AB Latino children in the U.S. have high rates of unmet need for mental health services, perhaps due to biased perceptions of impairment and need for care by parents and providers. We tested this argument using an experimental vignette design. Vignettes described children with problems that varied on severity (mild vs. serious), nature of the problem (internalizing vs. externalizing), as well as gender and ethnicity (Latino vs. Anglo). Raters were Latino and Anglo parents (N = 185) and providers (N = 189). Vignettes with Latino names were viewed as more impaired by both parents and providers, and this effect was significantly stronger in Latino vignettes with less severe problems. Severity and Latino features of vignettes also interacted with judgments of need for service. At higher severity, vignettes with Anglo names were judged to need service more than vignettes with Latino names, despite the same judged levels of impairment. Results are discussed in the light of the unmet need for Latinos.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widely used child mental health questionnaire with five hypothesised subscales. There is theoretical and preliminary empirical support for combining the SDQ's hypothesised emotional and peer subscales into an 'internalizing' subscale and the hypothesised behavioral and hyperactivity subscales into an 'externalizing' subscale (alongside the fifth prosocial subscale). We examine this using parent, teacher and youth SDQ data from a representative sample of 5-16 year olds in Britain (N = 18,222). Factor analyses generally supported second-order internalizing and externalizing factors, and the internalizing and externalizing subscales showed good convergent and discriminant validity across informants and with respect to clinical disorder. By contrast, discriminant validity was poorer between the emotional and peer subscales and between the behavioral, hyperactivity and prosocial subscales. This applied particularly to children with low scores on those subscales. We conclude that there are advantages to using the broader internalizing and externalizing SDQ subscales for analyses in low-risk samples, while retaining all five subscales when screening for disorder.

AB To answer several questions pertinent to DSM-V, the authors examined the predictive validity of pretreatment oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) dimensions, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and callous unemotional (CU) traits in relation to several treatment outcomes in 177 children diagnosed with ODD or conduct disorder (CD). Multiple informants completed diagnostic interviews and rating scales at 6 assessment points (pretreatment to 3-year follow-up) to document emotional and behavioral outcomes. After controlling for pretreatment CD, the ODD dimension of hurtfulness was related to treatment-resistant CD, delinquent behaviors, and externalizing problems. In contrast, the ODD dimension tapping irritability was associated with treatment-resistant ODD, internalizing problems, and global functional impairment following treatment. Whereas pretreatment ADHD was associated with posttreatment ODD and social problems, it was unrelated to posttreatment CD symptoms and diagnosis. Contrary to predictions, CU traits were unrelated to any posttreatment outcomes after controlling for other covariates. These findings remained after controlling for measures of pretreatment global functional impairment.

AB We examined different dimensions of acculturative stress in mediating the association between acculturation and psychosocial functioning among 199 Cuban American college students (M age = 20.1 years) in Miami. Results showed that heritage-cultural orientation was directly associated with self-esteem. No other direct relations emerged. Spanish competency pressures and pressures against acculturation mediated the relationships between heritage-cultural orientation and internalizing symptoms, whereas pressures to acculturate mediated the association between American cultural orientation and self-esteem. These findings highlight the unique roles of different components of acculturative stress in the relationship of heritage and American cultural orientation to Cuban American adolescents' psychosocial well-being. Implications regarding the multidimensionality of acculturation and of acculturative stress are discussed.

AB Objective: The incremental utility of symptoms of conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and callous-unemotional (CU) traits for predicting psychosocial outcomes across multiple domains was examined in a community sample of 1,517 boys. Method: Several outcomes were assessed semiannually across a 2-year follow-up, including antisocial behavior, internalizing problems, peer conflict, and academic difficulties. Official criminal charges were also examined across adolescence. Results: CD symptoms emerged as the most robust predictor of future antisocial outcomes. However, ODD symptoms predicted later criminal charges and conduct problems, and CU traits were robustly associated with serious and persistent criminal behavior in boys. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms predicted increases in oppositional defiant behavior and conduct problems over time and were uniquely related to future academic difficulties. Both ADHD and ODD symptoms predicted social and internalizing problems in boys, whereas CU traits were associated with decreased internalizing problems over time. Conclusions: The current findings have implications for revisions being considered as part of the DSM-V. Specifically, incorporating CU traits into the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) may help to further delineate boys at risk for severe and persistent delinquency. Although currently prohibited, allowing a diagnosis of ODD when CD is present may provide unique prognostic information about boys who are at risk for future criminal behavior, social problems, and internalizing problems.

AB Maternal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has been identified as a key risk factor for problem behavior in children, but the role of genetic susceptibility is not clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the metabolic genetic modification effect of exposure to ETS in nonsmoking mothers on child behavior at 2 years of age.
   A prospective cohort study was conducted among 191 mothers who gave births between 2004 and 2005 and their infants in Taiwan. The mothers completed a questionnaire before delivery in which they provided information on exposure to ETS during pregnancy. Four metabolic genes, CYP1A1 MspI, CYP1A1 Ile462Val, GSTT1, and GSTM1 were isolated from both maternal and infant DNA samples. Children's behavior problems at 2 years of age were reported by their mothers using the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5. Multiple linear models were used to estimate the effects of ETS and genotype on child behavior.
   Maternal ETS exposure was associated with the anxious score. The ETS-exposed group with both the CYP1A1 MspI and the CYP1A1 Ile462Val variants had higher scores, as reflected in total CBCL score as well as scores on the internalizing scale and its emotional subdomain, the anxious scale, and the externalizing scale and its aggressive subdomain.
   Child behavioral problems may be associated with prenatal ETS exposure, and this effect may be modified by infant CYP1A1 MspI and CYP1A1 Ile462Val genes.

AB This meta-analysis of 69 studies (1,483 effect sizes) used random effects models to examine maternal employment during infancy/early childhood in relation to 2 major domains of child functioning: achievement and behavior problems. Analyses of studies that spanned 5 decades indicated that, with a few exceptions, early employment was not significantly associated with later achievement or internalizing/externalizing behaviors. The exceptions were for teacher ratings of achievement and internalizing behaviors: Employment was associated with higher achievement and fewer internalizing behaviors. Substantial heterogeneity among the effect sizes prompted examination of moderators. Sample-level moderator analyses pointed to the importance of socioeconomic and contextual variables, with early employment most beneficial when families were challenged by single parenthood or welfare status. Maternal employment during Years 2 and 3 was associated with higher achievement. Some moderator analyses indicated negative effects of employment for middle-class and 2-parent families and for very early employment (child's first year). Associations also differed depending on whether effect sizes were adjusted for contextual variables. Only 1 study-level moderator (sex of first author) was significant after adjusting for other moderators. The small effect size and primarily nonsignificant results for main effects of early maternal employment should allay concerns about mothers working when children are young. However, negative findings associated with employment during the child's first year are compatible with calls for more generous maternal leave policies. Results highlight the importance of social context for identifying under which conditions and for which subgroups early maternal employment is associated with positive or negative child outcomes.

AB Objective: This study examines the impact of the Family Connections (FC) intervention on preventing behavioral problems among urban, predominantly African American children at risk of neglect. Method: Secondary data analyses using mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures were used to examine gender differences in child behavior outcomes among 111 participating families across three time points (intake, closing, and 6 months following intervention participation). Results: From intake to closing, boys appeared to experience a larger decrease in internalizing and externalizing behaviors than girls. At 6-month follow-up, boys' behaviors remained stable relative to results at closing; girls showed a slight decrease in behaviors over the same period. Findings also indicate a greater decrease in problem behaviors for participants in the 9-month versus 3-month version of FC. Conclusions: Positive effects of the FC intervention for African American children indicate the potential of this prevention intervention to avert negative behavior trajectories.

AB This study collected data five times between 1983 and 2002 from 400 participants who originally came from upstate New York. These participants completed structured interviews as did their mothers three times. LISREL analysis generally supported the hypothesized model. The results indicated that having parents who smoked and having low educational aspirations and expectations were associated with being unconventional, which, in turn, was related to having low emotional control and reporting more internalizing behaviors. Internalizing behaviors were directly associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation, as was parental smoking. Research and clinical implications are discussed and the limitations noted.

AB Background: Different diagnostic interviews in child and adolescent psychiatry have been developed in English but valid translations of instruments to other languages are still scarce especially in developing countries, limiting the comparison of child mental health data across different cultures. The present study aims to examine the convergent validity of the Brazilian version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children/Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) by comparison with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a parental screening measure for child/adolescent emotional/behavior problems.
   Methods: An experienced child psychiatrist blind to CBCL results applied the K-SADS-PL to a consecutive sample of 78 children (6-14 years) referred to a public child mental health outpatient clinic (response rate = 75%). Three K-SADS-PL parameters were considered regarding current disorders: parent screen interview rates, clinician summary screen interview rates, and final DSM IV diagnoses. Subjects were classified according to the presence/absence of any affective/anxiety disorder, any disruptive disorder, and any psychiatric disorder based on K-SADS-PL results. All subjects obtained T-scores on CBCL scales (internalizing, externalizing, total problems).
   Results: Significant differences in CBCL mean T-scores were observed between disordered and non-disordered children. Compared to children who screened negative, children positive for any affective/anxiety disorder, any disruptive disorder, and any psychiatric disorder had a higher internalizing, externalizing and total problem T-score mean, respectively. Highly significant differences in T-score means were also found when examining final diagnoses, except for any affective/anxiety disorder.
   Conclusions: Evidence of convergent validity was found when comparing K-SADS-PL results with CBCL data.

AB Witnessed violence has significant negative consequences for youth behavior and mental health. However, many findings on the impact of witnessed violence have been based on a single informant. There is a general lack of consistency between caregiver and youth reports on both witnessed violence and behavioral problems. This study included data from both caregivers and youth and incorporated a multisource analytic approach to simultaneously examine the association between youth witnessed violence and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Data from 875 caregivers and 812 youth were collected as part of the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Findings showed that youth reported more witnessed violence than did their caregivers, and caregivers reported more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems than did youth. Further, the source of information had a significant impact on the association between witnessed violence and internalizing behaviors. These findings highlight the need to incorporate multiple sources and multi-informant analytic techniques to eliminate methodological limitations to understanding the effect of witnessed violence on youth behavioral problems.

AB Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) to prevent mental health problems in parentally bereaved youths and their parents 6 years later.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Arizona State University Prevention Research Center from November 2002 to July 2005.
   Participants: Two hundred eighteen bereaved youths (89.34% of 244 enrolled in the trial 6 years earlier) and 113 spousally bereaved parents.
   Interventions: The FBP includes 12 group sessions for caregivers and youths; the literature control (LC) condition includes bereavement books for youths and caregivers.
   Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of youths in the FBP and LC on a measure of mental disorder diagnosis, 5 measures of mental health problems, and 4 measures of competent functioning; and comparisons of spousally bereaved parents on 2 measures of mental health problems.
   Results: Youths in the FBP as compared with those in the LC had significantly lower externalizing problems as reported by caregivers and youths (adjusted mean, -0.06 vs 0.13, respectively; P = .02) and on teacher reports of externalizing problems (adjusted mean, 52.69 vs 56.27, respectively; P = .001) and internalizing problems (adjusted mean, 47.29 vs 56.27, respectively; P = .002), and they had higher self-esteem (adjusted mean, 33.93 vs 31.91, respectively; P = .005). Parents in the FBP had lower depression scores than those in the LC (adjusted mean, 5.48 vs 7.83, respectively; P = .04). A significant moderated program effect indicated that for youths with lower baseline problems, the rate of diagnosed mental disorder was lower for those in the FBP than in the LC.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates efficacy of the FBP to reduce mental health problems of bereaved youths and their parents 6 years later.

AB In a longitudinal dataset of 470 Dutch adolescents, the current study examined the ways in which early sexual initiation was related to subsequent attachment, self-perception, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. For male adolescents, analyses revealed general attachment to mother and externalizing problems at Wave 1 to predict to early transition at Wave 2. However, there was no differential change in these psychosocial factors over time for early initiators of sexual intercourse and their non-initiating peers. For female adolescents, the model including psychosocial factors at Wave 1 did not predict to sexual initiation at Wave 2. However, univariate repeated measures analyses revealed early initiators to have significantly larger increases in self-concept and externalizing problems than their non-initiating female peers. While the difference between female early initiators and non-initiators were statistically significant, the mean levels of problem behaviors were very low. The findings suggest that, contrary to previous research, early sexual initiation does not seem to be clustered with problem behaviors for this sample of Dutch adolescents.

AB This mixed method study examines the mental health and experiences of physical aggression in 41 children aged six to 14 years from rural families involved with methamphetamine misuse and the child welfare system. Each child was seen for a minimum of 3 h total by experienced clinicians on at least three sessions conducted at the child's home. Fifty percent of children scored in the clinical range (98th percentile and above) on externalizing and 26% on aggression scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). More girls (75%) scored in the clinical range on CBCL externalizing behaviors than did boys (32%). During individual, semi-structured interviews, 17 children spontaneously produced 58 narratives of past physical aggression. These were primarily set at home and involved adults and the children themselves. Children primarily attributed physical aggression to anger and adult substance misuse, and described negative outcomes of the aggression. In contrast, a subgroup of girls with clinically significant levels of CBCL externalizing behaviors characterized their own physical aggression as appropriate retaliation with emotionally satisfying consequences. Many of these girls also scored in the clinically significant range on CBCL internalizing behaviors and total problems. Clinicians who collected the data expressed concern about these girls, in particular because they were ostracized from non delinquent peer groups, viewed others' continuing physical aggression against them as an inevitable part of their future, and described their own physical aggression as unavoidably driven by that violence. The perspectives of this subgroup of girls are elaborated through a case study of a physically aggressive 12-year-old. Implications for intervention are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine behavioral outcomes in an out of home placement depending on whether youth's ethnicity was congruent with the ethnicity of the caregiver (family teacher). It was hypothesized that African American children in transracial out of home placements would exhibit significantly more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems compared to either Caucasian children in transracial out of home placements, or African American or Caucasian children placed with the same race caregivers. Results provide support for hypotheses related to some youth externalizing behaviors, while hypotheses regarding youth internalizing behaviors were not supported. We discuss the need to consider the ethnicity congruence between out of home placement caregivers and youth. Additionally, the results of this study reflect the need for caregiver training in multicultural competence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using the first four waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this article examined the effects of mothers who experienced domestic violence at Year 1 on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems of children at Year 5 and investigated whether maternal mental health and parenting at Year 3 mediated those effects. Findings from structural equation modeling showed partial support for the hypothesized mediation effects. Consistent with the spillover hypothesis, domestic violence at Year 1 had a direct effect on maternal mental health at Year 3, which had direct effects on children's externalizing behavior problems at Year 5. Likewise, domestic violence at Year 1 had direct effects on parenting behavior and spanking at Year 3, and both parenting behavior and spanking then had direct effects on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at Year 5. Domestic violence at Year 1 had direct effects on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at Year 5. These results suggest that there are long-term effects of domestic violence on the behavior problems of preschool-aged children and that early interventions are needed to prevent later problems among children in families experiencing domestic violence.

AB Despite emerging evidence for the central role of emotion dysregulation in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), little is known about the factors that may increase the risk for this dysregulation. One factor that may be worth investigating is childhood abuse, previously found to be associated with both emotion dysregulation and GAD. To begin to explore the interrelationships among these phenomena, the present study examined the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship between various forms of childhood abuse (i.e., physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) and analogue GAD status in a sample of 396 undergraduates. Findings provided evidence for the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship between emotional abuse in particular and analogue GAD.

AB Background: Children with anxious or depressive symptoms are at risk of developing internalizing disorders and their attendant morbidity. To prevent these outcomes, school-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed, but few studies include active control conditions. We evaluated a preventive CBT program targeting internalizing symptoms relative to an activity contrast condition post-intervention and at 1-year follow-up. Methods: One thousand one hundred and thirty-nine children from Grades 3-6 from a diverse sample of schools, were screened with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and Children's Depression Inventory. Those with t>460 on either measure were offered participation in a randomized 12-week trial, school-based group CBT versus a structured after-school activity group of equal duration. We explored several therapeutic elements as potential predictors of change. Results: One hundred and forty-eight children participated (84 boys, 64 girls; 78 CBT, 70 contrast; 57% Caucasian) and 145 completed the program. Self-reported anxious and depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time (eta(2) = .15 and .133, respectively), with no group by time interaction. There was a trend toward fewer children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule at 1-year post-CBT than post-contrast (6/76 versus 12/69). Positive reinforcement of child behavior was associated with change in anxiety symptoms; checking homework was understood with change in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that children with internalizing symptoms may benefit from both school-based CBT and structured activity programs. Replication, longer follow-up, and further studies of therapeutic elements in child CBT are indicated.

AB The aim was to study the association between preschool behavioural problems and emotional symptoms in 10- to 12-year-old children. The study was based on the Aarhus Birth cohort, Denmark, and included 1,336 children. Based on the parent-administered preschool behaviour questionnaire (PBQ), we identified three not mutually exclusive preschool behavioural categories: anxious-fearful (n = 146), hyperactive-distractible (n = 98), and hostile-aggressive (n = 170). Children without any known symptoms were considered well adjusted (n = 1,000). Borderline emotional (n = 105) and emotional difficulties (n = 136) were measured at age 10-12 years with the parent-administered strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for potential confounding factors. We found that anxious-fearful behaviour and hostile-aggressive preschool behaviour were associated with twice the risk of school-age emotional difficulties. Comorbidity or confounding failed to explain these results. Hyperactive-distractible preschool behaviour was not associated with school-age emotional difficulties. Preschool anxious-fearful behaviour was associated with school-age emotional difficulties, suggesting internalizing symptom stability in some children from early childhood. Preschool hostile-aggressive behaviour was also associated with school-age emotional difficulties, which suggests transformation of one behavioural dimension into another through childhood, and the need to focus on both early internalizing difficulties and hostile-aggressive behaviour as risk factors for later internalizing difficulties.

AB Developmental trajectories in delinquency through adolescence were studied along with family and peer relationship problems. Drawing from eight waves of data over seven years, we conducted trajectory analyses with a sample of 746 students (402 girls; 344 boys). Analyzing girls and boys together, a five-class model emerged: 60% of the adolescents rarely reported delinquency; 27.7% reported low initial levels with moderate levels of delinquency over time; 6% in the late onset group reported initially low and rising levels of delinquency; 5% in the early onset group reported moderate initial levels which increased and then decreased in later adolescence. A small group of only boys (1.3%) labeled chronic reported high initial levels of delinquency that increased over time. Group comparisons revealed problems in internalizing, parent and peer relationship problems. The findings provide direction for early identification and interventions to curtail the development of delinquency.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare interpretive biases (i.e., the tendency to interpret neutral stimuli in a negative way) and judgment biases (i.e., a lowered estimate of one's ability to cope with a threatening situation) in clinically anxious youth (n = 24) with a demographically matched group of non-referred youth (n = 48). Interpretive biases were assessed with the Children's Negative Cognitive Error Questionnaire (CNCEQ) and judgment biases were assessed with the Anxiety Control Questionnaire-child form (ACQ-C). Results indicated that (1) children in the clinic sample exhibited significantly more negative interpretive biases and less positive judgment biases relative to the control sample, (2) the ACQ-C demonstrated incremental validity over the CNCEQ in predicting diagnostic status, (3) the ACQ-C predicted diagnostic status while controlling for Generalized Anxiety Disorder symptoms and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms, (4) the relationship between the CNCEQ and diagnostic status was moderated by age and gender. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed to highlight suggestions for future research and clinical practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We conducted a pilot study of the initial development of a self-report measure assessing how adolescents react when parents respond in a helpful manner to their sad emotional experiences. Participants were late adolescents (ages 18-20) attending a large, racially diverse urban university (N = 86; 75% women; 46% racial/ethnic minority). A broad range of relationship-oriented literatures (e.g., early childhood and marital) were considered in creating items for the Adolescent Reactions to Parents (ARP) scale. A 3 factor solution (Accepting, Avoidant, and Attacking) appeared to provide the most parsimonious fit to the data. Adequate levels of reliability were observed for each of the three ARP subscales. Zero-order correlations among subscales of the ARP were moderate in strength. Findings indicated that participants who reported more avoidant and attacking reactions also reported more adjustment difficulties including emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression. Results suggest that the ARP scale has the potential to be a valuable tool for advancing knowledge related to the socialization of emotions.

AB Previous research demonstrates that aspects of parenting interact to influence child adjustment. We aimed to extend this research by examining parenting strategies associated with behavioral control, specifically sources of parental knowledge regarding child behavior (child disclosure, parental solicitation, parental control), as moderators of the relation between psychological control and relational and physical/verbal aggression. Our sample included 89 children (56% male), ages 9-12. Consistent with prior research on child adjustment, low child disclosure was the only source of parental knowledge associated with both relational and physical/verbal aggression. Moreover, parental solicitation moderated the association between psychological control and relational, but not physical, aggression. That is, at high levels of parental solicitation, psychological control and relational aggression were positively related, whereas at low levels of parental solicitation, psychological control and relational aggression were unrelated. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Objective:
   To examine associations between exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and clinical patterns of symptoms and disorders in preschool children.
   Method:
   Two hundred and thirteen referred and non-referred children, ages 24 to 48 months (MN = 34.9, SD = 6.7 months) were studied. Lifetime exposure to PTEs (family violence and non-interpersonal events) and recent stressful life events were assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) and Child Life Events Scale. Child psychiatric symptoms and disorders were assessed with parent-reports in the PAPA, a comprehensive, developmentally sensitive interview. Sociodemographic risk, parental anxiety and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory), and child developmental level (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) also were assessed.
   Results:
   Violence exposure was broadly associated with psychiatric status in the areas of depression, separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and conduct problems, whereas potentially traumatic non-interpersonal exposure was associated with phobic anxiety. The majority of the associations between violence exposure and preschoolers' symptoms were significant even when other key factors, including economic disadvantage and parental mood and anxiety symptoms, were controlled statistically. However, parental depressive/anxious symptoms may have partially or fully mediated the relationships between violence exposure and depressive and conduct symptoms.
   Conclusions:
   Evidence of robust associations between violence exposure and early childhood internalizing and externalizing disorders and symptoms highlights the need for longitudinal prospective research concerning neurodevelopmental mechanisms and pathways. Findings underscore the relevance of assessing trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence, to identify young children at risk.

AB Objective: In a randomized clinical trial with 111 families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder (86% mothers, 14% fathers; 86% Caucasian, 5% African-American, 3% Hispanic. 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% mixed ethnicity), changes in adolescents' (mean age = 11 years; 42% female, 58% male) coping and parents' parenting skills were examined as mediators of the effects of a family group cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Method: Changes in hypothesized mediators were assessed at 6 months, and changes in adolescents' symptoms were measured at a 12-month follow-up. Results: Significant differences favoring the family intervention compared with a written information comparison condition were found for changes in composite measures of parent-adolescent reports of adolescents' use of secondary control coping skills and direct observations of parents' positive parenting skills. Changes in adolescents' secondary control coping and positive parenting mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms, accounting for approximately half of the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. Further, reciprocal relations between children's internalizing symptoms and parenting were found from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: The present study provides the first evidence for specific mediators of a family group cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder. The identification of both coping and parenting as mediators of children's mental health outcomes suggests that these variables are important active ingredients in the prevention of mental health problems in children of depressed parents.

AB National surveys in the U.S. reveal that Latina adolescents have higher rates of suicide attempts than females of other ethnic and racial groups. Past reports indicate that the suicide attempts among Latinas are lodged within family contexts in which sociocultural and individual experiences influence parental and adolescent behaviors. To better understand the parent-adolescent relations that explain the Latina suicidal phenomenon, we examined how the high value on family unity and support, as reflected by familism, and its effects on mother-daughter mutuality (i.e., reciprocal empathy and engagement) were evident in a group of adolescent Latinas with suicide attempts and a group of adolescent Latinas without suicide attempts. Drawing from data on 169 mother-daughter dyads recruited from Latino communities in a Northeastern metropolis and who self-identified as being of Latino origin or heritage, we considered how differences in familism between mothers and daughters influenced their sense of mutuality, the adolescents' internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and suicide attempts. Results show that gaps in familism (mothers scoring higher than their daughters on the scale) predicted less mother-daughter mutuality and more externalizing behaviors in the adolescents. Also, mother-daughter mutuality was negatively related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors which, in turn, predicted suicide attempts. Findings point to further research on family interactions that raise the risk for suicidality in Latino youth, particularly to including fathers and siblings in study designs. Clinical implications point to enhancing family and dyadic communication skills focusing mutuality while observing the cultural value of familism.

AB Using a developmental psychopathology framework, this study aimed to examine changes in externalizing and internalizing problems of adolescents in foster care and to determine whether type of maltreatment, gender, and age influenced trajectories. Authors used 3 waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Growth-curve analyses of 106 adolescents aged 13-16 in foster care revealed that externalizing and internalizing problems decreased over time. Adolescents, particularly boys, placed in foster care as a result of sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect demonstrated faster decreases in externalizing problems and, similarly but to a weaker degree, internalizing problems than did those placed in foster care as a result of other forms of maltreatment.

AB Objectives: Children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) frequently report comorbid complaints such as anxiety and activity limitations. Their parents often experience heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and somatization. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these comorbid complaints in children and their parents are specific for FAP or can also be found in a community sample.
   Patients and Methods: Six hundred sixty-five schoolchildren (ages 718 years) filled out questionnaires concerning AP, activity limitations, somatic complaints, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A total of 391 of their parents filled out questionnaires concerning parental anxiety, depression, and somatization. Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed.
   Results: A total of 56.5% of the children reported AP at least once in a 2-week period. Univariate relations with AP were found for activity limitations (r = 0.392), somatic complaints (r = 0.408), 3 of 5 domains of quality of life (r ranging from -0.120 to -0.209), and symptoms of anxiety and depression (r, respectively, 0.329 and 0.361). Multivariate analyses showed only significant relations for female sex (beta = 0.230), younger age (beta = -0.077), activity limitations (beta = 0.247), somatic complaints (beta = 0.170), and depressive symptoms (beta = 0.093).
   Conclusions: Activity limitations, somatic complaints, and depressive symptoms are related to AP in the general population, whereas a reduced quality of life, anxiety, and parental internalizing problems seem specific comorbid complaints for FAP. Future research on parental internalizing problems, quality of life, and anxiety as risk factors for FAP is warranted.

AB Objectives To examine medication adherence trajectories posttransplantation and the association between adherence trajectories and self-reported internalizing symptoms in a pediatric population. Methods Multilevel modeling was used to examine internalizing symptoms and longitudinal medication adherence, as assessed by electronic monitoring, among 55 children and adolescents who received liver or kidney transplantation. Results Medication adherence generally declined over the study assessment window, and higher levels of anxiety were associated with higher and more stable patterns of medication adherence. Conclusions Anxiety may be an important factor to consider when assessing and intervening with posttransplantation medication adherence. Future research should consider the potential reactivity effects of adherence monitoring, as well as individual and family behaviors associated with anxiety that may influence adherence.

AB Childhood abuse is relatively prevalent among women and is an important risk factor for both criminal behavior and suicide-related behavior (SRB). Based on a sample of 266 female offenders, we address one theoretical and one practical issue. First, from a theoretical perspective, we assess whether internalizing (depression and anxiety) and externalizing (substance abuse and antisocial behavior) psychopathology mediate the relation between abuse on the one hand, and SRB or criminal behavior, on the other. Results indicate that externalizing problems mediate the relation between childhood abuse and both lifetime SRB (fully) and lifetime criminality (partially). Second, at a practical level, results indicate that a subscale of the Revised Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R; Hare, 1991) that assesses lifetime criminal behavior adds incremental utility to postdicting SRB, beyond the variance accounted for by self-report measures of abuse and externalizing problems. However, none of the measures including the PCL-R predicted future recidivism.

AB Objective: Although clinical studies have demonstrated smaller subcortical volumes in structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus in adults and adolescents with depressive disorders and anxiety, no study has assessed such structures in babies, long before the development of the disorders. This study examined whether the size of the "gangliothalamic ovoid" (encompassing the basal ganglia and thalamus) assessed during infancy is associated with increased internalizing problems in early childhood. Method: Cranial ultrasounds were used to assess gangliothalamic ovoid diameter and ventricular volume at 6 weeks of postnatal age; moreover, head circumference was measured. Outcome data included ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (reported by mothers and fathers) at 18 and/or 36 months. Analyses were based on a total of 651 children. Results: Smaller gangliothalamic diameter was associated with higher Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing scores at ages 18 and 36 months. Results remained significant after correcting for head circumference and were evident for the DSM-oriented subscales of anxiety problems and affective problems. Total ventricular volume was not consistently associated with Internalizing scores. Conclusions: Findings associating infant brain measurements with Child Behavior Checklist mother and father reports at two time points are consistent with previous cross-sectional reports of smaller subcortical volumes in depression. Results were not simply reflective of overall brain development, because the pattern held after adjustment for head circumference. This is the first study to point toward a biological vulnerability evident in infancy, involved in the development of internalizing problems in childhood. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

AB Background. There is growing evidence on the importance of experiences of stressful events in the development of psychopathology. This study aimed to investigate the role of stressful events in the continuity of internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as the cross-influence of these problems from early childhood to late adolescence.
   Method. Data came from a general population sample of 396 children followed from the ages of 3 to 18 years. Parent-ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 3, 5, 10 and 18 years were used. Parents also reported on the presence of stressful events between the ages of 3 and 5 years, and 5 and 10 years. Adolescent reports on stressful events over the ages of 10-18 years were used. Structural equation models were used to disentangle/analyse the role of stressful events in the development of internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results. From the age of 3 years onwards externalizing symptoms predicted experiences of stressful events. In turn, these experiences predicted later externalizing problems. Stressful events also explained part of the continuity of internalizing problems from the age of 10 years onwards, but not during childhood. From childhood onwards, cross-influences from externalizing problems to subsequent internalizing problems were found to run through stressful events. Only in adolescence cross-influences from internalizing problems to externalizing problems were found, again via stressful events.
   Conclusions. From childhood onwards to late adolescence, stressful events play a significant role in both the continuity and the co-occurrence of externalizing and internalizing problems. Theoretical and methodological implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This descriptive study examined the perceptions of a national sample of school psychologists in the United States regarding their perceived knowledge, preferred roles, and training needs in the prevention and treatment of nine prominent child and adolescent internalizing disorders. The results indicated that participants perceived the prevention of all nine internalizing disorders to be an appropriate role for school psychologists, and that they perceived the school-based treatment of particular disorders, such as school phobia/refusal, to be an appropriate role as well. A majority of the sample reported the need for some or significant additional training in all nine internalizing disorders. Limitations of the study and needs for future research are discussed.

AB This study builds upon existing research by examining whether risk indices for child psychological wellbeing behave in the same way in different types of neighborhoods. Specifically, we sought to determine if neighborhood characteristics acted to exacerbate or, alternatively, to buffer risk factors at the family and/or child level. Families with a child entering first grade in Fall 2002 were recruited from Baltimore City neighborhoods, defined as census block groups. This study included 405 children, and data came from an interview with the primary caregiver and an assessment of the first grader. The dependent variables were externalizing behavior and internalizing problems. A family risk index consisting of 13 measures, and a child risk index consisting of three measures were the main independent variables of interest. We examined the effects of these indices on child psychological well-being and behavior across two neighborhood characteristics: neighborhood potential for community involvement with children and neighborhood negative social climate. Results of multivariate analyses indicated that cumulative family risk was associated with an increase in both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Perceived negative social climate moderated the effect of family risks on behavior problems such that more risk was associated with a larger increment in both externalizing behavior problems and psychological problems for children living in high versus low risk neighborhoods. These findings further emphasize the importance of considering neighborhood context in the study of child psychological well-being. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Divorce rates increased dramatically in South Korea in recent years, raising important questions about possible effects on children. In this study, we compared South Korean early adolescents from divorced and non-divorced families on measures of psychological problems, emotional pain, and parent-child relationships. Early adolescents from divorced families reported more internalizing and lower self-esteem, but not more externalizing. They also endorsed more fears of abandonment and feelings of loss, reflecting aspects of emotional pain. Early adolescents from divorced families also rated their attachments to parents as less secure, and perceived their parents as less warm and less firm with discipline. Children fared equally well in mother and father residence, and in single and remarried families. Overall, results were remarkably similar to findings on U.S. samples, despite some important cultural differences.

AB Background: Research has shown a bi-directional relation between alcohol use and sleep regulation in adults. Much less is known about this association in early adolescents, while profound puberty-dependent transitions regarding sleep patterns take place in early adolescence. Moreover, puberty has been associated with an increase in alcohol use of adolescents.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the associations between pubertal development, sleep preference, sleep problems, and alcohol use in 431 early adolescents (mean age: 13.66). Second, it was studied whether the associations changed when controlling for adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Furthermore, we included gender as a moderator on all the associations.
   Results: Results showed that pubertal development was positively associated with sleep problems and more evening-type tendencies (e. g., favoring later bedtimes), which in turn were positively related to alcohol use. Underlying psychopathology, gender and educational level did not change these relationships.
   Conclusions: From this study, it can be concluded that both puberty and sleep regulation are important factors in explaining alcohol use in early adolescence.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between smoking behaviour, mental disorders and emotional and behavioural problems in a nationally representative sample of young people.
   Method: Data were taken from the child and adolescent component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing which assessed mental health problems in two main ways: using a fully structured interview (the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) and using the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Youth Self Report, which assess emotional and behavioural problems on a dimensional scale. The relationship between smoking and mental health problems was assessed using logistic regression.
   Results: Among young people with conduct disorder 72% had smoked in the last 30 days, 46% of young people with depressive disorder, and 38% among young people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This compared with 21% of young people with none of these disorders. Odds ratios (OR) for current smoking were consistently elevated for young people with mental health problems after adjusting for demographic and socio-economic factors across all measures of mental health used. The OR for current smoking in young people with parent-reported externalizing behaviours in the clinical range was 4.5 (95% CI: 3.1-6.8), and for young people with parent-reported internalizing problems in the clinical range the OR was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.8-4.0). Young people with mental health problems started smoking on average at a younger age, were more likely to progress to current smoking, and smoked on average a higher number of cigarettes per day.
   Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic and socio-economic factors, young people with mental health problems were more likely to start smoking, progress to daily smoking, and smoke more heavily. Mental illness is an important issue to consider in tobacco control in young people.

DE replication; socioemotional skills; motor skills; achievement
AB In their 2007 article in this journal. Duncan et al. examined 6 longitudinal data sets to gauge the links between 3 key elements of readiness at school entry (academic, attention, and socioemotional skills) and later achievement. Across all 6 data sets, the strongest predictors of later achievement were school-entry math, reading, and attention skills. Social skills and internalizing and externalizing behavior did not predict subsequent achievement, even among children with relatively high levels of problem behavior. Patterns of association were similar for boys and girls and were not moderated by socioeconomic status. The 5 articles in this section reconsider the original findings and reanalyze the data involved. Overall, the thrust of these articles confirms the original article. The articles in this section, however, do offer some new insights. In general, the articles find somewhat more support for socioemotional factors, especially for prosocial skills, but the relationships involved are very small. Perhaps the most striking new finding is the added emphasis on fine motor skills, which is the focus of 2 articles. Taken together, the articles reveal the value of reanalysis and replication in developmental psychology.

AB Duncan et al. (2007) presented a new methodology for identifying kindergarten readiness factors and quantifying their importance by determining which of children's developing skills measured around kindergarten entrance would predict later reading and math achievement. This article extends Duncan et al.'s work to identify kindergarten readiness factors with 6 longitudinal data sets. Their results identified kindergarten math and reading readiness and attention as the primary long-term predictors but found no effects from social skills or internalizing and externalizing behavior. We incorporated motor skills measures from 3 of the data sets and found that fine motor skills are an additional strong predictor of later achievement. Using one of the data sets, we also predicted later science scores and incorporated an additional early test of general knowledge of the social and physical world as a predictor. We found that the test of general knowledge was by far the strongest predictor of science and reading and also contributed significantly to predicting later math, making the content of this test another important kindergarten readiness indicator. Together, attention, fine motor skills, and general knowledge are much stronger overall predictors of later math, reading, and science scores than early math and reading scores alone.

AB This study's primary purpose was to examine the relative contribution of social-behavioral predictors to reading and math skills. The study expands on Duncan et al.'s (2007) work by using longitudinal methodology from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) databases, and by focusing on potential differences in patterns of early predictors of later reading and math trajectories for African American versus Caucasian students. Predictor measures were selected at kindergarten, and the outcomes included standardized reading and math scores obtained from Grades I. 3, 5, and 9 for the SECCYD sample, and Grades 3. 5, and 8 for the ECLS-K sample. Consistent with Duncan et al.'s findings, results reflect the relative contributions of early reading and math skills to later functioning in these respective academic domains for both samples, and there are indications for the importance of early expressive language skills to both reading and math in the SECCYD sample. Findings related to the power of social-behavioral predictors, however, are not consistent across samples. Although the SECCYD sample evidenced no such predictors, several interactions in the ECLS-K sample suggested the moderating effects of early ratings of aggressive behaviors and internalizing behaviors on later reading and math for African American students. The moderating effects of early teacher ratings of attention and internalizing behaviors for African American students as compared with Caucasian students in later math growth also were noted. The importance of early social-behavioral functions as related to later academic skills remains an important area of inquiry.

AB How and why do internalizing and externalizing problems, psychopathological problems from different diagnostic classes representing separate forms of psychopathology, co-occur in children? We investigated the development of pure and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems from ages 2 to 12 with the use of latent class growth analysis. Furthermore, we examined how early childhood factors (temperament, cognitive functioning, maternal depression, and home environment) and early adolescent social and behavioral adjustment variables were related to differential trajectories of pure and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. The sample (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care) consisted of 1,232 children (52% male). Mother reports on the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991, 1992) were used to construct the trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems. Analyses identified groups of children exhibiting pure and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. Children exhibiting continuous externalizing or continuous co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems across the 10-year period under investigation were more likely to (a) engage in risky behaviors, (b) be associated with deviant peers, (c) be rejected by peers, and (d) be asocial with peers at early adolescence. However, children exhibiting pure internalizing problems over time were only at higher risk for being asocial with peers as early adolescents. Moreover, the additive effects of individual and environmental early childhood risk factors influenced the development of chronic externalizing problems, although pure internalizing problems were uniquely influenced by maternal depression. Results also provided evidence for the concepts of equifinality and multifinality.

AB The present study investigated the role of a school-based intervention program, called the Integrated School Day, in the socioemotional development of Finnish children during their first years of school. The 3-year program involved the restructuring of the school day by adding in extracurricular activities, which were organized on school premises, included a multitude of activities according to children's wishes, and were available to every child. The longitudinal findings, based on the hierarchical linear modeling, showed that the 9- to 10-year-old children who had participated in the program (N=276) had lower levels of internalizing problem behaviors, both social anxiety and depressive symptoms, than the non-intervention comparison group (N=239). The difference was statistically significant in both genders. The results also showed that the higher number of years of participation (but not the number of different activities or the regularity of participation) was related to lower internalizing problem behaviors, particularly to lower social anxiety, at the end of the program.

AB Canadian data based on maternal reports for a nationally representative sample of 4,521 4-5-year-olds were used to examine associations among child care, family factors, and behaviors in preschool-aged children. Linear regressions testing for direct and moderated associations indicated that regulated home-based care was associated with less physical aggression and less prosocial behavior while high process quality in home-based care was associated with greater prosocial behavior. Among children in home-based settings, being in at least one additional current child care arrangement was linked with greater physical aggression, and low child care stability was linked to greater hyperactivity-inattention, internalizing behavior, and prosocial behaviors. For family factors, parenting behaviors and maternal depression were associated with greater behavioral problems while low household income was linked with greater hyperactivity-inattention among children in home-based care. There was a significant interaction between process quality and household income for physical aggression and internalizing behavior and between structure quality and parenting consistency for prosocial behavior for children in home-based care. Results suggest that child care matters for preschool behavioral outcomes, even after controlling for socio-demographic factors. High quality care appears particularly important for children in home-based care from low-income families so issues around child care quality and regulation should be considered. Findings also underscore the importance of family factors on young children's behaviors and show that child care and family influences work together to impact child outcomes.

AB The aim of this study was to explore child and adolescent personality in the Russian culture, addressing gender and age differences, and to examine personality and family effects on children's Internalizing and Externalizing problems. Parents of 1,640 Russian children aged 3-18 years completed the Inventory of Child Individual Differences measuring personality, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire measuring problem behavior, and reported about family background. Girls scored higher than boys on the Conscientiousness domain and on the Intelligent and Considerate scales, but lower on Activity. In younger children, Extraversion was higher; in older children, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Shyness were higher; Distractibility was highest in early adolescence. The gender and age differences were small. Personality explained about 30% of variance in children's Internalizing problems, and 50% in Externalizing problems; family factors contributed less than 4%. Internalizing Problems were linked to higher Neuroticism and lower Extraversion; Externalizing Problems were linked to higher Extraversion, lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. For both types of problems, harsh parenting was a risk factor, while SES and family cohesion were associated with lower problem levels. Models linking personality with children's problem behavior were similar in preschool, middle childhood, early and late adolescence.

AB Although proposed by bioecological models, there has been minimal empirical examination of whether children's individual differences moderate neighborhood effects on development. We used an urban community sample (8-12 years, N = 316) to examine interactions among neighborhood characteristics (problems and social organization) and children's temperament (fear, irritability and impulsivity) in predicting psychosocial adjustment. The main effects of neighborhood and temperament on outcomes were consistent with previous research. Findings show that development is challenging in disadvantaged neighborhoods whatever one's temperament, however, some effects of neighborhood were conditioned by temperament, particularly children's fear and irritability. Neighborhood problems were more strongly related to lower social competence for fearful and for less irritable children. Neighborhood problems were more strongly related to higher internalizing problems for low-fear children. Neighborhood social organization was more strongly related to greater social competence for low-fear children. Findings are discussed in relation to "diathesis-stress" and "differential responsiveness" models of temperament. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We compared ratings of behavior and attention problems between youth-onset psychosis and ADHD, two disorders in which attentional impairments play a key role, and examined the effect of psychostimulant use on age of onset in psychosis. Method: Parent and teacher ratings of behavioral problems and ADHD symptoms were collected using the Achenbach CBCL, TRF, and SNAP-IV Teacher Rating Scales on 42 participants with psychosis, 36 with ADHD and 57 controls (ages 8-19). Results and Conclusions: Results suggested that academic, externalizing, and attention problems reflect symptoms shared between the disorders, whereas internalizing, social and thought problems reflect factors that differ between disorders. Furthermore, participants with psychosis who had been prescribed psychostimulants had a younger age of onset of psychotic symptoms than those who had not. This difference could reflect dissimilarities in symptom severity symptom between subgroups or potentially harmful effects of psychostimulants in individuals predisposed to develop psychosis.

AB Discrepancies among informants on measures of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents are common in the literature. One reason proposed for such discrepancies is that psychopathology may distort or bias third-party reports. In the present study, measures of adolescent internalizing symptom levels were completed by adolescents aged 13 to 18 years and their mothers and fathers. Parents also completed measures of their own depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Parent symptoms explained a small amount of variance in discrepancies between informants. Specifically, mothers' depression and stress symptoms were associated with discrepancies regarding sons' symptomatology and fathers' anxiety and stress symptoms were associated with discrepancies regarding daughters' symptomatology. Implications of informant discrepancies for both clinical practice and research are discussed. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol: 66:978-995, 2010.

Weekly participation in extracurricular activities was related to better emotional and behavioral adjustment and social competence. Overall, the relations were low and different according to gender; type of activity, and informant. Better adjustment was more related to participation in sports activities in boys and to participation in nonsports activities in girls. Size effect was higher for girls and decreased for both boys and girls when parental education and parenting practices were considered. Findings supported previous results obtained in American adolescents. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study tests the hypothesis that 6-year longitudinal stability of behavioral and emotional problems would be greater for children ages 6 to 7 than for those ages 4 to 5 at Time 1. Six-year outcome data for a nationally representative sample of 4- to 7-year-olds (N = 733) were used to examine longitudinal stability of internalizing, externalizing, social, and attention problems. Six-year correlations were high for both age groups, with only 1 of 12 comparisons showing a significant age difference. About 80% of the children maintained their status as deviant versus nondeviant from Time 1 to Time 3 for all problems assessed. The best predictors of Time 3 problem scores were Time 1 and Time 2 scores on the same scale, and age group had no significant effect on regression results. These data suggest that longitudinal stability of behavioral and emotional problems is as strong for children ages 4 to 5 as for children ages 6 to 7 at Time 1.

AB Objective To conduct a meta-analytic review of psychosocial adjustment of youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods Nineteen studies with a total of 1167 youth with IBD (M age = 14.33, 50% female) were included. Effect size (ES) estimates were calculated for anxiety symptoms & disorders, depressive symptoms & disorders, internalizing symptoms & disorders, externalizing symptoms, quality of life (QOL), social functioning, and self-esteem. Separate ESs were calculated for comparisons between IBD and youth with chronic illnesses versus healthy youth. Results Youth with IBD had higher rates of depressive disorders and internalizing disorders than youth with other chronic conditions. Youth with IBD had higher parent-reported internalizing symptoms, lower parent- and youth-reported QOL, and lower youth-reported social functioning compared to healthy youth. Conclusions Clinical attention to depressive disorders, QOL, and social functioning may be particularly salient in the context of pediatric IBD.

ID ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES
AB Recent empirical research has found that children's noncognitive skills play a critical role in their own success, young children's behavioral and psychological disorders can severely harm their future outcomes, and disruptive students harm the behavior and learning of their classmates. Yet relatively little is known about wide-scale interventions designed to improve children's behavior and mental health. This is the first nationally representative study of the provision, financing, and impact of school-site mental health services for young children. Elementary school counselors are school employees who provide mental health services to all types of students, typically meeting with students one-on-one or in small groups. Given counselors' nonrandom assignment to schools, it is particularly challenging to estimate the impact of these counselors on student outcomes. First, cross-state differences in policies provide descriptive evidence that students in states with more aggressive elementary counseling policies make greater test score gains and are less likely to report internalizing or externalizing problem behaviors compared to students with similar observed characteristics in similar schools in other states. Next, difference-in-differences estimates exploiting both the timing and the targeted grade levels of states' counseling policy changes provide evidence that elementary counselors substantially influence teachers' perceptions of school climate. The adoption of state-funded counselor subsidies or minimum counselor-student ratios reduces the fraction of teachers reporting that their instruction suffers due to student misbehavior and reduces the fractions reporting problems with students physically fighting each other, cutting class, stealing, or using drugs. These findings imply that there may be substantial public and private benefits derived from providing additional elementary school counselors.

AB Background. The purpose of the following article was to examine: (a) body mass index (BM!) in survivors of childhood brain tumors; (b) the association of BMI with social competence and cognitive functioning; and (c) congruency in reporting of survivors' social competence by the survivors, parents, and teachers. Procedure. Fifty-four survivors of childhood brain tumors (32 males) 8-18 years participated. BMI-for-age percentiles and BMI Z-scores (SDS) were calculated and survivors were categorized as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, using established criteria. Informants completed measures of social competence and internalizing behaviors. Survivors also completed a test of self-perception and cognitive functioning (IQ). Results. Survivors were more underweight (15% vs. 4%), and less overweight (17% vs. 31%) than population norms (chi(2) = 38.62, P < 0.001). Parents perceived lower social competence in survivors that were underweight, had lower verbal IQ, and higher internalizing behaviors (P <0.05). A significant interaction between BMI-for-age and IQ on self-perception of close friendships suggested that survivors with lower weight and lower IQ perceived having fewer close friendships (P <0.05). Congruency among the three informants was moderate. Conclusions. Survivors of childhood brain tumors are at increased risk for underweight. Underweight status is related to lower parent reported social competence and survivors' self-perception of fewer close friendships in the presence of low IQ. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010;55:532-539.

AB Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been observed in association with internalizing symptoms and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression and some anxiety disorders. This study examined basal and stress-induced cortisol concentrations in relation to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a racially mixed community sample of 102 8-11-year-old boys. Afternoon basal cortisol concentrations were positively correlated with measures of internalizing behavior problems, social problems, and emotionality. Greater change in cortisol across a home-visit challenge task was also significantly associated with internalizing behaviors and social problems, as well as attention and thought problems. The implications of these findings and how they may relate to the pathogenesis of emotional and behavioral problems are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims at providing qualitative and quantitative evidence on the relevance of two broadly used mental health self-report measures-Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist 37 for Adolescents (HSCL-37A)-for use in Eastern Democratic of Congo, as no psychological assessment instruments were available for this region. We therefore describe an apt procedure to adapt and translate standard screening instruments in close collaboration with the local community, feasible under challenging conditions in emergency settings.
   Focus groups and interviews with community key figures in psychosocial care were employed to ensure local validity of the adaptation and translation process. Consequently, the questionnaires' internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and construct validity (principal component analysis, testing of theoretical assumptions) were assessed based on a clustered school-based community survey among 1,046 adolescents (13-21 years) involving 13 secondary schools in the Ituri district in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
   Key-informant qualitative data confirmed face and construct validity of all IES-R and all HSCL-37A anxiety items. Additional culture-specific symptoms of adolescent mental ill-health were added to enhance local relevance of the HSCL-37A depression and externalizing subscales. Quantitative analysis of the survey data revealed adequate internal consistency and construct validity of both adapted measures, yet weaker results for the externalizing scale. Furthermore, it confirmed the internalizing/externalizing factor structure of the HSCL-37A and the theoretically deviating intrusion/arousal versus active avoidance factor structure for the IES-R.
   Community-based adaptation can extend the validity and local relevance of mental health screening in emergency and low-income settings. The availability of adequate Swahili and Congolese French adaptations of the IES-R and HSCL-37A could stimulate the assessment of psychosocial needs in war-exposed Eastern Congolese adolescents.

AB The purpose of the current study was to develop and test a transactional model, based on longitudinal data, capable to describe the existing interrelation between maternal behavior and child bullying and victimization experiences over time. The results confirmed the existence of such a model for bullying, but not for victimization in terms of maternal involvement, although a transactional relationship was supported for both bullying and victimization when considering conflict between parents and children. More specifically, the study's results show that maternal involvement, including monitoring, predicts negatively both the initial value of bullying and its degree of change over time. In other words, the more a parent is involved, and the closer her supervision is, the less possible it is for her child to participate in bullying others activity. Moreover, the findings show that increases in bullying behavior on the part of the child cause a reduction in maternal involvement and monitoring over time. Finally, initial conflict between parents and children influence both bullying and victimization, and in turn, the development of bullying and victimization affects parent-child conflict. Hence, the findings of this study offer support to the hypothesis that parental and child behavior reciprocally influence each other, rather than one shaping the other in a unidirectional fashion.

TI Design of an internet-based health economic evaluation of a preventive

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

ID COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER; EUROQOL
AB Background: Preventive interventions are developed for children of parents with mental and substance use disorders (COPMI), because these children have a higher risk of developing a psychological or behavioral disorder in the future. Mental health and substance use disorders contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. Although the exact number of parents with a mental illness is unclear, the subject of mentally ill parents is gaining attention. Moreover there is a lack of interventions for COPMI-children, as well of (cost-) effectiveness studies evaluating COPMI interventions. Innovative interventions such as e-health provide a new field for exploration. There is no knowledge about the opportunities for using the internet to prevent problems in children at risk. In the current study we will focus on the (cost-) effectiveness of an online health prevention program for COPMI-children.
   Methods/Design: We designed a randomized controlled trial to examine the (cost-) effectiveness of the Kopstoring intervention. Kopstoring is an online intervention for COPMI-children to strengthen their coping skills and prevent behavioral and psychological problems. We will compare the Kopstoring intervention with (waiting list) care as usual. This trial will be conducted entirely over the internet. An economic evaluation, from a societal perspective will be conducted, to examine the trial's cost-effectiveness. Power calculations show that 214 participants are needed, aged 16-25. Possible participants will be recruited via media announcements and banners on the internet. After screening and completing informed consent procedures, participants will be randomized. The main outcome is internalizing and externalizing symptoms as measured by the Youth Self Report. For the economic evaluation, healthcare costs and costs outside the healthcare sector will be measured at the same time as the clinical measures, at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. An extended measure for the intervention group will be provided at 12 months, to examine the long-term effects. In addition, a process evaluation will be conducted.
   Discussion: Recent developments, such as international conferences and policy discussions, show the pressing need to study the (cost-) effectiveness of interventions for vulnerable groups of children. This study will shed light on the (cost-) effectiveness of an online preventive intervention.

AB Aims
   To examine the longitudinal associations in both directions between mental health and substance use in adolescence.
   Design
   Three-year longitudinal cohort.
   Setting
   Britain (nationally representative sample).
   Participants
   3607 youths aged 11-16 years at baseline.
   Measurements
   Externalizing and internalizing mental health problems were measured using brief questionnaires (parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and diagnostic interviews, including clinician-rated diagnoses of mental disorder. Substance use was measured by youth self-report, and included regular smoking, frequent alcohol consumption, regular cannabis use and ever taking other illicit drugs.
   Findings
   Externalizing (specifically behavioural) problems at baseline independently predicted all forms of substance use, with a particularly strong effect on smoking. In all cases this association showed a dose-response relationship. In contrast, although internalizing problems had a strong univariable association with smoking, this disappeared after adjusting for comorbid externalizing problems. There was little or no evidence that baseline substance use predicted mental health at follow-up.
   Conclusions
   Externalizing problems predict adolescent substance use, and adjusting for comorbid externalizing problems is vital when investigating the effects of internalizing problems. A dose-response effect of externalizing problems is seen across the full range. Programmes seeking to prevent adolescent substance use by reducing externalizing problems may therefore wish to consider population-wide interventions rather than targeting individuals only at the negative extreme.

AB The need to make meaning of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is common and often persists long after the abuse ends. Although believed to be essential for healthy recovery, there is a paucity of research on how youth process their CSA experiences. The current study identified individual differences in the ways youth process their CSA and examined associations with psychosocial adjustment. A sample of 108 youth with confirmed abuse histories enrolled in the study within 8 weeks of abuse discovery, when they were between 8 and 15 years old. Six years later, they participated in interviews about their CSA experiences, reactions, and perceived effects. Using a coding system developed for this study, youths' CSA narratives were reliably classified with one of three processing strategies: Constructive (13.9%), Absorbed (50%), or Avoidant (36.1%). Absorbed youth reported the highest levels of psychopathological symptoms, sexual problems, and abuse-specific stigmatization, whereas Constructive youth tended to report the fewest problems. Avoidant youth showed significantly more problems than Constructive youth in some but not all areas. Interventions that build healthy processing skills may promote positive recovery by providing tools for constructing adaptive meanings of the abuse, both in its immediate aftermath and over time.

AB Ostensible psychiatric comorbidity can sometimes be explained by shared relations between diagnostic constructs and higher order internalizing and externalizing dimensions. However, this possibility has not been explored with regard to comorbidity between personality pathology and other clinical constructs in adolescents. In this study, personality pattern scales from the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory in a sample of 492 adolescent inpatients were subjected to a principal components analysis to yield oblique internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Relations between personality dimensions and well-established measures of psychopathology (depression, alcohol abuse, drug abuse) and other indicators of clinical dysfunction (self-esteem, suicidality, violence) were assessed before and after controlling for these higher-order personality dimensions. Associations between personality scales and indicators of psychopathology and clinical dysfunction were minimal with these higher order components controlled. These results suggest that internalizing and externalizing personality dimensions explain most of the associations between personality patterns and indicators of psychopathology and clinical dysfunction in adolescent patients.

AB Adolescent Latinas continue to report higher levels of suicide attempts than their African-American and White peers. The phenomenon is still not understood and is theorized to be the result of the confluence of many cultural, familial, and individual level factors. In Latino cultures, belief in the importance of the family, the value known as familism, appears to protect youth's emotional and behavioral health, but parent-adolescent conflict has been found to be a risk factor for suicide attempts. The role of familism in relation to parent-adolescent conflict, self-esteem, internalizing behaviors, and suicide attempts has not been studied extensively. To address this question, we interviewed 226 adolescent Latinas, 50% of whom had histories of suicide attempts. Using path analysis, familism as a cultural asset was associated with lower levels of parent-adolescent conflict, but higher levels of internalizing behaviors, while self-esteem and internalizing behaviors mediated the relationship between parent-adolescent conflict and suicide attempts. Our findings point to the importance of family involvement in culturally competent suicide prevention and intervention programs. Reducing parent-daughter conflict and fostering closer family ties has the added effect of improving self-esteem and shrinking the likelihood of suicide attempts.

AB This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis of the treatment outcome studies of different types of psychotherapeutic approaches for adults sexually abused as children. There were 44 studies included comprising 59 treatment conditions, and most of the studies aimed to treat the psychological effects of childhood sexual abuse. Separate meta-analyses were conducted according to study design and outcome domain, in keeping with meta-analytic conventions. For most outcome domains, there was remarkable consistency in overall effect sizes across study design. Effect sizes were predominantly of moderate magnitude for post-traumatic stress disorder or trauma symptoms (g=0.72-0.77), internalizing symptoms (g=0.68-0.72), externalizing symptoms (g=0.41-0.53), self-esteem (g=0.56-0.58), and global functioning or symptoms (g=0.57-0.60). Studies measuring interpersonal functioning outcomes had inconsistent effect sizes across study design. Effects were largely maintained at follow-up, although relatively few studies provided follow-up data. A number of moderating variables were examined given the inherent heterogeneity of the studies. Moderator analysis revealed a variety of variables, particularly treatment characteristics, that were associated with better outcomes. However, different variables were identified for the diverse outcomes that were measured, emphasizing the importance of moderator analysis in looking beyond overall treatment effects to ascertain specific elements that confer additional benefit in therapy for the diverse psychological effects of child sexual abuse.

AB Research suggests that anxiety sensitivity is an important cognitive developmental precursor of anxiety disorders. Identifying the developmental origins of anxiety sensitivity may be facilitated by multiple perspective assessment (parents, children) coupled with an understanding of agreement in reporting. In general, disagreement between parent and youth ratings of the child's emotions is common but is not well understood. Variables such as age and gender have been suggested as potential factors that influence agreement; however, this literature often produces inconsistent results. This study examined parent reports of their children's anxiety sensitivity in order to explore the effects of age, sex, and ethnicity on cross informant associations with child reports using complementary statistical models. Parents and children (N = 202, aged 6-17 years) completed child and parent versions of the childhood anxiety sensitivity index [CASI (child) and CASI-P (parent)] as well as instruments assessing fears and manifest anxiety. Results indicated that the CASI-P demonstrated internal consistency, test-retest associations, incremental and concurrent validity estimates similar to those previously reported for the self report instrument. Moreover, reliability and validity were highly similar across age and child sex. However, age and ethnicity were found to significantly influence cross informant associations, and the statistical method used to examine cross informant associations produced differing conclusions. Results are discussed in terms of the utility of a parent report measure of anxiety sensitivity and implications of the differing statistical methods for clarifying the existing research on informant agreement in internalizing symptoms.

AB In a sample of 18-, 30-, and 42-month-olds, the relations among parenting, effortful control (EC), and maladjustment were examined. Parenting was assessed with mothers' reports and observations; EC was measured with mothers' and caregivers' reports, as well as a behavioral task; and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed with parents' and caregivers' reports. Although 18-month unsupportive (vs. supportive) parenting negatively predicted EC at 30 months, when the stability of these variables was taken into account; there was no evidence of additional potentially causal relations between these two constructs. Although EC was negatively related to both internalizing and externalizing problems within all three ages as well as across 1 year, EC did not predict maladjustment once the stability of the constructs and within time covariation between the constructs were taken into account. In addition, externalizing problems at 30 months negatively predicted EC at 42 months, and internalizing problems at 30 months positively predicted EC at 42 months, but only when the effects of externalizing on EC were controlled. The findings are discussed in terms of the reasons for the lack of causal relations over time.

AB Existing longitudinal research on the interplay between externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and academic and social competence has documented "cascading" effects from early aggressive/disruptive behavior through impairments in competence, leading to symptoms of depression and anxiety. The primary aim of the current study was to replicate such work using the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development while also extending the developmental window of investigation of cascades back into early childhood. Participating families (N = 1,160) completed questionnaire measure's of externalizing, internalizing, and social competence (maternal report), as well as individual assessment of academic achievement, spanning five time points from age 54 months through age 15 years. A series of nested structural equation models tested predicted links across various domains of competence and psychopathology. Results were consistent with prior research, demonstrating cross-domain effects from early externalizing problems through effects on both academic and social competence into later internalizing problems. Effects held across gender and were largely unaffected by inclusion of socioeconomic status, early caregiving, and early cognitive ability as covariates in the model.

AB A developmental cascade model linking symptoms of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology through three indices of peer relational difficulty (peer rejection, peer victimization, friendedness) was tested in a general population sample of 653 children followed annually from kindergarten to fourth grade. Rejection and victimization linked kindergarten externalizing problems with fourth-grade internalizing problems. Transactional links between rejection and victimization were found. In addition, peer rejection added to the development of externalizing problems. Friendedness did not add to the development of externalizing or internalizing problems. Cascade paths were similar for boys and girls. Over the period of kindergarten to fourth grade, psychopathology and peer relations become entangled, and the dynamic interplay between multiple manifestations of poor peer relations ultimately adds to the development of both externalizing and internalizing problems and their cross-time relation. Implications for research and prevention are discussed.

AB This study examined developmental processes linking competence and psychopathology in an urban sample of girls during their transition to adolescence. Longitudinal associations among indices of externalizing symptom, social competence, and internalizing symptoms were also tested within contexts of family adversity and girls' pubertal status. Child, parent, and teacher report were employed to assess core constructs across six annual assessment waves, starting at age 9. Results revealed the significant effect of prior levels of externalizing symptoms on changes in social competence and internalizing symptoms, as well as reciprocal relations between social competence and internalizing symptoms. In addition, girl's maladaptive functioning predicted increases in family adversity exposure over time. Last, more mature pubertal status in early assessment waves was linked to an increase in internalizing symptoms; however, this association was reversed by the last assessment, when most girls had reached advance stages of puberty. The timing of these effects reveals important targets for future interventions aimed at promoting the successful adaptation of girls in adolescence.

AB The current study was initiated to increase understanding of developmental cascades in childhood in a sample of at-risk boys (N = 291; 52% White). Mothers, teachers, and boys reported on boys externalizing problems, internalizing difficulties, and academic competence. Consistent with hypotheses regarding school-related transitions, high levels of externalizing problems were associated with both low levels of academic competence and high levels of internalizing problems during the early school-age period, and with elevations in internalizing problems during the transition to adolescence. Low levels of academic competence were associated with high levels of internalizing problems in middle childhood, and with high levels of externalizing problems during the transition from elementary school to middle school. Shared risk factors played a minimal role in these developmental cascades. Results suggest that there are cascading effects of externalizing problems and academic competence in childhood and early adolescence, and that some cascading effects are more likely to occur during periods of school-related transitions. Implications of developmental cascade effects for research and intervention are discussed.

Analyses showed that childhood conduct problems predicted adolescent conduct problems and risk taking, which in turn, predicted adult conduct problems, health risks, depression, and service use. Childhood family adversity predicted adolescent internalizing, a predictor itself of poor health, depression, and service use at age 27. There was considerable continuity in the same adult outcomes measured over a 3-year period, as well as some cross-domain prediction from variables at age 27 to measures at age 30. Developmental patterns found in these data offer implications for future research and prevention.

AB It is unclear whether subclinical autistic traits at very young age are transient or stable, and have clinical relevance. This study investigated the relationship between early subclinical autistic traits and the occurrence of later developmental and behavioural problems as well as problems in cognitive and language functioning. Parents of infants aged 14-15 months from the general population completed the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire (ESAT). Three groups of children with high, moderate, and low ESAT-scores (total n = 103) were selected. Follow-up assessments included the CBCL 1A1/2-5 at age 3 years, and the SCQ, the ADI-R, the ADOS-G, a non-verbal intelligence test, and language tests for comprehension and production at age 4-5 years. None of the children met criteria for autism spectrum disorder at follow-up. Children with high ESAT-scores at 14-15 months showed significantly more internalizing and externalizing problems at age 3 years and scored significantly lower on language tests at age 4-5 years than children with moderate or low ESAT-scores. Further, significantly more children with high ESAT-scores (14/26, 53.8%) than with moderate and low ESAT-scores (5/36, 13.9% and 1/41, 2.4%, respectively) were in the high-risk/clinical range on one or more outcome domains (autistic symptoms, behavioural problems, cognitive and language abilities). Subclinical autistic traits at 14-15 months predict later behavioural problems and delays in cognitive and language functioning rather than later ASD-diagnoses. The theoretical implications of the findings lie in the pivotal role of early social and communication skills for the development of self-regulation of emotions and impulses. The practical implications bear on the early recognition of children at risk for behavioural problems and for language and cognitive problems.

AB This study investigated child, caregiver, and caseworker factors associated with greater use of family support services by immigrant families in the U.S. child welfare system. Among child factors, higher levels of internalizing behavior problems (Odds Ratio (O.R.) = 3.60), externalizing behavior problems (O.R. = 2.62) and a history of neglect (O.R. = 4.23) were associated with greater family support service use. Among caregiver factors, prior reports of maltreatment (O.R. = 6.77), a serious mental health problem of the caregiver (O.R. = 6.86), cognitive impairments (O.R. = 10.46) in the primary caregiver, the primary caregivers' history of arrests (O.R. = 6.47) and domestic violence (O.R. = 2.87), were associated with heavy service use. Caseworkers' training on cultural issues (O.R. = 61.35), their concerns over bureaucracy (O.R. = 25.38) and concern over rules and regulations (O.R. = 6.08) were also associated with greater service use among immigrant families. This research suggests that use of family support services may be determined not only by the family's demographic factors and risk level but also by caseworkers' training in cultural competence and their perception of organizational problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to: (1) examine symptom levels of anxiety and depression in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFASDs) compared with matched control children using child self-reports and parent ratings; and (2) examine source differences within the two condition groups. An overall multivariate effect indicated significantly elevated depression and anxiety symptoms for children with HFASDs based on parent reports; however no significant between-group differences based on child self-reports. Within-condition source comparisons (parent vs. child) revealed a significant multivariate effect indicating a significant difference in symptoms of depression and anxiety for the HFASD group but none for the control. Correlations between parent and child reports for the HFASD group suggested some positive association between child-reports and parent-reports for depressive symptoms only; however, the difference in average scores reflected a substantial discrepancy in the magnitude of symptoms by rater. Implications for clinical assessment and future research are provided.

   BIASES
AB Cognitive models of psychopathology posit that the content or focus of information-processing biases (e.g., intentional biases) is disorder specific: Depression is hypothesized to be characterized by attentional biases specifically for depression-relevant stimuli (e.g., sad facial expressions), whereas anxiety should relate particularly to attentional biases to threat-relevant stimuli (e.g., angry faces). However, little research has investigated this specificity hypothesis and none with a sample of youths. The present study examined attentional biases to emotional faces (sad, angry, and happy compared with neutral) in groups of pure depressed, pure anxious, comorbid depressed and anxious, and control youths (ages 9-17 years; N = 161). Consistent with cognitive models, pure depressed and pure anxious youths exhibited attentional biases specifically to sad and angry faces, respectively, whereas comorbid youths exhibited attentional biases to both facial expressions. In addition, control youths exhibited attentional avoidance of sad faces, and comorbid boys avoided happy faces. Overall, findings suggest that cognitive biases and processing of particular emotional information are specific to pure clinical depression and anxiety, and results inform etiological models of potentially specific processes that are associated with internalizing disorders among youths.

AB Introduction: The impact of internalizing comorbid disorders on cognitive functions in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is hardly understood. While inconsistent findings exist with respect to the modulating effect of anxiety on impulsivity in ADHD, only few neuropsychological studies focused on other attention parameters. This is the first study that examines the influence of anxiety disorders (ANX) on ADHD in a model-oriented approach including selectivity and intensity parameters of attention.
   Methods: Children with ADHD, ADHD + ANX and healthy controls (n = 34 for each group, all aged 8-15 years) participated in five neuropsychological tasks (alertness, sustained attention, divided attention, go/no-go and set-shifting). Group differences were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each dependent variable, with group as independent variable.
   Results: Data indicated that children with ADHD performed worse than healthy controls with regard to almost all parameters of attention. While ANX had no mitigating effect on impulsivity in ADHD, performance in sustained attention and selective attention tasks of children with ADHD + ANX was better than that of children with ADHD only.
   Limitations: Since the present data were derived from a large neuropsychological data base which focused primary on children with ADHD and different comorbidities no comparison to a "pure" ANX group was possible.
   Conclusions: These findings might indicate that ADHD + ANX constitute a cognitively distinct subtype, with possible individual symptomatology, development and therapeutic needs. Further investigations are needed to clarify the specificity of these findings and to disentangle the impact of trait versus state anxiety on neuropsychological performance in children with ADHD.

AB Variability in the social and behavioral characteristics of students with emotional disturbance (ED) in the public schools may impact special education effectiveness; yet very little evidence exists on how such variability may express itself from school to school. One place to begin such investigation involves school context as expressed by income level and academic performance. In this study, we selected 140 children (grades kindergarten through 6) receiving special education services for ED in schools in a large east-coast urban area. We gathered school-wide test results from state achievement testing and school poverty levels from eligibility for free or reduced lunch on each school. For each child, we collected teacher ratings of problem behavior and social skills. Findings from regression analyses revealed significant relationships between school context and children's externalizing and internalizing behavior. We discuss the implications of these findings for the concept of ED as a unitary disability category in special education research and practice.

AB Background:
   Violence exposure within each setting of community, school, or home has been linked with internalizing and externalizing problems. Although many children experience violence in multiple contexts, the effects of such cross-contextual exposure have not been studied. This study addresses this gap by examining independent and interactive effects of witnessing violence and victimization in the community, home, and school on subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems in early adolescence.
   Methods:
   A community sample of 603 boys and girls (78% African American, 20% Caucasian) participated in a longitudinal study of youth violence. During two assessments 16 months apart, adolescents reported on witnessing violence and victimization in the community, school, and home, and their internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results:
   Multiple regressions tested the independent and interactive effects of witnessing violence or victimization across contexts on subsequent adjustment, after controlling for initial levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and demographic covariates. Witnessing violence at school predicted anxiety and depression; witnessing at home was related to anxiety and aggression; and witnessing community violence predicted delinquency. Victimization at home was related to subsequent anxiety, depression, and aggression; victimization at school predicted anxiety; and victimization in the community was not independently related to any outcomes. Finally, witnessing violence at home was associated with more anxiety, delinquency, and aggression only if adolescents reported no exposure to community violence.
   Conclusions:
   Violence exposure at home and school had the strongest independent effects on internalizing and externalizing outcomes. Witnessing community violence attenuated the effects of witnessing home violence on anxiety and externalizing problems, perhaps due to desensitization or different norms or expectations regarding violence. However, no comparable attenuation effects were observed for victimization across contexts.

AB Objective: To examine the efficacy of a developmentally appropriate parent child cognitive behavioral therapy (CBI) protocol for anxiety disorders in children ages 4-7 years. Method: Design: Randomized wait-list controlled trial. Conduct: Sixty-four children (53% female, mean age 5.4 years, 80% European American) with anxiety disorders were randomized to a parent child CBT intervention (n = 34) or a 6-month wait-list condition (n = 30). Children were assessed by interviewers blind to treatment assignment, using structured diagnostic interviews with parents, laboratory assessments of behavioral inhibition, and parent questionnaires. Analysis: Chi-square analyses of outcome rates and linear and ordinal regression of repeated measures, examining time by intervention interactions. Results: The response rate (much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Anxiety) among 57 completers was 69% versus 32% (CBT vs. controls), p < .01; intent-to-treat: 59% vs. 30%, p = .016. Treated children showed a significantly greater decrease in anxiety disorders (effect size [ES] = .55) and increase in parent-rated coping (ES = .69) than controls, as well as significantly better CGI improvement on social phobia/avoidant disorder (ES = .95), separation anxiety disorder (ES = .82), and specific phobia (ES = .78), but not on generalized anxiety disorder. Results on the Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing scale were not significant and were limited by low return rates. Treatment response was unrelated to age or parental anxiety but was negatively predicted by behavioral inhibition. Gains were maintained at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Results suggest that developmentally modified parent child CBT may show promise in 4- to 7-year-old children.

AB Objective: To support ongoing monitoring of child response during treatment, we sought to develop a brief, easily administered, clinically relevant, and psychometrically sound measure. Method: We first developed child and caregiver forms of a 12-item Brief Problem Checklist (BPC) interview by applying item response theory and factor analysis to Youth Self-Report (YSR; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL;Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) data for a sample of 2,332 youths. These interviews were then administered weekly via telephone to an ethnically diverse clinical sample of 184 boys and girls 7-13 years of age and their caregivers participating in outpatient treatment, to examine psychometric properties and feasibility. Results: Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were excellent, and factor analysis yielded 1 internalizing and 1 externalizing factor. Validity tests showed large and significant correlations with corresponding scales on paper-and-pencil administrations of the CBCL and YSR as well as with diagnoses obtained from a structured diagnostic interview. Discriminant validity of the BPC interviews was supported by low correlations with divergent criteria. Longitudinal data for the initial 6 months of treatment demonstrated that the BPC significantly predicted change on related measures of child symptoms. Estimates obtained from random coefficient growth models showed generally higher slope reliabilities for the BPC given weekly relative to the CBCL and YSR given every 3 months. Conclusions: Given their combination of brevity and psychometric strength, the child and caregiver BPC interviews appear to be a promising strategy for efficient, ongoing assessment of clinical progress during the course of treatment.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between psychiatric disorders and sexual behaviors among adolescents receiving mental health treatment. Adolescents in mental health treatment have been found to have higher rates of HIV risk behavior than their peers, but data concerning the relationship between psychopathology and risk are inconsistent and limited. Method: Eight hundred and forty adolescents (56% female, 58% African American, mean age = 14.9 years) and their parents completed computerized assessments of psychiatric symptoms via the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Shaffer, 2000a, 2000b). Adolescents also reported on sexual risk behaviors (vaginal/anal sex, condom use at last sex) and completed urine screens for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Results: Adolescents meeting criteria for mania, externalizing disorders (oppositional defiant, conduct, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders), or comorbid for externalizing and internalizing disorders (major depressive, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders) were significantly more likely to report a lifetime history of vaginal or anal sex than those who did not meet criteria for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 2.3, and 1.9, respectively). Adolescents meeting criteria for mania were significantly more likely to have 2 or more partners in the past 90 days (OR = 3.2) and to test positive for a STI (OR = 4.3) relative to adolescents who did not meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: The presence of internalizing and externalizing disorders, especially mania, suggests the need for careful screening and targeting of adolescent sexual behavior during psychiatric treatment.

AB This study examined a stress process model in which stressful life events and association with delinquent peers mediated the relationship of neighborhood disadvantage to Mexican American early adolescents' mental health. The authors also proposed that child gender, child generation, and neighborhood informal social control would moderate the relationship of neighborhood disadvantage to children's experiences of stressful life events. With data from 738 Mexican American early adolescents, results generally provided support for the theoretical model although the relationships of neighborhood disadvantage to stressful life events and adjustment were weaker than expected. Additional research is needed to corroborate these results and determine why neighborhood disadvantage may have different relationships to adjustment for Mexican American early adolescents than for others.

AB The current study examined the role of adolescents' self-regulation as a mediator between sibling relationship quality and adolescent outcomes, after controlling for the quality of the parent-child relationship. Participants were 395 families (282 two parent; 113 single parent) with an adolescent child (M age of child at Time 1 = 11.15, SD = .96, 49% female) who took part in [project name masked for blind review] at both Time 1 and Time 2. Path analysis via structural equation modeling suggested that sibling affection was longitudinally and positively related to self-regulation and prosocial behaviors, and negatively related to externalizing behaviors; while sibling hostility was positively, and having a sister was negatively related to internalizing behaviors (in general, paths were stronger for adolescents from two- vs. single-parent families). There was also evidence that adolescents' self-regulation partially mediated the relation between sibling affection and positive and negative adolescent outcomes. The discussion focuses on the importance of continued research examining the mechanisms through which the sibling relationship influences development during adolescence.

AB Although research demonstrates many negative family outcomes associated with single-parent households, little is known about processes that lead to positive outcomes for these families. Using 3 waves of longitudinal data, we examined how maternal dispositional optimism and life stressors are associated with parenting and child outcomes in 394 single mother African American families. Confirming prior research, we found that mothers' childhood adversities, current economic pressure, and internalizing problems were associated with lower levels of maternal warmth and child management and with lower child school competence. Extending previous studies, we found that maternal optimism was a positive resource, predicting lower levels of maternal internalizing symptoms and higher levels of effective child management and moderating the impact of economic stress on maternal internalizing problems. These findings highlight the need for further investigation of processes and resources that promote positive outcomes for African American mother-headed families and single mother families in general.

AB Objective To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH).
   Study design The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models.
   Results PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power.
   Conclusions Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems. (J Pediatr 2010;157:316-21).

AB Objective: To review the methodology of behavior genetics studies addressing research questions that go beyond simple heritability estimation and illustrate these using representative research on childhood and adolescent anxiety and depression Method: The classic twin design and its extensions may be used to examine age and gender differences in the genetic determinants of complex traits and disorders, the role of genetic factors in explaining comorbidity, the interaction of genes and the environment, and the effect of social interaction among family members An overview of the methods typically employed to address such questions is illustrated by a review of 34 recent studies on childhood anxiety and depression Results: The review provides relatively consistent evidence for small to negligible sex differences in the genetic etiology of childhood anxiety and depression, a substantial role of genetic factors in accounting for the temporal stability of these disorders, a partly genetic basis of the comorbidity between anxiety and depression, a possible role of the interaction between genotype and the environment in affecting liability to these disorders, a role of genotype-environment correlation, and a minor, if any, etiological role of sibling interaction Conclusion: The results clearly demonstrate a role for genetic factors in the etiology and temporal stability of individual differences in childhood anxiety and depression. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 2010,49(8) 820-829

DT Review
DE migraine; children; clinical; psychological functioning; psychiatric

ID HEADACHE; PAIN; DISORDERS; QUALITY
AB BACKGROUND: In past decades, numerous population-and hospital-based studies have revealed a relationship between migraine or headache and psychopathology in children.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess all clinical studies on the prevalence and manifestations of psychological functioning and psychiatric comorbidity in children with migraine and to provide recommendations for its diagnosis and treatment.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database to identify clinical studies that assessed psychological functioning and/or psychiatric comorbidity in children with migraine. Trial quality was assessed according to a standardized and validated set of criteria.
   RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Evidence assessment was performed by using the best-evidence synthesis method of Slavin. On the basis of this method, we found strong evidence that children with migraine in a clinical setting do not exhibit more withdrawn behavior, do not have more thought problems, do not have more social problems, and do not exhibit more delinquent or aggressive behavior than healthy children. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that children with migraine have more somatic complaints and exhibit internalizing behavior which is, given the construct of the outcome measure used, a consequence of the nature of their disease rather than a sign of psychological dysfunctioning. Finally, compared with healthy children, there is limited evidence that children with migraine in a clinical setting are more frequently diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, and they are not more frequently diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, dysthymia, or depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this review, we conclude that children with migraine at referral to a specialist do not exhibit more psychological dysfunctioning and (to a lesser extent) do not exhibit more psychiatric comorbidity compared with healthy controls. Pediatrics 2010;126:323-332

AB In this study, we investigated the role of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) 48-base pairs (bp) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and perinatal adversities regarding severity of tics and comorbid symptoms in children with tic disorders. We genotyped 110 children with tics with regard to the 48-bp VNTR and assessed presence of prenatal smoking exposure, and pregnancy and delivery complications by parent questionnaires. We examined associations between 2, 3, 4, and 7 repeat (R) alleles and severity of tics and comorbid obsessive-compulsive, depressive, anxious, and autistic symptoms. Through linear regressions, we investigated whether perinatal adversities and the 2R, 3R, 4R, and 7R alleles would interact with severity ratings of tics or comorbid symptoms as outcome. Presence of a 2R allele was related to more severe obsessive compulsive symptoms, and presence of a 3R allele to increased severity of autistic features. Pregnancy complications were associated with decreased obsessive compulsive symptom severity, and prenatal smoking exposure to more severe depressive and autistic symptoms. In children without a 3R allele delivery complications were associated with more severe tics, but in children with a 3R variant an inverse relation between delivery complications and tic severity was found. Moreover, the relation between delivery complications and internalizing symptom severity appeared to be most pronounced in children with a 2R allele. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a role of the 48-bp VNTR in the etiology of tic and associated disorders, and for interactions with delivery complications regarding severity of tics and co-occurring internalizing symptoms.

AB The comorbidity of tic disorders (TD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has long been recognized in the clinical literature and appears to be bidirectional, affecting 20-60% of individuals with each disorder. Coffey et al. (1998) found that adults with TD+OCD had a more severe comorbidity profile than adults with OCD or TD alone. This exploratory study in children attempts to evaluate whether heightened diagnostic severity, increased comorbidity load, and lower functioning is more commonplace in youth with TD+OCD in comparison to either syndrome alone. Participants were 306 children (seeking clinical evaluation) with TD, OCD, or TD+OCD. Assessment consisted of a diagnostic battery (including structured diagnostic interviews and standardized parent-report inventories) to evaluate diagnostic severity, comorbid psychopathology, behavioral and emotional correlates, and general psychosocial functioning. Data from this study sample were not supportive of the premise that youth with both a tic disorder and OCD present with elevated diagnostic severity, higher risk-for or intensity-of comorbidity, increased likelihood of externalizing/internalizing symptomatology, or lower broad-based adaptive functioning. The OCD group had elevated rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were more prevalent among youth in the TD group. The three groups also differed on key demographic variables. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to adults, TD+OCD in children and adolescents does not represent a more severe condition than either disorder alone on the basis of diagnostic comorbidity, symptom severity, or functional impairment.

AB Background: Some evidence suggests that obesity and behavior problems are related in children, but studies have been conflicting and have rarely included children under age 4. An association between behavior problems in early childhood and risk for obesity could suggest that a common set of factors contribute to both. Our research objectives were to determine the extent to which externalizing behavior in early childhood is related to body mass index (BMI) in early childhood and through age 12, and to evaluate whether these associations differ by sex and race.
   Methods: Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed. Externalizing behaviors at 24 months were assessed by mothers using the Child Behavior Checklist. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight assessed 7 times between age 2 and 12 years. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess associations between 24 month externalizing behavior and BMI from 2 to 12 years, calculate predicted differences in BMI, and evaluate effect modification.
   Results: Externalizing behavior at 24 months was associated with a higher BMI at 24 months and through age 12. Results from a linear mixed effects model, controlling for confounding variables and internalizing behavior, predicted a difference in BMI of approximately 3/4 of a unit at 24 months of age comparing children with high levels of externalizing behavior to children with low levels of externalizing behavior. There was some evidence of effect modification by race; among white children, the average BMI difference remained stable through age 12, but it doubled to 1.5 BMI units among children who were black or another race.
   Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that externalizing behaviors in early childhood are associated with children's weight status early in childhood and throughout the elementary school years, though the magnitude of the effect is modest.

AB The prevalence of childhood maltreatment and the magnitude of the association of maltreatment with internalizing mental health symptoms were examined in 398 incarcerated youth. The prevalence of abuse greatly exceeded general population rates. The proportion of variance in mental health symptoms accounted for by maltreatment was small but developmentally significant. Sexual abuse is a markedly stronger predictor of internalizing mental health problems in incarcerated youth than physical abuse. Consistent with a bio-psychological model of trauma, dissociation at the time of sexual abuse was the strongest nondemographic predictor of mental health symptoms. Physical abuse was associated with more internalizing mental health problems for children from families with mental health problems and families with lower socioeconomic status. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine (a) if child characteristics relate to disagreement between clinician-assigned diagnoses and diagnoses derived from parent-report questionnaire, which were available to clinicians, and (b) if disagreement predicts subsequent number of clinic visits attended. This study evaluated the odds of agreement versus disagreement for internalizing and externalizing problems as a function of child age, gender, race, public-aid status, symptom severity, and impairment among 900 children (3-19 years) in a large, urban, child psychiatry clinic. A mixed-effects regression approach was used to evaluate the relationship between disagreement and visit attendance. Internalizing problem disagreement was more likely for children who were males, older, less symptomatic, and receiving Medicaid. Externalizing problem disagreement was more likely for children who were female, older, less impaired, and less symptomatic. Internalizing disagreement predicted significantly fewer visits; externalizing disagreement did not. Clinician-parent disagreement about the nature of child problems may have clinical consequences, especially for internalizing disorders. Attention to child characteristics that predict agreement may diminish discrepancies and reduce attrition from treatment.

AB Despite a long history of documenting discrepancies in parent and child reports of parental care and child psychopathology, it has only been in recent years that researchers have begun to consider these discrepancies as meaningful indicators of parent-child relationship quality and as predictors of long-term child adjustment. Discrepancies in perceptions of parenting may be particularly important for the children of mothers with a history of substance abuse who may be less aware of the impact of their behavior on their child and of their child's internalizing symptoms. This study examined associations between (a) mother-child discrepancies in reports of maternal aggression, and (b) mother and child reports of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Data collected from 99 mother-child dyads (with children 4-16 years of age) during the baseline phase of a randomized clinical trial testing a parenting intervention were used in this study. Measures included parent and child versions of the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children. Findings indicated that as children viewed their mothers as increasingly more aggressive than mothers viewed themselves, children reported more internalizing and externalizing symptoms but mothers only reported more child externalizing symptoms. Mother-child discrepancies in reports of parenting behavior have potentially meaningful implications for child emotional and behavioral problems.

AB Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorders often experience severe anxiety and depression, yet the explanation for this association remains unclear. The authors examined the longitudinal relationship between autistic-like and internalizing traits across middle to late childhood in a population-representative twin sample.
   Method: Participants were approximately 6,000 twin pairs born in England and Wales from 1994 to 1996. Parental reports of autistic-like and internalizing traits were analyzed at ages 7 and 8 (timepoint 1) and again at age 12 (timepoint 2). The direction and etiology of the associations between these traits were examined within a cross-lagged design.
   Results: Findings revealed an asymmetric bidirectional association between autistic-like and internalizing traits over time. Autistic-like traits at age 7 made a modest but significant contribution to the presence of internalizing traits at age 12. Earlier internalizing traits also influenced the development of later autistic-like traits, although this association was approximately one-half the magnitude. While both traits were moderately to highly heritable, they were largely independent with regard to their genetic influences. Stronger associations were found between the modest shared environmental influences on each trait. Of note, it was autistic-like communication difficulties, rather than social deficits, that made a significant contribution to later internalizing traits.
   Conclusions: The association between autistic-like and internalizing traits was attributable to reciprocal processes occurring across childhood, suggesting that these traits may serve to exacerbate each other over time. Autistic-like communication difficulties had the most notable impact. This association must now be explored within samples of children with diagnosed autism spectrum disorders and internalizing disorders, since this may help to inform the best timing and targeting of clinical intervention.

AB This paper shows the internalizing symptoms: anxiety, depression and somatic complaints, obtained in a clinical sample from 300 boys and girls aged between 8 and 12 years. The instrument used was the abbreviated Child Behavior Checklist Scale (CBCL) (Achenbach & Edelbrock 1983) of 96 items.
   The prevalence found in the CBCL-DSM factors in the total sample, estimated from 98th percentile (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), is 54% in anxiety, 32% in affective alterations, and 29% in somatic complaints, finding a higher prevalence in boys than girls in the first two alterations.
   A factorial analysis was carried out and it was found three internalizing empirical syndromes: anxious/depressed, somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed. In these empirical syndromes the prevalence, from mean plus one SD of the sample, is: 18% in anxious/depressed and somatic complaints, and 14% in withdrawn/depressed, and in all factors the prevalence was higher in boys than girls.

AB Reactive aggression (RA) is an angry response to perceived provocation. Proactive aggression (PA) is a pre-meditated act used to achieve some goal. This study test hypotheses that (1) individuals high in RA and PA will differ in resting levels of autonomic arousal and (2) RA will be related to emotional and behavioral problems, while PA only to behavioral problems.
   Parents of 68 children (age 6-13) reported on child symptoms, reactive/proactive aggression, and behavior problems. Resting heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and HR variability (HRV) were measured in 42 of the children. RA was significantly related to decreased HRV and a trend for decreased SC, while PA was significantly related to increased SC and HRV. RA was significantly related to increased internalizing behaviors and attention deficits, while PA was significantly related to increased hyperactivity/impulsivity and delinquent behavior problems.
   Findings support a distinction between child reactive (hot-tempered) and proactive (cold-tempered) aggression in autonomic, emotional (i.e., internalizing problems), and behavioral (i.e., attention deficits, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and delinquent behavior) functioning, and are discussed in relation to theories of antisocial behavior.

AB Objective: Sexually or physically abused children are at risk for neurobiological dysregulation as well as for internalizing and disruptive behavior disorders. Stress-related autonomic nervous system (ANS) down-regulation has been proposed as a sequela of abuse and was investigated in the present study.
   Methods: Child Protective Services documented incidents of abuse were recorded for children in a sample of 262 pediatric psychiatric inpatients, as well as demographic, physical and intellectual functioning, and diagnostic and medication prescription data. Before and after a mildly stressful blood draw, noninvasive assessments of ANS activity were obtained.
   Results: Controlling for all other variables in logistic regression analyses, a history of physical abuse (45% overall prevalence) was associated with poststressor ANS hyporesponsivity (i.e., heart rate deceleration).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that a history of physical (but not sexual) abuse is associated with stressor-related ANS down-regulation in psychiatrically impaired children and adolescents.
   Practice implications: Stressor-related autonomic hyporesponsivity secondary to physical abuse may contribute to the impairment of severely emotionally disturbed children. Differential diagnosis of psychiatrically impaired children should include identification of those who have a history of physical abuse, and their treatment should address stressor-related hyporeactivity.

AB The study examines group and individual differences in psychological functioning and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity among adolescents displaced by Hurricane Katrina and living in a U.S. government relocation camp (n = 62, ages 12-19 years) 2 months postdisaster. Levels of salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, depression, anxiety, distress, aggression, and self-esteem for this group were contrasted with a demographically matched no-trauma control group (n = 53). Results revealed that hurricane exposure and SNS activity moderated the relations between lower cortisol and higher internalizing behaviors. Sex-related differences were observed in behavioral adjustment and stress regulation. Implications of sex differences in biobehavioral adjustment to loss, displacement, and relocation are discussed in relation to evolutionary and developmental theory.

AB This paper presents a meta-analysis of the psychotherapy treatment outcome studies for sexually abused children and adolescents. There were 39 studies included, most of which aimed to treat the psychological effects of childhood sexual abuse. Separate meta-analyses were conducted according to study design and outcome domain, in keeping with meta-analytic conventions. However, given heterogeneity across studies and the need for sufficient n in each category for meaningful moderator analyses, the study designs were pooled into a repeated measures meta-analysis. There were large effect sizes for global outcomes (g=1.37) and PTSD/trauma outcomes (g=1.12). More moderate effect sizes were evident for internalizing symptoms (g=0.74), self-appraisal (g=0.63), externalizing symptoms (g=0.52), and sexualized behavior (g=0.49), while small effects were found for measures of coping/functioning (g=0.44), caregiver outcomes (g=0.43), and social skills/competence (g=0.38). Effects were maintained at follow-up more than six months after treatment for some outcome domains but not others. Studies represented diverse treatment approaches, and most treatments were effective in symptom reduction. Presence of probable moderators of treatment outcome varied across symptom domains, reflecting importance of targeting therapy to individual needs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The moderating effects of kinship social support on the association of mother adolescent problematic relations and mothers' report of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed among 204 African American mothers of adolescents who were between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Kinship support was negatively associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems. Mother adolescent communication problems and mothers' psychological control were positively associated with internalizing problems. Mother adolescent communication problems were positively related to externalizing problems. The interaction of kinship support and mothers' psychological control on.internalizing problems was significant. Probing the interaction revealed that the relation of mothers' psychological control with internalizing problems was less apparent for mothers who had higher compared with lower kinship social support. Also, the relation of the interaction of kinship support and mother adolescent communication problems with externalizing problems was significant. The association of mother adolescent communication problems with externalizing problems was less apparent when mothers had higher compared with lower kinship support. The findings are discussed in terms of the need for more information on factors that moderate families' access to social support.

AB Purpose of review
   To summarize recent research on developmental coordination disorder (DCD), with particular attention to comorbidity and related questions of etiology.
   Recent findings
   Although a general consensus on the disorder definition exists, case identification in research studies remains problematic. Despite this, recent research has reported high levels of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and internalizing disorders among children with poor motor coordination. These findings offer some support for the longstanding view that DCD may be one facet of a broader syndrome that includes learning difficulties and deficits in attention. 'Pure' cases are common, however, and other work suggests that DCD and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder have distinct causes. There is also some evidence that internalizing disorder may be a consequence of DCD.
   Summary
   Measurement issues in DCD persist, whereas findings on comorbidity have both illuminated the nature of the disorder and heightened debate on its usefulness as a distinct diagnostic entity.

AB Using a prospective longitudinal design, this study investigated factors associated with resilience in 20-year-old offspring of depressed mothers (n = 648). Resilient youth were operationally defined as those whose mothers were depressed but who themselves had no history of recurrent depression and currently evidenced adequate academic or work and romantic functioning, no Axis I psychopathology, and no clinically significant internalizing behavior problems. Low levels of perceived maternal psychological control (p = .02) and high child IQ (p < .01) acted as protective factors in the context of maternal depression. Low paternal psychological control (p = .02), high maternal warmth (p < .01), high self-esteem (p < .01), and healthy peer social functioning (p < .01) all acted as resource factors predicting high functioning outcomes for young adults, regardless of mother depression status. Notably, high child IQ acted as a protective factor predicting resilient outcomes that persisted from adolescence to adulthood (p < .01), and low maternal psychological control acted as a protective factor predicting resilient outcomes that emerged in early adulthood (p = .03). Interventions focused on these 2 protective factors might yield the strongest benefits for offspring of depressed mothers as they transition to early adulthood.

AB The authors of this study tested a selection influence de-selection model of depression. This model explains friendship influence processes (i.e., friends' depressive symptoms increase adolescents' depressive symptoms) while controlling for two processes: friendship selection (i.e., selection of friends with similar levels of depressive symptoms) and friendship de-selection (i.e., de-selection of friends with dissimilar levels of depressive symptoms). Further, this study is unique in that these processes were studied both inside and outside the school context. The authors used a social network approach to examine 5 annual measurements of data in a large (N = 847) community-based network of adolescents and their friends (M = 14.3 years old at first measurement). Results supported the proposed model: adolescents tend to select friends with similar levels of depression, and friends may increase each other's depressive symptoms as relationships endure. These two processes were most salient outside the school context. At the same time, friendships seemed to be ended more frequently if adolescents' level of depressive symptoms was dissimilar to that of their friends.

AB OBJECTIVE - This study examines how active coping and withdrawal, psychological (internalizing and externalizing) symptoms, and glycemic control (A1C values) influence each other across time in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - One hundred and nine adolescents participated in a four-wave longitudinal study spanning four years (mean age at Time 1 was 13.77). Patients were visited at home and completed questionnaires measuring coping and psychological symptoms. The treating physicians were contacted to obtain A1C values. Cross-lagged path analysis from a structural equation modeling approach was used for data analysis.
   RESULTS - Clinically meaningful pathways between coping and glycemic control were found across time. Active coping prospectively predicted lower A1C levels, which, in turn, predicted active coping. Higher A1C levels and higher psychological symptoms consistently predicted avoidance coping across time. Finally, psychological symptomatology constituted an important link in the observed longitudinal chain of effects. More specifically, higher A1C values and symptomatology at Time 1 positively predicted withdrawal at Time 2, which, in turn, positively predicted symptomatology at Time 3. Next, symptomatology at Time 3 positively predicted higher A1C values at Time 4, thus coming full circle.
   CONCLUSIONS - Coping with everyday stress, psychological symptoms, and glycemic control were interrelated across time. Evidence was obtained for reciprocal pathways and mutually reinforcing mechanisms, indicating the need to monitor coping strategies and psychological symptoms along with glycemic control in optimizing clinical care in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

AB Background: Behavioral disinhibition (externalizing/impulsivity) and behavioral inhibition (internalizing/anxiety) may contribute to the development of alcohol abuse and dependence. But tests of person-by-environment interactions in predicting alcohol use disorders are needed. This study examined the extent to which interactions between behavioral disinhibition, behavioral inhibition and family management during adolescence predict alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence at age 27.
   Methods: This study used longitudinal data from a community sample of 808 men and women interviewed from ages 10 to 27 in the Seattle Social Development Project. Zero-order correlations followed by a series of nested regressions examined the relationships between individual characteristics (behavioral disinhibition and behavioral inhibition/anxiety) and environment (good vs. poor family management practices during adolescence) in predicting alcohol abuse and dependence criterion counts at age 27.
   Results: Behavioral disinhibition and poor family management predicted increased likelihood of both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence at age 27. Behavioral inhibition/anxiety was unrelated to both outcomes. Youths high in behavioral disinhibition were at increased risk for later alcohol abuse and dependence only in consistently poorly managed family environments. In consistently well-managed families, high levels of behavioral disinhibition did not increase risk for later alcohol abuse or dependence.
   Conclusions: Behavioral disinhibition increases risk for alcohol abuse and dependence in early adulthood only for individuals who experience poor family management during adolescence. Interventions seeking to reduce environmental risks by strengthening consistent positive family management practices may prevent later alcohol abuse and dependence among individuals at risk due to behavioral disinhibition.

AB In the present study, predictors of persistent conduct problems among children aged 4-8 years were investigated in a randomized controlled trial 1 year after treatment with the Incredible Years parent training program (PT), or combined parent training and child treatment (PT + CT). Data were collected before and after treatment and at a 1-year follow-up. Pre-treatment child characteristics predicting persistent conduct problems in the child at the 1-year follow-up were high levels of internalizing and aggression problems as reported by mothers. The only family characteristic predicting persistence of child conduct problems was having contacts with child protection services. Clinicians and researchers need to closely monitor and identify children with conduct problems not responding to parent training programs. These individuals and their families are likely to need further support.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the prediction of adult behavioral and emotional problems from developmental trajectories of externalizing behavior in a 24-years longitudinal population-based study of 2,076 children. The adult psychiatric outcome of these trajectories has not yet been examined. Trajectories of the four externalizing behavior types: aggression, opposition, property violations and status violations were determined separately through latent class growth analysis using data of five waves, covering ages 4-18 years. We used regression analyses to determine the associations between children's trajectories and adults' psychiatric problems based on the Adult Self-Report. The developmental trajectories of the four types of externalizing behavior mostly predicted intrusive, aggressive and rule-breaking behavior in adulthood. Non-destructive behaviors in childhood such as opposition and status violations predict adult problems to a larger extent than destructive behaviors such as aggression and property violations. In general, children who develop through high-level trajectories are likely to suffer from both internalizing and externalizing problem behavior in adulthood, regardless the direction of change (i.e. increasing/decreasing/persisting) of the high-level trajectory. We can conclude that the level rather than the developmental change of externalizing behavior problems has a larger impact on adult outcome.

AB Parental psychopathology is associated with increased psychosocial maladjustment in adolescents. We examined, from a psychosocial perspective, the association between parental psychological distress and psychosocial maladjustment in adolescents and assessed the mediating role of psychosocial covariates. This is a cross-sectional survey and the setting include representative sample of Quebec adolescents in 1999. The participants of the study include 13- and 16-year-old children (N = 2,346) in the Social and Health Survey of Quebec Children and Adolescents. The main outcome measures are internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance use, and alcohol consumption. For statistical analysis, we used structural equation modeling to test for mediation. Internalizing and externalizing disorders were significantly associated with parental psychological distress, but not substance use or alcohol consumption. The higher the parental distress, the higher the risk of adolescent mental health disorders. The association between parental psychological distress and internalizing disorders was mediated by adolescent self-esteem, parental emotional support and extrafamilial social support. As for externalizing disorders, these variables only had an independent effect. In conclusion, A family's well being is a necessary condition for psychosocial adjustment in adolescence. Beyond the psychiatric approach, psychosocial considerations need to be taken into consideration to prevent negative mental health outcomes in children living in homes with distressed parents.

AB The goal of this longitudinal study was to examine observed paternal and maternal control (psychological control and autonomy granting) and support (rejection and emotional warmth) as mediators of the relation between children's negative emotionality at 3.5 years of age and depression and anxiety problems at 4.5 years. For 35 children, 60-min unstructured parent child interactions were rated at 4.5 years. Results indicated that maternal rejection mediated the relation between children's negative emotionality and their later anxiety/depression. Higher levels of child negative emotionality predicted more psychological control in mothers, but did not predict any parenting behaviours in fathers. Higher levels of paternal autonomy granting were associated with more child anxiety/depression. Unexpectedly, however, more maternal emotional warmth was related to higher levels of child anxiety/depression. The findings offer new insights to guide future research on the (mediating) role of parenting behaviours in the relation between children's negative emotionality and their internalizing problems.

AB The present study investigated the impact of comorbidity over and above the impact of symptom severity on treatment outcome of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for children with anxiety disorders. Children (aged 8-12, n = 124) diagnosed with an anxiety disorder were treated with a short-term CBT protocol. Severity was assessed with a composite measure of parent-reported behavior problems. Two approaches to comorbidity were examined; "total comorbidity" which differentiated anxiety disordered children with (n = 69) or without (n = 55) a co-occurring disorder and "non-anxiety comorbidity' which differentiated anxious children with (n = 22) or without a non-anxiety comorbid disorder (n = 102). Treatment outcome was assessed in terms of Recovery, represented by post-treatment diagnostic status, and Reliable Change, a score reflecting changes in pre- to post-treatment symptom levels. Severity contributed to the prediction of (no) Recovery and (more) Reliable Change in parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms and self-reported depressive symptoms. Total and non-anxiety comorbidity added to the prediction of diagnostic recovery. Non-anxiety comorbidity added to the prediction of Reliable Change in parent reported measures by acting as a suppressor variable. Non-anxiety comorbidity operated as a strong predictor that explained all of the variance associated with severity for self-reported depressive symptoms. The results support the need for further research on mechanisms by which treatment gains in children with higher symptom severity and non-anxiety comorbidity can be achieved.

AB A model for teaching children skills to strengthen emotional self-regulation is introduced, informed by the developmental concept of scaffolding. Adult modeling/instruction, role-play and in vivo coaching are tailored to children's level of understanding and skill to promote use of skills in reallife contexts. Two-hundred twenty-six kindergarten-3rd grade children identified with elevated behavioral and social classroom problems from a population-based screening participated in a waitlisted randomized trial of the Rochester Resilience Project derived from this model. In 14 lessons with school-based mentors, children were taught a hierarchical set of skills: monitoring of emotions; selfcontrol/ reducing escalation of emotions; and maintaining control and regaining equilibrium. Mentors provided classroom reinforcement of skill use. Multi-level modeling accounting for the nesting of children in schools and classrooms showed the following effects at post-intervention: reduced problems rated by teachers in behavior control, peer social skills, shy-withdrawn and off-task behaviors (ES 0.31-0.47). Peer social skills improved for girls but not for boys. Children receiving the intervention had a 46% mean decrease in disciplinary referrals and a 43% decrease in suspensions during the 4-month intervention period. Limitations and future directions to promote skill transfer are discussed.

AB The objective of this investigation was to examine whether children's responses to peer victimization predict subsequent changes in their social and emotional well-being. Also investigated was whether these associations vary as a function of children's sex and level of victimization. Participants included 420 4th- and 5th-grade students (197 boys). Data included children's self-reports of their responses to peer victimization in the Fall and measures of their socioemotional adjustment obtained in the Fall and Spring. Results indicated that there are a number of tradeoffs associated with children's responses to peer victimization. Seeking other's support was predictive of decreased aggression among children infrequently victimized, but was also predictive of increased internalizing difficulties. Avoidant coping predicted improved social adjustment for boys, but declines in social adjustment for girls. Retaliation was associated with increased social maladjustment, but for highly victimized children, predicted decreases in anxiety. Implications for intervention efforts are discussed.

AB There is a dearth of research examining intervention effectiveness for ethnic minorities and few studies have investigated within-group differences in response to treatment. This study examined the prevalence of mental health problems among Anglo- and Mexican-American juveniles entering probation and their response to a comprehensive intervention designed to address drug, alcohol, and mental health in a culturally-sensitive manner. We hypothesized that all youths would demonstrate mental health improvements from pretest to posttest, and the improvements would be equal for Mexican-American youth of varying levels of acculturation and an Anglo comparison group. Participants included a total of 103 adolescents ages thirteen to eighteen years, of whom 59 percent were male and 81 percent were Mexican American. Hypotheses were supported, indicating this comprehensive, community-based intervention targeting delinquent adolescents and their families was effective in improving mental health regardless of ethnic background or level of acculturation. That is, regardless of group differences in mental health problems at intake, youth with different cultural orientations reported significantly reduced levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at posttest.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity modifies the relation between family stress, and physical and mental health, and functional impairment for children with sickle cell disease. Methods: Thirty-eight 5-to 8-year old children with sickle cell disease completed a 20-minute ANS reactivity protocol measuring respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period during comparison and challenge tasks in social, cognitive, sensory, and emotion domains. Domain-specific reactivity was calculated as the difference between challenge and comparison tasks; overall reactivity was calculated across domains as the mean of the difference scores. ANS profile scores combined the overall respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period reactivity scores. Caregivers completed measures of family stress, child physical and mental health symptoms, and functional impairment. Results: Family stress was associated with child functional impairment whereas overall and cognitive ANS reactivity was associated with co-morbid internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms. Interaction models showed that children with the classic ANS profile (parasympathetic inhibition and sympathetic activation) in the cognitive and emotion domains were most vulnerable to the effects of stress, with more functional impairment and injuries when family stress was high, controlling for age, sex, and parent education. Conclusion: The costs to patients and families in diminished quality of life and to the health care system could be reduced by further exploration of strategies to identify children with sickle cell disease who are most vulnerable under conditions of high family stress and heightened psychobiologic reactivity.

AB Objective The behavioral ratings of preschoolers who sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) prior to the age of 2 years and a typically developing group were compared; predictors of behavioral functioning were examined. Methods Eighty-two 3-year-olds comprised mild TBI (n = 31), moderate/severe TBI (n = 20), and typically developing (n = 31) groups, with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as the primary outcome measure. Results Groups differed on the CBCL Withdrawal Scale. No differences emerged in the proportion of children demonstrating clinical elevations, with average mean scores for each group. Exploratory analyses yielded no differences between inflicted, non-inflicted, and typical groups. Glasgow Coma Scale and Self-Report Family Inventory Leadership predicted Externalizing Problems; developmental level predicted Internalizing Problems. Conclusions After early TBI, preschoolers did not differ from one another or a matched comparison group in behavioral ratings; however, it may be premature to infer that preschoolers do not evidence behavioral dysfunction after early TBI.

TI Parental Assessment of Executive Function and Internalizing and

   Therapy
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; CONSEQUENCES; CHILDREN
AB Objective To determine the change in parental ratings of executive function and behavior in children with primary hypertension after anti-hypertensive therapy.
   Study design Parents of subjects with untreated hypertension and control subjects completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to assess behavioral correlates of executive function and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Subjects with hypertension subsequently received anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve casual blood pressure (BP) <95th percentile. After 12 months, all parents again completed the BRIEF and CBCL.
   Results Twenty-two subjects with hypertension and 25 normotensive control subjects underwent both baseline and 12-month assessments. The BP of subjects with hypertension improved (24-hour systolic BP [SBP] load: mean baseline versus 12-months, 60% versus 25%, P < .001). Parent ratings of executive function improved from baseline to 12 months in the subjects with hypertension (BRIEF Global Executive Composite T-score, Delta = -5.9, P = 0.001), but not in the normotensive control subjects (Delta = -0.36, P = .83). In contrast, T-scores on the CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing summary scales did not change significantly from baseline to 12 months in either subjects with hypertension or control subjects.
   Conclusions Children with hypertension demonstrated improvement in parental ratings of executive function after 12 months of anti-hypertensive therapy. (J Pediatr 2010;157:114-9).

AB Objective: The aims of this paper are as follows: to present past-year prevalence data for DSM-IV disorders in the early elementary school years; to examine the impact of impairment criteria on prevalence estimates; to examine the relation of sociodemographic and psychosocial risk factors to disorders; and to explore associations between "internalizing" and "externalizing" disorders and social competence and family burden as further validation of the impairing nature of these disorders. Method: As part of a longitudinal representative population study of children born healthy between July 1995 and September 1997 in the New Haven-Meriden Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area of the 1990 Census (n = 1,329), parents of a subsample enriched for child psychopathology (n = 442; 77.6% response rate, 69.5% of eligible sample) were interviewed in the child's kindergarten or first-grade year with the Diagnostic interview Schedule for Children, Version IV (DISC-IV). Parents were surveyed about sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, and both parents and teachers were surveyed about social competence. Results: Approximately one in five (21.6%) children met criteria for psychiatric disorder(s) with impairment. Sociodemographic and psychosocial correlates included persistent poverty beginning in early childhood, limited parental education, low family expressiveness, stressful life events, and violence exposure. Finally, diagnostic status was significantly associated with poorer social competence and family burden. Conclusions: That approximately one in five children evidenced a psychiatric disorder with impairment during the transition to formal schooling highlights the importance of integrating psychiatric epidemiological and developmental approaches to inform conversations about school readiness and intervention planning.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of maternal depression during the child's first year of life (i.e., sensitive period) on subsequent behavior problems. Method: Participants were 175 mothers participating in the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) who met lifetime diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and completed the child behavior checklist (CBCL) for their first child at some point during the child's first 12 years (mean = 4.91 years). Results: Regression analyses indicated that MDD in the sensitive period was a significant predictor of internalizing and total behavior problems on the CBCL while controlling for several demographic variables (e.g., child and mother age, child gender). Maternal depression before pregnancy and during the prenatal period did not significantly predict later child behavior problems, suggesting that the effect was not driven by the presence of previous MDD and was specific to the first year of life. Conclusions: Presence of maternal MDD during a child's first year of life represents a sensitive period and increases the risk of adverse child outcome. The findings suggest the importance of identification, prevention, and early intervention. Future studies should examine these findings in more diverse, heterogeneous samples. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2010;49(7): 699-707.

AB Children's relational schemas have been found to account for, and moderate, links between peer victimization and psychosocial difficulties. The present study extends this research by examining whether children's mental representations of their teachers' responses to students' peer harassment moderate associations between peer victimization and internalizing distress and school avoidance. Data were collected from 264 children (124 boys and 140 girls) in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. A number of significant victimization x perceived teacher response interactions emerged, although the nature of these moderated associations often varied by children's sex. For boys, victimization was associated with greater internalizing distress only when they viewed their teacher as advocating assertion, avoidance, or independent coping. In fact, perceiving teachers to use low levels of these strategies appeared to protect victimized boys from internalizing problems. In comparison, although girls similarly evidenced greater internalizing problems when they viewed the teacher as using these strategies, no evidence was found of a buffering effect at low levels of perceiving the teacher as advocating avoidance, assertion, or independent coping. The results highlight the role of perceptions of the teacher in explicating individual differences in adjustment problems associated with peer victimization.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore associations of maternal prenatal smoking and child psychological problems and determine the role of causal intrauterine mechanisms.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Maternal smoking and child psychological problems were explored in 2 birth cohorts in Pelotas, Brazil (n = 509, random subsample), and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in Britain (n = 6735). Four approaches for exploring causal mechanisms were applied: (1) cross-population comparisons between a high-income and a middle-income country; (2) multiple adjustment for socioeconomic and parental psychological factors; (3) maternal-paternal comparisons as a test of putative intrauterine effects; and (4) searching for specific effects on different behavioral subscales.
   RESULTS: Socioeconomic patterning of maternal prenatal smoking was stronger in the ALSPAC compared with the Pelotas cohort. Despite this difference in a key confounder, consistency in observed associations was found between these cohorts. In both cohorts, unadjusted maternal smoking was associated with greater offspring hyperactivity, conduct/externalizing problems, and peer problems but not with emotional/internalizing problems. After adjusting for confounders and paternal prenatal smoking, only the association with conduct/externalizing problems persisted in both cohorts (conduct problems in the ALSPAC cohort, odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.46], P = .005; externalizing problems in the Pelotas cohort, OR: 1.82 [95% CI: 1.19-2.78], P = .005; ORs reflect ordinal odds ratios of maternal smokers having offspring with higher scores). Maternal smoking associations were stronger than paternal smoking associations, although statistical evidence that these associations differed was weak in 1 cohort.
   CONCLUSION: Evidence from 4 approaches suggests a possible intrauterine effect of maternal smoking on offspring conduct/externalizing problems. Pediatrics 2010; 126: e57-e65

AB Background. Several theories have posited a common internalizing factor to help account for the relationship between mood and anxiety disorders. These disorders are often co-morbid and strongly covary. Other theories and data suggest that personality traits may account, at least in part, for co-morbidity between depression and anxiety. The present study examined the relationship between neuroticism and an internalizing dimension common to mood and anxiety disorders.
   Method. A sample of ethnically diverse adolescents (n=621) completed self-report and peer-report measures of neuroticism. Participants also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).
   Results. Structural equation modeling showed that a single internalizing factor was common to lifetime diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders, and this internalizing factor was strongly correlated with neuroticism. Neuroticism had a stronger correlation with an internalizing factor (r=0.98) than with a substance use factor (r=0.29). Therefore, neuroticism showed both convergent and discriminant validity.
   Conclusions. These results provide further evidence that neuroticism is a necessary factor in structural theories of mood and anxiety disorders. In this study, the correlation between internalizing psychopathology and neuroticism approached 1.0, suggesting that neuroticism may be the core of internalizing psychopathology. Future studies are needed to examine this possibility in other populations, and to replicate our findings.

AB The aim was to investigate the association of bullying behavior with psychiatric disorders and physical health in a sample of adolescent psychiatric patients, as there have to our knowledge been no previous studies using actual psychiatric diagnoses examining this relationship in boys and girls. We studied 508 Finnish adolescents (age 12-17) admitted to psychiatric inpatient care between April 2001 and March 2006 from the geographically large area of Northern Finland. The Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) was used to obtain psychiatric diagnoses of adolescents according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and information on bullying behavior. Logistic regression analyses showed that having an externalizing disorder increased the likelihood of being a bully or a bully-victim (i.e. a person who is both a bully and a victim of bullying) among both the boys (odds ratio, OR = 14.4, P=0.001) and the girls (OR = 10.0, P<0.001). In addition, having an internalizing disorder increased the likelihood of being a victim of bullying among the boys (OR = 3.4, P=0.008), but not the girls. Chronic somatic diseases were also significantly associated with being bullied among the boys (OR = 2.5, P=0.041). Our results suggest that adolescents who are involved in bullying behavior should be evaluated psychiatrically, as this might be an early marker of psychiatric disorders.

AB Introduction: Analyzing data that arises from correlated observations such as husband-wife pairs, siblings, or repeated assessments of the same individuals over time requires more specialized analytic tools. Additionally, outcomes that are not normally distributed such as count data, (e.g., number of symptoms or number of problems endorsed) also require specialized analytic tools. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are a very flexible tool for dealing with correlated data (such as data derived from related individuals such as families). The objective of this report was to compare traditional ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to a GEE approach for analyzing family data.
   Methods: Using data from an ongoing five-wave longitudinal study of newlywed couples, we examined a subset of 173 families with children between the ages of 4 and 11 at two data collection points. The relation between parental risk factors (e.g., heavy drinking, aggression, marital quality) and child internalizing symptoms was examined within the context of two regression-based models: traditional OLS regression and a GEE approach.
   Results: Overall, the GEE approach allowed a more complete use of the available data, provided more robust findings, and produced more reliable parameter estimates.
   Conclusion: GEE models are a flexible regression-based approach for dealing with related data that arises from correlated data such as family data. Further, given the availability of the models in common statistical programs, family researchers should consider these models for their work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study investigated the relationships between internalizing and externalizing (I-E) behaviors and family variables, including both parenting stress and quality of attachment relations, in children aged 8-12 with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with typical development. Compared to the group with typical development, children with ASD exhibited significantly greater levels of psychopathology as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist [Achenbach, 1991], and parents of children with ASD exhibited higher parenting stress as assessed by the Parenting Stress Index [Abidin, 1995]. In a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, parenting stress emerged as the most important predictor of children's I-E problems. Results are discussed in light of the two groups' similar relationships between parenting stress and child psychopathology.

AB Little is known about the contribution of technical and relational factors to child outcomes in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for children with anxiety disorders. This study investigated the association between treatment adherence, the child-therapist alliance, and child clinical outcomes in manual-guided individual- and group-based CBT for youths diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Trained observers rated tapes of therapy sessions for treatment adherence and child-therapist alliance in a sample of 52 children (aged 8 to 12) with anxiety disorders. Self-reported child anxiety was assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment; parent-reported child internalizing symptoms was assessed at pre- and posttreatment. The results showed high levels of treatment adherence and child-therapist alliance in both CBT programs. Neither treatment adherence nor child-therapist alliance predicted traditional measurements of child outcomes in the present study, but a relation between alliance and outcome was found using a more precise estimation of the true pre-post differences. Implications of these findings for expanding our understanding of how treatment processes relate to child outcome in CBT for children with anxiety disorders are discussed.

AB Objective: The first objective of this study was to test for sex differences in four childhood sexual abuse characteristics penetration, substantiation, perpetrator familial status, and multi-maltreatment in a national sample of youth. The second objective was to test for sex differences in how these abuse characteristics were associated with victims' emotional and behavioral problems.
   Methods: The sample was drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a sample of children investigated by United States child welfare services. Youth in the current study (n = 573, including 234 adolescents) were investigated for alleged sexual abuse. Logistic regression and multivariate analysis of covariance were used to test for sex differences in abuse characteristics, and to determine whether sex moderated associations between abuse characteristics and emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results: Girls were more likely than boys to have their abuse substantiated and to experience penetrative abuse (although differences in penetration status did not emerge among adolescents). Substantiation status and child age were positively associated with caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Sex did not moderate the relationship between abuse characteristics and youth emotional and behavioral problems.
   Conclusions: Sexual abuse characteristics might not be highly predictive factors when making decisions about services needs. Furthermore, there may not be a strong empirical basis for operating on the assumption that one sex is more vulnerable to negative consequences of abuse than the other, or that abuse affects girls and boys differently. The processes explaining why some victims exhibit more impairment than others are likely complex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This secondary analysis presents psycho-social characteristics of two cohorts of overweight/obese African American children [baseline (n = 68) and post-intervention (n = 81)] participating in a community-based, year-long Type 2 diabetes prevention program. The original intervention was designed to incorporate strategies that existent literature deemed most promising with respect to obesity intervention and reduction of Type 2 diabetes risk. Eligible children were assigned to one of two sites and a random process was then used to designate the two sites as either treatment or control. To add to the literature on the psycho-social profiles of overweight children, this analysis considers child and parent caregiver ratings derived from the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition-2 (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2002). For purposes of reference, we index our findings to pre-intervention BASC-2 scores in the baseline cohort as well as to scores of obese children previously reported by others. Parent-reported post-intervention scores favored the intervention condition on three of the four key composites including behavioral symptoms index, internalizing problems and adaptive skills. However, child-reported outcomes showed fewer effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the increase in international adoptions during the last decade, many researchers have investigated the developmental outcomes of these adoptees, including their extreme behaviors. Collectively, these results have not always appeared consistent across studies, perhaps because studies have used children reared in institutions or not, the institutional environments vary in severity, children spend different lengths of time in the institution and are assessed at different ages, and studies use different outcome measures. In an attempt to discern more order in the literature, this review focuses on 18 studies, each of which used the Child Behavior Checklist, and their outcomes are viewed with respect to these parameters. Results suggest that the major factor contributing to extreme behaviors is age at adoption, with those adopted after 6/18 months having more behavior problems, especially Internalizing, Externalizing, and Attention problems. Generally, samples of post-institutional children have more problems than samples of mixed or non-institutional internationally adopted children, and some problems are more likely to be manifest in adolescence, suggesting the effects of deficient early experiences are not simply the persistence of learned behavior but more general dispositions that become more noticeable or severe during adolescence. Findings are discussed in terms of early deficient social-emotional caregiver-child interactions that characterize most institutional environments as a possible major cause of later difficulties in post-institutionalized children.

AB Poverty and economic stress are risk factors for child psychopathology; however, primary and secondary control coping can buffer children against the negative effects of these risks. A 4-week (12 h) pilot prevention program aimed at enhancing coping skills and preventing symptoms of psychopathology among children growing up in poverty was evaluated using a multiple baseline design. Participants were 24 children (ages 8-12) and their primary caregivers. Attrition was low and parent-reports of program satisfaction were high. Children's ability to generate positive coping thoughts and high quality solutions to problems improved from pre- to post-intervention. At the post-intervention measurement, parents' and children's involuntary engagement stress responses had declined and parents' secondary control coping had increased. Children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms also decreased from pre- to post-intervention, according to parent-reports. Results provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention.

AB Forty-one parents and their children (20 girls and 21 boys, mean age = 4.33 years, SD = 1.30) participated in a study to examine how parents' personal use of mental health services related to their attitudes toward child mental health services as well as to their children's adjustment. Results indicated that parents' attitudes and personal use of services have implications for children's adjustment and mental health utilization. Parents who personally used mental health services reported more positive help-seeking attitudes, higher level of help-seeking intentions, and lower stigmatization of child mental health services. In addition, parents who used child services in the past reported higher levels of internalizing (not externalizing) behaviors in their children, and parents' previous experience predicted child mental health service use. Results have implications for fostering positive attitudes and reducing stigma about child mental health services that may prevent parents from seeking professional help for their children.

   UMBILICAL ARTERY; PULSED DOPPLER; INFANTS; FETUSES
AB Background: In severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency a haemodynamic adaptation occurs, resulting in preferential blood flow to the fetal brain (brain sparing). With Doppler ultrasound an increased ratio between the umbilical and the cerebral artery pulsatility index (U/C ratio) can be demonstrated. IUGR is associated with impaired neurodevelopmental outcome.
   Objective: Evaluation of the effect of fetal brain sparing on behavioural problems at eleven years in premature born children.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study in premature children born in 1989, with a gestational age of 26 0/7 to 33 0/7 weeks. An U/C ratio>0.72 was defined as brain sparing. Behavioural problems were assessed with the parent-reported Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) and the Teacher's Report Form (TRF). T scores >60 for total problem score and subscales of internalizing and externalizing behaviour, were considered abnormal.
   Results: Ninety-eight of the 116 survivors were assessed, of which 31 with antenatally established fetal brain sparing. According to the CBCL-total problem score 23.3% of the premature born babies in the brain sparing group had behavioural problems compared with 22.8% of those without brain sparing. According to the TRF-total problem score the percentages were 21.4% and 20.0%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis failed to show a significant association of U/C ratio with behavioural problems. In this model oxygen dependency at 28 days, IQ<85 at five years, cranial ultrasound abnormalities, fetal growth ratio <0.80, Apgar scores <7 after 5 min and birth weight<p10 contributed significantly.
   Conclusion: In this cohort brain sparing itself has no significant association with behavioural problems at eleven years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychopathological factors associated with metabolic control in juvenile insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) deserve further investigation. This study assessed the relationship among specific psychopathological dimensions, coping mechanisms, and metabolic control in a Croatian clinical sample of adolescents with IDDM. One-hundred and one adolescents (aged 11-18) with IDDM filled out the youth self report (YSR) assessing psychopathological dimension and the scale of coping with stress (SCS). Glycemic control was estimated by the percentage of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Subjects were divided into three groups according to HbA1C values: "optimal", "suboptimal control", and "at high risk". Subjects in optimal glycemic control presented with significantly lower scores in most of YSR scales compared to subjects at high risk. Moreover, they had significantly lower scores in avoidance and emotional reactivity and significantly higher scores in cognitive restructuring and problem solving SCS subscales. Regression models revealed that both internalizing and externalizing YSR scores, as well as emotional reactivity coping scores, independently contributed to explain variability of HbA1C values. Both internalizing and externalizing psychopathological dimensions, as well as emotion-oriented coping strategies, are independently associated with poor metabolic control in both boys and girls with IDDM, thus representing potential interest targets of psychotherapeutic interventions aimed at improving glycemic control in this population.

AB Following from life history and attachment theory, individuals are predicted to be sensitive to variation in environmental conditions such that risk and uncertainty are internalized by cognitive, affective, and psychobiological mechanisms. In turn, internalizing of environmental uncertainty is expected to be associated with attitudes toward risk behaviors and investments in education. Native American youth aged 10-19 years (n = 89) from reservation communities participated in a study examining this pathway. Measures included family environmental risk and uncertainty, present and future time perspective, adolescent attachment, attitudes toward risk, investments in education, and salivary cortisol. Results support the idea that environmental risk and uncertainty are internalized during development. In addition, internalizing mechanisms significantly predicted attitudes toward risk and education: (1) lower scores on future time perspective and higher cortisol predicted higher scores on risk attitudes, and (2) higher scores on future time perspective and lower scores on problems with attachment predicted higher self-reported school performance. Gender differences were seen, with males anticipating a shorter lifespan than females, which predicted higher scores on risk attitudes and lower school performance. Implications for research on adolescent problem behavior and academic achievement are discussed.

AB Effective screening for emotional and behavioral disorders among youth requires brief screening scales with good validity to identify youth requiring further evaluation and to estimate prevalence of target disorders in populations of interest such as schools or neighborhoods. This paper examines the psychometric properties of a very short (six-item) screening scale, the K6, to assess serious emotional disturbance (SED) among youth. The K6, which is made up of symptoms of depression and anxiety, has been shown in previous research to be a strong predictor of serious mental illness (SMI) in adults, but no information is available on the ability of the scale to screen for SED among youth. The current report examines the K6 as a screen for SED in a national survey of US adolescents, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). The K6 is shown to provide fairly good prediction of SED [area under curve (AUG) = 0.74] that is somewhat higher for internalizing (AUG = 0.80) than behavior (AUG = 0.75) disorders. Based on this result, we augmented the K6 with questions about symptoms of behavior disorders. This improved prediction of SED (from AUG = 0.74 to AUG = 0.83) as well as of SED associated with pure behavior disorders (from AUG = 0.53 to AUG = 0.78). These results show that although the symptoms of depression and anxiety in the K6 are sufficient to detect SMI among adults, high rates of behavior disorders among adolescents require indicators of behavior disorders to be added to the K6 to screen adequately for adolescent SED.

ID SPEECH; DISORDERS; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE; DELAY; AGE
AB Objective: Analysis of behavioural problems in young children with language problems. Materials and methods: From 38 children diagnosed with a language problem, the opinion of the parents about the behaviour of their child, scored by the Child Behaviour Checklist 1.5-5 was compared with the behavioural problems in the Dutch population with the Chi-square test. T-tests and Mc Nemar tests were used to compare the opinion of the fathers about the behavioural problems with the opinion of the mothers and to compare the scores on internalizing problems with scores on externalizing problems.
   Plots display the measurement of the mean behavioural problems of the parents against the discrepancy between the parents and of the total behavioural problems against the discrepancy between internalizing and externalizing problems. The relation between the behavioural problems, the language score and the non-verbal intelligence score was also compared and is presented in a bar chart. Results: All children had an inadequate language production (GDS). Twenty-seven children had an adequate and 11 children had an inadequate Language Comprehension Quotient (LCQ). Twenty-eight children had an adequate and 10 children had an inadequate non-verbal IQ (SON-IQ).
   In the clinical population mothers report more internalizing behavioural problems than in Dutch peers. The fathers also experience differences, but these are not significant. There is agreement between the parents in how they experience problems on the internalizing, externalizing and total problem scale. And there are no significant differences between the internalizing and externalizing problem scales, between boys and girls, and in behavioural problems in children with both adequate LCQ and SON-IQ and with inadequate LCQ and/or SON-IQ.
   Conclusion: Compared to their peers in the Dutch population, young children with language problems show more internalizing problems according to their mothers. The fathers also experience differences, but these are not significant. Fathers and mothers agree on the behaviour analysis of their child and there are no differences between the occurrences of internalizing or externalizing problems and between boys and girls. There is also no relation between the behavioural problems and the severity of the language problem or the level of non-verbal functioning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether leaving home to live in lodgings during senior high school can be a risk factor for the development of internalizing problems. Utilizing two large-scale prospective community studies of 2399 and 3906 Norwegian students (age range 15-19 years), respectively, the difference in internalizing symptoms between adolescents living in lodgings and adolescents living with their parents during senior high school was examined. Female students living in lodgings had higher scores on internalizing problems than female students living at home, whereas no differences were found for males. Living in lodgings did not predict later internalizing problems, and prior internalizing problems did not predict moving into lodgings. Iris therefore suggested that the negative effect of living in lodgings on high school students well-being is temporary. (C) 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB The current study examined co-rumination (i.e., extensively discussing, rehashing, and speculating about problems) in the context of mother-adolescent relationships. Fifth-, eighth-, and eleventh-graders (N = 516) reported on co-rumination and more normative self-disclosure with mothers, their relationships with mothers, and their own internalizing symptoms. A subset of mothers (N = 200) reported on mother-adolescent co-rumination and self-disclosure. Results from the adolescent-report data indicated greater mother-adolescent co-rumination with daughters than sons and also adjustment trade-offs of mother-adolescent co-rumination. Mother-adolescent co-rumination was related to positive relationship quality but also to enmeshment in the relationship. Whereas the relation with positive relationship quality appeared to be due in part to normative self-disclosure, the relation with enmeshment was unique to co-rumination. Mother-adolescent co-rumination also was related to youth anxiety/depression. The relations with enmeshment and internalizing symptoms were strongest when co-rumination focused on the mothers' problems. Implications of mother-adolescent co-rumination for promoting appropriate relationship boundaries and youth well-being are discussed.

AB We examined data collected as a part of the Autism Treatment Network, a group of 15 autism centers across the United States and Canada. Mean Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) scores of the 286 children assessed were significantly lower than those of healthy populations (according to published norms). When compared to normative data from children with chronic conditions, children with ASD demonstrated worse HRQoL for total, psychosocial, emotional and social functioning, but did not demonstrate differing scores for physical and school functioning. HRQoL was not consistently related to ASD diagnosis or intellectual ability. However, it was consistently related to internalizing and externalizing problems as well as repetitive behaviors, social responsiveness, and adaptive behaviors. Associations among HRQoL and behavioral characteristics suggest that treatments aimed at improvements in these behaviors may improve HRQoL.

AB Our study examined the links between interparental violence and children's internalizing and externalizing problems by testing a theoretical model for indirect pathways from interparental violence to childhood emotional problems. Our theoretical model suggests that interparental violence is associated with maternal depression, maternal depression is associated with the use of maladaptive parenting practices, and maternal maladaptive parenting practices are associated with children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants included 359 women and one of their children between the ages of 5- and 12-years-old. Sixty-four of these women resided in a battered women's shelter, 100 of these women resided in the community but had a history of interparental violence, and 195 of these women were recruited as a comparison sample. Our theoretical model was supported by the results of structural equation modeling. However, a variation of the broader indirect pathway, one which indicates that interparental violence is related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems through maternal depression, which is then directly associated with children's internalizing and externalizing problems, was also supported. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and applied implications and suggest that longitudinal studies that clarify temporal relationships in the model are warranted.

AB We examined the associations and likely pathways underlying the relationships between peer attachment style, self-concept, and Internalizing/Externalizing Problems among high school students in Japan. A total of 228 senior high school students (186 boys and 82 girls; mean age = 16.4) completed the Attachment Questionnaire for Children, Self-Description Questionnaire II-Short, and Youth Self-Report. The main results were that securely attached adolescents reported fewer mental health problems and more positive self-concept than those who reported insecure attachment. Some patterns of associations among variables appeared to be different across gender. The Structural Equation Modeling provided a support for the mediating role of self-concept in influencing the relationships between Attachment and Internalizing Problems, but not Externalizing Problems. The paths for the model were significant across gender. The results promote understanding of psychological processes that influence the relationships between attachment and psychological well-being among high school adolescents in Japan.

AB Background:
   The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal relations among child maltreatment, emotion regulation, peer acceptance and rejection, and psychopathology.
   Methods:
   Data were collected on 215 maltreated and 206 nonmaltreated children (ages 6-12 years) from low-income families. Children were evaluated by camp counselors on emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and were nominated by peers for peer acceptance and rejection.
   Results:
   Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that experiencing neglect, physical and/or sexual abuse, multiple maltreatment subtypes, and earlier onset of maltreatment were related to emotion dysregulation. Lower emotion regulation (Time 1) was associated with higher externalizing symptomatology (Time 1) that contributed to later peer rejection (Time 2), which in turn was related to higher externalizing symptomatology (Time 2). Conversely, higher emotion regulation was predictive of higher peer acceptance over time, which was related to lower internalizing symptomatology controlling for initial levels of symptomatology.
   Conclusions:
   The findings emphasize the important role of emotion regulation as a risk or a protective mechanism in the link between earlier child maltreatment and later psychopathology through its influences on peer relations.

AB The current study examined the prevalence and presentation of psychosocial symptoms in pediatric patients and their parents presenting for first time appointments at a gastroenterology (GI) clinic compared to healthy controls (HC). One hundred GI patients, aged 8-17 years, and their mothers were compared to 100 age- and gender-matched HC on measures of child and parental behavioral/psychosocial functioning, depression, and anxiety. Results revealed significant correlations between mother- and child-reported internalizing behaviors and psychological symptoms. Significant group differences were observed in internalizing problems, adaptive and social skills, and leadership competency, as well as parental interpersonal sensitivity, depression, phobic anxiety, and number of psychological symptoms. GI patients are at increased risk for psychosocial and social dysfunction compared to healthy peers. Psychosocial factors should be considered when assessing patients in GI clinics. Patients might benefit from treatment plans that involve adjunctive behavioral intervention to assist patients in managing their conditions.

AB In this article, the authors examine the psychometric properties of the Student Risk Screening Scale (SRSS), including evaluating the concurrent validity of the SRSS to predict results from the Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD) when used to detect school children with externalizing or internalizing behavior concerns at three assessment points during one academic year. Results suggest strong internal consistency and test-retest stability. Analyses of receiver operating characteristics curves also suggest that the SRSS is more accurate for detecting externalizing than internalizing behaviors. The authors conclude by offering recommendations to school site teams and researchers interested in conducing systematic screenings at the elementary level. Limitations and future directions are offered.

AB Objective Foster children often experience compromising situations such as neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse before out-of-home placement. This article aims to give a literature review related to the development and mental health of foster children with special consideration of trauma history. Methods A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, PSYNDEXplus, and SCOPUS. We determined a time frame from 1998 to 2009. Results The literature search resulted in 32 articles reporting empirical data about development and mental health in foster children. Very high rates of exposure to maltreatment, developmental delays and mental disorders were found. A broad spectrum of externalizing as well as internalizing symptoms and a high prevalence of comorbid mental disorders were found. Conclusions Foster children exhibit a broad pattern of developmental problems and psychopathology. The etiology of these disorders is discussed in the context of multiple risk factors, especially that of persistent maltreatment.

AB Replication of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA) core syndrome factor structure with a sample of 124 randomly selected Hispanic/Latino youths is reported. The six ASCA core syndromes produced the identical two-factor solution observed in other samples. Principal-axis exploratory factor analysis using multiple factor extraction criteria and varimax, direct oblimin, and promax rotations produced nearly identical factor structure coefficients. Consistent with earlier studies, the ASCA was observed to measure two independent dimensions of youth psychopathology (Overactivity and Underactivity) that are similar to the conduct problems/externalizing and withdrawal/internalizing dimensions typically found in the child psychopathology assessment literature.

AB Objective: To investigate the longitudinal course of internalizing and externalizing problems and adaptive/prosocial behaviors among Sierra Leonean former child soldiers and whether postconflict factors contribute to adverse or resilient mental health outcomes. Method: Male and female former child soldiers (N = 260, aged 10 to 17 years at baseline) were recruited from the roster of an non-governmental organization (NGO)-run Interim Care Center in Kono District and interviewed in 2002, 2004, and 2008. The retention rate was 69%. Linear growth models were used to investigate trends related to war and postconflict experiences. Results: The long-term mental health of former child soldiers was associated with war experiences and postconflict risk factors, which were partly mitigated by postconflict protective factors. Increases in externalizing behavior were associated with killing/injuring others during the war and postconflict stigma, whereas increased community acceptance was associated with decreases in externalizing problems (b = -1.09). High baseline levels of internalizing problems were associated with being raped, whereas increases were associated with younger involvement in armed groups and social and economic hardships. Improvements in internalizing problems were associated with higher levels of community acceptance and increases in community acceptance (b = -0.86). Decreases in adaptive/prosocial behaviors were associated with killing/injuring others during the war and postconflict stigma, but partially mitigated by social support, being in school and increased community acceptance (b = 1.93). Conclusions: Psychosocial interventions for former child soldiers may be more effective if they account for postconflict factors in addition to war exposures. Youth with accumulated risk factors, lack of protective factors, and persistent distress should be identified. Sustainable services to promote community acceptance, reduce stigma, and expand social supports and educational access are recommended. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2010;49(6):606-615.

Child-report of hostile and coercive parenting was a salient predictor of child posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), internalizing symptoms, and personal adjustment. Caregivers' own trauma symptoms predicted caregiver-report of child PTSD, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but not child-reported child symptoms. Implications Jiff assessment and intervention following exposure to a PTE are emphasized.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the invariance of predictive relations across early-adolescent sex and ethnic groups regarding parenting factors and externalizing and internalizing problems and victimization. Data (n = 598; 54% female) from a triethnic (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black) probability sample of fifth graders collected from three sites (Birmingham, AL, Houston, TX, and Los Angeles, CA) were used in the analyses. Simultaneous group structural equation modeling supported the invariance of parenting-early adolescent outcomes across sex and ethnic groups. Parental monitoring and parental norms were relatively robust predictors of early-adolescent externalizing problems and victimization, and to a lesser extent, of internalizing problems. A maternal nurturance by parental monitoring interaction was statistically significant for all outcome behaviors, indicating that higher monitoring in conjunction with higher maternal nurturance was associated with lower levels of early-adolescent problem behaviors. The findings suggest that core parenting factors such as nurturance, monitoring, and normative expectations for early adolescent problem behaviors may serve as a foundation for parenting components of multi-component intervention studies.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the trajectories of behavioral problems for a sample of predominately minority adolescents (n = 212, 91% African-American and/or Hispanic, 45% boys, 55% girls) in a large, urban school district and to determine the impact of parental and peer relationships, gender, and risk status on their development during middle and high school. Multi-level growth modeling was the primary statistical procedure used to track internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems across time. Results indicated that behavioral problems as rated by students' teachers declined significantly for both boys and girls, a finding that is in direct contrast to previous studies of adolescent behavior. The quality of parental relationships was a strong predictor of both types of behavior whereas the quality of peer relationships predicted only internalizing behavioral symptoms. These findings suggest that behavioral trajectories may be somewhat unique for this population underscoring the need for additional research in this area. The findings also have implications for intervening with children and youth who display behavioral problems during critical developmental periods.

AB The experience of the spousal bereavement of widows who are single parents has been largely neglected in the literature. This qualitative study provides insight into how such women grieved over their spouse's death in Iran. In-depth interviews with 24 participants were held and field notes were written. The generated data were analyzed by using the constant comparative method. The results indicated four main categories: "intense grief", "becoming hopeless", "internalizing bereavement and continuing bonds", and "the contexts of experience of spousal death". The fourth category consisted of two subcategories: "the unexpected nature of death" and "full dependence". The findings suggested that hopelessness related to spousal death changed the lifestyles of the participants, which led to health risks in these women. We conclude that it is the duty of health-care professionals, especially nurses, to first identify widows at risk, with the help of the contexts of experience of spousal death and the symptoms presented in this study, and then to provide hope therapy, which can facilitate positive bereavement outcomes for healthier living after spousal death.

AB METHODS: Data were analyzed for a sample derived from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth: 1,836 youth who were 10-11 years old at the 1992, 1994 and 1996 waves. Mothers' reports of their child's socioemotional problems at age 10-11 were assessed; sexual initiation before age 15 was assessed using youth self-reports. Logistic regression analyses estimated associations between socioemotional problems and early initiation; predicted probabilities and group differences were calculated using various regression techniques.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of youth had had intercourse before turning 15, and their average level of each problem was higher than the level of those who had not. Both internalizing problems (e.g., depression and dependency) and externalizing problems (e.g., hyperactivity and antisocial behavior) were associated with early sexual initiation (odds ratios, 1.1 and 1.2, respectively), but only externalizing problems retained significance when both types were included in the model (1.2). Among specific problems, only hyperactivity and antisocial behavior were associated with early initiation (1.2 for each). Youth with a high level of externalizing problems had a higher predicted probability of having early sex than did those with a low level (0.28 vs. 0.21). Associations between socioemotional problems and early initiation did not differ by gender or by race or ethnicity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should be targeted at youth with externalizing problems, especially those who engage in antisocial or hyperactive behavior, in an effort to promote positive social interactions.

AB An attribution model was tested to explain the internalization of stigma among parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the model, the internalization paths from courtesy stigma to affiliate stigma and the impact of three types of social support on affiliate stigma and psychological well-being were examined. The study was conducted in Hong Kong, China: one hundred and eighty-eight parents of children with ASD were recruited to complete the questionnaire. The model showed excellent fit to the data. Path analysis suggested three possible paths of internalizing courtesy stigma, including the direct path to affiliate stigma, through perceived controllability, or through perceived responsibility and self-blame. Support from family, significant others, friends, or professionals was found to be related to affiliate stigma and psychological well-being differentially. The internalization of stigma among parents of ASD children was severe. The path model sheds light on possible ways to reduce stigma in future services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. We investigated the relation between the language status of children and their behavioral and emotional well-being during their early school years.
   Methods. Behavioral and emotional well-being were drawn from teacher-reported data and included externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Three-level growth curve analyses were conducted on a subsample (n = 12586) of children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, kindergarten cohort, who originated from Asian countries. US-born, non-Hispanic White children served as the comparison group.
   Results. All children started with a similar level of internalizing and externalizing behaviors at kindergarten entry. The growth rate of problem behaviors was slowest in fluent bilingual and non-English-dominant bilingual children compared with White English-monolingual children. By contrast, problem behaviors increased at a significantly faster rate in non-English-monolingual children, who had the highest level of problem behaviors among all children by fifth grade.
   Conclusions. By fifth grade, fluent bilingual and non-English-dominant bilingual children had the lowest levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, whereas non-English-monolingual children had the highest levels of both behavior problems. Our data suggest emotional and behavioral benefits of being bilingual. (Am J Public Health. 2010;100:831-838. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2009.174219)

AB Objective: To test the effect of prenatal and infancy home visits by nurses on 12-year-old, firstborn children's use of substances, behavioral adjustment, and academic achievement.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Public system of obstetric and pediatric care in Memphis, Tennessee.
   Participants: We studied 12-year-old, firstborn children (n = 613) of primarily African American, economically disadvantaged women (743 randomized during pregnancy).
   Intervention: Program of prenatal and infancy home visits by nurses.
   Outcome Measures: Use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana; internalizing, externalizing, and total behavioral problems; and academic achievement.
   Results: By the time the firstborn child was 12 years of age, those visited by nurses, compared with those in the control group, reported fewer days of having used cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana during the 30-day period before the 12-year interview (0.03 vs 0.18, P = .02) and were less likely to report having internalizing disorders that met the borderline or clinical threshold (22.1% vs 30.9%, P = .04). Nurse-visited children born to mothers with low psychological resources, compared with their control group counterparts, scored higher on the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests in reading and math (88.78 vs 85.70, P = .009) and, during their first 6 years of education, scored higher on group-administered standardized tests of math and reading achievement (40.52 vs 34.85, P = .02). No statistically significant program effects were found on children's externalizing or total behavioral problems.
   Conclusions: Through age 12, the program reduced children's use of substances and internalizing mental health problems and improved the academic achievement of children born to mothers with low psychological resources.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether prenatal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant exposure affects behavior in 3-year-olds of antenatally anxious or depressed mothers and whether risk was moderated by the serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4) genotype.
   Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort design.
   Setting: Vancouver.
   Participants: Mothers and their 3-year-old children (n = 33 SSRI exposed and n = 42 nonexposed).
   Main Exposures: Prenatal exposure to SSRI antidepressants and prenatal and postnatal maternal mood disturbances.
   Main Outcome Measures: Parent report of child behavior (ChildBehavior Checklist, ages 1.5-5 years) and the child SLC6A4 genotype. The covariates used were maternal mood during the third trimester, 3 months post partum, and at the 3-year follow-up study and the child's 5-minute Apgar score.
   Results: Prenatal exposure to both maternal depressed mood and SSRI antidepressants were associated with increased internalizing behaviors during early childhood, whereas current maternal mood increased risk for externalizing behaviors. Increased child anxiety and depression symptoms were predicted by higher third-trimester maternal anxiety only in children with 2 short S alleles. In contrast, increased aggression and externalizing behaviors were predicted by third-trimester maternal anxiety only in children with 2 copies of the L allele.
   Conclusions: Exposure to prenatal SSRIs and maternal mood had distinct effects on child behavior at 3 years of age, reflected in an increased level of internalizing behaviors. The impact of antenatal maternal anxiety on child mood was moderated by the child SLC6A4 genotype. Despite SSRI treatment for prenatal maternal mood disturbances, childhood behavior at 3 years of age remained at risk.

AB The aim of the present study was to review and update historical controversies in relation to the limbic system in light of advances in the neuroanatmy and neurobiology of cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) neural circuits. It is hypothesized that observed comorbidities between internalizing and externalizing childhood syndromes may be better understood in terms of excess communication between subcortical brain circuits. A neuroanatomical understanding of reciprocal and non-reciprocal connections between modular circuits provides a basis for understanding previously puzzling aspects of internalizing, externalizing comorbidity. Function depends on the degree of cooperative integration of goal orientation, Pavlovian stimulus response, and operant processing in cortical-subcortical circuits, and interventions may be targeted at any of these functions.</.

AB Relations were examined between children's sleep and their externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Longitudinal relations were examined when children were in 3rd (T1) and 5th (T2) grades, and cross-sectional relations were assessed at T2. Participants included 176 children at T1 (M = 8.68 years) and 141 children at T2 (M = 10.70 years). Sleep was examined via subjective reports and actigraphy. Children reported on anxiety, self-esteem, and depression symptoms, and parents reported on children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Cross-sectionally and longitudinally, sleep problems were associated with worse adjustment outcomes; African American children or those from lower socioeconomic status homes were at particular risk. Findings highlight the importance of adequate sleep for children's optimal development, especially in the context of ecological risk.

AB The current study examines the effects of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms on increases in victimization over a 1-year period. Using longitudinal data from the Developmental Victimization Survey (DVS), analyses are based on a national probability sample of 1,467 children aged 2-17. Results indicate that children with high levels of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms were particularly likely to experience increased exposure to several forms of victimization, including peer victimization, maltreatment, and sexual victimization, controlling for earlier victimization and adversity. The relationship of symptoms to victimization exposure differed across developmental stage. Elementary school-age children with high levels of symptoms were especially vulnerable to victimization by peers, whereas distressed youth in early adolescence were particularly vulnerable to sexual victimization. Mental health problems in childhood and adolescence appear to represent important risk factors for increased victimization. Future interventions might consider targeting youth with co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms during especially vulnerable developmental stages.

AB Based upon Bourdieu's 'theory of capital' and Willis's 'theory of cultural production', the article scrutinizes the interrelation between perceived discrimination, self-exclusion and cultural differentiation. The empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal study by the German Youth Institute, which was set up to explore the transition of young Turks from school to vocational training and employment. The data point out that young immigrants who are dealing with experiences of devaluation of their (origin-)specific cultural capital and who are disadvantaged regarding the accessibility of dominant cultural capital bring about a production of a counterculture. They are less likely to exclude themselves in the sense of internalizing the rightness of the dominant culture.

AB The person-oriented approach seeks to match theories and methods that portray development as a holistic, highly interactional, and individualized process. Over the past decade, this approach has gained popularity in developmental psychopathology research, particularly as model-based varieties of person-oriented methods have emerged. Although these methods allow some principles of person-oriented theory to be tested, little attention has been paid to the fact that these methods cannot test other principles, and may actually be inconsistent with certain principles. Lacking clarification regarding which aspects of person-oriented theory are testable under which person-oriented methods, assumptions of the methods have sometimes been presented as testable hypotheses or interpreted as affirming the theory. This general blurring of the line between person-oriented theory and method has even led to the occasional perception that the method is the theory and vice versa. We review assumptions, strengths, and limitations of model-based person-oriented methods, clarifying which theoretical principles they can test and the compromises and trade-offs required to do so.

AB The current study investigated concurrent and longitudinal mediated and mediated moderation pathways among maltreatment, self-perception (i.e., loneliness and self-esteem), social support, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. For both genders, early childhood maltreatment (i.e., ages 0-6) was related directly to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 6, and later maltreatment (i.e., ages 6-8) was directly related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 8. Results of concurrent mediation and mediated moderation indicated that early maltreatment was significantly related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 6 indirectly both through age 6 loneliness and self-esteem for boys and through age 6 loneliness for girls. Significant moderation of the pathway from early maltreatment to self-esteem, and for boys, significant mediated moderation to emotional and behavioral problems were found, such that the mediated effect through self-esteem varied across levels of social support, though in an unexpected direction. No significant longitudinal mediation or mediated moderation was found, however, between the age 6 mediators and moderator and internalizing or externalizing problems at age 8. The roles of the hypothesized mediating and moderating mechanisms are discussed, with implications for designing intervention and prevention programs.

AB This study pursued three goals. The first goal was to explore children's trajectories of anxiety from age 6 to 12 using a representative community sample. The second goal was to assess the link between certain behavioral characteristics assessed in kindergarten (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and low prosociality) and these trajectories. The third goal was to determine whether certain aspects of maternal parenting (i.e., warmth and discipline) could moderate the association between these characteristics and the trajectories of anxiety. A population sample of 2,000 children (1,001 boys, 999 girls) participated in this longitudinal study. Developmental trajectory analyses allowed us to identify four trajectory groups: low, low-increasing, high-declining,, and high anxiety groups. Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions revealed a profile of children at risk of developing high anxiety symptoms (i.e., high group), characterized by sociofamily adversity, inattention, and low prosociality in the classroom. Hyperactivity was also found in this profile, but only for children exposed to a mother who showed little affective warmth. Finally, mothers' high level of discipline increased the odds of belonging to the high anxiety group. The results are discussed in relation to studies examining the association among anxiety, behavioral characteristics, and parenting during childhood.

AB Many problem behaviors in youth have been attributed to maladaptive self-regulation in response to frustration. Frontolimbic networks that promote flexible as well as over- and undercontrolled regulation could provide evidence linking cortical mechanisms of self-regulation to the development of internalizing or externalizing symptomology. Specifically, ineffective dorsally mediated inhibitory control may be associated with rule-breaking and substance use behaviors, whereas overengagement of ventral limbic systems responsible for self-monitoring of errors may increase risk of developing anxious and depressed symptomology. In this study, a sample of 9- to 13-year-old children were presented with an emotional go/no-go task. Event-related potentials were used to identify differences in cortical mechanisms related to inhibitory control (indexed with the stimulus-locked medial frontal negativity) and self-monitoring (indexed with the error-related negativity). These measurements were then related to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. As predicted, externalizing problems were associated with smaller medial frontal negativity amplitudes, which indicate undercontrolled self-regulation and poor dorsal mediation of actions. Internalizing symptoms were related to larger error-related negativity amplitudes, demonstrating overregulation and overengagement of ventral limbic systems. These findings suggest that the use of event-related potential methodology with paradigms that elicit cognition emotion can provide insight into the neural mechanisms of regulatory deficits that result in problem behaviors in youth.

TI The Social Competence of Latino Kindergartners and Growth in

LA English
DT Article
DE Latino child development; social competence; cognitive growth
ID UNITED-STATES; CHILD-CARE; POVERTY
AB We know that social competence contributes to young children's adaptation to, and cognitive learning within, classroom settings. Yet initial evidence is mixed on the social competencies that Latino children bring to kindergarten and the extent to which these skills advance cognitive growth. Building from ecocultural and developmental-risk theory, this paper shows children's social competence to be adaptive to the normative expectations and cognitive requirements of culturally bounded settings in both the home and classroom. Latino socialization in the home may yield social competencies that teachers value rather than reflect "risk factors" that constrain children's school readiness. We draw on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, kindergarten cohort (N = 19,590) to detail 5 social competencies at entry to school self-control, interpersonal skills, approaches to learning, internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors-and to examine variability among Latino subgroups. We then test the extent to which baseline variation in social competence accounts for children's cognitive growth during the kindergarten year. We find that Latino children from poor. but not middle-class. families display weaker social competencies vis-a-vis White children (all relationships p <= .05). Social competence levels contribute to Latino children's cognitive growth. which is shaped most strongly by positive approaches to learning. The disparities in competencies observed for Latino children from poor families, relative to White children, are significant yet much smaller than gaps in baseline levels of mathematical understanding. We discuss how the consonance or mismatch between competencies acquired at home and those valued by teachers must consider cultural differences, social-class position, and variation among diverse Latino subgroups.

AB The spirituality and religiosity of Indonesian Muslim adolescents were examined longitudinally as were the relations of spirituality and religiosity with (mal)adjustment. At Time 1 (T1). 959 seventh-grade Muslim adolescents were screened for selection of a sample: at Time 2 (T2), 183 eighth-grade adolescents participated: and at Time 3 (T3), 300 ninth-grade adolescents (164 new participants) participated. At T1 adolescents' peer likeability was assessed: at T2. adolescents' global and cognitive esteem were measured: and at T2 and T3, adolescents' (mal)adjustment, spirituality, and religiosity were assessed. Adolescents and parents rated aspects of (mat (adjustment. spirituality. and religiosity. Teachers also rated adolescents' (mal)adjustment. In general. we found that T2 spirituality and religiosity were positively related to T3 adjustment and negatively related to T3 maladjustment. although in panel models. support for prediction of outcomes from spirituality and religiosity was found only for loneliness and socially appropriate behavior. In addition, there was some evidence in the models that certain Aspects of (mal)adjustment (self-esteem and social competence, and to a marginal degree, parent-rated internalizing problems and teacher-rated prosociality) predicted spirituality and religiosity longitudinally.

AB Short-term and long-term predictors of therapeutic change due to parent management training were investigated. Therapeutic change was defined as the change in outcome measures [externalizing problem behavior and parenting self-efficacy (PSE)] from before treatment to afterward. Three different types of predictors were analyzed: child variables (gender, age, and initial externalizing and internalizing behavior), parent variables (age, initial PSE and parental psychopathology) and socioeconomic status and other sociodemographic characteristics of the family (parental school education, employment, family status, language). The parent management training was part of the Prevention Program for Externalizing Problem Behavior, which was evaluated as an effectiveness trial under routine care conditions using a within-subject control group design. Between 78 and 270 families were included in the analysis, which investigated therapeutic change over two time intervals: (1) immediate change from the pre-treatment to the post-treatment assessments, and (2) long-term-change from pre-treatment to 1-year follow-up. Throughout several analyses, the only predictor of therapeutic change that was consistently significant over the two time periods for the externalizing problem behavior of the child was the initial externalizing problem behavior. More impaired children improved more. Similarly, the only predictor of therapeutic change for the two time periods in PSE was the initial level of PSE. Parents with less PSE gained more during the course of the training.

AB In the current study, we examined parent gender differences in feelings (negativity and positivity) and perceptions of child behavioural and emotional problems in adoptive and biological parent child dyads. In a sample of 85 families, we used a novel within-family adoption design in which one child was adopted and one child was a biological child of the couple, and tested whether the links between parent feelings and child maladjustment included effects of passive gene environment correlation. Parents reported more negativity and less positivity as well as higher levels of externalizing behaviour for the adopted child compared to the non-adopted child, although effect sizes were small and no longer statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Fathers and mothers did not differ significantly in their reports of positive and negative feelings towards their children or in regard to child externalizing and internalizing behaviours. The correlations between parental negativity and positivity and child externalizing and internalizing were similar for fathers and mothers, and for adopted and non-adopted children. The findings suggest similar parent child relationship processes for fathers and mothers, and that genetic transmission of behaviour from parent to child does not account for the association between parental warmth and hostility and child-adjustment problems.

AB The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of a brief Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (the MISC-SP) designed to enhance the quality of mothers' interaction with their toddlers who have sensory processing disorders (SPD). The basic assumption was that quality parent child interactions can serve as a protective factor moderating the potential negative effects of toddlers' sensory processing and regulation difficulties on their development. The effects of the intervention were compared to those of another intervention designed to enhance children's sensory functioning (the SI group) and to a control group receiving no intervention. Participants were 86 toddlers (12-18 months old) with SPD and their mothers, who were randomly assigned to the aforementioned three research groups. Following the intervention period, mothers in the MISC-SP group showed more sensitive behavior, supported their toddlers' communication behavior better, and used teaching behaviors more appropriately than did mothers in the two other groups.

AB Objective: Affect regulation models of disordered eating propose that disordered eating behaviors function as maladaptive efforts to modulate or escape from aversive emotional states. Prior studies have shown both negative affect and emotion regulation factors to be significantly associated with disordered eating and body dissatisfaction in women. The purpose of the current investigation was to evaluate whether emotion regulation difficulties contribute to disordered eating and body dissatisfaction in men.
   Method: Two hundred and ninety-six undergraduate men completed a series of questionnaires assessing negative affect, difficulties in emotion regulation, disordered eating, and body dissatisfaction.
   Results: A series of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties accounted for unique variance in both outcome measures after accounting for the variance associated with BMI and negative affect.
   Discussion: Results are discussed in terms of the role of emotion regulation difficulties in the etiology and maintenance of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in men. (C) 2009 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of these studies was to examine the frequency and stability of relational and physical aggression and their associations with social-psychological adjustment or peer victimization, and how friendships are involved in the relations between forms of aggression and peer victimization in Japanese children. The sample consisted of 452 (Study 1) and 138 (Study 2) children who were in the fourth and fifth grades. Results of Study 1 demonstrated that relational aggression was uniquely and more strongly associated with internalizing adjustment problems than physical aggression. Moreover, Study 2 revealed that relational aggression and physical aggression were stable over a 6-month period and the stability of relational aggression was reinforced by negative friendships (i.e., high levels of exclusivity and friend victimization). Further, the association between relational aggression and relative increases in relational victimization was attenuated by positive friendships (i.e., high levels of intimacy, companionship, and friendship satisfaction). Interestingly, friendships were unrelated to physical aggression and its relation to physical victimization. The age and gender of the children in the two studies were also examined. Cultural and developmental processes involving forms of aggression, friendships, social-psychological adjustment, and peer victimization were discussed.

AB This study investigated the type and stability of temperament profiles in toddlers, and relations of profile probability to negative and positive parenting trajectories. Mothers (N = 96) rated their child's (41 girls and 54 boys) Sociability, Anger Proneness, and Activity Level four times during 1 year. The assessment of parenting included both maternal self-reports and observational measures. Latent profile analysis indicated three child temperament profiles: a well-adjusted 'typical' profile, an 'expressive' profile with heightened externalizing problems, and a 'fearful' profile with heightened internalizing problems. Although toddlers' profile classifications were highly stable across 1 year, individual differences in (changes in) toddlers' temperament profile probability occurred. We identified negative and positive parenting as environmental mechanisms that were related to the development of temperament profiles over time. These results support the notion that, in addition to having a genetic base, temperament is subject to maturation and experience over time.

AB The goal of this exploratory, within-family, longitudinal study was to examine whether children's perspectives of the mother-child relationship explained within-family differences in children's responses to a shared family stressor (maternal depressive symptoms) over time. Children (ages 8 to 15 years; N = 68) residing in 34 families were drawn from a general population study in the UK. Predictor variables were assessed at Time 1 and change in internalizing behavior from Time 1 to Time 2 (2 years later) was examined. As children were nested within families, data were analyzed using multilevel modeling, controlling for previous child behavior. Child perspective of the mother-child relationship, in interaction with maternal depressive symptoms, was found to explain within-family differences in internalizing over time. Children with a negative perspective (compared to mothers' perspectives) were the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms.

AB Existing structural models of psychopathology need to be expanded to include additional diagnostic constructs beyond mood, anxiety, substance use, and antisocial behavior disorders. The goal of this study was to locate eating disorders within a hierarchical structural model of psychopathology that is anchored by broad Internalizing and Externalizing factors. Participants were female adolescent twins (N = 1,434) from the Minnesota Twin Family Study. The authors compared the fit of 4 models in which eating disorders (a) defined their own diagnostic class, (b) represented a subclass within Internalizing, (c) formed a subclass within Externalizing, and (d) were allowed to cross-load on both Internalizing and Externalizing. In the best fitting model, eating disorders formed a subfactor within Internalizing. These findings underscore the value of developing more comprehensive empirically based models of psychopathology to increase researchers' understanding of diverse mental disorders.

DE Peer stressors; Mental health; Adolescents; Gender
ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS; PROBLEM BEHAVIORS; LIFE
   EVENTS; VICTIMIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; GENERATION; ONSET; BOYS
AB Purpose: This study tested two hypotheses about gender-specific mental health effects of peer stressors during early adolescence: (1) boys and girls are sensitive to different types of peer stressors, and (2) peer stress is associated with different mental health problems in boys and girls.
   Methods: These two hypotheses were tested in a prospective large population cohort of 2,084 Dutch young adolescents. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured at baseline and follow-up, whereas stressful life events in the period between baseline and follow-up were measured retrospectively at follow-up. We performed the analyses with two types of peer stressors; victimization at school and relationship losses.
   Results: Relationship losses were more strongly associated with internalizing and externalizing problems in girls than boys, supporting the first hypothesis. Peer victimization at school was also associated with both types of mental health problems, but equally strong in boys and girls.
   Conclusions: Peer stress is unlikely to be associated with different mental health problems in boys and girls. Instead, boys and girls are more likely to be susceptible to different types of peer stressors. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined associations between parental cultural orientation, childhood shyness, and anxiety symptoms in a sample of Hispanic American children (N = 127). Parents completed measures of their level of acculturation, collectivism, and socialization goals, while children provided self-reports of anxiety symptoms and both parents and children provided reports of children's shyness. Results provided some support for the relationship between parental cultural orientation and expressed shyness in children. Additionally, results suggested that although increasing levels of parental collectivism are associated with more consistent levels of child shyness across social contexts: shyness with peers is uniquely associated with anxiety symptoms. Implications of these results for future research on social development and internalizing problems in Hispanic children are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background:
   The development of epidemiological instruments has enabled the assessment of mental disorders in youth in countries that plan policy according to evidence-based principles. The Israel Survey of Mental Health among Adolescents (ISMEHA) was conducted in 2004-2005 in a representative sample of 957 adolescents aged 14-17 and their mothers.
   Methods:
   The aims of this study were to estimate prevalence rates of internalizing and externalizing mental disorders and their socio-demographic and health correlates. Disorders were ascertained with the Development and Well-Being Assessment inventory and verified by child psychiatrists.
   Results:
   The prevalence rates were 11.7%, 8.1% and 4.8% for any disorder, internalizing disorders and externalizing disorders, respectively. Distinct risk factors were associated with the different types of disorders: internalizing disorders were associated with female gender, chronic medical conditions and being cared for by a welfare agency. Risk factors for externalizing disorders were male gender, having divorced or single parents, being an only child or having only one sibling. Learning disability was associated with both types of disorders.
   Conclusions:
   The risk and protective factors related to internalizing and externalizing disorders are interpreted within the framework of family composition in this multicultural society.

AB Objective: To study perinatal risk factors for psychiatric symptoms in adolescents born preterm with very low birth weight or at term, but small for gestational age (GA). Method: Mental health was assessed in 65 adolescents born with very low birth weight (VLBW) (birth weight <= 1500 g), 59 born term small for GA (birth weight <10th centile) and 81 control adolescents using Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Children's Global Assessment Scale, Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale IV and Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. Perinatal data included birth weight, GA, head circumference, Apgar scores, intraventricular hemorrhage, days in neonatal intensive care unit, and days on mechanical ventilation. Results: In the very low birth weight group, lower birth weight was associated with inattention (p < .01), psychiatric diagnoses, and reduced psychosocial function (p <= .05). Intraventricular hemorrhage increased the risk for a high inattention score (odds ratio = 7.5; 95% confidence intervals: 1.2-46.8). Lower Apgar score at 1 min was associated with a high Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire score and lower Apgar score at 5 min with a high internalizing score (p <= .05). In the subgroup born appropriate for GA, internalizing symptoms were also associated with lower GA. In the term small for GA group, perinatal events were not associated with psychiatric problems. In contrast, low socioeconomic status was associated with externalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Lower birth weight, shorter gestation, and intraventricular hemorrhage were risk factors for psychiatric problems in the very low birth weight group. Lower Apgar score increased the risk for autism spectrum symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Among adolescents born term small for GA, the main risk factor for psychiatric symptoms was low socioeconomic status.

AB BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to assess the factorial validity and reliability of the Iranian versions of the personality and behavior system scales (49 items) of the AHDQ (The Adolescent Health and Development Questionnaire) and interrelations among them based on Jessor's PBT (Problem Behavior Theory).
   METHODS: A multi-staged approach was employed. The cross-cultural adaptation was performed according to the internationally recommended methodology, using the following guidelines: translation, back-translation, revision by a committee, and pretest. After modifying and identifying of the best items, a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of Persian version using calibration and validation samples of adolescents. Also 113 of them completed it again two weeks later for stability.
   RESULTS: The findings of the exploratory factor analysis suggested that the 7-factor solution with low self concept, emotional distress, general delinquency, cigarette, hookah, alcohol, and hard drugs use provided a better fitting model. The a range for these identified factors was 0.69 to 0.94, the ICC range was 0.73 to 0.93, and there was a significant difference in mean scores for these instruments in compare between the male normative and detention adolescents. The first and second-order measurement models testing found good model fit for the 7-factor model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Factor analyses provided support of existence internalizing and externalizing problem behavior syndrome. With those qualifications, this model can be applied for studies among Persian adolescents.

AB Objective: This study investigated the associations of poverty and food insecurity over a 2-year period with internalizing and externalizing problems in a large, community-based sample. Method: A total of 2,810 children were interviewed between ages 4 and 14 years at baseline, and between ages 5 and 16 years at follow-up. Primary caregivers reported on household income, food insecurity, and were administered the Child Behavior Checklist, from which we derived indicators of clinically significant internalizing and externalizing problems. Prevalence ratios for the associations of poverty and food insecurity with behavior problems were estimated. Results: At baseline, internalizing and externalizing problems were significantly more prevalent among children who lived in poor households than in nonpoor households, and among children who lived in food insecure households than in food-secure households. In adjusted analyses, children from homes that were persistently food insecure were 1.47 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.94) times more likely to have internalizing problems and 2.01 (95% CI = 1.21 to 3.35) times more likely to have externalizing problems compared with children from households that were never food insecure. Children from homes that moved from food secure to insecure were 1.78 (95% CI = 1.07 to 2.94) times more likely to have externalizing problems at follow-up. Conclusions: Persistent food insecurity is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, even after adjusting for sustained poverty and other potential confounders. These results implicate food insecurity as a novel risk factor for child mental well-being; if causal, this represents an important factor in the etiology of child psychopathology, and potentially a new avenue for prevention.

AB Objective: To identify trajectories of behavioral adjustment from age 6 through 14 years for youth placed in early foster care, and to examine links between trajectories and early cognitive ability and social competence, caregiver stability, and frequency, timing, and type of maltreatment. Method: Participants were 279 youth from the Southwest site of the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). All youth had spent at least 5 months in out-of-home care before age 4 years because of substantiated reports of maltreatment. Behavioral adjustment was assessed using caregiver reports on the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Cognitive ability and social competence were assessed at age 6. Caregiver stability was recorded every 2 years from age 6 through 14 years and summed. Child protective services (CPS) maltreatment reports were coded for type and frequency. Results: Growth mixture modeling identified three internalizing trajectories: stable adjustment (66.7%), mixed/decreasing adjustment (25.4%), and increasing adjustment (7.9%). Four externalizing trajectories were identified: stable adjustment (46.6%), mixed adjustment (28.7%), increasing adjustment (8.2%), and stable maladjustment (16.5%). Trajectories of stable or increasing adjustment were predicted by social competence, cognitive ability, placement stability, and low frequency of physical abuse from ages 6 through 14. Conclusions: Many youth who have spent time in early out-of-home care evidence stable, long-term positive behavioral adjustment. Trajectories reflecting more positive adjustment are associated with early child cognitive ability and social competence, long-term caregiver stability, and low frequency of physical abuse in middle childhood and adolescence.

TI What's in a Disruptive Disorder? Temperamental Antecedents of

AB Objective: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is classified as a disruptive disorder, but shows a wide range of associations with other psychopathology, including internalizing problems. The reasons for these associations are unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that two distinct early temperamental precursors emotionality and activity underlie ODD and differentially predict its comorbidities. Method: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) community-based representative sample was used. Temperamental dimensions at the age of 38 months were derived through exploratory factor analysis from the Emotionality Activity Sociability (EAS) scale and used in logistic regression predicting to psychiatric diagnoses at the age of 91 months. Results: Pure ODD was predicted by both emotionality (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1.34, CI = 1.09 to 1.66) and activity (RRR = 1.39, CI = 1.07 to 1.81). The strongest predictions were from early temperament to ODD with comorbidity: from emotionality to ODD plus internalizing disorders (RRR = 3.33, CI = 2.14 to 5.19), and from activity to ODD plus ADHD (RRR = 3.24, CI = 1.48 to 7.11). Temperamental activity was a predictor of the hyperactive-impulsive and combined types of ADHD but not of the inattentive type. Conclusions: Classified as a disruptive disorder, ODD is predicted by early emotion dysregulation as well as by high levels of temperamental activity. The findings of this study suggest that early emotionality and activity differentially contribute to the phenotype of ODD in middle childhood and may determine its range of co-occurrence with other psychopathology. Taking into account the heterogeneous origins of childhood oppositionality may help to refine clinical approaches to ODD. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2010;49(5):474-483.

AB Objective: To examine whether oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) rather than conduct disorder (CD) may explain the comorbidity between behavioral disorders and depression; to test whether distinct affective and behavioral dimensions can be discerned within the symptoms of ODD; and to determine whether an affective dimension of ODD symptoms is specifically predictive of later depression. Method: The dimensions of ODD and their prediction to later CD and depression were examined in a community sample of 2,451 girls between the ages of 5 and 8 years, followed up annually over a 5-year period, using parent, child, and teacher questionnaire ratings of the severity of symptoms of psychopathology. Results: Dimensions of negative affect, oppositional behavior, and antagonistic behavior were found within ODD symptoms. Negative affect predicted later depression. Oppositional and antagonistic behavior predicted CD overall, and for Caucasian girls, negative affect also predicted later CD. CD was not predictive of later depression, controlling for comorbid conditions. Conclusions: ODD plays a key role in the early development of psychopathology. It is central in the comorbidity between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, which may be caused by a dimension of negative affective symptoms within ODD. How this dimension relates to later CD appears to vary by race. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2010;49(5) :484-492.

AB Suicide and parasuicides (i.e. suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt) have long been recognized as serious social problems, especially among youth. A series of logistic regression models were developed incorporating various internalizing and externalizing risk factors experienced by young people with the goal of predicting parasuicides among Canadian youth. The main objective of the research is to determine whether or not there are significant sex differences between these internalizing and externalizing influences on suicidal behavior. Data were used from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Waves 3 through 6, for a total sample of 2,499 15-year olds (48.9% male). Results show that both suicidal ideation and attempt are more frequent for girls compared to boys. Contrary to expectations, externalizing problems had a greater impact on girls and internalizing problems had a marginally greater impact on boys. This casts doubt on the notion that "bad boys" and "sad girls" are at greater risk for suicidal behavior. These results are discussed in light of their substantive importance, policy implications, and suggestions for future research.

AB Rejection sensitivity, the tendency to anxiously or angrily expect rejection, is associated with internalizing difficulties during childhood and adolescence. The primary goal of the present study was to examine whether supportive parent-child relationships and friendships moderate associations that link angry and anxious rejection sensitivity to depression and social anxiety during middle adolescence in an ethnically diverse sample of 277 youth (M age = 14.30 years; 46.93% male). Analyses revealed that angry rejection sensitivity was related to depressive symptoms, but only for adolescents reporting low support from parents and friends. Friend support moderated the association between (1) angry rejection sensitivity and social anxiety, and (2) anxious rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms. For adolescents reporting low support from friends, support from parents was positively related to social anxiety. Findings highlight the importance of considering relationships in studies of rejection sensitivity and adjustment during adolescence.

AB Aims: Knowledge of sleep problems and their relationships among adolescent psychiatric patients is limited. This study investigated whether adolescents in specialty mental health care differ in rate and correlates of sleep problems from adolescents in a community sample; 2465 adolescents from a community sample were compared with a representative clinical sample of 129 adolescent patients. Methods: Comparisons were made on frequent sleep problems according to scores on the Youth Self-Report, the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and instruments assessing coping styles, stresses and family functioning. Results: Sleep problems were more frequent in the clinical sample than the community sample (31.3% vs. 5%). Sleeping little and being overtired were the most common sleep problems. Sleep problems were multivariately associated with internalizing problems in both samples. Poor family functioning and distractive coping were multivariately associated with sleep problems among adolescent patients, whereas depressive symptoms were multivariately associated in community adolescents. Conclusions: Prevalences of sleep problems were high among adolescent patients. However, sleep problems may be in danger of being unnoticed in clinical practice. Clinicians should ask about such problems and be aware of possible connections with family functioning, depression and suicidality. Therapeutic interventions directed towards sleep problems should be considered.</.

AB Background. Adolescents who consult for substance misuse problems are at increased risk for multiple adverse outcomes from ages 21 to 50. Method. The sample included 180 adolescents who consulted a clinic for substance misuse and 251 of their parents. Adolescents and parents completed diagnostic interviews and independently completed questionnaires reporting on maltreatment of the adolescents. The adolescents completed questionnaires on substance misuse, illegal activities and relationships with others. Information was extracted from the criminal register. Twelve months later, 86% of the adolescents again completed a diagnostic interview, responded to questions about treatments they had received and completed questionnaires as before. In addition, information was extracted from health and social service files. Results. Six problem domains were defined to include externalizing and internalizing disorders, substance misuse, and violent and non-violent self-reported offending. These were generally stable during the 12-month follow-up, but some adolescents did improve, while others developed new problems. Change in the number of problem domains over the 12-month period was predicted by the number of problem domains present at first contact with the clinic and negatively by treatment during the follow-up period. Conclusion. Adolescents who consulted for substance misuse presented multiple mental health and psychosocial problems, which had been present for many years. The multiplicity of problems largely determined outcome 12 months later. Effective interventions are needed to target each problem domain. Identification and intervention with young children presenting mental health problems are needed to avoid the accumulation of problems observed in this sample of adolescents.</.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2), a 2-item depression-screening scale, among adolescents.
   METHODS: After completing a brief depression screen, 499 youth (aged 13-17 years) who were enrolled in an integrated health care system were invited to participate in a full assessment, including a longer depression-screening scale (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression screen) and a structured mental health interview (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children). Eighty-nine percent (n = 444) completed the assessment. Criterion validity and construct validity were tested by examining associations between the PHQ-2 and other measures of depression and functional impairment.
   RESULTS: A PHQ-2 score of >= 3 had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 75% for detecting youth who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for major depression on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 82% for detecting youth who met criteria for probable major depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression screen. On receiver operating characteristic analysis, the PHQ-2 had an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.92), and a cut point of 3 was optimal for maximizing sensitivity without loss of specificity for detecting major depression. Youth with a PHQ-2 score of >= 3 had significantly higher functional-impairment scores and significantly higher scores for parent-reported internalizing problems than youth with scores of <3.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PHQ-2 has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting major depression. These properties, coupled with the brief nature of the instrument, make this tool promising as a first step for screening for adolescent depression in primary care. Pediatrics 2010; 125: e1097-e1103

AB Psychometric study of the Children's Behavior Problem Screening Test SP. The main purpose of the study was to create a screening test for children's behavior problems (SPCI) and to carry out psychometric analyses of its reliability and validity. The sample comprised 1,272 participants, 671 boys and 601 girls, ages between 5 and 12 years, of whom 937 randomly selected individuals had no clinical diagnosis, and 335 intentionally selected individuals had a clinical diagnosis (criterial groups). The results obtained reveal that the SPCI: I) has high internal consistency; 2) it allows discrimination of children with and without behavior problems; children with and without emotional problems; and children with and without intellectual problems. which confirms its criterial validity: 3) more differences were found between boys and girls in the non-clinical sample (somatization, anxiety, dependent children, attention-hyperactivity, disruptive behavior, academic performance, violent behaviour) than in the clinical sample (attention-hyperactivity, disruptive behavior, academic performance, violent behaviour). However, in the total screening, the results was significantly higher in boys in both groups. Factor analysis revealed two factors, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.

AB Children from families of alcoholics and drug addicts are a high-risk group for developing a mental or substance-related disorder. The parental substance-related disorder can cause different effects on the physical, mental, and cognitive health of children in various stages of development, particularly internalizing and externalizing disorders. For the development of the mental health of these children, the promotion of resilience and protective factors play a crucial role. General and specific resilience and protective factors, which are relevant for prevention and intervention for children of alcoholics and substance users, are presented based on empirical studies. Resilience is commonly understood as a mental hardiness of children and adolescents to biological, mental, and psychosocial developmental risks. Important is the multilevel consideration of internal and external protective factors. In doing so, resilience is understood as a process that is subject to fluctuations over the course of life. The "stress-strain-coping-support" model is suitable for the theoretical concept of preventive measures for children of alcoholics and drug addicts.

AB Objective: To provide a best estimate of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among detained male adolescents, with particular emphasis on impairment, multi-informant assessment, and race or ethnicity.
   Method: Computer-assisted searches were executed to identify relevant studies.
   Results: Fifteen studies using adolescents as informants met inclusion criteria (n = 3401), of which only 2 reported within a subsample on parent-derived diagnoses. The mean prevalence of any disorder was 69.9% (95% CI 69.5% to 70.3%); with conduct disorder occurring most frequently (46.4%, 95% CI 45.6% to 47.3%), followed by substance use disorder (45.1%, 95% CI 44.6% to 45.5%), oppositional defiant disorder (19.8%, 95% CI 19.2% to 20.3%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (13.5%, 95% CI 13.2% to 13.9%). Although lower, rates for internalizing disorders were still substantial, with any anxiety disorder found in 15.9% (95% CI 15.6% to 16.1%), major depression in 12.0% (95% CI 11.7% to 12.2%), and posttraumatic stress disorder in 9.6% (95% CI 9.2% to 10.0%). Three studies reported on psychotic disorders, finding low rates (1.35%, 95% CI 1.32% to 1.39%). Estimates of prevalence were only marginally different when impairment was not required, while consistency between adolescents and parents was poor. Findings on the relations between race or ethnicity were too scarce and inconsistent to interpret.
   Conclusion: Detained male adolescents bear substantial mental health needs, emphasizing the need to organize effective mental health services for this troubled group. However, our knowledge on mental disorders in detained youth should be enhanced, in particular regarding the reliability of adolescents, compared with parent report, and whether clinically relevant differences exist by race or ethnicity.

AB Objective: Childhood trauma impacts multiple domains of functioning including behavior. Traumatized children commonly have behavioral problems that therapists must effectively evaluate and manage in the context of providing trauma-focused treatment. This manuscript describes practical strategies for managing behavior problems in the context of trauma-focused evidence-based treatment (EBT) using a commonly implemented EBT for traumatized children.
   Methods: The empirical literature is reviewed and practical strategies are described for conducting trauma- and behavioral-focused assessments; engaging families in trauma- and behavioral-focused treatment; treatment-planning that includes a balance of both trauma and behavioral foci; managing ongoing behavioral problems in the context of providing trauma-focused treatment; managing behavioral crises ("crises of the week"); addressing overwhelming family or social problems; and steps for knowledge transfer.
   Results: Trauma-focused EBT that integrate behavioral management strategies can effectively manage the behavioral regulation problems that commonly occur in traumatized children.
   Conclusions: Addressing trauma-related behavioral problems is an important part of trauma-focused treatment and is feasible to do in the context of using common trauma-focused EBT.
   Practice implications: Integrating effective behavioral interventions into trauma-focused EBT is essential due to the common nature of behavioral regulation difficulties in traumatized children. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study assessed the mediating role of trauma symptoms in the relation between child maltreatment and behavioral problems. It is based on the postulate that child maltreatment is a severe form of chronic relational trauma that has damaging consequences on the development of children's behavioral regulation.
   Method: Participants were 34 maltreated and 64 non-maltreated children (mean age = 60 months; range: 46 to 72 months), all from economically disadvantaged families. Maltreated children were recruited from the Child Protection Agencies. Behavioral problems and trauma symptoms were evaluated by the preschool teacher with the Internalizing and the Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist Teacher Report Form (CBCL-TRF) and the posttraumatic stress score of the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Young Children respectively (TSCYC).
   Results: Baron and Kenny's mediational procedure was conducted using structural equation modeling. Mediational analyses revealed that trauma symptoms fully mediated the association between maltreatment and both internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Conclusions: Results were consistent with the literature on developmental trauma research and provide empirical support to the idea that trauma-related symptoms resulting from early maltreatment may constitute a mechanism in the development of psychosocial problems in preschoolers.
   Practice implications: These findings underline the importance of understanding psychosocial maladjustment of maltreated children not only from the perspective of problematic behavior, but also by taking into account the traumatic reactions that might develop in response to chronic and intense stress associated with abuse and neglect.

AB Objective: A recent meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies examining correlations between peer victimization and indices of internalizing problems indicates that victims of bullying are highly distressed. However, the reliance on cross-sectional studies precludes interpretation of the direction of effects. The present study was designed to investigate if internalizing problems are antecedents of victimization, consequences of victimization, or both.
   Method: This paper provides a meta-analysis of 18 longitudinal studies examining prospective linkages between peer victimization and internalizing problems (n = 13,978). Two prospective paths were examined: the extent to which peer victimization at baseline predicts changes in internalizing problems, as well as the extent to which internalizing problems at baseline predict changes in peer victimization.
   Results: Results revealed significant associations between peer victimization and subsequent changes in internalizing problems, as well as significant associations between internalizing problems and subsequent changes in peer victimization. Several moderator effects were observed.
   Conclusions: Internalizing problems function as both antecedents and consequences of peer victimization. These reciprocal influences suggest a vicious cycle that contributes to the high stability of peer victimization.
   Practice implications: This study should further encourage steps to reduce bullying at schools. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we examined longitudinal, person-centered trajectories of acculturation, internalizing symptoms, and self-esteem in 349 Latino adolescents. We compared acculturation measures (time in the US, culture-of-origin involvement, US cultural involvement, for both parents and adolescents); acculturation stressors (perceived discrimination, acculturation conflicts); and family dynamics (parent-adolescent conflict, familism). Results indicated that, over time, Latino adolescents' internalizing problems decreased and their self-esteem increased. However, we showed that increased length of time living in the US was significantly related to lower self-esteem among adolescents. Parent-adolescent conflict was a strong risk factor, which not only directly heightened internalizing symptoms and lowered self-esteem, but also mediated the effects of acculturation conflicts and perceived discrimination on these outcomes. Our findings revealed familism as a cultural asset associated with fewer internalizing symptoms and higher self-esteem. Internalizing symptoms were also minimized by the adolescent's involvement in the US culture whereas bicultural adolescents with high culture-of-origin involvement reported higher self-esteem. We discussed the limitations and implications of this study for future research and practice.

AB This review synthesizes recent research evidence regarding the parenting characteristics associated with families with children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a complex, heterogeneous disorder with a range of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its behavioral expression and different developmental trajectories. The current review adopts a developmental psychopathology perspective to conceptualize the risk and protective factors that might shape the developmental pathways of the disorder across different domains. Following from Johnston and Mash's review (Johnston and Mash, Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev 4:183-207, 2001), the present review systematically examines empirical studies from 2000-2008 that investigate parenting variables in relation to the development of children with ADHD, with a particular focus on the development of externalizing and internalizing comorbidities, as well as functional impairments in academic and social contexts. The most recent research evidence uses correlational designs to show that ADHD is associated with problematic family functioning, including greater stress within the family, higher rates of parental psychopathology and conflicted parent-child relationships, which appears to be exacerbated in children with comorbid oppositional and conduct problems. However, there is an absence of literature that considers the role that parents play in contributing to children's development in areas such as academic achievement and peer competence, as well as the development of internalizing difficulties. Future research should examine family factors that are associated with resilience in children with ADHD, using longitudinal designs that reflect the dynamic changes associated with a developmental psychopathology framework.

AB Although effective in treating a range of childhood psychiatric conditions, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have been implicated in the induction of an "activation syndrome'' (characterized by symptoms of irritability, restlessness, emotional labiality, etc.) that may represent an intermediary state change that fosters suicidality. SSRI-induced activation syndrome is well-accepted by many clinicians and thought to be relatively common, particularly in children and teens. However, gaps exist in empirical data on phenomenology and tools for early detection. With this in mind, we report on a recently funded National Institutes of Health grant to develop a measure of behavioral activation to be completed in a clinical setting. We discuss the development of this measure-the Treatment-Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment Profile (TE-ASAP)-as well as psychometric results from a sample of youth with internalizing disorders who were at varying stages of SSRI treatment. Overall, psychometric data were quite promising, with the TE-ASAP demonstrating excellent reliability (i.e., internal consistency, inter-rater, short-term test-retest stability) and strong validity properties. Through further evaluation of the TE-ASAP in the context of a controlled multimodal trial in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder, we hope to augment understanding of activation syndrome and, in turn, mitigate risks through early detection of this potentially lifethreatening adverse effect.

AB This review examines the impact of race/ethnicity and cultural differences in the presentation and prevalence rates of internalizing disorders in youth, as well as a variety of associated factors. There is robust support for higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety in ethnic minority youth living in the United States. Gender differences are consistent across ethnicity, but symptom presentation, biological factors, and family processes vary somewhat by ethnic group. Environmental factors and acculturation are considered in relation to internalizing disorders in ethnic minority youth. Several problems with the literature are outlined. Several recommendations are made including better operationalization of internalizing disorders in the DSM and key issues that warrant being added to background text in the DSM. A research agenda is outlined to address possible mechanisms by which culture and race/ethnicity impact internalizing symptomatology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines selected findings regarding the consequences of difference in timing of pubertal onset in order to build an explanatory model of puberty in context. We also seek to shed light on possible prevention efforts targeting adolescent risk. To date, there is substantial evidence supporting early onset effects on both internalizing and externalizing problems during the adolescent decade and possibly beyond. However such effects do not directly speak to preventive intervention. The biological, familial, and broader relationship contexts of puberty are considered along with unique contexts for early maturing girls versus boys. Finally, we identify potential strategies for intervention based on these explanatory models. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 52: 254-262, 2010.

AB The present study is part of a larger project that seeks to identify factors that predict children's behavioral, social, and cognitive adaptation to epilepsy. Children with seizures are more likely to have internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than either healthy children or children with other chronic illnesses. The present research examines risk factors for behavior problems. Early temperament and neuropsychological functioning, specifically executive function and language abilities, are evaluated as unique and moderating predictors of adverse behavioral outcomes in 229 children with a first recognized seizure. Parents assessed temperament, children were administered neuropsychological tests, and teachers evaluated behavior 36 months after seizure onset. Results revealed that early temperament and neuropsychological functioning, specifically executive function, predicted behavioral outcomes 3 years after seizure onset. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Maternal internalizing problems affect reporting of child's problem behavior. This study addresses the relative effects of maternal depressive symptoms versus anxiety symptoms and the association with differential reporting of mother and child on child's internalizing problems. The study sample comprised a cohort of 1,986 10- to 12-year-old children and their mothers from the Dutch general population in a cross sectional setup. Children's internalizing problems were assessed with the DSM-IV anxiety and affective problem scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Current maternal internalizing problems were assessed with the depressive and anxiety symptom scales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), while the TRAILS Family History Interview (FHI) measured lifetime maternal depression and anxiety. Results show that current and lifetime maternal depressive symptoms were associated with positive mother-child reporting discrepancies (i.e. mothers reporting more problems than their child). Considering the small amount of variance explained, we conclude that maternal depressive symptoms do not bias maternal reporting on child's internalizing problems to a serious degree. Studies concerning long term consequences of mother-child reporting discrepancies on child's internalizing problems are few, but show a risk for adverse outcome. More prognostic research is needed.

AB Objective: To investigate the role of early self-regulation skills, including emotion regulation, sustained attention and inhibitory control/reward sensitivity, in predicting pediatric obesity in early childhood.
   Method: Participants for this study included 57 children (25 girls) obtained from three different cohorts participating in a larger ongoing longitudinal study. At 2 years of age, participants participated in several laboratory tasks designed to assess their self-regulation skills. Height and weight measures were collected when children were 2 and 5.5 years of age.
   Results: Self-regulation skills in toddlerhood were predictive of both normal variations in body mass index (BMI) development and pediatric obesity. Specifically, emotion regulation was the primary self-regulation skill involved in predicting normative changes in BMI as no effects were found for sustained attention or inhibitory control/reward sensitivity. However, both emotion regulation and inhibitory control/reward sensitivity predicted more extreme weight problems (that is, pediatric obesity), even after controlling for 2-year BMI. Thus, toddlers with poor emotion regulation skills and lower inhibitory control skills/higher reward sensitivity were more likely to be classified as overweight/at risk at 5.5 years of age.
   Conclusion: Early self-regulation difficulties across domains (that is, behavioral and emotional) represent significant individual risk factors for the development of pediatric obesity. Mechanisms by which early self-regulation skills may contribute to the development of pediatric obesity are discussed.

AB This study reports psychosocial characteristics of a sample of 111 children (K to 2nd grade) and their mothers who were living in urban supportive housings. The aim of this study was to document the various types and degree of risk endemic to this population. First, we describe the psychosocial characteristics of this homeless sample. Second, we compared this homeless sample with a grade-matched, high-risk, school-based sample of children (n = 146) who were identified as showing early symptoms of disruptive behaviors. Third, we compared the parents in both samples on mental health, parenting practices, and service utilization. Results showed that children living in supportive housing were in the at-risk range and had comparable levels of externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems and emotional strengths with the school-based risk sample receiving prevention services at a family support community agency. Mothers in supportive housing reported significantly higher psychological distress, less optimal parenting practices and greater service utilization. These findings are among the first to provide empircal support for the need to deliver prevention interventions in community sectors of care.

AB Recent research has identified adolescent disclosure to parents as a powerful predictor of adolescent adjustment. We propose, however, that the common operationalization of adolescent disclosure incorporates the two separate constructs of disclosure and secrecy, and predicted that the disclosure-adjustment link can largely be explained by the unique contribution of secrecy from parents. A four-wave survey study among 309 adolescents tested these predictions. Factor analyses confirmed that disclosure and secrecy should be distinguished as two separate constructs. Moreover, in cross-lagged path analyses, only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression) and externalizing (i.e., delinquency) problems, disclosure was not. Secrecy consistently contributed to the longitudinal prediction of delinquency from early to middle adolescence, whereas it contributed to the prediction of depression only in early adolescence. Findings thus attest the importance of distinguishing between disclosure and secrecy and suggest that the disclosure-adjustment link may actually reflect a secrecy-maladjustment link.

AB Purpose: We use full-matching propensity score models to test whether developmentally specific measures of maltreatment, in particular childhood-limited maltreatment versus adolescent maltreatment, are causally related to involvement in crime, substance use, health-risking sex behaviors, and internalizing problems during early adulthood.
   Methods: Our design includes 907 participants (72% male) in the Rochester Youth Development Study, a community sample followed from age 14 to age 31 with 14 assessments, including complete maltreatment histories from Child Protective Services records.
   Results: After balancing the data sets, childhood-limited maltreatment is significantly related to drug use, problem drug use, depressive symptoms, and suicidal thoughts. Maltreatment during adolescence has a significant effect on a broader range of outcomes: official arrest or incarceration, self-reported criminal offending, violent crime, alcohol use, problem alcohol use, drug use, problem drug use, risky sex behaviors, self-reported sexually transmitted disease diagnosis, and suicidal thoughts.
   Conclusions: The causal effect of childhood-limited maltreatment is focused on internalizing problems, whereas adolescent maltreatment has a stronger and more pervasive effect on later adjustment. Increased vigilance by mandated reporters, especially for adolescent victims of maltreatment, along with provision of appropriate services, may prevent a wide range of subsequent adjustment problems.

AB Anxiety disorders are prevalent throughout childhood and adolescence. As such, identifying the factors and mechanisms that precede, maintain, or exacerbate anxiety disorders is essential for the development of empirically based prevention and intervention programs. The current review focuses on child temperament (i.e., behavioral inhibition) and the child's environment, including parenting, childcare, and peer relationships, as these factors have been linked to internalizing problems and anxiety diagnoses. Research programs are needed that examine the associations between the environment and anxiety in temperamentally at-risk populations. In order to be successful, early intervention and prevention programs require a more detailed analysis of the interplay between various environmental contexts, both distal and proximal to the child, and the child's temperamental reactivity to novelty and threat. Furthermore, conducting these investigations across multiple levels of analysis in large-scale, longitudinal samples would be an important addition to the literature on the developmental psychopathology of anxiety.

AB Objective: To examine the initial efficacy of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) for treating behavior problems in young children who were born premature. Method: In this randomized, controlled trial, 28 children between the ages of 18 and 60 months, who were born <37 weeks gestation and presented with clinically significant externalizing behavior problems, were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment (IT) or waitlist (WL) control group. Results: After 4 months, children who received PCIT were reported by their mother to have less attention problems, aggressive behaviors, and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, and they were observed to be more compliant to maternal commands than children in the WL group. In addition, mothers in the IT group interacted more positively with their child, reported lower parenting stress related to difficult child behavior and demonstrated improved parenting practices compared with WL mothers. Behavior change maintained for 80% of the IT children 4 months after treatment completion. Conclusions: This study demonstrates preliminary efficacy of PCIT for the treatment of behavior problems in young children who were born premature.

AB This investigation identifies unique risk and protective factors for internalizing and externalizing problems among 8- to 12-year-old, low-income, African American children and tests cumulative risk and protective models. A total of 152 mother-child dyads complete questionnaires. Receipt of food stamps, mother's distress, and child maltreatment increase children's risk for internalizing and externalizing problems and family functioning ( adaptability, cohesion), and after-school program participation ( externalizing only) are protective against internalizing and externalizing problems. A cumulative risk model reveals that compared with youth with no risk factors, having one risk factor confers three-and fivefold risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Having two or three risk factors confers 12 and 19 times greater risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Compared with no protective factors, youth with two protective factors are 4 and 6 times less likely to display internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Implications for community-based preventive intervention efforts and future research are discussed.

AB Previous investigations of the association between parent and adolescent internalizing problems have been largely restricted to the unidirectional effect of parent symptoms on their children. This study therefore aimed to investigate potential reciprocal relationships between parent and adolescent internalizing symptoms. One-hundred and seventy-seven adolescents ages 14 to 18 years and their parents (172 mothers, 124 fathers) completed measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms at two time points, 6 months apart. Results supported reciprocity between maternal and adolescent internalizing symptoms but not between paternal and adolescent internalizing symptoms. In addition, the relationship between maternal symptoms and later adolescent symptoms was found to be partially mediated by maternal parenting self-esteem. The study highlights the potential impact of adolescent internalizing problems on maternal well-being, a phenomenon previously neglected in the literature.

AB The prospective relations between five types of parental reactions to children's negative emotions (PRCNE) and children's psychological adjustment (behavioral problems and social competence) were examined in a two-wave longitudinal study of 425 school-age children in China. Parents (mostly mothers) reported their own PRCNE. Parents, teachers, and children or peers reported on children's adjustment. Parental punitive reactions positively predicted externalizing problems (controlling for baseline), whereas emotion- and problem-focused reactions were negatively related to internalizing problems. Parental minimizing and encouragement of emotion expression were unrelated to adjustment. Concurrent relations were found between PRCNE and parents' authoritative and authoritarian parenting dimensions. However, PRCNE did, not uniquely predict adjustment controlling for global parenting dimensions. The findings have implications for cultural adaptation of parent-focused interventions for families of Chinese origin.

AB Research has identified complex relationships between abuse experiences, emotion regulation, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Data generally indicate that individuals with an abuse experience, or those with NSSI, have difficulties with emotion regulation. However, it is unknown whether there are specific patterns of emotion regulation difficulties across abuse subtypes that are uniquely associated with engaging in NSSI. Using a sample of 2238 college students (n = 419; 18.1% with NSSI histories), the present study examined differences in emotion regulation difficulties across specific abuse types between those with and without a history of NSSI. Results indicate significantly greater difficulties with emotion regulation among abused and self-injuring participants as well as significant differences on specific emotion regulation problems between self-injuring and noninjuring participants within the physical abuse and combination physical/sexual abuse subtypes. Possible explanations and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB To examine associations among Puerto Rican children's physical health problems and children's internalizing disorders, parental psychopathology and acculturative stress, and family factors. A population-based probability sample of 2491 Puerto Rican children, aged between 5 and 13 years, and caregivers from the South Bronx and the U. S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico participated in this study. The parent version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV was used to assess children's internalizing disorders. Children's anxiety disorders, parental psychopathology, and acculturative stress were associated with childhood asthma, abdominal pain, and headaches. Children's depressive disorders, maternal acceptance, and family functioning were associated with abdominal pain and headaches. Parents of children living in Puerto Rico were more likely to report physical health problems in their children than in the Bronx. Children's internalizing disorders, parental psychopathology, and acculturative stress may be important areas to target among Puerto Rican children with physical health problems.

AB Objective This study examined externalizing and internalizing behavior problem trajectories as a function of both iron status in infancy and infant characteristics. Methods A sample of 185 healthy Costa Rican children who either had chronic, severe iron deficiency or good iron status in infancy were followed for 19 years. Results Mother ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems from age 5 to 11-14 years were higher for the chronic iron deficiency group compared with those with the good iron status. Iron deficiency in infancy predicted persisting externalizing problems over this time period, especially for those with low physical activity in infancy. Beyond adolescence, youth in the chronic iron deficiency group did not report more problems than those in the good iron group. Conclusions These findings underscore the importance of considering infant iron status along with early behavioral characteristics to better identify those children at greatest risk for persisting long-term behavior problems.

AB A confirmatory factor analytic study was conducted to obtain evidence for physical aggression as a distinct construct of nonaggressive antisocial behavior in young children. Second, the authors investigated factorial invariance across gender. Teachers completed the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ) for two independent samples of kindergartners (N = 487; N = 1,557). Behavior items were selected representing physically aggressive versus nonaggressive antisocial behavior. To obtain support for the two-factor model, the authors also examined associations with subtypes of internalizing behavior. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed that physical aggression constitutes a distinct construct from nonaggressive antisocial behavior for young children. In support of the model, differential associations with internalizing behavior and different outcomes with respect to gender differences were found. Factorial noninvariance across gender was found for physical aggression, and explanations for those gender differences are discussed.

AB In the current study, five annual wave longitudinal data were employed to examine the associations between Big Five personality traits and problem behavior (i.e., depression and aggression) in early to middle and middle to late adolescent boys and girls. Using cross-lagged panel models, we simultaneously tested two competing hypothesis: (1) a vulnerability hypothesis stating that Big Five personality traits would affect problem behavior and (2) a scar hypothesis asserting that problem behavior would affect Big Five personality traits. Results supported both hypotheses, as the effects between personality and problem behavior were bidirectional. These findings have important theoretical and clinical implications, as they suggest a transactional process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to community violence can seriously threaten healthy adolescent development. This longitudinal study examines the relationship between exposure to violence in the community and the internalizing behaviors of Asian American and African American adolescents. Data analyzed was from 901 adolescents (57.9% female and 42.1% male, and 84.7% African American and 15.3% Asian American) who had participated in both Wave I and II interviews of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health conducted between 1994 and 1996. Being female, having prior internalizing behaviors at baseline, and being exposed to violence significantly predicted African American adolescents' subsequent report of internalizing behaviors and their symptoms. Being female and having prior internalizing behaviors also predicted Asian American adolescents' subsequent internalizing behaviors and their symptoms. However, exposure to violence was not associated with Asian American adolescents' internalizing behaviors. Findings suggested a need to conceptualize mental health risk in a more nuanced context of cultural diversity.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the socioemotional adjustment of unsociable (versus shy) children in middle childhood. The participants in this study were 186 children aged 6-8 years (M-age= 7.59 years, SD = .31). Multisource assessment was employed, including maternal ratings, teacher ratings, and individual child interviews. Results provided some of the first evidence to suggest that unsociability can be distinguished from shyness in middle childhood. Shy children evidenced more internalizing problems, peer difficulties, and loneliness as compared to unsociable and nonwithdrawn comparison children. In contrast, aside from a greater tendency to play alone, unsociable children did not differ from nonwithdrawn comparison peers. However, a gender difference emerged, with unsociable boys appearing to be more prone to experiencing difficulties with peers. Results are discussed in terms of the assessment, meaning, and implications of different forms of social withdrawal in middle childhood.

AB This study examined whether self-esteem mediates the association between peer aggression and internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. A total of 204 Swedish adolescents aged between 12- and 16-years-old completed self-report measures; self-esteem was assessed with 'I think I am' (ITIA) and internalizing and externalizing problems with Youth Self-Report (YSR). Our results showed that internalizing problems in peer aggressors could be understood as problems with low self-esteem, while internalizing problems in peer victims could be understood both as problems with low self-esteem and as an effect of being victimized. Externalizing problems in peer aggressors and peer aggressor-victims could be understood as problems with being involved in peer aggression, while the same problems in peer victims could be understood as problems with low self-esteem. This article also discusses the importance of self-esteem in adolescents' development of their own identities and for peer aggressive-related psychological psychopathology.

AB The authors explored the utility of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in assessing adolescents' emotion regulation. Adolescents (11-17 years; N = 870) completed the DERS and measures of externalizing and internalizing problems. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a similar factor structure in the adolescent sample of the authors as demonstrated previously among adults. Furthermore, results indicated no gender bias in ratings of DERS factors on three scales (as evidenced by strong factorial gender invariance) and limited gender bias on the other three scales (as evidenced by metric invariance). Female adolescents scored higher on four of six DERS factors than male adolescents. DERS factors were meaningfully related to adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems. Results suggest that scores on the DERS show promising internal consistency and validity in a community sample of adolescents.

AB Objectives. The aim of this study was to examine the association between psychopathic traits and mental disorders and to study associations between psychopathic traits and familial problems across gender.
   Design. This is a cross-sectional study.
   Methods. One hundred and Eighty adolescents seeking help at a substance abuse treatment clinic (99 girls, 81 boys) and their parents (165 mothers, 90 fathers) were studied. The assessment included Psychopathy checklist: Youth version (PCL-YV) and SCID I/II or Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL).
   Results. Across gender, there was a positive correlation between externalizing symptoms and PCL-YV score. Among boys, there was a positive correlation between internalizing symptoms and PCL-YV score. Further, the behavioural dimension of psychopathy was predictive of externalizing symptoms across gender. The interpersonal and affective dimension of psychopathy predicted oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)-symptoms among girls. Parent problem behaviour predicted PCL-YV score amongst girls only.
   Conclusions. Psychopathic traits do not only exist among adolescents who are identified because of their criminal behaviour. There were gender differences in the association between symptoms and psychopathic traits. It is suggested that different dimensions of psychopathy predisposed substance use for girls and for boys, and that ODD is particularly important in the expression of psychopathic traits among girls. This study showed transmission of antisocial behaviour between two generations among girls.

The present study examined parent and peer attachment in 67 African American males and 97 Latinos (ages 12-17, M = 14.7 +/- A 1.3) attending an alternative school. The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment was used to identify 3 attachment style groups: "Isolated," "Disconnected," and "Connected." Controlling for age, attachment group membership predicted differences in delinquent behaviors, as did ethnicity. Further, on the Youth Self-Report of the Child Behavior Checklist, attachment group membership predicted differences in both the Internalizing and Externalizing Scales. Implications for interventions with each identified attachment group are discussed.

Children with stable left frontal EEG asymmetry during infancy were rated higher in externalizing behaviors by their mothers, whereas children with, table right frontal EEG asymmetry were rated higher in internalizing behaviors. These findings highlight the need to focus oil the early stability in physiological measures that may be implicated later in developing behavioral problems. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

AB Antipathetic relationships, or relationships based on mutual dislike, have received less attention than other aspects of children's peer relations. The present meta-analytic review summarizes the existing literature (26 studies consisting of over 23,000 children and adolescents) to illuminate the prevalence of antipathetic relationships and their associations with maladjustment. Results indicate that 35% of children have an antipathetic relationship and that antipathetic relationships are associated with externalizing and internalizing problems, low academic achievement, low prosocial behavior, victimization and rejection by peers, and lower positive peer regard (e.g., social preference) and friendships. Gender differences in antipathetic relationships are trivial, and antipathetic relationships are equally often same and mixed ender. Collectively, the findings indicate the importance of studying antipathetic relationships, and several directions for future research are described.

AB This study tested a model predicting behavior symptoms in preschoolers with asthma. Specifically, it examined the role that asthma severity and children's representations of family functioning may play in the development of child behavior problems in a sample of 53 low-income preschoolers. The study included parent report of asthma severity and a narrative story-stem method to assess children's representations of both general and disease-specific family processes. A regression model tested the inclusion of both types of family processes in predicting child internalizing and externalizing behavior. Disease severity and children's family narratives independently predicted children's behavior over and above the combined effects of demographic variables including child age, socioeconomic status, and family structure. Although children's narratives about general family functioning predicted children's behavior, narratives about family response to asthma symptoms did not. Findings support that both disease severity and family functioning are important considerations in understanding children's behavior problems in the context of asthma. Clinical applications of findings may include: (1) Informing family based-assessments to incorporate children's narratives, and (2) A focus on reducing asthma symptoms and strengthening family functioning to prevent or address child behavior problems.

AB The weak androgen oxandrolone (Ox) increases height gain in growth-hormone (OH) treated girls with Turner syndrome (TS), but may also give rise to virilizing side effects. To assess the effect of Ox, at a conventional and low dosage, on behavior, aggression, romantic and sexual interest, mood, and gentler role in OH-treated girls with TS, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted. 133 patients were treated with OH (1.33 mg/m(2)/d) from baseline, combined with placebo (Pl). Ox 0.03 mg/kg/d. or Ox 0.06 mg/kg/d from the age of eight, and with estrogens from the age of 12. The child behavior checklist (CBCL), Junior Dutch Personality Questionnaire (DPQ-J), State-subscale of the Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Scale, Romantic and Sexual Interest Questionnaire, Mood Questionnaire, and Gender Role Questionnaire were filled out before, during, and after discontinuing Ox/Pl. The changes during Ox/Pl therapy were not significantly different between the dosage groups. In untreated patients, the mean CBCL total (P = 0.002) and internalizing (P = 0.003) T scores, as well as the mean DPQ-J social inadequacy SD score (SDS) (P = 0.004) were higher than in reference girls, but decreased during OH + Ox/Pl therapy (P<0.001, P = 0.05, P<0.001, respectively). Whereas the mean total (P = 0.01) and internalizing (P<0.001) T score remained relatively high, the mean social inadequacy SDS became comparable with reference values. We conclude that in OH-treated girls with TS, Ox 0.03 mg/kg/d or 0.06 mg/kg/d does not cause evident psychological virilizing side effects. Problem behavior, frequently present in untreated girls with TS, decreases during therapy, but total and internalizing problem behavior remain increased. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To elucidate the time trends in self-reported mental health complaints (internalizing problems) among school children in Sweden during a time characterized by economic downturns and upturns, with a focus on possible differences across grades and genders.
   Methods: The study uses nationwide and repeated cross-sectional data collected five times during 1985-2005 among students in Sweden in grades 5, 7, and 9. The number of participating students each year varied between 2,933 and 4,421. The attrition rates varied between 10% and 15% in the participating schools. Data were subjected to descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression using a composite measure of self-reported mental health complaints.
   Results: The study results show significantly higher rates of mental health complaints in 2005/2006 compared with 1985/1986 among older adolescents, in particular girls, whereas the rates are almost unchanged among younger boys and girls. Only among girls in grade 9 has there been a successively (linear) increase of mental health complaints across years of investigations.
   Conclusions: The increasing rates of mental health complaints among older adolescents, in particular girls, are a cause for concern and a challenge for public health work. By showing discrepant time trends among younger and older adolescents, the results of the study nuance the predominant and unambiguous notions about continuously deteriorating mental health among children and adolescents in Sweden. To address hypotheses concerning the causes of the discrepant time trends, suggestions are made for comparative cross-country analyses based on data from Sweden and other European countries.

AB Homeless children show significant developmental delays across major domains of adaptation, yet research on protective processes that may contribute to resilient adaptation in this highly disadvantaged group of children is extremely rare. This study examined the role of effortful control for adaption in 58 homeless children, ages 5-6, during their transition to school. Effortful control skills were assessed using children's performance on four standard laboratory tasks. Adaptive functioning was assessed by teacher report of academic competence, peer competence, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Variable-focused and person-focused results indicate that effortful control may be an important marker of school readiness and resilience. Controlling for child IQ parenting quality, and socio-demographic risks, effortful control emerged as the most significant predictor of all four salient developmental domains of adaptation as well as of resilient status of homeless children. Implications of these findings are discussed for future research and design of interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It is well known that functional somatic symptoms (FSS) are associated with anxiety and depression. However, evidence is lacking about how they are related to FSS. The aim of this study was to clarify these relationships and examine whether anxiety and depression are distinctly related to FSS. We hypothesized that anxiety contributes to the development of FSS and that depression is a consequence of FSS. Methods: FSS, anxiety, and depression were measured in adolescents (N = 2230, 51% women) by subscales of the Youth Self-Report during three assessment waves (adolescents successively aged: 10-12, 12-14, and 14-17) and by corresponding subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist. Using structural equation models, we combined trait and state models of FSS with those of anxiety and depression, respectively. We identified which relationships (contemporaneous and two-year lagged) significantly connected the states of FSS with the states of anxiety and depression. Results: Trait variables were all highly interrelated (r = .54-.63). Contrary to our hypothesis, both state anxiety (beta = .35) and state depression (beta = .45) had a strong contemporaneous effect on state FSS. In turn, state FSS had a weak two-year lagged effect on state anxiety (beta = .11) and an even weaker effect on state depression (beta = .06). Conclusions: While the effect of anxiety and depression on FSS is strong and immediate, FSS exert a weaker and delayed influence on anxiety and depression. Further research should be done to detect the exact ways in which anxiety and depression lead to FSS, and FSS lead to anxiety and depression.

Using data from the national evaluation of the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI), 2,853 caregivers and their children ages 6 to 18 years from 39 communities participated in this study. The findings indicated that during the first 6 months of entry into services, one third of families received FES services, and the clinical characteristics of children whose families received FES services were found to be more severe at intake into services with significantly higher internalizing and externalizing problems and significantly lower strengths than those families who did not. Similarly, caregivers who received FES services entered services experiencing more strain. The findings have implications for the impact of FES services on children.

AB This study examines mental health symptoms in a cohort of adolescents with substance use disorder (SUD), and attempts to determine if mental health symptoms differed by gender. We retrospectively looked at the Beck's Youth Inventory Second Edition (BYI-II) scores of 88 clients attending a community drug and alcohol treatment service in Dublin, Ireland that were completed at intake as part of their assessment. The raw and T-scores of the male patients were compared against their female counterparts and both against their age- and gender-matched normative population. Participants were 65 boys and 23 girls with a mean age of 16.2 years. Polysubstance use was the norm. As a group, the girls had higher T scores than the boys in all the domains of the BYI-II, and these were statistically significant. Sixty (68%) of the participants had a psychological problem which was moderate or severe in at least one of the five domains. This study found that SUD girls differ from their male counterparts in having both more internalizing and externalizing psychiatric problems. We also note that comorbid psychological problems are not universal. Thus we should avoid a "one size fits all" approach to treatment such as delivering universal self-esteem enhancement interventions to all adolescents with SUD.

Participants included 38 youth between the ages of 7 and 12 (51% males, M age = 9 [1.52] years and 49% females, M age = 9 [1.94] years) and their mothers (M age = 39 years) and fathers (M age = 42 years). Children were prompted to indicate the intensity of their current emotion four times a day for 1 week using Palm Tungsten E2s. Youth also completed self-report measures of emotion intensity, awareness, and dysregulation. Parents completed measures of child emotion regulation and symptoms of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. Sixty percent of the prompts were answered as intended. Higher levels of positive emotion intensity based on electronic diary ratings were negatively related to parent reports of adaptive emotion regulation and were positively related to youths' reports of emotion dysregulation and poor emotion awareness. Given that the electronic diary data offered unique information on youth emotional functioning, strategies to increase compliance with the diaries are suggested.

AB The construct of emotion regulation has been increasingly investigated in the last decade, and this work has important implications for advancing anxiety disorder theory. This paper reviews research demonstrating that: 1) emotion (i.e., fear and anxiety) and emotion regulation are distinct, non-redundant, constructs that can be differentiated at the conceptual, behavioral, and neural levels of analysis; 2) emotion regulation can augment or diminish fear, depending on the emotion regulation strategy employed; and 3) measures of emotion regulation explain incremental variance in anxiety disorder symptoms above and beyond the variance explained by measures of emotional reactivity. The authors propose a model by which emotion regulation may function in the etiology of anxiety disorders. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.

AB Behavior and psychological problems assessed prospectively by teachers and parents and by youths' self-reports through late childhood and adolescence were examined as possible predictors of early adult depression. Data were from 765 participants in the Seattle Social Development Project, a multiethnic and gender-balanced urban sample. Analyses examined 7 waves of data from ages 10 to 21, and included measures from the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist and assessments of past-year depressive episode based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Self-reported conduct problems as early as age 10 (Mason et al. 2001) and throughout adolescence consistently predicted depression at age 21. Parent reports of conduct and other externalizing problems in adolescence also significantly predicted adult depression. None of the available teacher reports through age 14 were significant predictors. Results suggest that externalizing problems can be useful indicators of risk for adult depression. Prevention efforts that target externalizing problems in youth may hold promise for reducing later depression.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between childhood abuse, assault, cognitive distortion, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in a clinical adolescent sample. The sample included one hundred eighty-five psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents and their parents. Adolescent participants were predominantly female (71.4%), Caucasian (84%), and of non-Hispanic ethnicity (9.2%). Participants completed a diagnostic interview and self-report measures to assess youth history of abuse and assault, cognitive errors, negative self-views, and recent NSSI. No relationship was found between childhood abuse and NSSI. However, a history of assault was associated with NSSI among youth who reported higher cognitive errors and more negative self-views, even after controlling for gender and internalizing disorders. These results suggest that existing affect regulation models of NSSI may be enhanced by incorporating the role of cognitive distortion. Clinically, results also suggest that assessing adolescent victims of assault for cognitive errors and negative self-views, and helping them restructure these cognitive distortions when present, may reduce the likelihood of NSSI.

AB Background. To evaluate the neuropsychological late effects amongst survivors treated oil the Head Start II protocol between 1997 and 2003. Procedures. Forty-nine patients (mean age 2.9 years) diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor underwent baseline neuropsychological assessment prior to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AuHCT). Twenty-six Survivors Were retested after 3 years Of follow-up is 20 patients did not survive. Patients were evaluated for intelligence, academic achievement, receptive language, visual-motor integration (VMI), learning/memory, social-emotional and behavioral functioning based upon age at testing. Results. Overall intelligence and VMI at baseline were low average while verbal and non-verbal intelligence, academic achievement, and receptive Vocabulary were in average range. Parents reported social-emotional and behavioral functioning within normal limits. Serial testing revealed Full Scale (FSIQ)/Mental Development Index (MDI), Verbal (VIQ), and Performance (PIQ) Intelligence to be generally stable over 3-year follow-up. Group-average analysis at follow-up demonstrated low average intelligence, academic achievement, receptive language, and VMI. Age at diagnosis was positively correlated with internalizing symptoms and visual immediate memory, while time since diagnosis was inversely correlated with FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ reading and delayed verbal memory. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) was avoided in two-thirds of patients. Conclusion. Induction, with or without intensification using intravenous methotrexate, followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with AuHCT, may avoid or delay CSI, with possible stabilization of neuropsychological functioning, including those younger at diagnosis. Continued follow-up is necessary to determine the preservation of neuropsychological, academic, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2010;54:429-436.

AB It is commonly assumed that there is a direct relationship of alexithymia with internalizing symptoms, such as Somatic Complaints. However, the fact that alexithymia is also strongly related to negative mood states suggests that the frequently found association between alexithymia and internalizing symptoms is actually mediated by mood states. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the unique contribution of alexithymia to the prediction of internalizing symptoms (self-reported health complaints and worrying/ruminative thoughts) in a population with children and young adolescents (n = 579, mean age 12 years and 2 months) by testing two models through structural equation modelling. The first model assumed an indirect relationship of alexithymia with internalizing symptoms, via mood. The second model also assumed a direct relationship between alexithymia and internalizing symptoms. The results showed a clear misfit of the first model, but a good fit of the second model. These outcomes suggest that there is a unique contribution of alexithymia to the explanation of internalizing symptoms in children and young adolescents over and above negative mood.

AB Objective: The first nationwide Israel Survey of Mental Health Among Adolescents was conducted in 2004-2005 with a representative sample of 957 adolescents aged 14-17 and their mothers to assess 12-month mental health service use, unmet needs, and associated factors. Methods: Need for services was assessed by presence of a psychiatric disorder diagnosed with the Development and Well-Being Assessment inventory, plus clinicians' verification and additional questions on service use. Results: In the past year, 22% of adolescents and 11% of their mothers consulted a service provider. Adolescents' help seeking in school was associated with residing in an Arab locality (odds ratio [OR]=1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-2.4) and with having single, divorced, or widowed parents (OR=2.9, CI=1.8-4.8); an employed father (OR=1.7, CI=1.0-2.8); and an internalizing disorder (OR=2.2, CI=1.2-3.9). Mothers' consultation was associated with residing in a Jewish or mixed locality (OR=18.1, CI=3.4-96.1); being single, divorced, or widowed (OR=3.1, CI=1.6-6.0); and having a child with an internalizing disorder (OR=6.4, CI=3.2-13.0), an externalizing disorder (OR=8.2, CI=2.9-23.0), or a learning disability (OR=4.5, CI=2.4-8.4). Overall, unmet needs were 66% and 60%, according to adolescents' and mothers' reports, respectively. According to mothers' reports, unmet needs were higher in Arab (91%) than in Jewish or mixed localities (54%). Conclusions: Adolescents and their mothers reported distinct service use patterns with particular implications for policy makers and health service providers. High rates of unmet needs, particularly among Arab-Israeli adolescents, need to be addressed. (Psychiatric Services 61: 241-249, 2010)

AB Background: Intervention aimed at preventing schizophrenia may be most effective if targeted at specific, but modifiable, functional impairments that present during childhood. We have developed a novel method of screening community samples aged 9 to 12 years to identify children who present a triad of putative antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz), defined as 1) speech and/or motor development lags/problems; 2) internalizing, externalizing, and/or peer-relationship problems in the clinical range; and 3) psychotic-like experiences. This study examined whether ASz children display brain function abnormalities during error processing that are similar to those exhibited by adults with schizophrenia.
   Methods: Twenty-two ASz children and 26 typically developing (TD) children with no antecedents of schizophrenia completed an error-inducing Go/NoGo task during event-related potential recording. Group differences were examined in the amplitude and latency of four event-related potential components: the initial error-related negativity (ERN) and later error-positivity (Pe) elicited on false-alarm responses to NoGo trials, and the corresponding initial correct response negativity (CRN) and later correct response positivity (Pc) elicited during processing of correct responses to Go trials.
   Results: Relative to TD children, ASz children were characterized by reduced ERN amplitude but unaffected CRN, Pe, and Pc amplitudes. No group differences were observed in the latency of any component.
   Conclusions: Children presenting a triad of putative antecedents of schizophrenia show error-processing dysfunction mimicking that observed in adults with schizophrenia using the same Go/NoGo paradigm. The ASz children displayed specific early error-processing deficits rather than a generalized deficit in self-monitoring.

AB The present study examined the developmental trajectories of youth depression and anxiety symptoms from 6th through 12th grade in a low-income, urban sample (N = 141; mean age = 11.75 years; 88.7% African American). The study also tested the independent contribution of parent mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders assessed in early childhood to initial levels and rate of change in depression and anxiety symptoms from 6th through 12th grade. Possible gender differences in symptom course and strength of parent psychopathology predictors were examined using multiple-group analysis. Results indicated that depression symptoms declined over time for males, whereas depression symptoms initially declined, but then increased for females. In contrast, male and female adolescents each showed a decline in anxiety symptoms throughout adolescence. Findings also indicated that parent mood disorders were the only predictor of youth depression and anxiety symptoms for male and female adolescents in 6th grade. Parent anxiety disorders uniquely predicted the rate of change in depression symptoms among male adolescents. These results underscore the importance of targeting parents with mood and anxiety disorders in urban families in order to reduce the risk for internalizing difficulties in their adolescent youth.

AB There is limited knowledge about the unique relations between adolescent reactive and proactive aggression and later psychosocial adjustment in early adulthood. Accordingly, this study prospectively examined associations between adolescent (mean age = 16) reactive and proactive aggression and psychopathic features, antisocial behavior, negative emotionality, and substance use measured 10 years later in early adulthood (mean age = 26). Study questions were examined in a longitudinal sample of 335 adolescent males. Path analyses indicate that after controlling for the stability of the outcome and the overlap between the two subtypes of aggression, reactive aggression is uniquely associated with negative emotionality, specifically anxiety, in adulthood. In contrast, proactive aggression is uniquely associated with measures of adult psychopathic features and antisocial behavior in adulthood. Both reactive and proactive aggression uniquely predicted substance use in adulthood, but the substances varied by subtype of aggression. Implications for findings are discussed.

At the third measurement moment, mothers. fathers. and children reported on the child's adjustment problems. Rank-order stability of the personality dimensions and overreactive parenting were high. Univariate talent growth models revealed mean-level decreases for extraversion, conscientiousness, and imagination. Mean levels of benevolence, emotional stability. and overreactive parenting were stable. Multivariate latent growth models revealed that decreases in extraversion and emotional stability predicted internalizing problems, whereas, decreases in benevolence. conscientiousness. and emotional stability predicted externalizing, problems. Increases in overreactive parenting predicted externalizing. hut not internalizing problems. The associations were similar for boys and girls. The results indicate that changes in child personality and overreactive parenting during, the transition to adolescence are associated with adolescent adjustment problems. Overall. child personality wits More important than overreactive parenting, and children were more likely to "act out" than to "withdraw" in reaction to overreactive parenting.

AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the theory and evidence for the links of parent-child attachment with internalizing problems in childhood and adolescence. We address three key questions: (a) how consistent is the evidence that attachment security or insecurity is linked to internalizing symptoms. anxiety. and depression? (b) How consistent is the evidence that specific forms of insecurity are more strongly related to internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression than are other forms of insecurity? (c) Are associations with internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression consistent for mother-child aid father-child attachment? The current findings are consistent with the hypothesis that insecure attachment is associated with the development of internalizing problems. The links between specific insecure attachment patterns and internalizing problems are difficult to evaluate. Father-child and mother-child attachments have a comparable impact, although there are relatively few studies of father-child attachment. No moderators consistently affect these relations. We also propose two models of how attachment insecurity may combine with other factors to lead to anxiety or depression.

AB This multiwave longitudinal study investigated potential transactional and accumulating influences among corumination, interpersonal stressors, and internalizing symptoms among a sample of early and middle adolescents (N= 350: 6th-10th graders). Youth completed self-report measures of corumination at Times 1, 2, and 4, and negative life events. internalizing symptoms (general depressive. specific anhedonic depressive, anxious arousal, general internalizing), and externalizing problems at all four time points (5 weeks between each assessment across 4 months). Results Supported hypotheses. First. baseline corumination predicted prospective trajectories of all forms of internalizing symptoms but not externalizing problems. Second, baseline corumination predicted generation of interpersonal-dependent, but not interpersonal-independent or noninterpersonal stressors. Third, interpersonal-dependent events partially mediated the longitudinal association between baseline corumination and prospective internalizing symptoms. Fourth, a transactional. bidirectional set of associations was Supported in that initial internalizing symptoms and stressors predicted later elevations in corumination, and in turn. corumination predicted later symptoms through the mediating role of interpersonal stressors to complete both streams in the transactional chain Of influence. Fifth, girls and older adolescents exhibited higher corumination, but neither age nor sex moderated any associations. These findings are discussed within a transactional. developmental cascade model.

AB The objectives of the study are (i) to describe and compare the epidemiology of emotional/behavioral problems and associated risk/protective factors among nationally representative samples of institutionally reared and similarly aged community-based adolescents brought up in their natural homes by means of youth self-reports, caregiver/parent, and teacher informants; and (ii) to identify mental health service needs and utilization. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between November 2005 through April 2006 using an equal probability cluster sample of 11-18 year old adolescents in institutional care settings (N = 350; 163 males, 187 females) and results were compared with similarly aged community sample of youth living in their natural homes (N = 2,206). The Sociodemographic Information Form, Youth Self Report (YSR), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by caregivers for institutional sample and parents for the community sample, and Teacher's Report Form (TRF) were used to obtain standardized data on demographic characteristics, emotional/behavioral problems, and risk/protective factors. The prevalence of problems behaviors by YSR, caregiver/parent CBCL, and TRF were: 47, 15.1, 20.5% for the institutional versus 10.1, 7.5 and, 9.5% for the community samples, respectively (p < 0.05). Youth self-reports were fourfold, and all informant reports were twofold higher for institutional versus community comparisons. Furthermore, institutional sample had consistently higher rates, not only of Externalizing, but Internalizing, Social Problems, Attention Problems, and Thought Problems, as well as discrete DSM-oriented scales, suggesting that labeling of institutional youth as simply aggressive and delinquent contributes to their further marginalization and does not comprehensively address their mental health needs. In terms of protective factors, we found that: perceived social support, high competency scores, supportive caregiving, getting along well with peers and relatives (positive relationships), and problem solving skills were significantly protective of mental health. On the other hand fatalistic beliefs, cigarette and alcohol use were significantly associated with increased risk for problem behaviors (p < 0.05). The primary reason for institutional placement was family disruption (68.9%), poverty (15.7%), abandonment (8.4%), and physical or sexual abuse (5.4%). Only 31.2% of the youth were in fact true orphans (loss of one or both parents). It is therefore remarkable that in terms of service use, despite consistently high prevalence of problem behaviors across all informant sources, only 2.4% of the youth had received any speciality mental health services during institutional care. In conclusion, there is a pressing need to transform the social and health care policy and to provide family and community-based alternatives for youth currently in institutional care in Turkey. Before this goal is achieved, it is necessary to address their mental health needs urgently and comprehensively. The highest rates of problems by youth self-report also support the view that the youths' own voices ought to be heard and need to inform the reform process regarding their future care.

AB The first objective of this study was to investigate which aspects of temperament are related to externalizing problem behavior and which aspects are related to internalizing problem behavior. The second objective was to investigate how parenting influences the link between temperament and problem behavior. The sample included 89 two-parent families and their firstborn 36-month-old children, and 81 day care and preschool playgroup teachers. Mothers, fathers and teachers filled in questionnaires and home observations took place. The results showed that different temperament characteristics predict externalizing and internalizing problems. Further, the results indicate that parenting moderates the relation between temperament and problem behavior. More specifically, positive control of the father buffered the relation between impulsivity and externalizing problems, whereas negative control of the mother and father strengthened the relation between fear and internalizing problems.

AB The objective of the current study was to evaluate how the inclusion of 3 Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) symptoms in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnostic criteria influences the external validity of the ADHD subtypes. The sample comprised 228 children (166 boys, 62 girls) ranging in age from 5-18 years who were referred to clinics for attentional, behavioral, and/or learning problems and diagnosed with DSM-IV ADHD (124 Combined type, 81 Inattentive type, 23 Hyperactive-Impulsive type). Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms were obtained using the Emory Combined Rating Scale (ECRS), which assesses symptoms of the common DSM-IV childhood psychiatric disorders. Regression analyses incorporating planned comparisons were conducted to examine how the inclusion of SCT symptoms affects differences among ADHD subtypes on several external validity indicators (i.e., gender, age-of-onset, and overlapping conditions). The regression analyses did not yield any significant differences in gender ratios, mean age-of-onset, or overlapping externalizing or internalizing problems when the ADHD Inattentive type was subdivided into high- versus low-SCT groups. In conclusion, the current results suggest that the inclusion of parent-reported SCT symptoms in the ADHD diagnostic criteria has limited utility for isolating diagnostically meaningful subgroups of the Inattentive type or for enhancing the external validity of the ADHD subtypes in clinic-referred samples.

AB Although the tripartite model reliably distinguishes anxiety and depression in adolescents, it remains unclear how negative affectivity (NA) and positive affectivity (PA) Influence developmental pathways to internalizing problems Based on models which propose that affectivity shapes how youth react to stress. the present study attempted to investigate the relative roles of NA, PA. and stressful life events in characterizing and differentiating adolescent anxiety and depression A sample of adolescent females (N = 63), including a sub-sample of adolescent mothers, completed measures of NA, PA, negative life event (NLE) Occurrence, anxiety. and depression. Findings supported the tripartite model as a "temperamental reactivity to stress" approach Anxious and depressive symptoms were predicted by a combination of high NA and high NLE occurrence However, a combination of low PA and high NLE occurrence was uniquely linked to greater depressive symptoms Implications of these findings for early identification and prevention programs are discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to assess predictors of placebo response in all available short-term, placebo-controlled trials of psychotropic drugs for children and adolescents with internalizing disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD,) and anxiety disorders (ANX) exclusive of OCD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Method: We reviewed the literature relevant to the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents with internalizing disorders, restricting our review to double-blind studies including a placebo arm. Placebo response, defined according to each trial's primary response outcome variable and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, when available, and potential predictive variables were extracted from 40 studies.
   Results: From 1972 to 2007, we found 23 trials that evaluated the efficacy of psychotropic medication involving youth with MDD, 7 pertaining to youths with OCD, and 10 pertaining to youths with ANX (N = 2,533 patients in placebo arms). For all internalizing disorders combined, predictors of nonresponse to placebo were the percentage of Caucasian patients included in the study and the duration of the disorder: Both variables were negatively correlated with the percent of placebo responders. The type of disorder was found to predict the robustness of placebo response: (OCD < ANX < MDD). For a subset of MDD studies, we found that baseline illness severity tended to be negatively correlated with placebo response. Finally, trial "success'' was significantly associated with lower placebo response rate.
   Conclusion: Predictors of placebo response in internalizing disorders of youths parallel those in adult studies, with the exception of race. These predictors should be considered when designing placebo-controlled trials in youths to enhance findings of true drug-placebo differences.

AB We examined the associations between perceived parental rearing, attachment style, self-concept, and mental health problems among Japanese adolescents. About 193 high school students (143 boys and 50 girls, mean = 16.4) completed a set of self-report questionnaires including EMBU-C (My Memories of Child Upbringing for Children), AQC (Attachment Questionnaire for Children), SDQII-S (Self-Description Questionnaire II-Short) and YSR (Youth Self-Report). There seems to be a unique influence on mental health problems from parent-adolescent relations depending on the gender of parents and adolescents. PLS (Partial Latent Squares Regression) analysis showed that insecure attachments (Avoidant and Ambivalent) and Rejection from parents were predictors of Internalizing and Externalizing Problems among boys, while all dysfunctional parenting (Rejection, Overprotection and Anxious Rearing) were determinants of these problems among girls. Non academic self-concept (social, emotional, and physical) was a predictor of Internalizing and Externalizing Problems. Power of the prediction of these problems was greater for girls than boys.

AB Research indicates both parents and peers influence child and adolescent adjustment outcomes. Moreover, friendship quality has been found to buffer the influence of parenting on adolescent adjustment, particularly externalizing symptoms. Little to no research, however, has longitudinally examined whether friendship quality moderates the relation between parenting and adolescent internalizing symptoms. Accordingly, our study examines friendship quality as a moderator of the relation between parenting (positive parenting, poor parental monitoring, inconsistent discipline, parental involvement) and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms over one year's time. The sample included 65 early adolescents (67% male), ages 10-13 at initial assessment. Friendship quality buffered the effect of positive parenting on internalizing symptoms over time. However, no moderating effects for externalizing symptoms were found. Implications and further directions are discussed.

AB Background:
   To model and compare contextual (area and family) effects on the psychopathology of children nested in families nested in areas.
   Method:
   Data from the first two sweeps of the UK's Millennium Cohort Study were used. The final study sample was 9,630 children clustered in 6,052 families clustered in 1,681 Lower-layer Super Output Areas. The mean age of the children at Sweep 2 was 4.96 (SD = 2.76) years. Contextual risk was measured at area level with the Index of Multiple Deprivation (Sweep 1), and at family level with the number of proximal (Sweep 2) and distal (Sweep 1) adverse life events experienced. Psychopathology was measured at Sweep 2 with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results:
   At baseline, both proximal and distal family risk and area risk predicted broad psychopathology, although the most parsimonious was the proximal family risk model, and both the family-level and the area-level variability were significant. The area risk/broad psychopathology association remained significant even when family risk was controlled, but not when family socioeconomic status was controlled. The full model added parenting and paternal and maternal psychopathology. When parental qualifications were excluded from the family-level contextual controls the effect of area risk remained significant on both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology.
   Conclusions:
   The effect of area on child psychopathology operated via the socioeconomic characteristics of the child's family, not just the adverse characteristics of the neighbors. Multiple family risk predicted child psychopathology directly and independently, and not because it was associated with family socioeconomic status. Family socioeconomic status explained the association between area risk and broad psychopathology.

TI 5-HTTLPR moderates the effect of relational peer victimization on

   BULLYING BEHAVIORS; POLYMORPHISM; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN; VICTIMS
AB Background:
   Relational peer victimization is associated with internalizing symptoms. Compared to boys, girls are more likely to be both relationally victimized by peers and distressed by the victimization. While previous studies have reported that a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) moderates the effect of stressful life events on depressive symptoms, the present study is the first to evaluate the interaction of this polymorphism with relational peer victimization to predict level of depressive symptoms in young girls.
   Methods:
   Participants were 78 girls ages 10 to 14 who had no current or past Axis I disorder. Girls were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR; peer victimization was assessed with the Social Experiences Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms with the Children's Depression Inventory.
   Results:
   The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism alone did not predict level of depressive symptoms; the interaction of 5-HTTLPR and relational peer victimization, however, was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. Follow-up analyses indicated that peer victimization significantly predicted level of depressive symptoms only for girls who were homozygous for the short allele, and not for girls homozygous for the long allele or who were heterozygous for the short and long alleles.
   Conclusions:
   The findings support the diathesis-stress model of depression: having two 5-HTTLPR short alleles confers vulnerability to depressive symptoms in adolescent girls when they experience relational peer victimization. These findings also suggest that relational peer victimization, at least for girls with genetic vulnerability, is a significant source of stress and should be recognized in the monitoring and prevention of bullying.

AB Background:
   We examined ecological (family socioeconomic status (SES)) and bioregulatory (sleep duration, sleep efficiency) moderators of the link between maternal psychological control and children's vulnerability to internalizing symptoms.
   Method:
   A large socioeconomically diverse sample of third graders (N = 141) and their mothers participated. Sleep was examined via actigraphy for one week. Psychological control and internalizing symptoms (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, pre-sleep arousal) were examined through children's reports.
   Results:
   For children with poorer sleep, lower SES, or a combination of the two, maternal psychological control was positively related to depressive symptoms; this association was not evident for children with both better sleep and higher SES. Further, maternal psychological control, sleep efficiency, and SES interacted to predict both anxiety symptoms and pre-sleep arousal. Children were protected from the negative effects of psychological control when they were from higher SES families and had higher sleep efficiency; for all other groups of children, psychological control was associated with anxiety symptoms. A similar but less robust pattern of results was found for pre-sleep arousal.
   Conclusions:
   Findings highlight the importance of children's bioregulatory processes within the socioeconomic context for an enhanced understanding of children's vulnerability to internalizing problems in the context of maternal psychological control.

AB This study examined the factorial invariance and construct validity equivalence of a self-report of victimization and exclusion (SVEX) for Latino and European American early adolescent participants (fifth and sixth grades; mean age 11.3). The instrument included an expanded set of relational victimization items that more thoroughly tapped exclusion behaviors relevant to developmental and cross-cultural use. Confirmatory factor analyses techniques demonstrated acceptable (partial) factorial invariance across ethnic groups, fifth and sixth graders, and across gender. Linkages between the SVEX scores, peer nominations, internalizing indices, and three demographic variables also supported construct validity equivalence for the SVEX. Findings supported a two-factor model similar to that of Crick and colleagues (e.g., Crick & Grotpeter, 1995) and suggested that the instrument provided an acceptable level of equivalence for overt and relational victimization forms across these groups.

AB In a 4-year longitudinal study, the authors investigated effects of retention in first grade on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors: social acceptance; and behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement. From a large multiethnic sample (n = 784) of children below the median on literacy at school entrance, 124 retained children were matched with 251 promoted children on the basis of propensity scores (probability of being retained in first grade estimated from 72 baseline variables). Relative to promoted children, retained children were found to benefit from retention in both the short and longer terms with respect to decreased teacher-rated hyperactivity, decreased peer-rated sadness and withdrawal, and increased teacher-rated behavioral engagement. Retained children had a short-term increase in mean peer-rated liking and school belongingness relative to promoted children, but this advantage showed a substantial decrease in the longer term. Retention had a positive short-term effect oil children's perceived school belonging and a positive longer term effect on perceived academic self-efficacy. Retention may bestow advantages in the short-term, but longer term detrimental effects oil social acceptance may lead to the documented longer term negative effects of retention.

AB The objective of this longitudinal study was to determine psychosocial predictors of military misconduct in a cohort of Marine Corps war veterans. The study included data from 20,746 male Marines who completed a life history questionnaire during initial basic training and were subsequently deployed to a combat zone. Associations between psychosocial variables, psychiatric diagnoses, and subsequent misconduct outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The strongest predictors of misconduct outcomes (bad conduct discharges and military demotions) were psychiatric diagnoses and young age at first combat deployment. The results indicate that combat-related psychological disorders may manifest in numerous harmful ways, including impulsive, disruptive, and antisocial behavior. We recommend that the association between misconduct and psychiatric disorders be more explicitly acknowledged in research and treatment efforts involving military war veterans and other trauma victims.

AB Objective To assess the effectiveness of child health care professionals (CHP) in identifying psychosocial problems among children originating from industrialized and nonindustrialized countries and to assess whether parental concerns enhance CHP problem-identification.
   Study design During routine well-child visits data were collected from a sample of children aged 5 to 12 years of Dutch, Moroccan, Turkish, Surinam, and Antillean origin (response: 82%). CHP reported on psychosocial problems that they identified in children. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a questionnaire on concerns regarding their child's psychosocial development. Interpreter services were used to support parents in filling out questionnaires.
   Results Elevated CBCL total and internalizing problem scores were more prevalent among children from nonindustrialized countries (10% and 17%, respectively) than among children from industrialized countries (3% and 5%, respectively). About 30% of the Turkish and Moroccan children with an elevated CBCL score were identified by CHPs compared with 60% of the children from industrialized countries. Parental concerns on their child's psychosocial well-being were related to elevated CBCL scores. Concerns were not related to CHP problem-identification.
   Conclusions Better methods to support parents in disclosure of their concerns regarding the psychosocial development of their children may enhance CHP-identification of problems, especially among groups from nonindustrialized countries. (J Pediatr 2010;156:277-84).

AB We sought to quantify the effectiveness of special education services as naturally delivered in U.S. schools. Specifically, we examined whether children receiving special education services displayed (a) greater reading or mathematics skills, (b) more frequent learning-related behaviors, or (c) less frequent externalizing or internalizing problem behaviors than closely matched peers not receiving such services. To do so, we used propensity score matching techniques to analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, a large-scale, nationally representative sample of U.S. schoolchildren. Collectively, results indicate that receipt of special education services has either a negative or a statistically nonsignificant impact on children's learning and behavior. However, special education services do yield a small, positive effect on children's learning-related behaviors.

AB Background. The role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in psychiatric disorders following trauma is poorly studied and most studies have been done on adults. Aims. To investigate the association of mental well-being and diurnal cortisol in abused adolescents. Methods. The present cross-sectional study examined diurnal salivary cortisol (measured three times a day during three days) in relation to psychiatric symptoms (Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Children) and the salutogenic construct "sense of coherence", in 15 adolescents exposed to childhood abuse. Results. Significant correlations were found between symptoms and sense of coherence versus early and late morning cortisol concentrations. The correlations were most consistent for internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and somewhat less for post-traumatic symptoms and sense of coherence. In contrast, evening cortisol did not correlate with any of the psychological measures. Conclusion. These results extend previous research findings by pointing towards a relation between symptoms and higher morning cortisol and accentuated diurnal cortisol variation in abused adolescent as opposed to lower basal cortisol and a flattening of the cortisol rhythm repeatedly observed in traumatized adults. Clinical implications. The pathophysiology of the impact of trauma on youth, including the impact on biological stress systems, are important for an understanding of the consequences of trauma and may serve as a basis for the development of new treatment options.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study provides nationally representative prevalence estimates of internalizing mental health symptoms among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and identifies significant co-variates of these symptoms by using multivariate regression. Internalizing symptoms include feeling anxious and depressed.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a nationally representative, parent-reported, cross-sectional survey of 40 465 CSHCN. The presence of internalizing mental health symptoms was assessed by using 2 binary items capturing whether a child had or experienced difficulty with depression, anxiety, disordered eating, or other emotional problems. The odds of experiencing internalizing symptoms were assessed by using multivariate regression, controlling for sociodemographic, health-related, and burden-related covariates.
   RESULTS: A total of 31.9% of CSHCN 3 to 17 years of age experienced internalizing mental health symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression showed internalizing symptoms to be strongly associated with female gender, older age, and frequent activity limitations, as well as externalizing mental health symptoms and conditions with behavioral components. Children with behavior problems had 6 times the odds of internalizing symptoms ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.95 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.30-6.69]), whereas children with autism spectrum disorder had 3 times the odds (aOR: 3.00 [95% CI: 2.39-3.77]). Increased odds of symptoms also were associated with frequent headaches ( aOR: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.45-2.13]) and chronic pain (aOR: 1.46 [95% CI: 1.221.75]). Odds of symptoms were greater for children living in households that experienced employment changes or financial burdens resulting from the children's needs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Internalizing mental health symptoms are common among CSHCN. Findings may help caregivers focus screening and prevention efforts for high-risk groups in this heterogeneous population. Pediatrics 2010; 125:e269-e277

AB OBJECTIVE: Behavior problems are common in children with functional constipation. This study assessed the prevalence of overall, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems in children with functional constipation and explored which clinical characteristics of constipation are associated with these behavior problems.
   METHODS: Children who had functional constipation, were aged 4 to 18 years, and were referred to the gastrointestinal outpatient clinic at the Emma Children's Hospital were eligible for enrollment. This study made use of baseline data of 133 children who participated in a randomized, controlled trial that evaluated the clinical effectiveness of behavioral therapy compared with conventional treatment. Prevalence of behavior problems was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to test the association between clinical characteristics and behavior problems.
   RESULTS: The prevalence rate of overall, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems was considerable: respectively 36.8%, 36.1%, and 27.1% compared with 9% in the Dutch norm population. A long duration of treatment was found to have the strongest association with overall and externalizing behavior problems in children with constipation. Children with constipation and nighttime urinary incontinence have an increased risk for having overall behavior problems. Fecal incontinence and the production of large stools seemed to be exclusively related to externalizing behavior problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: Behavior problems are common in children who have constipation and are referred to gastrointestinal outpatient clinics, suggesting that a behavioral screening should be incorporated into the diagnostic workup of children with constipation. Pediatrics 2010; 125:e309-e317

AB The present meta-analytic review examined the magnitude of the relation between discrete emotion knowledge and three of its most commonly studied correlates in childhood and adolescence: social competence, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Emotion knowledge demonstrated small to medium-sized relations with each correlate. Moderators of effect size were also examined and included multiple sample and methodological characteristics. Using random effects models, significant moderators of effect size for relations between emotion knowledge and externalizing problems included sample recruitment, sample age, and the source of externalizing problems ratings. Moderators of effect size were not found for emotion knowledge and social competence, and the effect sizes across samples for emotion knowledge and internalizing problems were homogeneous. Results highlight the relatively consistent yet modest relations between emotion knowledge and its correlates. Implications for applied research and new directions for research on emotion knowledge using innovative methods are discussed.

AB This study examined associations between self-reports of sadness and anger regulation coping, reluctance to express emotion, and physical and relational aggression between two cohorts of predominantly African-American fifth (N = 191; 93 boys and 98 girls) and eighth (N = 167; 73 boys and 94 girls) graders. Multiple regression analyses indicated unique associations between relational aggression and expressive reluctance and sadness regulation coping. In contrast, physical aggression, but not relational aggression, was associated with anger regulation coping. These relations did not differ across gender, but the strength of the association between anger regulation coping and physical aggression varied by grade. Sadness regulation coping moderated the association between expressive reluctance and relational aggression. Conversely, anger regulation coping moderated the relation between expressive reluctance and physical aggression; however, the strength of this relation differed by gender. These findings have important implications for intervention efforts.

AB Although cross-cultural research concerning children's emotions is growing, few studies have examined emotion dysregulation in culturally diverse populations. This study compared 6- to 8-year-old children's reported methods of expressing and controlling anger, sadness, and physical pain, and their justifications for doing so across four groups in urban India: those with internalizing problems (N = 31), externalizing problems (N = 32), somatic complaints (N = 25), and an asymptomatic control group (N = 32). Results revealed that in comparison to physical pain, Indian children were less likely to report expressing anger and sadness through direct facial/verbal means. Control-group children reported expressing anger and sadness through indirect verbal cues more so than pain, whereas the internalizing and externalizing groups considered their expressions of anger and sadness uncontrollable and reported crying and utilizing aggressive behaviors, respectively, more than the control group. The somatic complaints group considered emotions trivial and reported withdrawing more than the control group.

AB Research on twin-singleton differences in externalizing and internalizing problems in childhood is largely cross-sectional and yields contrasting results. The goal of this study was to compare developmental trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems in 6- to 12-year-old twins and singletons. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) maternal reports of externalizing and internalizing problems were obtained for a sample of 9651 twins from the Netherlands Twin Register and for a representative general population sample of 1351 singletons. Latent growth modeling was applied to estimate growth curves for twins and singletons. Twin-singleton differences in the intercepts and slopes of the growth curves were examined. The developmental trajectories of externalizing problems showed a linear decrease over time, and were not significantly different for twins and singletons. Internalizing problems seem to develop similarly for twins and singletons up to age 9. After this age twins' internalizing symptoms start to decrease in comparison to those of singletons, resulting in less internalizing problems than singletons by the age of 12 years. Our findings confirm the generalizability of twin studies to singleton populations with regard to externalizing problems in middle and late childhood. The generalizability of studies on internalizing problems in early adolescence in twin samples should be addressed with care. Twinship may be a protective factor in the development of internalizing problems during early adolescence.

AB Symptoms of internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic, trauma) are the major risk factors for suicide. Atypical suicide risk is characterized by people with few or no symptoms of internalizing disorders.
   Objective: In persons screened at intake to alcohol or other drug (AOD) treatment, this research examined whether person fit statistics would support an atypical subtype at high risk for suicide that did not present with typical depression and other internalizing disorders.
   Methods: Symptom profiles of the prototypical, typical, and atypical persons, as defined using fit statistics, were tested on 7408 persons entering AOD treatment using the Global Appraisal of individual Needs (GAIN; Dennis et al., 2003a,b).
   Results: Of those with suicide symptoms, the findings were as expected with the atypical group being higher on suicide and lower on symptoms of internalizing disorders. In addition, the atypical group was similar or lower on substance problems, symptoms of externalizing disorders, and crime and violence.
   Conclusions: Person fit statistics were useful in identifying persons with atypical suicide profiles and in enlightening aspects of existing theory concerning atypical suicidal ideation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   There is a lack of evidence regarding the effect of dose, pattern and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and behaviour problems in children aged 2 years and older.
   Methods
   A 10% random sample of women delivering a live infant in Western Australia (1995-96) were invited to participate in an 8-year longitudinal survey (78% response rate n = 2224); 85% were followed-up at 2 years, 73% at 5 years and 61% at 8 years. Alcohol consumption was classified by combining the overall dose, dose per occasion and frequency to reflect realistic drinking patterns. Longitudinal analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to investigate the association between child behaviour as measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist at 2, 5 and 8 years of age and prenatal alcohol exposure collected 3 months postpartum for each trimester separately, adjusting for a wide range of confounding factors.
   Results
   Low levels of prenatal alcohol were not associated with child behaviour problems. There were increased odds of internalizing behaviour problems following heavy alcohol exposure in the first trimester; anxiety/depression [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-7.43] and somatic complaints (aOR 2.74; 95% CI 1.47-5.12) and moderate levels of alcohol exposure increased the odds of anxiety/depression (aOR 2.24; 95% CI 1.16-4.34).
   Conclusions
   Prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate and higher levels increased the odds of child behaviour problems with the dose, pattern and timing of exposure affecting the type of behaviour problems expressed. Larger studies with more power are needed to confirm these findings.

   ADOLESCENCE
AB Attachment theory has been conceptualised as an affect regulation theory, proposing that attachment is associated with the expression and recognition of emotions as well as interpersonal functioning. Previous research has reported affect regulation difficulties in substance use disorders and addiction has been considered an attachment disorder. However, scarce empirical research exists on the relationship of attachment in relation to affect regulation and interpersonal functioning in those with substance use problems. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate potential associations between attachment, negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies, fear of intimacy and self-differentiation in substance abusers. The revised adult attachment scale (RAAS), the NMR expectancies scale, the fear of intimacy scale and the differentiation of self inventory were administered to a sample of 100 substance use disorder inpatients. Attachment accounted for significant variance in NMR expectancies and was also a strong predictor of fear of intimacy. The predictive utility of attachment also extended to self-differentiation, suggesting that attachment was strongly related to overall self-differentiation score, Emotional reactivity, Emotional cut-off and I position. These findings support attachment theory suggesting that attachment is associated with and predicts affect regulation abilities and difficulties in interpersonal functioning in a sample of substance use disorder inpatients. The inclusion and assessment of attachment appears to be important in the development of treatment programmes for substance abusing individuals.

AB Objectives: First, to determine if childhood experiences of abuse have an impact on internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders) among older adults. Second, we wish to determine if self-esteem plays a role in explaining the relationship between abuse and internalizing disorders. Method: First, we conducted an analysis on a population sample of participants aged 50 years or older (mean age = 67 years; SD = 10.3) assessed at two time points, three years apart (Wave 1, N = 1460; Wave 2, N = 1090). We examined the relationship between reports of childhood abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual) and internalizing disorders. Second, we determined the role self-esteem played in explaining the relationship. Results: We found that childhood experiences of abuse assessed at Wave 1 predicted the number of DSM-IV internalizing disorders occurring three years later. Demonstrating the specificity of self-esteem; we found self-esteem, but not emotional reliance, to moderate the relationship between abuse and internalizing disorders such that childhood abuse had more negative effects on those with low self-esteem compared to those with higher self-esteem. Contrary to prediction, self-esteem did not mediate the relationship between abuse and internalizing disorders. Conclusion: The negative effects of childhood abuse persist for many years, even into older adulthood. However, contrary to the findings in younger adults, self-esteem was not correlated with childhood abuse in older adults. Moreover, childhood abuse only had a negative effect on those who had low self-esteem. It may be through the process of lifespan development that some abused individuals come to separate out the effects of abuse from their self-concept.

AB Objective: In this article developmental and psychosocial adjustment problems observed in siblings of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are reviewed. For this purpose, medline was searched and books related with the subject and previous studies related with these siblings were examined. Results: Findings draw attention to the increase in the prevalence of PDD spectrum disorders and subthreshold problems which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PDD in siblings of children with PDD. It has been reported that these siblings have delay and deviance in motor and language development. Although some studies have demonstrated that their adjustment are not different than controls, others draw attention to the increased risk they have for adjustment problems, high depression rates and especially for internalizing problems. Discussion: Because of the hereditary and psychosocial loadings they have, siblings of children with PDD are at risk for psychopathology. Psychiatric evaluation of the siblings in this context will make early diagnosis and intervention possible. The limited number of studies in this area, highlights the need for longutidunal follow-up studies which will be done with these siblings. (Anatolian Journal of Psychiatry 2010; 11:163-170)

AB The development of children's emotion-related self-regulation appears to be related to, and likely involved in, many aspects of children's development. In this review, the distinction between effortful self-regulatory processes and those that are somewhat less voluntary is discussed, and literature on the former capacities is reviewed. Emotion-related self-regulation develops rapidly in the early years of life and improves more slowly into adulthood. Individual differences in children's self-regulation are fairly stable after the first year or two of life. Such individual differences are inversely related to at least some types of externalizing problems. Findings for internalizing problems are less consistent and robust, although emotion-related self-regulation appears to be inversely related to internalizing problems after the early years. Self-regulatory capacities have been related to both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction. Some interventions designed to foster self-regulation and, hence, reduce maladjustment, have proved to be at least partially effective.

AB This study provided an initial test of a theoretical model which emphasizes patterns of actual and perceived control. The model suggests that profiles of actual and perceived control are differentially related to emotional and behavioral problems. We examined whether anxiety and depression symptoms and aggressive behavior would differ among diverse patterns of actual (caregiver reported competencies) and perceived control (anxiety-related control beliefs) in youth (n = 203). Results were consistent with the theoretical predictions in that reported levels of anxiety and depression symptoms and aggressive behavior varied depending upon youth's control profiles. For example, youth with high actual and low perceived control exhibited relatively more anxiety/depression symptoms than aggressive behavior, while those youth with low actual and high perceived control exhibited relatively more aggressive behavior. Furthermore, youth with both high actual and perceived control reported and were reported by caregivers as having the least anxiety/depression symptoms and aggressive behavior, respectively. The findings provide empirical support for the model and suggest the importance of considering the role of actual and perceived control in emotional and behavioral problems. Implications for future tests of the model are also discussed.

AB This study explored the importance of using relevant measures when evaluating the effectiveness of early childhood interventions. Data from the federally-funded evaluation of the Comprehensive Child Development Program were used to examine whether the behavior measure, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), was an appropriate tool for the diverse community-based sample of young, low-income children. Results demonstrated no confirmation of the CBCL syndromes composing the Externalizing and Internalizing behavioral dimensions used to determine program impacts. Exploratory analyses revealed that two-thirds of the clinical behavior problems included in the CBCL were of very low prevalence in this community-based sample. These findings stress the importance of measurement fit in national evaluations of early childhood programs serving these vulnerable children.

   EVENTS; IMPRISONMENT; DELINQUENCY; ANXIETY
AB Theory and evidence relating parental incarceration, attachment, and psychopathology are reviewed. Parental incarceration is a strong risk factor for long-lasting psychopathology, including antisocial and internalizing outcomes. Parental incarceration might threaten children's attachment security because of parent-child separation, confusing communication about parental absence, restricted contact with incarcerated parents, and unstable caregiving arrangements. Parental incarceration can also cause economic strain, reduced supervision, stigma, home and school moves, and other negative life events for children. Thus, there are multiple possible mechanisms whereby parental incarceration might increase risk for child psychopathology. Maternal incarceration tends to cause more disruption for children than paternal incarceration and may lead to greater risk for insecure attachment and psychopathology. Children's prior attachment relations and other life experiences are likely to be of great importance for understanding children's reactions to parental incarceration. Several hypotheses are presented about how prior insecure attachment and social adversity might interact with parental incarceration and contribute to psychopathology. Carefully designed longitudinal studies, randomized controlled trials, and cross-national comparative research are required to test these hypotheses.

AB Background
   Cerebral palsy (CP) is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental condition persisting through the lifespan. In many individuals with CP, motor disorders are accompanied by other disturbances, including emotional and behavioural problems. Little is known on the course of such problems, also in relation to possible exacerbating or mitigating factors. Aims of this study were to test whether parental stress and support, apart from the severity of CP of the child, played a significant role in the course of behaviour problems.
   Method
   The participants aged 9, 11 and 13 were assessed (baseline) and followed up after 1, 2 and 3 years. Situational and relational sources of support and stress for the primary caregiver were rated with a questionnaire: (CBCL), behaviour problems with the Child Behaviour Checklist. Physicians rated motor ability using the Gross Motor Function Classification System.
   Results
   Behaviour problems of children with CP started significantly higher than in the general population, but diminished over the 3-year period. Older children showed less problems overall, and girls showed less externalizing problems than boys. Children with the most severe CP had more externalizing problems; effects on internalizing problems were not significant. Across time, an excess of stress vs. support related to parents' socio-economic and living situation and to parents' social relationships was positively related to total behaviour problems, internalizing and externalizing behaviours of children.
   Conclusions
   Levels of behaviour problems are elevated but diminish during adolescence for children with CP. Severity of CP plays a role as well as the family context in terms of the stress and support that caregivers experience.

AB The authors examined internalizing behavior problems at middle childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood and brain-based measures of stress vulnerability in 154 right-handed, nonimpaired young adults (M age = 23 years): 71 (30 males, 41 females) born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1,000 g) and 83 (35 males, 48 females) controls born at normal birth weight (NBW). Internalizing behavior problems increased from adolescence to young adulthood among ELBW individuals. ELBW adults exhibited greater relative right frontal electroencephalogram activity at rest and more concurrent internalizing behavior problems than NBW controls. Being born at ELBW may have subtle influences on brain-behavior relations even in survivors without major impairments and evidence of these influences may not emerge until young adulthood.

In a summer camp context, school-aged maltreated (n = 265) and nonmaltreated (n = 288) children provided morning and late afternoon saliva samples on 5 consecutive days. Child self-report and adult observer reports of child internalizing and depressive symptoms were obtained. Children experiencing EPA/SA and high depressive or internalizing symptoms uniquely exhibited an attenuated diurnal decrease in cortisol, indicative of neuroendocrine dysregulation. These results were specific to EPA/SA rather than later onset physical or sexual abuse or early occurring neglect or emotional maltreatment.

Mothers of children with cancer completed measures of PS and CD and rated their child's emotional, behavioral, and social adjustment. PS emerged as an independent predictor of the child's emotional, behavioral, and social adjustment; and moderated the relation between CD and child internalizing problems (IP). Contrary to expectations, children evidenced fewer IP under conditions of high CD and low PS, and more IP under conditions of low CD and low PS.

AB A developmentally oriented bio-neuropsychosocial model is introduced to explain the variation in family functioning and psychosocial adjustment in youth and young adults with spina bifida (SB). Research on the family functioning and psychosocial adjustment of individuals with SB is reviewed. The findings of past research on families of youth with SB support a resilience-disruption view of family functioning. That is, the presence of a child with SB disrupts normative family functioning but many families adapt to such disruption and exhibit considerable resilience in the face of adversity. Parents of youth with SB, and particularly those from lower socio-economic status (SES) homes, are at-risk for psychosocial difficulties. Individuals with SB are at-risk for developing internalizing symptoms, attention problems, educational difficulties, social maladjustment, and delays in the development of independent functioning. Emerging adults are often delayed in achieving milestones related to this stage of development (e.g., vocational and educational achievements). Methodologically sound, longitudinal, and theory-driven studies of family and psychosocial functioning are needed, as are randomized family-based intervention trials, to promote adaptive functioning and better psychosocial outcomes in families of individuals with SB.

AB Shyness is associated with social-emotional maladjustment in some, but not all, children. The ability to flexibly regulate attention under conditions of potential conflict may protect shy children from developing internalizing problems. In the current study, the associations between shyness, the N2 event related potential (ERP) response, and social-emotional adjustment were examined in a sample of 36 typically developing 9- to 13-year-old children. It was hypothesized that the N2 amplitude, an ERP measure associated with aspects of cognitive and attention control, would moderate the associations between shyness and social-emotional functioning (negative attribution style, social self-perceptions, social anxiety). Shyness was unrelated to behavioral or ERP measures collected during a modified Flanker task; however, shyness and N2 amplitude were alone and in combination associated with all three measures of social adjustment. In general, shyness was associated with poor outcomes primarily among children with relatively large amplitude, or enhanced, N2 responses. The results are discussed in terms of the role of conflict sensitivity in the regulation of attention and emotions associated with shyness and the importance of studying the combined influences of reactive and self-regulatory aspects of temperament in relation to adjustment in childhood.

AB This study examines the association between nighttime sleep characteristics and cortisol levels and how these variables relate to aspects of children's temperament and behavior Twenty-seven healthy children, aged 12-36 months, attending group childcare settings, participated in the study. Each child's sleep was measured at home with actigraphy over three nights. Saliva samples were collected by the mothers at bedtime and within 30 min of awakening. In addition, both the mother and the daycare teacher rated the child's behavioral difficulties and negative emotionality. It was found that children with more fragmented sleep displayed higher awakening cortisol levels compared to children with more efficient sleep. Moreover, elevated awakening cortisol levels were correlated with teachers' ratings of internalizing behavior and negative emotionality. These preliminary findings suggest that awakening cortisol may serve as a useful index of adrenocortical reactivity in young children, signaling a disturbance in physiological regulation, and underscore the need for more research pertaining to the dynamic associations between sleep and HPA-axis across the 24-hr period.

AB Early adversity, for example poor caregiving, can have profound effects on emotional development. Orphanage rearing, even in the best circumstances, lies outside of the bounds of a species-typical caregiving environment. The long-term effects of this early adversity on the neurobiological development associated with socio-emotional behaviors are not well understood. Seventy-eight children, who include those who have experienced orphanage care and a comparison group, were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure volumes of whole brain and limbic structures (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus). Emotion regulation was assessed with an emotional go-nogo paradigm, and anxiety and internalizing behaviors were assessed using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, the Child Behavior Checklist, and a structured clinical interview. Late adoption was associated with larger corrected amygdala volumes, poorer emotion regulation, and increased anxiety. Although more than 50% of the children who experienced orphanage rearing met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, with a third having an anxiety disorder, the group differences observed in amygdala volume were not driven by the presence of an anxiety disorder. The findings are consistent with previous reports describing negative effects of prolonged orphanage care on emotional behavior and with animal models that show long-term changes in the amygdala and emotional behavior following early postnatal stress. These changes in limbic circuitry may underlie residual emotional and social problems experienced by children who have been internationally adopted.

AB Research Findings: Early childhood mental health consultation aims to reduce problem behaviors and improve social skills in young children primarily through changes in the classroom environment and teacher practices. We conducted a systematic review of the literature and identified 14 rigorous studies that reported on child-level outcomes. These studies had at least one of the following characteristics: publication in a peer-reviewed journal, use of a randomized control trial design, or inclusion of a comparison group. Across these studies, there was variation in the approaches to consultation, qualifications of the consultants, and intensity of the services provided. Overall, early childhood mental health consultation services were consistently associated with reductions in teacher-reported externalizing behaviors. Findings related to reductions in internalizing behaviors were mixed. Teacher ratings of prosocial behaviors were improved in the majority of the studies that reported on this domain. Practice or Policy: This research synthesis underscores the importance of documenting the specific approaches to early childhood mental health consultation that are being implemented to allow for replication of effective models. Areas for future research improvement include increasing rigor through studies that contain independent assessments of children's behaviors, isolating key components of effective consultation, and identifying consultant qualifications and characteristics that lead to child behavior changes.

DE internalizing behavior; research design; retesting; childhood

ID VALIDITY
AB This investigation focuses on the question whether assessments of the development of internalizing behavior from childhood to adolescence are affected by the kind of research design (longitudinal versus cross-sectional). Two longitudinal samples of 432 second-graders and 366 fourth graders participated in a longitudinal study with subsequent measurements taken 1, 2, and 3 years later. A third sample consisting of 849 children covering the same range of grades participated in a cross-sectional study. The results show that the development of internalizing symptoms in girls - but not in boys - varies systematically with the research design. In girls, there is a decrease of internalizing symptoms (especially between the first two timepoints) in the longitudinal assessment, which may reflect, for example, the influence of strain during the first testing situation. Both longitudinal trajectories converge to a common trajectory from grade 2 to grade 7 when controlling for this "novelty-distress effect." Moreover, when we control this effect, the slight but significant decrease characterizing the common trajectory becomes similar to the one obtained in the cross-sectional study. Therefore, trajectories based on longitudinal assessments may suggest more changes with regard to internalizing symptoms over time than actually take place, while trajectories based on cross-sectional data may be characterized by an increased level of internalizing symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

AB The psychometric properties of the shortened version of the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (SRQ; Furman & Buhrmester, 1985) were examined in a sample of 428 Dutch adolescents, aged 13 to 16. In order to examine the dimensions Warmth/Closeness and Conflict, as proposed by Furman and Buhrmester, we first conducted confirmatory factor analyses. Second, we investigated the construct validity by correlating Warmth/Closeness and Conflict with internalizing and externalizing behaviors and the quality of relationship with parents. Third, we determined the internal reliability of Warmth/Closeness and Conflict and the underlying qualities by computing Cronbach's alpha s. The results confirmed the dimensions Warmth/Closeness and Conflict as major aspects of sibling relationships. Moreover, the construct validity of the instrument and internal consistency for these dimensions and the underlying qualities proved to be good. Our findings underscore the psychometric properties of the SRQ, in that it appears to be a valid and reliable measure to assess Warmth/Closeness and Conflict in sibling relationships.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore how passion was manifested among gifted and talent youth selected from a larger longitudinal study of child and adolescent development. The gifted sample included 25 high school and college students who were selected because they were in a gifted program in elementary school. The talent sample included 41 high school students who were selected because they were highly involved in athletics and the arts in middle childhood. The authors found that passion was more characteristic of participation in nonacademic activities (i.e., sports and the arts). Talented youth were more likely to talk about wanting to do their activity all the time, experiencing flow, getting emotional release from participation, and internalizing the activity into their identity. The authors also found that school settings, and especially regular classrooms as compared with gifted and advanced classes, appeared to undermine rather that support passion. The authors discuss implications of their findings for creating school environments that can foster passion.

AB The main aim of this paper is to determine the impact of the physical exercise on externalizing and internalizing behaviors in preschool children. The sample included 192 children aged 4 and 7 years. Of them, 87 took active part in organized physical activities and participated in a special 6-month physical education course, with 105 children making up the control group. In order to obtain data on externalizing and internalizing behaviors in children, a 36-item measuring instrument for behavior assessment was used.
   The results of this research suggest that over the observation period both externalizing and internalizing behaviors change in conformity to socially acceptable patterns of behavior. Both descriptive statistics and t-test results showed that the experimental group had better results in case of externalizing forms of behaviors rather than in the case of internalizing behaviors. In addition to this, it was shown that treatment-induced changes had influenced the reduction in scores regarding almost all indicators for problem behavior. Moreover, some of these changes were proved to be statistically significant.
   According to the results of a descriptive statistics, there is an emphasized tendency toward an increase in discrepancy between the experimental and control groups, with the discrepancy approaching a statistically significant difference under the influence of a special treatment.
   Based on everything said so far, the conclusion can be drawn that engagement in intensive physical activity encourages acquisition and development of conventional forms of behavior.

AB The relations among infant anger reactivity, approach behavior, and frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry, and their relations to inhibitory control and behavior problems in early childhood were examined within the context of a longitudinal study of temperament. Two hundred nine infants' anger expressions to arm restraint were observed at 4 months of age. Infants' approach behaviors during play with an unpredictable toy and baseline frontal EEG asymmetry were assessed at 9 months of age. Inhibitory control during a Go/No-Go task and parent report of behavior problems were evaluated at 4 years of age. High anger-prone infants with left, but not right, frontal EEG asymmetry showed significantly more approach behaviors and less inhibitory control relative to less anger-prone infants. Although a link between anger proneness in infancy and behavior problems in early childhood was not found, a combination of low approach behaviors and poor inhibitory control was predictive of internalizing behaviors.

AB Objective. To determine if there is a relationship between maternal perception of neighborhood safety in 3<SUrd</SU grade and weight status in 5<SUth</SU grade children, to test if gender moderates this relationship, and to identify potential mediators. Method. Data from 868 children and their mothers involved in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD-SECCYD) were used to examine the relationship between maternal perception of neighborhood safety in the 3<SUrd</SU grade and child body mass index (BMI) z-score in the 5<SUth</SU grade. Multiple regression models tested this relationship, the effect of gender, and potential mediating variables (time outdoors in neighborhood, television viewing, child behavior problems and puberty status). Results. Neighborhood safety ratings in the least safe tertile, compared with the safest tertile, were associated with an increased risk of obesity independent of gender, race and income-to-needs ratio (OR=1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 2.46), and higher child BMI z-scores among girls, but not boys, compared with the safest tertile (beta=0.33; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.57). Neither amount of time spent outdoors in the neighborhood, television viewing, child behavior problems (internalizing or externalizing), nor puberty status altered the relationship. Conclusions. Maternal perception of the neighborhood as unsafe in 3<SUrd</SU grade independently predicted a higher risk of obesity, and a higher BMI z-score among girls, but not boys, in the 5<SUth</SU grade. The relationship was not explained by several potential mediators. Further investigation is needed to explore these gender differences and potential mediators.</.

AB Objective: Few pediatric primary care providers routinely use mental health screening tools, in part because they may have concerns about whether screening is useful and how it will affect their practice. This study examined the extent to which screening in primary care would increase the identification of mental health problems among a diverse population of children and youth. Methods: Prior to the visit, the parents of 767 patients age 5 to 16 completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to report their child's mental health symptoms and impairment. Without viewing the screening results, each child's provider (N = 53) completed a questionnaire to report whether the child or youth demonstrated a mental health problem. Results: Compared with providers, the screen identified twice as many patients with moderate symptoms and nearly 28% more patients with high symptoms. Among patients with high symptoms, providers failed to identify a problem among 78% of those who were Latino/Other and 55% of those who were African American compared with 27% of Caucasian patients (p < 0.001). Providers were not more likely to identify patients with externalizing versus internalizing symptoms but were more likely to identify patients who demonstrated symptoms across multiple domains of functioning. Conclusions: Screening substantially increased the number of children and youth who would be identified as possibly having a mental health problem. Screening may have the most potential to increase the identification of problems among patients who have moderate mental health symptoms and those who are African American or Latino. (Int'l. J.

AB Empirical research has shown that parent-child conflict is positively related to poor adjustment in adolescents; however, the underlying processes have not been adequately examined. To explore the possible mediating pathways, reciprocal filial belief and perceived threat were chosen to represent two likely mechanisms accounting for how parent-child conflict harms adolescents' perceptions of their relationship with their parents and their self-perceptions within their cognitive-appraisal framework. The former operates by attenuating children's affection towards their parents and the latter by lowering their self-perceptions. This study also distinguishes internalizing from externalizing problems in order to examine whether lower reciprocal filial belief more strongly mediates the relation between conflict with parents and adolescents' externalizing problems and whether perceived threat more strongly mediates the relation between conflict with parents and adolescents' internalizing problems. Hypotheses are as follows: (1) the more parent-child conflict adolescents report, the less reciprocal filial belief they recognize, which, in turn, leads to more maladjustments, especially externalizing ones; (2) the more parent-child conflicts adolescents report, the more threat they perceive, which, in turn, leads to more maladjustments, especially internalizing ones. Participants consisted of 603 Taiwanese adolescents (226 males and 377 females) aged 15 to 19 (average age 5 16.95; SD 5 0.78). Structural equation modelling analyses confirmed the hypotheses. However, the three direct effects of conflict on internalizing problems, aggression, and deviant behaviour were still significant. In addition, a greater effect of the paternal than the maternal role on the link between conflict and attenuated reciprocal filial belief, and between perceived threat and internalizing problems, was identified. Implications for understanding the mediation processes responsible for all indirect effects, even the subsidiary ones, and the greater impact of conflict with the father than with the mother are discussed. Limitations of the study and considerations for future research are also addressed.

AB There is support for a differentiated model of early internalizing emotions and behaviors, yet researchers have not examined the course of multiple components of an internalizing domain across early childhood. In this paper we present growth models for the Internalizing domain of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment and its component scales (General Anxiety, Separation Distress, Depression/Withdrawal, and Inhibition to Novelty) in a sample of 510 one- to three-year-old children. For all children, Internalizing domain scores decreased over the study, although girls had significantly higher initial levels and boys had steeper declines. General Anxiety increased over the study period and, when modeled individually, girls evidenced higher initial levels and greater increases. For all children, Separation Distress and Inhibition to Novelty decreased significantly over time, while Depression/Withdrawal remained low without change. Findings from our parallel process model, in which all components were modeled simultaneously, revealed that initial levels of internalizing scales were closely associated while rates of change were less closely related. Sex differences in variability around initial levels and rates of change emerged on some scales. Findings suggest that, for one- to three-year-olds, examining scales of the internalizing domain separately rather than as a unitary construct reveals more meaningful developmental and gender variation.

AB This study examined the development of antisocial personality problems (APP) in young adulthood from disruptive behaviors and internalizing problems in childhood and adolescence. Parent ratings of 507 children's (aged 6-8 years) symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and anxiety, were linked to self-ratings of adolescents' (aged 14-16 years) symptoms of depression, substance use, conduct problems, and somatic problems, to predict self-ratings of APP in young adulthood (age 20-22 years). The findings suggested a hierarchical development of antisocial behavior problems. Despite being positively associated with conduct problems in adolescence, neither internalizing problems nor substance use added to the prediction of APP in young adulthood from conduct problems in adolescence. The developmental pathways to APP in young adulthood did not differ by gender.

AB Across development, maternal depression has been found to be a risk factor for youth psychopathology generally and youth depression specifically. Maternal Expressed Emotion (EE) has been examined as a predictor of outcome among youth with depression. The present study explored the associations between youth psychopathology and two predictors-maternal depression within the child's lifetime and maternal EE-in a study of children at risk for depression. One hundred and seventy-one youth, ages 8-12, and their mothers participated. To assess maternal and youth psychopathology, dyads were administered structured diagnostic assessments, and mothers and children completed self-report measures of their own depressive symptoms. In addition, mothers completed the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist-Parent Report Version (CBCL) for their children. Maternal EE was assessed based on the Five Minute Speech Sample. History of maternal depression was associated with high maternal EE, and the combination of maternal depression history and maternal EE was associated with children's own reports of higher depressive symptoms. Current maternal depressive symptoms were associated with mothers' reports of children's Internalizing scores on the CBCL, and maternal depression history, current maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal EE were strongly associated with mothers' reports of children's Externalizing and Total Problem scores on the CBCL. History of maternal depression and a rating of high or borderline Critical EE (characterized by maternal critical comments and/or reports of a negative relationship) were independently associated with children's depression diagnoses.

AB In a large sample of early adolescents (T2: n = 1023; M age = 13.51; 55.5% girls) it was investigated whether the effects of parental and peer acceptance and rejection on psychopathology (externalizing and internalizing problems) remain when taking into account both contexts simultaneously. Moreover, we examined whether acceptance in one context can buffer rejection in the other. It was found that when analyzing peer and parent effects simultaneously (1) the protective effect of parental acceptance and the risk effect of peer rejection were diminished; (2) the protective effect of peer acceptance and the risk-effect of parental rejection remained strong; and (3) peer acceptance buffered parental rejection but parental acceptance did not buffer peer rejection. The results imply that the parent and peer contexts are interdependent. Implications and directions for future research are given.

AB The purposes of the present study were to examine the growth trajectories of children's social skills from kindergarten through sixth grade, and to investigate the roles of early behavior problems and teacher-child relationships in children's social skill development, using data from phases I, II, and III of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. There were four main findings. First, on average, children showed curvilinear social skill growth trajectories from kindergarten to sixth grade, with periods of marked acceleration in the early and later elementary years and a period of slight deceleration in the late elementary years. Second, children with higher levels of preschool internalizing behavior problems demonstrated lower levels of kindergarten social skills and qualitatively different social skill growth trajectories than their less-internalizing peers over time. Third, children with higher-quality teacher-child relationships demonstrated greater social skills from kindergarten through sixth grade than their peers with lower-quality relationships. The magnitude of the effect for teacher-child relationships increased as children aged and was marginally stronger for children with lower levels of early internalizing problems. implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB This study examined the unique longitudinal effects linking academic competence, social competence, and internalizing symptoms from childhood to adulthood. A multimethod and multi-informant approach was used to assess psychopathology and competence in 205 participants during four developmental periods. Social competence in childhood had a cascading effect on internalizing symptoms in adolescence, whereas social and academic competence in emerging adulthood had dual cascading effects on internalizing in young adulthood. Results suggested a developmental cascade beginning with externalizing symptoms in childhood, which contributed to lower academic achievement in adolescence, which in turn influenced social competence in emerging adulthood and internalizing symptoms in young adulthood.

AB This cross-sectional study examined the nature of child and adolescent psychopathy using the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) in 3,675 schoolchildren (ages 11-16) in Hong Kong, China. A confirmatory factor analysis observed a good fit for the three-factor model (callous-unemotional, impulsivity, narcissism) of APSD, with boys scoring higher than girls on narcissism and callous-unemotional traits. Modest construct validity was found with regard to expected relationships with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The previously observed higher scores on callous-unemotional traits in boys at older ages were replicated. Findings suggest that child psychopathy may be applicable in a non-Western culture, although the callous-unemotional factor may have a different meaning in China.

AB We examined familial and cultural factors predicting parent-child (dis)agreement on child behavior and parenting problems. Immigrant Chinese parents (89.7% mothers; M age=44.24 years) and their children (62 boys; 57.9%) between the ages of 9 and 17 years (M=11.9 years, SD=2.9) completed measures of parent punitive behavior and child problems. Concordance in item profiles and discrepancies in overall problem levels were assessed. Overall, immigrant parents reported fewer child and parenting problems than did their children. Relationship closeness predicted less disagreement in ratings of child internalizing symptoms and punitive parenting. Parental acculturative stress and parent-child acculturation dissonance predicted more disagreement regarding internalizing problems. The findings highlight potential under-identification of internalizing problems among immigrant Chinese families that may be driven by acculturation processes.

AB Two studies examined shared and unique relations of social information processing (SIP) to youth's anxious and depressive symptoms. Whether SIP added unique variance over and above trait affect in predicting internalizing symptoms was also examined. In Study 1, 215 youth (ages 8-13) completed symptom measures of anxiety and depression and a vignette-based interview measure of SIP. Anxiety and depression were each related to a more negative information-processing style. Only depression was uniquely related to a less positive information processing style. In Study 2, 127 youth (ages 10-13) completed measures of anxiety, depression, SIP, and trait affect. SIP's relations to internalizing symptoms were replicated. Over and above negative affect, negative SIP predicted both anxiety and depression. Low positive SIP added variance over and above positive affect in predicting only depression. Finally, SIP functioning partially mediated the relations of affect to internalizing symptoms.

AB This study examined how girls' initial use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana related to changes in depressive, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, and whether these changes varied based on which internalizing symptom trajectories the girls were on. Data came from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a community-based study of girls assessed at ages 5 to 8 and followed for 6 years. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectory groups. The results indicated that for girls on a ohigh depressive symptomo trajectory, initial use of marijuana was related to further increases in depressive symptoms. Initial uses of alcohol and cigarettes were associated with overall increases in depressive symptoms, and the initial use of cigarettes was associated with an overall increase in generalized anxiety symptoms. Initial use of all substances was related to change in social anxiety, but the direction of change varied by trajectory group and substance. Links between initial use and internalizing symptoms depended on the type of substance, type of internalizing symptom, and trajectory group.

AB Adolescents with depression and high levels of oppositionality often are particularly difficult to treat. Few studies, however, have examined treatment outcomes among youth with both externalizing and internalizing problems. This study examines the effect of fluoxetine, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), the combination of fluoxetine and CBT, and placebo on co-occurring oppositionality within a sample of depressed adolescents. All treatments resulted in decreased oppositionality at 12 weeks. Adolescents receiving fluoxetine, either alone or in combination with CBT, experienced greater reductions in oppositionality than adolescents not receiving antidepressant medication. These results suggest that treatments designed to alleviate depression can reduce oppositionality among youth with a primary diagnosis of depression.

AB This study examined the longitudinal link between clique membership status and the development of psychopathology in 451 children followed annually from age 9 to 12 years. Classroom clique membership status was identified through social network analysis, and internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed using peer nominations. Controlling for concurrent experiences of social preference and dyadic friendships, a high clique membership probability was found to be related to low levels of internalizing problems and to an increase in externalizing problems across 4 years. This link between clique membership and an increase in externalizing problems was found for boys only.

AB Objective: To examine the impact of maternal breast cancer on the emotional and behavioral functioning of school-age children; evaluate whether child adjustment is associated with variations in distress, marital satisfaction, and parenting behavior evidenced by mothers and fathers; and determine whether these associations differ from families that are not contending with cancer. Method Participants included 40 children (age 8-16 years) of mothers with breast cancer along with their parents as well as 40 families of comparison classmates not affected by parental illness. Questionnaires assessing the domains of interest were administered in families' homes. Results: Mothers with breast cancer and their spouses reported higher levels of distress than comparison parents; child internalizing problems were inversely associated with parental adjustment in both groups. No group differences were found in any indicators of family functioning including parent-child relationships. Warm and supportive parenting by both mothers and fathers were associated with lower levels of child internalizing behavior, but only in families affected by breast cancer. Conclusion: These results suggest that children of mothers with breast cancer, such as most children, may be at risk for internalizing behavior when parents are distressed. These children may particularly benefit from interactions with mothers and fathers who are warm and supportive, and maintenance of positive parenting may partially account for the apparent resilience of these youth.

AB Using data collected from an urban Southern Visayan province during the Summer of 2006, this study examines a sample of 133 Filipino fathers to consider potential relationships between father behaviors and child outcomes. Increased paternal psychological control predicts increased problematic child outcomes, with sons being more affected than daughters. Furthermore, increased authoritative fathering is associated with decreased externalizing problems of children as well as fewer internalizing problems for sons but not for daughters. Increased father involvement predicts improved sibling relationship quality for children. Other factors predicting problematic child outcomes in the overall regression model include father education and number of children in the household. Overall, findings support the idea that Filipino fathers play a valuable role in the lives of their children.

AB This study examines the effects of child abuse and domestic violence exposure in childhood on adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Data for this analysis are from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study, a prospective study of 457 youth addressing outcomes of family violence and resilience in individuals and families. Results show that child abuse, domestic violence, and both in combination (i.e., dual exposure) increase a child's risk for internalizing and externalizing outcomes in adolescence. When accounting for risk factors associated with additional stressors in the family and surrounding environment, only those children with dual exposure had an elevated risk of the tested outcomes compared to non-exposed youth. However, while there were some observable differences in the prediction of outcomes for children with dual exposure compared to those with single exposure (i.e., abuse only or exposure to domestic violence only), these difference were not statistically significant. Analyses showed that the effects of exposure for boys and girls are statistically comparable.

AB Objective: Patients operated on for hypospadias often display a range of emotional and functional postoperative problems at an early age. This study explores the social, psychosocial and sexual development of adolescent boys operated on for hypospadias at an early age.
   Patients and method: Ten boys between the ages of 11 and 18 years and an age-matched reference group of 10 boys completed three mailed questionnaires: the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18, the Youth Self Report, and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. Data on body image and genital perception, and on social, psychosocial and sexual development were gathered by interview and standardized questionnaire.
   Results: Internalizing or externalizing problems were not reported to be increased. Boys operated on for hypospadias had a significantly lower score on the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, Social Acceptance subscale. Fewer boys in the clinical group considered their penis to be normal or judged their penis as similar to that of friends. No difficulties were found regarding psychosocial or sexual development; there was however a tendency towards a more negative genital appraisal.
   Conclusion: Boys operated on for hypospadias appear to experience normal social, psychosocial and sexual development. (C) 2009 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, we examined the psychometric properties of the Revised Ego Resiliency 89 Scale (ER89-R; Alessandri, Vecchio, Steca, Caprara, Caprara, 2008), a brief self-report measure of ego resiliency. The scale has been used to assess the development of ego resiliency from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, focusing on different ways to define continuity and change. We analyzed longitudinal self-report data from 267 late adolescents (44% male) using 4 different approaches: factor analysis for testing construct continuity, correlational analysis for examining differential stability, latent growth modeling for analyzing mean level change, and the reliable change index for studying the occurrence of change at the individual level. Converging evidence points to the marked stability of ego resiliency from 16 to 20 years, both for males and females. The scale predicts externalizing and internalizing problems, both concurrently and at 2 and 4 years of distance. Findings suggest that the ER89-R scale represents a valid and reliable instrument that can be fruitfully suited for studying ego resiliency through various developmental stages.

AB We examined the linear and nonlinear relations between breadth of extracurricular participation in 11th grade and developmental outcomes at 11th grade and 1 year after high school in an economically diverse sample of African-American and European-American youth. In general, controlling for demographic factors, children's motivation, and the dependent variable measured 3 years earlier, breadth was positively associated with indicators of academic adjustment at 11th grade and at 1 year after high school. In addition, for the three academic outcomes (i.e., grades, educational expectations, and educational status) the nonlinear function was significant; at high levels of involvement the well-being of youth leveled off or declined slightly. In addition, breadth of participation at 11th grade predicted lower internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, alcohol use, and marijuana use at 11th grade. Finally, the total number of extracurricular activities at 11th grade was associated with civic engagement 2 years later.

AB The relations among effortful control, ego resiliency, socialization, and social functioning were examined with a sample of 182 French adolescents (14-20 years old). Adolescents, their parents, and/or teachers completed questionnaires on these constructs. Effortful control and ego resiliency were correlated with adolescents' social functioning, especially with low externalizing and internalizing behaviors and sometimes with high peer competence. Furthermore, aspects of socialization (parenting practices more than family expressiveness) were associated with adolescents' effortful control, ego resiliency, and social functioning. Effortful control and ego resiliency mediated the relations between parental socialization and adolescents' peer competence and internalizing problems. Furthermore, effortful control mediated the relations between socialization and adolescents' externalizing behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of cultural and developmental variation.

AB This study examines family and child characteristics, parent and peer relationships, and early adolescent behavior as statistical predictors of trajectories of number of sexual partners from midadolescence through early adulthood using data from 527 participants in the Child Development Project. Early adolescent developmental antecedents accounted for modest variance in number of sexual partners. Latent growth models revealed that African American race, more advanced pubertal development, lower parental monitoring knowledge, association with more deviant peers, and lower grade point average in early adolescence each predicted having more sexual partners at age 16. In addition, non-African American race, lower child IQ, higher parental monitoring knowledge, and lower early adolescent internalizing problems each was associated with a higher rate of growth in number of sexual partners over time at the ages following 16. Latent growth mixture modeling identified subgroups with distinct trajectories of involvement with sexual partners that were associated with family and child characteristics, parent and peer relationships, and behavior in early adolescence.

AB This study used longitudinal, multireporter data, in a community sample, to examine the role of rejection sensitivity in late adolescents' social and emotional development. Rejection sensitivity was linked to a relative increase in adolescent depressive and anxiety symptoms over a 3-year period, even after accounting for teens' baseline level of social competence. Additionally, reciprocal relationships emerged between rejection sensitivity and internalizing symptoms. Rejection sensitivity was also linked to relative decreases in peer-reports of teens' social competence over a 3-year period. Consistent with research on gendered socialization, males reported higher levels of rejection sensitivity than females at ages 16 and 17. Results are interpreted as highlighting the importance of rejection sensitivity in understanding late adolescent social and emotional development.

AB Objective: There is ongoing debate regarding the impact of youth behavior problems oil placement change in child welfare compared to the impact of placement change on behavior problems. Existing studies provide support for both perspectives. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the relations of behavior problems and placement change in a nationally representative sample of youths in the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Method: The sample consisted of 500 youths in the child welfare system with out-of-home placements over the course of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being Study. We used a prospective cross-lag design and path analysis to examine reciprocal effects of behavior problems and placement change, testing an overall model and models examining effects of age and gender. Results: In the overall model, out of a total of eight path coefficients, behavior problems significantly predicted placement changes for three paths and placement change predicted behavior problems for one path. Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at baseline predicted placement change between baseline and IS months. Behavior problems at an older age and externalizing behavior at 18 months appear to confer an increased risk of placement change. Of note, among female subjects, placement changes later in the study predicted Subsequent internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Conclusions: in keeping with recommendations from a number of professional bodies, we suggest that initial and ongoing screening for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems be instituted as part of standard practice for youths entering or transitioning in the child welfare system.

AB This study examines whether disagreeable youth are distinct from aggressive youth, victimized youth, and withdrawn youth. Young adolescents (120 girls and 104 boys, M = 13.59 years old) completed personality and adjustment inventories. Aggression, withdrawal, and victimization scores were derived from peer nominations (N = 807). Cluster analyses identified six groups. Disagreeable youth, aggressive victimized youth, withdrawn victimized youth, and withdrawn youth tended to have worse concurrent peer relations than did agreeable youth and aggressive youth. Disagreeable youth had some of the highest levels of concurrent and prospective adjustment problems, with rates of self-and mother-reported internalizing problems that rivaled withdrawn victimized youth and withdrawn youth, and rates of self-and mother-reported externalizing problems that rivaled aggressive victimized youth and aggressive youth. The findings indicate that low agreeable youth represent a discrete category of adolescents with social and adjustment difficulties.

AB Existing studies of mediation models have been limited to normal-theory maximum likelihood (ML). Because real data in the social and behavioral sciences are seldom normally distributed and often contain outliers, classical methods generally lead to inefficient or biased parameter estimates. Consequently, the conclusions from a mediation analysis can be misleading. In this article, we propose 2 approaches to alleviate these problems. One is to identify cases that strongly affect testing of mediation using local influence methods or robust methods. The other is to user robust methods for parameter estimation and subsequently test them mediated effect based on the robust estimates. The application of these 2 approaches is illustrated using 1 simulated and 2 real data examples. The interest in 1 real data set is the relationship among marital conflict, children's emotional insecurity, and children's internalizing problems. The other example is concerned with whether ethnic identity mediates the effect of family cohesion on Korean language fluency. Results show that local influence and robust methods rank the influence of cases similarly, but robust methods are more objective. Moreover, when the normality assumption is violated, robust methods give estimates with smaller standard errors and more reliable tests of the mediated effect compared with normal-theory ML. An R program that implements the local influence and robust procedures for mediation analysis is also provided.

AB Objective. This study examined interactions between parenting beliefs and parenting behaviors in the prediction of early childhood externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Design. The authors observed sensitive and negative intrusive parenting behaviors during infancy and toddlerhood in conjunction with self-reported maternal beliefs about the importance of discipline/control and concerns regarding spoiling in a community sample of 185 African American and European American mother-child dyads. Multiple regression techniques modeled interactions between parenting self-reported parenting beliefs and observed parenting behaviors to predict mother-reported child internalizing symptoms and mother-reported child externalizing symptoms at 30 and 36 months. The analyses also explored the role of ethnicity as a moderator of these relations. Results. The combination of high and average spoiling beliefs and low levels of sensitive parenting was associated with elevated child internalizing symptoms. Negative parenting and beliefs reflecting concerns about spoiling were independent risk factors for elevated child externalizing symptoms. Conclusion. Parenting beliefs and behaviors should be considered jointly to identify risks for the development of early behavior problems.

AB Objective. Although maternal internalizing symptoms and parenting dimensions have been linked to reports and perceptions of children's behavior, it remains relatively unknown whether these characteristics relate to expectations or the accuracy of expectations for toddlers' responses to novel situations. Design. A community sample of 117 mother-toddler dyads participated in a laboratory visit and questionnaire completion. At the laboratory, mothers were interviewed about their expectations for their toddlers' behaviors in a variety of novel tasks; toddlers then participated in these activities and trained coders scored their behaviors. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing demographics, depressive and worry symptoms, and parenting dimensions. Results. Mothers who reported more worry expected their toddlers to display more fearful behavior during the laboratory tasks, but worry did not moderate how accurately maternal expectations predicted toddlers' observed behavior. When also reporting a low level of authoritative-responsive parenting, maternal depressive symptoms moderated the association between maternal expectations and observed toddler behavior, such that, as depressive symptoms increased, maternal expectations related less strongly to toddler behavior. Conclusions. When mothers were asked about their expectations for their toddlers' behavior in the same novel situations from which experimenters observe this behavior, symptoms and parenting had minimal effect on the accuracy of mothers' expectations. When in the context of low authoritative-responsive parenting, however, depressive symptoms related to less accurate predictions of their toddlers' fearful behavior.

AB Objective. The present meta-analysis examines the relation between coparenting and child adjustment. Design. The authors integrate 59 studies and differentiate among cooperation, agreement, conflict, and triangulation as dimensions of coparenting. Further, they differentiate internalizing and externalizing symptoms, social functioning of children, and attachment as outcomes. Results. Effect sizes were generally small and, to some extent, moderated by age of the children, percentage of girls in the sample, clinical background of the sample, mono-informant bias, annual family income, and percentage of separated parents. Effect sizes remained significant after controlling for individual parenting or marital quality. Coparenting predicted change in child adjustment. Conclusions. Coparenting is important for the psychological adjustment of children. Research and practice should pay further regard to this construct.

AB This article presents an overview on how to structure, carry out and evaluate observed family interaction with video. The emphasis lays on tasks used to stimulate family interaction. The examples cited illustrate different approaches to evaluation. Results of our latest research are presented which refer to (1) the clinical differentiation possibilities of macroanalytic observational scales, (2) the situational specificity of interactive behaviour in a comparison between a structured game situation and a minimally-structured planning discussion, and (3) the relation between various levels of family organisation (individuals, dyads of parent, parent-child-relationship, and family system). Families of 31 children with internalizing disorders and 30 children with externalizing disorders (age: 4-15 years) were included in the study and compared to a healthy control group (21 Children). Family interactions showing the family either as a group playing or planning something together were videotaped and rated independently in each case by two trained and "blind" observers using the Munich Interactional Scales and the Beavers Interactional Scales approaches. Characteristics of the interaction could be identified which were consistent/stable for all children in both situations, or which changed depending on the situation. Individual patterns of behaviour of children with emotional or behavioural problems depend on the level of structure and demands in the situation. Different levels of family organisation (individuals, dyads of parent, parent-child-relationship and family system) are related. The advantages of using videotapes of family interactions in family assessment could be demonstrated. These findings should be taken into account in child treatment, family counselling and therapy.

AB This exploratory study examined mental development and the quality of socio-emotional functioning of 16 institutionalized children, aged from 3 to 6 years old, relating them with the quality of their caregivers' attachment narratives. Griffiths Developmental Scales, Child Behavior Checklist, Attachment Script Representation and Attachment Q-Sort were used in the psychological assessment. Results showed that chidren's developmental level was placed below normative data. Furthermore, data regarding externalizing and internalizing psychopathology symptoms were close to the clinical population. Nevertheless, and in contrast to our hypothesis, most children presented almost mormative attachments scores (secure base), but this was not related to the quality of attachement narratives presented by their caregivers. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the impact of institutional deprivation in child development.

AB Background. The relationship between metabolic control and cognitive function in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (DM type 1) is not clear. We compared the quality of glycemic control (GC) and cognitive measures in adolescents with DM type 1 to find out if the quality of diabetes management is related to cognitive impairment.
   Method. We assessed executive functions (EFs) and other neuropsychological and psychosocial variables in 70 adolescent patients with DM type 1 and 20 age-matched controls. Patients were divided into two groups according to their last hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): acceptable (HbA1c 5.9-8.0%, mean 6.9%, 36 patients, mean age 14 years) and non-optimal (HbA1c 8.2-11.6%, mean 9.3%, 34 patients, mean age 15.6 years).
   Results. We found impaired EFs, mainly problems of concept formation (p = 0.038), cognitive flexibility (p = 0.011.) and anticipation (p = 0.000), in the patients with DM type 1. Both groups did not differ in intelligence, most assessed EFs and adjustment to chronic illness (Youth Self-Report; YSR). Younger patients (<15 years) were cognitively less flexible. GC was worse in older patients and in patients with longer duration of the disease. We also found significant differences between patients with diabetes and controls concerning somatic complaints, internalizing problems (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL) and social activity (CBCL and YSR).
   Conclusions. DM type I is associated with cognitive deficits in adolescents independent of the quality of metabolic control and the duration of the disease. These deficits are probably related to the disease, especially in patients with early-onset diabetes.

AB Objective: To review the extant literature on functional abdominal pain in childhood through the lens of the developmental psychopathology perspective and to systematize research results by means of a two-stage pathway model in which the emergence of functional abdominal pain and its potential transition into a somatoform adjustment disorder is outlined. Methods: Using electronic searches for published studies and previous reviews about functional abdominal pain. Results: An association of functional abdominal pain with internalizing symptoms, poor well-being of family members, major life events and daily stressors is found. The impact of stress on pain seems to be moderated by the children's coping style and their perceived competence and self-efficacy to manage the pain experience. There is evidence for the influence of modeling and operant mechanisms on pain experiences. A new term, 'somatoform adjustment disorder', and its relation to functional abdominal pain is discussed. Conclusions: It seems that those children with functional abdominal pain who cannot adapt to the pain indeed run the risk of developing a somatoform adjustment disorder. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

AB We tested hypotheses that adolescent behaviors indicating difficulty with individuation from mothers predict current internalizing and increases in internalizing problems a year later. Seventy-eight rural, primarily White working-class adolescents used video recall methods to rate their behaviors with their mothers during a conflict resolution task. Multiple regression and sequential analyses revealed that girls, particularly those with prior internalizing problems, evidenced increased internalizing problems if they had high levels of Conflict and Submission (oagitated submissiono). Boys' internalizing problems increased as their Submission, but not Conflict (odisengaged submissiono), rose. These behavior patterns may represent gendered vulnerabilities in mastering individuation.

AB Different from other countries Of Europe and North American, studies about the behavioral profile of Noonan syndrome's patients are inexistent. The objective of this study was to report the profiles of behavioral functions of 10 participants (4 females and 6 males), with mutations in the PTPN11 gene. For this assessment it was used the Inventory of Behaviors of Children and Adolescents from 6 to 18 years (CBCL/6-18) and the Inventory of Auto-Evaluation for Adults from 18 to 59 years (ASR). The main results point that in Adaptive Functioning Scale all the participants were in the normality range. In the Syndrome Scale the adult participants were in normality range and the children were in clinical range to the sub-scales anxious/depressed, somatic complaints and aggressive behavior. In the DSM-Oriented Scale, 25% of the adult patients were in the borderline clinical range and clinical range, respectively, for Avoidant Personality Problems and Antisocial Personality Problems. About the both children in this scale were in the clinical range of Affective Problems and Anxiety Problems. This relatively homogenous sample, regarding the PTPN11 gene, shows a normal adult behavioral profile, on the average. However, the individual children anti adult profiles show diverse internalizing and externalizing behavioral disturbances.

AB Children exposed to overwhelming and potentially traumatic events early in their lives are considered at-risk for problems in adjustment. Yet it is not known whether it is the age of first exposure (AFE) to violence or the amount of violence that the child witnessed in their lifetime that has the greatest impact on adjustment. For a sample of 190 children ages 6 to 12 exposed to intimate partner violence, their mothers reported that the average length of their abusive relationship was 10 years. The majority of children were first exposed to family violence as infants (64%), with only 12% first exposed when school-aged. Both the AFE and an estimate of the cumulative amount of violence were significantly and negatively related to children's behavioral problems. However, in regression analyses controlling for child sex, ethnicity, age, and family environment variables, cumulative violence exposure accounted for greater variance in adjustment than did AFE. Furthermore, cumulative violence exposure mediated the relationship between AFE and externalizing behavior problems, indicating that the cumulative exposure to IPV outweighed the AFE in its effect on child adjustment.

AB This cross-sectional study (N = 708 families) took relevant covariates such as parenting style or socioeconomic variables into account to detect associations between screen media use, behavior problems, and ADHD. According to the SES (socioeconomic status) mainstreaming hypothesis the strongest associations would be expected for children with high SES; by contrast according to the SES resonance hypothesis these associations would be expected most notably for children with low SES. Results: Daily television use was associated significantly with increased sleep problems, aggressive behavior, and attention problems. On the other hand daily computer use showed an association with fewer attention problems. In relation to mother's SES, associations were found (foremost) between daily television use and internalizing behavior, which to some extent agree with the predictions of a resonance hypothesis, whereas in relation to father's SES these associations agree rather with the predictions of a mainstreaming hypothesis. Further research and research designs could profit by taking these moderations into account.

AB Comorbidity in autism spectrum disorders - I. Mental retardation and psychiatric comorbidity
   Objective: Recent epidemiological surveys show a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorders than was to be expected based on the first studies in this field. The objective of our study is to analyse the frequency of mental retardation and co-morbid psychiatric disorders and symptoms in a large clinical sample of patients with pervasive developmental disorders. Method: The sample consists of all patients (N = 601) with a pervasive developmental disorder diagnosed at the Department of Developmental Disorders at the Heckscher-Klinikum. For all patients the level of intellectual functioning was measured. In addition to psychiatric diagnoses, we also recorded intervention-relevant symptoms such as eating and sleeping problems, and auto-aggressive behavior on Axis I, as well as psychosocial impairments and level of psychosocial functioning on Axes V and VI. Results: 26% of the patients functioned on a normal intellectual level (N = 58). 54% of the patients (N = 325) had at least one additional psychiatric diagnosis, and 19% (N = 110) had two additional diagnoses. The most frequent diagnoses were externalizing disorders (N = 221). Internalizing disorders (N = 96), as well as other disorders (N = 114) were about equally frequent. Auto-aggressive behavior occurred more often among children with severe mental retardation than in children of normal intelligence. There was a significant association between the presence of (auto-) aggressive behavior as well as externalizing diagnoses and the level of psychosocial functioning. Conclusions: Children with pervasive developmental disorders show a wide variety of co-morbid problems, which are relevant for the treatment and the course of the disorder. The presence of externalizing behaviors is an additional burden on the development of these children.

AB First studies investigating the German version of the Reynolds Adolescent Adjustment Screening Inventory (RAASI; Reynolds, 2001) supported its adequate reliability and validity. Further investigations concerning the reliability and validity were made in two studies with sixth to ninth graders; construct validity was examined among n = 496 adolescents. Criterion-oriented validity was investigated among n = 52 adolescents with psychological disorders (internalizing: n = 20, externalizing: n = 18, combined: n = 14). Adequate to good internal consistencies as well as factorial and correlational validity were supported by both studies. Female participants showed higher levels of emotional distress. Although eighth and ninth graders reported higher on all psychological problems compared to sixth and seventh graders, females in the 8/9th grade have been found to be at highest risk. Clinical groups scored higher on all psychological problems than the sex, age, and grade matched nonclinical groups. Thus, more evidence has been accumulated for good reliability and construct validity of the German version of the RAASI. Moreover, the findings provided further support for the adequate criterion-oriented validity of this screening measure.

AB Background: Previous studies of Haitian immigrant and refugee youth have emphasized "externalizing" behaviors, such as substance use, high risk sexual behavior, and delinquency, with very little information available on "internalizing" symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. Analyzing stressors and "internalizing" symptoms offers a more balanced picture of the type of social and mental health services that may be needed for this population. The present study aims to: 1) estimate the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Haitian immigrant students; and 2) examine factors associated with depression and PTSD to identify potential areas of intervention that may enhance psychosocial health outcomes among immigrant youth from Haiti in the U. S.
   Methods: A stratified random sample of Haitian immigrant students enrolled in Boston public high schools was selected for participation; 84% agreed to be interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Diagnosis of depression and PTSD was ascertained using the best estimate diagnosis method.
   Results: The prevalence estimates of depression and PTSD were 14.0% and 11.6%; 7.9% suffered from comorbid PTSD and depression. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated factors most strongly associated with depression ( history of father's death, self-report of schoolwork not going well, not spending time with friends) and PTSD (concern for physical safety, having many arguments with parents, history of physical abuse, and lack of safety of neighborhood).
   Conclusions: A significant level of depression and PTSD was observed. Stressors subsequent to immigration, such as living in an unsafe neighborhood and concern for physical safety, were associated with an increased risk of PTSD and should be considered when developing programs to assist this population. Reducing exposure to these stressors and enhancing access to social support and appropriate school-based and mental health services may improve educational attainment and psychosocial health outcomes among Haitian immigrant youth.

AB Background. Behavioral and emotional problems in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) may be related to disease factors, or to socio-demographic factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in children with SCD living in a Western European Country, compared to healthy siblings (who were comparable in age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status-SES), and to a Dutch norm population. Methods. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF) and Disruptive Behavior Disorders rating scale (DBD) were distributed among caregivers and teachers of 119 children with SCID aged 6-18 years and among caregivers and teachers of 38 healthy siblings. Results. Questionnaires were returned by caregivers and/or teachers of 106 children with SCID and 37 healthy siblings. According to caregivers and teachers, children with SCD had more severe internalizing problems than healthy siblings and the norm population. According to teachers, Subgroups Of both children with SCD and healthy siblings had more severe externalizing problems than the norm population. Children with SCD had more difficulties than healthy siblings in terms of school functioning, showed less competent social behavior and tended to have more attention deficits. Conclusions. Children with SCD are at increased risk of developing internalizing problems as a result of their disease. Subgroups of children with SCD are at increased risk of developing severe externalizing problems, which may either be related to socio-demographic factors, or to disease factors, Such as neurocognitive deficits associated with cerebral infarction.

AB South Africa has one of the highest HIV-infection rates in the world, yet few studies have examined disclosure of maternal HIV status and its influence on children. This study provides descriptive information about HIV disclosure among South African mothers and explores whether family context variables interact with maternal HIV disclosure to affect children's functioning. A total of 103 mothers, who self-identified as living with HIV and who were the primary caregivers of a child between the ages of 11 and 16, were interviewed. A total of 44% of mothers had disclosed, and those who had most typically perceived children's reactions to disclosure to be sadness and worry. Widows and married mothers were more likely than single mothers to disclose their HIV status. Disclosure to children significantly predicted externalizing, but not internalizing, behaviors. Family variables had direct but not interactive effects on child functioning. This study highlights the complexity of disclosure-related decisions and the importance of addressing the family context.

AB Costello syndrome is a rare rasopathy caused by germline mutations in the oncogene HRAS resulting in increased signal transduction through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast to the more common rasopathies, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome, limited information is available on standardized cognitive testing in this cohort. Past research indicated a mean average IQ in the mild mental retardation range, with strengths in fluid reasoning (FR) and weakness in expressive language, as well as static skills over time. Here we report on standardized IQ and adaptive functioning in 18 individuals with Costello syndrome, nine males and nine females, and longitudinal development for 11 who had previous testing. The overall IQ, ranging from severe mental retardation to the average range, with a mean in the mildly mentally retarded range, was again found to be stable, but an interesting pattern in the development of nonverbal FR was identified. Participants showed an improvement in nonverbal FR, followed by stable skills thereafter, suggesting a "late bloomer" effect in late childhood/early adolescence. Overall adaptive functioning fell into the range of Intellectual Disability for 70% of subjects, with Socialization as a relative strength and Daily Living Skills an area of relative difficulty. Interestingly, females were found to be higher functioning than males in all domains, including Communication, Daily Living Skills and Socialization. Caregivers reported significantly more behavioral concerns in males, including internalizing, externalizing, and other maladaptive behaviors. In contrast, no gender differences were found in cognitive or visuomotor functioning. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Research on adulthood posits personality and self-esteem as important predictors of psychopathology. In childhood, however, the study of these relationships is complicated by the lack of consensus on how to combine data from multiple informants of child behavior. This study evaluates the relationships among personality symptoms, self-esteem and psychopathology in 60 child psychiatric patients (M (age) = 10.6) using principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate data from multiple informants and compares this strategy with a single informant approach. When predictor and criterion measures were rated by a single informant, strong and differential relationships between personality symptoms, self-esteem and psychopathology are found. When multiple informant data were combined into composite scores by PCA, correlations decreased but remained significant. Hierarchical regression analyses affirm the robustness of the following pattern: Emotional Instability, Introversion and Global Self-Esteem are associated with internalizing whereas Disagreeableness and Behavioral Conduct primarily relate to externalizing problems.

AB Early pubertal maturation has been identified as a potential risk factor for internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence. However, questions about the mechanisms that link early pubertal timing and psychopathology remain. In this article, we describe four hypotheses that explain the effects of early pubertal maturation. The hormonal influence hypothesis predicts that an increase in hormones at puberty leads to increased psychopathology. The maturation disparity hypothesis focuses on the gap between physical, social, and psychological maturation in early maturers that exacts the toll on individuals' adjustment. The contextual amplification hypothesis proposes that experiencing early pubertal transition in a disadvantaged context increases the risk for psychopathology. Finally, the accentuation hypothesis maintains that preadolescent vulnerabilities and challenges during early pubertal transition together increase problems. This article concludes with a consideration of how these hypotheses individually and collectively generate new lines of research linking early pubertal maturation and psychopathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) increases offspring aggression and diminishes differences in sexually dimorphic behaviors in rodents.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between prenatal BPA exposure and behavior in 2-year-old children.
   METHODS: We used data from 249 mothers and their children in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA). Maternal urine was collected around 16 and 26 weeks of gestation and at birth. BPA concentrations were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Child behavior was assessed at 2 years of age using the second edition of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). The association between prenatal BPA concentrations and BASC-2 scores was analyzed using linear regression.
   RESULTS: Median BPA concentrations were 1.8 (16 weeks), 1.7 (26 weeks), and 1.3 (birth) ng/mL. Mean (+/- SD) BASC-2 externalizing and internalizing scores were 47.6 +/- 7.8 and 44.8 +/- 7.0, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, log(10)-transformed mean prenatal BPA concentrations were associated with externalizing scores, but only among females [beta = 6.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-12.0]. Compared with 26-week and birth concentrations, BPA concentrations collected around 16 weeks were more strongly associated with externalizing scores among all children (beta = 2.9; 95% CI, 0.2-5.7), and this association was stronger in females than in males. Among all children, measurernents collected at <= 16 weeks showed a stronger association (beta = 5.1; 95% CI, 1.5-8.6) with externalizing scores than did measurements taken at 17-21 weeks (beta = 0.6; 95% CI, -2.9 to 4.1).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may be associated with externalizing behaviors in 2-year-old children, especially among female children.

AB The objective of the present study was to examine whether parent-reported short sleep duration and sleeping difficulties are related to behavioral symptoms among pre-school aged children. The study is a cross-sectional survey of 297 families with 5-6-year-old children. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for children was used to measure sleep duration and sleeping difficulties, and the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's Report Form were used to measure attention problems, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In multivariate logistic regression models, short sleep duration was according to parental reports related to inattention (adjusted odds ratio 4.70, 95% CI 1.58-14.00), internalizing (adjusted odds ratio 3.84, 95% CI 1.32-11.21), and total psychiatric symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 3.53, 95% CI 1.23-10.17) while according to teacher's reports it was almost significantly related to internalizing symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 4.20, 95% CI 0.86-20.51). Sleeping difficulties were strongly related to all subtypes of psychiatric symptoms according to parental reports (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 6.47 to 11.71) and to externalizing symptoms according to teachers' reports (adjusted odds ratio 7.35, 95% CI 1.69-32.08). Both short sleep duration and sleeping difficulties are associated with children's behavioral symptoms. Intervention studies are needed to study whether children's behavioral symptoms can be reduced by lengthening sleep duration or improving sleep quality.

Using multiple methods and informants, we explored the development of the mentoring relationship, challenges and benefits of mentoring children with incarcerated parents, and match termination in 57 mentor-child dyads. More than one-third of matches terminated during the first 6 months of participation. For those matches that continued to meet, however, children who saw their mentors more frequently exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In monthly interviews with participants, themes emerged about challenges associated with mentoring and reasons for match termination. Implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are discussed.

AB We sought to determine the extent to which children's behavior problems would mediate the relationship between children's learning disorders and adoption satisfaction using nationally representative data from 1,865 adoptive parents. We found that high levels of behavior problems, operationalized as internalizing and externalizing behaviors, occurred more frequently in children with learning disorders, supporting our mediational model. We concluded that it was the behavior problems, not the learning disorders, that were most problematic for parents. Implications for both pre- and postadoption services are highlighted.

AB Previous research Suggests that patterns of comorbidity of a limited number of anxiety, depressive, substance use and antisocial personality (ASP) disorders among adults are best reflected by a hierarchical three-factor structure with two correlated factors ('anxious-misery' and 'fear') that are summarized in a second-order 'internalizing' factor and one 'externalizing' factor. It has not been examined whether this structure is developmentally stable and robust against additions of more diagnoses. Using data from a prospective-longitudinal community study of adolescents and Young adults we re-evaluate the three-factor model originally proposed by Krueger (Archives of General Psychiatry, 1999; 56, 921-926). Using confirmatory factor analysis with identical conventions as in Krueger's original work we found that the three factor model did not fit robustly across age or a wider range of diagnoses. Using explanatory factor analysis we examined alternative structures. We found various clinically meaningful patterns with good fit that go substantially beyond the original three-factor structure.

AB Previous research suggests that patterns of comorbidity of common mental disorders among adults are best reflected by a hierarchical three-factor structure with two correlated factors ('anxious-misery' and 'fear') summarized in a second-order 'internalizing' factor and one 'externalizing' factor. This three-factor structure has not been examined yet in a sample of adolescents and young adults.
   A representative sample of 3021 adolescents and young adults (baseline age 14-24) were prospectively followed over 10 years. Mental disorders were assessed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) by using the standardized Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Ten mental disorders (major depressive episode, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, agoraphobia, panic disorder, alcohol dependence, drug dependence, antisocial personality) were fitted to a series of Confirmatory Factor Analysis models using: (1) 12-month data, and (2) lifetime data from a person-year data set.
   The three-factor model showed good fit to the observed data in our sample both when 12-month diagnoses and lifetime-to-date diagnoses from a person-year data file were used; yet the higher-order 'internalizing' factor summarizing 'anxious misery' and 'fear' had to be omitted.
   The three-factor model could be replicated in a sample of adolescents and young adults with the exception that the second-order 'internalizing' factor was not consistent with the data. Further research is necessary to provide more complete insight into the structure of mental disorders by examining the stability of the structure of mental disorders in different developmental stages (ages) and by using a more extensive set of mental disorders.

AB Aggressive, violent and antisocial behaviour in children and adolescents is a growing concern across the globe. Targeting parent-teen relationships is critical in reducing problem behaviour. 'Connect' is a manualized ten-week program for parents or alternative caregivers of at-risk teens that focuses on the building blocks of secure attachment: parental sensitivity, cooperation, reflective capacity, and effective dyadic affect regulation. Through didactic and experiential activities, parents develop the competence necessary to identify, understand and respond to the needs of their teen in a manner that provides structure and safety while safeguarding the quality of the parent-teen relationship. In Study 1, twenty parents reported significant increases in perceived parenting satisfaction and efficacy and reductions in adolescents' aggression, antisocial behaviour and other mental health problems following completion of Connect as compared to a waitlist control period. These effects were sustained and additional small effects were noted in decreases in conduct problems, depression and anxiety at a 12-month follow-up. The program was then transported to 17 communities serving 309 parents through standardized training and Supervision of group leaders. Study 2 summarizes significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in teen externalizing and internalizing problems; enhanced social functioning; and improvements in affect regulation. Parents also reported significant increases in parenting satisfaction and perceived efficacy and reductions in caregiver burden.

AB This study investigated the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention in a sample of Italian early adolescents oil internalizing and post-traumatic stress symptoms and coping strategies. Participants were 153 Italian adolescents (48% male), attending 7th grade (M = 12.24 yrs, SD = 0.47). Youth were randomly assigned either to write about personal emotional events related to problems they recently experienced with peers, or trivial topics. Data were collected before and 2 months following the intervention. Analyses revealed no overall intervention effects on symptoms. However, level of peel-victimization moderated the effects of the intervention on coping strategies, such that victimized youth in the intervention showed increases in cognitive restructuring and avoidance coping, relative to other groups. Thus, expressive writing affected coping strategies but not internalizing problems in our early adolescent sample. (C) 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB The efficacy of Multisystemic therapy (MST) in treating adolescent aggression has been established, however, not all youth and their families benefit from MST. One reason for this treatment variability could be the failure to distinguish between different aggressive Subtypes with different risk factors, developmental prognoses and treatment needs. We investigated whether changes in maternal depression over MST would lead to different outcomes for two aggressive Subtypes: pure externalizers (EXT) and mixed externalizers/internalizers (MIXED). Forty-two EXT and 27 MIXED youth and their families underwent MST for six months. Maternal depression, youth externalizing and internalizing behaviour were assessed before and after MST. Results showed a marginally greater change in externalizing for EXT youth. In addition, reductions in maternal depression were related to successful treatment outcomes for MIXED youth only. Our findings have implications for MST clinicians, namely the importance of reducing depressive symptoms in mothers of MIXED youth to improve their outcomes.

AB This study examines the psychometric properties of a newly developed pictorial anxiety assessment, the Picture Anxiety Test (PAT), designed for young children. A sample of 71 5-7-year-old children (clinically anxious and healthy controls) participated in an assessment comparing the PAT to other, established anxiety measures. Children's ratings were also compared to parent ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems. The PAT demonstrated favorable psychometric properties in this sample, including moderate to high internal consistency, high convergent validity with related constructs, and high discriminant validity between diagnostic groups and across pre- and post-treatment. Initial findings suggest that the PAT is a psychometrically sound instrument for assessing child anxiety and avoidance in young children and a valuable addition to existing diagnostic instruments for clinicians working with anxious children.

ID STUDENTS
AB Behavior, whether internalizing or externalizing, constitutes a primary challenge in any inpatient setting. In many cases, behavior may interfere with progress during inpatient treatment, resulting in the need for a behavioral strategy for those concerns. A multidisciplinary team approach is often necessary to fully identify and remediate interfering difficulties. Functional behavioral assessment (FBA) is a team-based technique that offers a positive option to these types of difficulties. This article provides a rationale for and delineates the use of FBA as a strategy for assessment and treatment for a complex care patient. Two uncontrolled case studies (pediatric rehabilitation and cancer) are used to illustrate the use of FBA in the tertiary hospital setting. Both cases demonstrated improvements in behavior with limited resources (time and training) needed to implement behavioral plans. Additional case-controlled research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of FBA as a strategy for multidisciplinary treatment planning and intervention.

AB Background:
   Childhood externalizing and internalizing behaviors have been associated with injury risk in childhood and adolescence, but it is unknown whether this association continues to hold in adulthood. We examined whether externalizing and internalizing behaviors expressed in childhood predict injuries in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
   Methods:
   The participants were from the 1958 British birth cohort (n = 11,537). Problem behaviors were assessed by teachers at ages 7 and 11. Injuries were reported by the participants' parents (at ages 7, 11, 16) and by the participants (at ages 23, 33, 42, and 46). Data on injury severity were available at ages 23 and 33, and on types of injuries at ages 23, 33, and 42. Measures of childhood family environment included father's social class, family size, and family difficulties. Adult psychological distress, treated as a potential mediating factor, was assessed at ages 23, 33, and 42.
   Results:
   Externalizing behavior predicted increased injury risk: one SD increase in externalizing score was associated with 10-19% increase in the rate of injuries in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In contrast, internalizing behavior decreased injury rate by 3-9% in adolescence and adulthood. Externalizing behavior was associated with various types of injuries, including injuries in traffic, at home, at work, and from violent assaults, while internalizing behavior predicted decreased injury risk particularly in sports, in traffic, and at home. These associations were largely independent of childhood family environment and adult psychological distress.
   Conclusions:
   The findings suggest that childhood problem behaviors predict injury risk over the life course from childhood to midlife, with externalizing behaviors increasing and internalizing behaviors decreasing this risk.

Outcomes were assessed at postintervention (2 months), after completion of 4 monthly booster sessions (6 months), and at 12-month follow-up. Children were assessed by child reports on depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems; by parent reports on internalizing and externalizing problems; and by child and parent reports on a standardized diagnostic interview. Parent depressive symptoms and parent episodes of major depression also were assessed. Evidence emerged for significant differences favoring the family group intervention on both child and parent outcomes; strongest effects for child outcomes were found at the 12-month assessment with medium effect sizes on most measures. Implications for the prevention of adverse outcomes in children of depressed parents are highlighted.

AB Objectives: This study investigated predictors of mental health service utilization from age 5 through age 16. Methods: Data were collected on a community sample of 399 children, including 338 European Americans and 61 African Americans. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed by maternal and teacher reports in kindergarten. History of mental health service utilization was assessed by maternal reports when participants were 16 years old. Results: On average, the probability of first-time mental health service utilization increased in early to middle childhood, stabilized, and then increased in early adolescence. Mother reports of internalizing behaviors (independent of teacher reports of externalizing behaviors) predicted an increased likelihood of service use among European American children but a decreased likelihood of service use among African American children. Externalizing behaviors (independent of internalizing behaviors) predicted a higher likelihood of first-time service use in middle childhood. The combination of elevated internalizing and externalizing behaviors predicted a higher likelihood of first-time service use in adolescence, mainly among European American children. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that elevated mother-reported internalizing behaviors are less likely to forecast mental health service utilization among African American children compared with European American children. To meet the mental health service needs of all children, it is critical to further examine reasons for service utilization and underutilization among children with internalizing problems.

AB Positive outcomes for children with developmental disabilities (DD) can be affected by children's behavior problems. This study examined the family environment of 125 children with DD at age 3, and the extent to which that environment, as well as children's cognitive and adaptive functioning, predicted the problematic behaviors that children with DD exhibited at age 5. The family environment included marital status, poverty status, stressful life events, and family climate, consisting of the extent of cohesiveness, expressiveness, and conflict in the family. Analyses indicated that children's behavior problems at 5 were predicted by the numbers of stressful events experienced by their families when the children were 3 years old. Consistent with developmental systems models, family climate added significant unique variance in predicting both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The findings support the need for practices in early intervention programs that promote the positive climate of families of children with DD.

AB This study focuses on relations between fathers' behavior in family context and children's adjustment, including the roles of paternal depressive symptoms, paternal marital conflict behaviors, paternal parenting, and children's emotional security. Participants included 235 families with a six-year-old child, with families followed longitudinally each year for three years. In terms of fathers' adjustment, paternal problem drinking was related to paternal negative marital conflict behaviors and decreased positive parenting, which was associated with children's externalizing and internalizing problems. Fathers' depressive symptoms were directly related with children's internalizing problems. Children's emotional security was an intervening variable in relations between father's behavior in family context and children's development.

AB The purpose of the current study was to explore how mother's and father's connectedness and involvement individually and collectively influence the lives of their children. Specifically, we asked how fathers' and mothers' parent-child connectedness and behavioral involvement influenced both problem behaviors (externalizing and internalizing behaviors) and positive outcomes (prosocial behaviors and hope) during early adolescence. Data for this study were taken from the Flourishing Families Project, from which 349 mothers and fathers were selected, along with their early adolescent child (mean age = 11.23 years, SD = .96). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed (even after controlling for child age, gender, and self-regulation) that mothers' and fathers' contributions differed, primarily as a function of child outcome. Namely, father (but not mother) connectedness and involvement were negatively related to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing behaviors, whereas mother (but not father) connectedness and involvement were positively related to adolescents' prosocial. behaviors and hope. We also found that when one parent's involvement was low (for whatever reason), the other parent's involvement made a significant and important contribution to the child's well-being, particularly in the area of internalizing behaviors.

AB The role of anxiety/depression in the progression of youth externalizing problems to future high risk behaviors has been disputed in the literature. Mixed support exists for a multiple problem hypothesis (i.e., co-occurring anxiety/depression leads to more high risk behaviors) and a protective hypothesis (i.e., anxiety/depression buffers this progression). The present study compared these two hypotheses in a sample of 124 African-American single mother families by examining mother report of externalizing problems and anxiety/depression at an initial timepoint and youth report of high risk behaviors fifteen months later. Results support the multiple problem hypothesis: In the context of high levels of externalizing problems, high levels of anxiety/depression were associated with more youth engaging in high risk behavior across the 15 month follow-up than were low levels of anxiety/depression. The findings suggest it is important to consider multiple domains of youth problem behaviors to conceptualize and prevent high risk behaviors.

AB Although youth with internalizing symptoms experience friendship difficulties, surprisingly little is known about their problematic interpersonal behaviors. The current observational study identifies a new construct, conversational self-focus, defined as the tendency to direct the focus of conversations to the self and away from others. Results indicated that youth with internalizing symptoms were especially likely to engage in self-focus when discussing problems with friends and that doing so was related to their friends perceiving the relationship as lower in quality, particularly helping. Content analyses further indicated that self-focused youth talked about themselves in ways that were distracting from their friends' problems and that they changed the subject abruptly. Last, conversational self-focus was not redundant with related constructs of rumination and self-disclosure. This research highlights the importance of intervention efforts aimed at teaching self-focused youth ways to cope with distress that are more effective and will not damage their friendships.

AB Background:
   Thalassemia major (TM) is a chronic disease with adverse emotional effects on both the child and the family. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychiatric state and behavioral problems of children with TM.
   Methods:
   Twenty children diagnosed with TM and 34 healthy children were enrolled in this study carried out by the Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics. Mothers of the children of both the groups were handed a child behavior check-list for 4-18-year-old children and adolescents as well as a short questionnaire requesting demographic information.
   Results:
   The psychiatric diagnosis was significantly higher in the children with TM (55.0%) as compared to the control group (14.7%). The thalassemic children showed an anxiety disorder frequency of 30.0% and a depressive disorder frequency of 15.0%. T scores of the indicators of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, attention problems and social problems contained in the child behavior check-list were shown to be higher in children with TM than in the control group. The TM group demonstrated significantly higher problems in peer relationships and educational success in comparison with the controls.
   Conclusion:
   Children with TM are posed with an increased risk of psychopathology.

AB This descriptive study examined the distribution of risk factors in a sample that was selected on the basis of existing potential for difficult child behaviors. We inquired into whether exposure to risk factors was distributed equally across different contexts of ethnicity, locality, and child gender. Participants included 731 mother-child dyads recruited from WIC Programs in rural, suburban, and urban localities. Cumulative risk indices were constructed using neighborhood, family, and individual risk factors. The findings generally revealed that African American children and children in urban localities were exposed to higher numbers of risk factors and cumulative risk in relation to other ethnic children and localities. On the other hand, Caucasian children expressed higher levels of vulnerabilities to risk for internalizing behaviors than did other children. The results are discussed in terms of differences in contextual specific rates of risk exposure, vulnerability, and their implications for prevention and intervention research.

AB Objective: To assess coping strategies of long-term retinoblastoma (RB) survivors and explore determinants of behavioural functioning, including medical, socio-demographic and coping variables.
   Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included 117 RB survivors (12-35 years), registered in the Dutch national RB register. Survivors were asked to fill in coping, social support and behavioural questionnaires, and situational characteristics were obtained from medical archives and from an interview. Prevalence rates of coping strategies were computed based on self-reports. One-sample t-tests were applied to analyse differences in the use of coping strategies compared with healthy reference samples. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify various determinants for behavioural problems within the RB sample.
   Results: RB survivors differed from their healthy reference group in one coping style, i.e. they showed significantly less emotion-oriented coping behaviour. Adolescents who came from a single-parent family and/or experienced lower social support and used more emotion-oriented coping reported more total problem behaviour. More internalizing problems were reported for adolescents who experienced less social support and less acceptance of the disease. For adults, more life events, emotion-oriented coping and lower social support explained more total problem behaviour, especially internalizing problems.
   Conclusion: RB survivors showed less emotion-oriented coping behaviour compared with the reference group. Behavioural problems are best determined by emotion-oriented coping, social support, life events other than RB and acceptance of the disease, and not by medical variables. Therefore, these variables should be taken into consideration during interventions for this group. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The construct of emotion dysregulation increasingly has been used to explain diverse psychopathologies across the lifespan. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; K. L. Gratz & L. Roemer, 2004) represents the most comprehensive measure of the construct to date and exhibits good reliability and validity in adults; however, the measure has yet to be tested in adolescents. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the DERS in a community sample of 428 adolescents (ages 13-17 years). Exploratory factor analysis supported a 6-factor structure consistent with the 6 DERS subscales. Internal consistencies for the subscales were good to excellent (alphas ranged from .76 to .89). In support of the measure's construct validity, the DERS exhibited robust correlations with psychological problems reflecting emotion dysregulation, specifically depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, alcohol use, and drug use. Intercorrelations among the DERS subscales ranged from negligible to high (range: r = .04 to r = .68), and potential problems with discriminant validity were noted. In general, results support the reliability and validity of the DERS as a measure of emotion dysregulation in adolescents.

AB The internal consistency of the Human Behavior Rating Scale (HBRS) was investigated. The 91-item Likert-type scale is designed to measure five dimensions: persistence, curiosity, externalizing affect, internalizing affect, and cognition. It is used as a research tool to investigate the tenets of Eaves' 1993 integrated theory of human behavior. Three separate sampling plans were employed. Teachers and nonteachers completed Human Behavior Rating Scale ratings of children ranging in age from 5 to 18 years old. Cronbach coefficients alpha were reported by sex, grade, or age for the three samples. Of the 185 reported alpha coefficients, 175 were at or above .90, while 10 had values between .80 and .89.

AB This study examined the relationship of two putative school-based protective factors-student identification with school and perceived teacher support-to psychosocial outcomes in a sample of urban youth exposed to community violence. Participants were 175 high school students ages 14-19 in grades 9-12 from a large urban school district. Results indicated that exposure to violence was positively associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Additionally, identification with school and teacher support were related to higher hope and lower psychosocial distress. Adolescents who reported higher identification with school and higher teacher support reported higher hope, regardless of the level of violence exposure. Results emphasize the importance of school factors, particularly feeling connected to and supported in school, in promoting hope and minimizing psychosocial distress for youth exposed to community violence.

AB Personality as a resource or risk for development was discussed in the light of the results of the ongoing Finnish Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (FJYLS) which the author has conducted since 1968 when the participants (N = 369, b. 1959) were 8 years of age. A general hypothesis presented within a two-dimensional framework of self-control and activity was that the child's high self-control of emotions and behavior would be associated with adaptive behavior in adulthood. The results have provided evidence in support for and limitations to the hypothesis. High self-control was a resource and low self-control was a risk for development, but there were gender differences that came out consistently in variable-oriented and person-oriented analyses. A resource factor for male adult social functioning was, compared to females, a broader construct of self-control in childhood covering both more passive (compliant) and active (constructive) behavior; only active well-controlled (constructive) behavior was a resource for female functioning. A risk factor for female functioning was low self-control combined with passivity (internalizing behavior), whereas low self-control combined with activity (externalizing behavior) was a risk factor for male functioning. Childhood self-control was not directly associated with adult psychological functioning such as well-being but indirectly through social functioning such as career development. Low self-control in childhood was an antecedent of criminal behavior but only for those male offenders who committed offences in adulthood, not for those who had limited their offending to adolescence.

AB Background: Recent studies show that advanced paternal age (APA) is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A body of evidence also suggests that individuals who develop schizophrenia show subtle deviations in a range of behavioural domains during their childhood. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between paternal and maternal ages and selected behavioural measures in children using a large birth cohort.
   Method: Participants were singleton children (n=21,753) drawn from the US Collaborative Perinatal Project. The Outcome measures were assessed at 7 years. The main analyses examined the relationship between parental age and behavioural measures when adjusted for a range of potentially confounding variables, including age of the other parent, maternal race, socioeconomic measures, sex, gestation length, maternal marital status, parental mental illness, and child's age-at-testing.
   Results: Advanced paternal age was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse 'externalizing' behaviours at age seven years. For every five year increase in paternal age, the odds of higher 'externalizing' behaviours was increased by 12% (OR=1.12: 95% CI=1.03, 1.21, p<0.0001). The relationship persisted after adjusting for potential confounding factors. 'Internalizing' behavioural outcome was not associated with advanced paternal age. In contrast, advanced maternal age was significantly protective against adverse 'externalizing' behavioural outcomes, but associated with an increased risk of adverse 'internalizing' behavioural outcomes.
   Discussion: The offspring of older fathers show a distinctly different pattern of behaviours compared to the offspring of older mothers. The diverse socio-cultural and biologically-mediated factors that underpin these findings remain to be clarified. In light of secular trends related to delayed parenthood, the mechanisms underlying these findings warrant closer scrutiny. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored the nature and basis of teachers' concerns regarding several behavioural and social difficulties experienced by their secondary-school students. It was hypothesized that teachers would be most concerned about students presenting externalizing behavioural or academic difficulties but not those displaying internalizing problems. We also expected that pupils who were objects of teacher concern would be considered more maladjusted than random controls in terms of self- and peer-rated popularity and problem behaviours. Participants were 1384 secondary school pupils from Seville, Spain. The most common reasons indicated by teachers for their concerns about students were motivational and socialization-emotional concerns. There was some basis for these concerns: students who were objects of teacher concerns were significantly more likely to be perceived by their peers and by themselves as socially rejected, more aggressive/disruptive, more withdrawn and less cooperative than controls. Nevertheless, teachers expressed concern about only a minority of pupils who appear to be at risk according to other sources of information.

AB To examine associations between childhood psychopathology and family factors at age 8, and sense of coherence (SOC) at age 18.
   The sample includes 2,314 Finnish boys born 1981 with information about psychopathology from parents and teachers using Rutter scales, and self-reports of depressive symptoms using Child Depression Inventory (CDI), and self-reports of SOC at age 18.
   Low parental education level and living in other than two biological parent family at age 8 were associated with low SOC 10 years later. Boys with internalizing symptoms based on parent/teacher reports, and depressive symptoms based on self-reports at age 8 were at risk for lower SOC at follow-up. Comorbidity of internalizing and conduct problems had the strongest association with low SOC.
   The study shows that internalizing symptoms, comorbid conduct and emotional problems, low parental education level and nonintact family at age 8 predict low SOC at age 18. Future research whether universal, selective or indicated early interventions targeted on risk factors of childhood mental health problems may result in promotion of well-being (including good SOC) in early adulthood is warranted.

AB Background
   The social-behavioural functioning of children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well studied and not fully understood, with available studies reflecting a mixed set of findings. The primary purpose of this paper is to compare the social-behavioural functioning of children with CKD with typical controls using multiple raters. A secondary analysis also examines the impact of disease severity on social-behavioural functioning.
   Methods
   Parental ratings and self-reports on the Behavior Assessment System for Children were obtained from a patient sample of 26 children and adolescents with CKD. This sample was comprised of those with end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease; n = 13) and those with chronic renal insufficiency (n = 13). For comparison, a typically developing control group (n = 33) also was ascertained.
   Results
   While behaviour ratings by parents and children fell within the average range, parent ratings showed an increased number of internalizing symptoms when compared with the CKD Group. Exploratory analyses revealed parental ratings showing more specific concerns on the Behavior Assessment System for Children individual clinical scales of Anxiety, Depression and Somatization. No differences were observed between the groups on the children's self-ratings, or in terms of numbers of children falling above the 90th percentile for both parent and child ratings. Secondary analyses did not produce any group differences between the chronic renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease severity groupings.
   Conclusions
   These findings failed to show the presence of social-behavioural difficulties in children with CKD, although there may be specific concerns for the presence of internalizing symptoms as per parent ratings. These findings suggest the need for follow-up of the subtle affective symptoms that might be present in children with CKD as recognizing these subthreshold social-behavioural symptoms may be a critical part of their overall clinical care.

AB Emotion Regulation Training (ERT) was developed for adolescents with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and emotion dysregulation. ERT is an adaptation of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) programme. This paper describes the background of the programme, and gives an outline of the treatment programme. The effectiveness of ERT was examined in a randomized controlled pilot study with 43 youth (aged 14-19 years) in five mental health centres in the Netherlands. Subjects were assessed before and after random assignment to ERT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or to TAU alone (n = 20). Outcome measures included assessment of BPD symptoms, locus of control, and internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Both groups showed equal reductions in BPD symptoms over time. The group receiving ERT plus TAU (and not the TAU-only group) had a significant increase in internal locus of control: ERT participants reported more sense of control over their own mood swings, and attributed changes in mood swings not only to external factors. The study was complicated by a high attrition. The implications of the findings are discussed, including the difficulties inherent in treating and researching an adolescent population, and the need for researchers to develop age-appropriate assessments.

AB Individuals with dyslexia may have lower self-esteem and exhibit more emotional and behavioural difficulties than those without reading problems. However, the nature of any relationship between self-esteem and psychopathology remains unknown. This exploratory study assessed levels of self-esteem using the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Manual for the Self-Perception Profile for Children. University of Denver, CO: Denver; 1985) and psycho-social adjustment using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry, 1997; 38: 581-586) and examined child and parent understanding, attitudes and the perceived impact of reading difficulties on daily life. Sixty-eight children assessed as dyslexic on the basis of discrepancy scores (mean age 11.2 years; 44 male), and their parents, participated. No global self-esteem deficit was found, but the mean score for both child and parent-rated scholastic competence was significantly lower than that of the general population. Rates of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties were significantly higher than in the general population and were correlated with self-esteem. For children who had high global self-worth, both children and their parents had more positive attitudes towards their reading difficulties and were less likely to perceive a negative impact on relationships. The association between academic self-esteem and emotional symptoms is consistent with the proposed link between dyslexia and internalizing difficulties. Good self-esteem and a good understanding of dyslexia may help children avoid some of these difficulties. Further research withlarger more representative samples is necessary as understanding the factors that promote successful psycho-social adjustment is essential to the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies.

AB This investigation examined the links between preschoolers' internalizing problems and anxiety-related social difficulties and two aspects of maternal and paternal psychological control: overprotection and critical control. Some 115 mothers and 92 fathers completed the New Friends Vignettes (NFV), a new measure of psychological control and supportive parenting designed to assess parenting relevant to young children's internalizing problems and anxiety. Children's anxious behaviors with peers at daycare or preschool were observed, mothers reported on preschoolers' internalizing problems, and teachers reported on children's internalizing problems and isolated behaviors. The NFV scales demonstrated good internal consistency and one-year test-retest reliability for mothers and fathers, and moderate convergent validity with observed parenting for mothers. Maternal overprotection and paternal critical control predicted more internalizing problems and anxious adjustment in preschoolers, with some associations being stronger for sons than daughters. Conversely, paternal supportiveness predicted fewer internalizing difficulties at preschool in daughters only. Children's anxious behaviors predicted increasing paternal overprotection, and their internalizing problems at home and preschool tended to predict increasing maternal overprotection and critical control. Results support the reliability and validity of the New Friends Vignettes, and are indicative of parent differences in socialization processes, gender differences in risk for internalizing problems, and possible bidirectional pathways of influence in the socialization of internalizing trajectories.

AB We examined associations between basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in conjunction with RSA regulation with the hypothesis that their interaction would explain unique variability in children's prospective adjustment 2 years later. Participants were 176 children (98 girls; 78 boys) in middle childhood. RSA regulation was assessed through social and problem-solving challenges. Parents reported on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interactions between RSA baseline and regulation to the social stressor predicted children's later internalizing symptoms. Interactions between RSA baseline and responding to the problem-solving stressor predicted children's externalizing symptoms. The highest levels of internalizing symptoms were predicted for children with both lower basal RSA and higher RSA suppression. The highest levels of externalizing symptoms were predicted for children who demonstrated lower basal RSA in conjunction with RSA augmentation. Findings highlight the importance of the contemporaneous consideration of basal RSA and RSA regulation in the prediction of developmental psychopathology symptomology.

AB Behavioral inhibition (BI) is characterized by a pattern of extreme social reticence, risk for internalizing behavior problems, and possible protection against externalizing behavior problems. Parenting style may also contribute to these associations between BI and behavior problems (BP). A sample of 113 children was assessed for BI in the laboratory at 14 and 24 months of age, self-report of maternal parenting style at 7 years of age, and maternal report of child internalizing and externalizing BP at 4, 7, and 15 years. Internalizing problems at age 4 were greatest among behaviorally inhibited children who also were exposed to permissive parenting. Furthermore, greater authoritative parenting was associated with less of an increase in internalizing behavior problems over time and greater authoritarian parenting was associated with a steeper decline in externalizing problems. Results highlight the importance of considering child and environmental factors in longitudinal patterns of BP across childhood and adolescence.

AB The present study examined a) the associations between adolescent-reported maternal psychological control and self-reported internalizing problems one year later, while simultaneously examining the opposite direction of effects and b) the equivalence of these associations across gender. Participants were 479 10-to-14-year old adolescents (55% female) participating in two waves of a study. Results from multi-group, cross-lagged panel analyses indicated that although early adolescents' depressive symptoms and social anxiety predicted change in perceived maternal psychological control one year later, perceived maternal psychological control did not predict change in early adolescents' internalizing problems. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms were associated with increased levels of perceived maternal psychological control one year later, whereas elevated levels of social anxiety were associated with decreased levels. Aforementioned findings were consistent across boys' and girls' data. Study findings extend limited research on adolescent effects, demonstrating that early adolescents' internalizing problems play a role in perceived maternal psychological control.

AB Research on hierarchical modeling of psychopathology has frequently identified 2 higher order latent factors, internalizing and externalizing. When based on the comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses, the externalizing domain has usually been modeled as a single latent factor. Multivariate studies of externalizing symptom features, however, suggest multidimensionality. To address this apparent contradiction, confirmatory factor analytic methods and information-theoretic criteria were used to evaluate 4 theoretically plausible measurement models based on lifetime comorbidity patterns of 7 putative externalizing disorders. Diagnostic information was collected at 4 assessment waves from an age-based cohort of 816 persons between the ages of 14 and 33. A 2-factor model that distinguished oppositional behavior disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) from social norm violation disorders (conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, hard drug use disorder) demonstrated consistently good fit and superior approximating abilities. Analyses of psychosocial outcomes measured at the last assessment wave supported the validity of this 2-factor model. Implications of this research for the theoretical understanding of domain-related disorders and the organization of classification systems are discussed.

   Youths with normative to clinical levels of internalizing problems (IP) and externalizing problems (EP) watched emotionally evocative film-clips while having heart rate (HR) recorded, and reported subjective feelings.
   Results:
   Hierarchical linear modeling revealed weaker coherence between HR and negative feelings in youths, especially boys, with more EP. Youths with IP showed coherence between HR and negative feelings that did not match the affect portrayed in the eliciting stimuli, but atypical positive emotions: they felt happier when they had slower HR. Youths without problems predominantly showed normative emotional coherence.
   Conclusions:
   Youths with EP and IP experience atypical patterns of activation across physiological and experiential emotion systems which could undermine emotion regulation in evocative situations.

AB Background:
   The regulation of emotion is essential for adaptive functioning. However, delineating the pathways of emotion regulation (ER) processes that lead to psychological adaptation remains under-studied, with mixed evidence for the specificity vs. generality of ER deficits in relation to specific forms of psychopathology. To examine this issue, this study investigated links among ER, social-contextual factors (family, peer), and psychological adjustment (internalizing, externalizing).
   Method:
   Participants were 140 adolescents (71% female, 83.3% Caucasian, M age = 16.03 years) who were consecutive psychiatric admissions over a one-year period. Adolescents completed measures on family environment and peer relationship experiences. Both adolescents and parents reported on adolescents' characteristic patterns of ER and psychopathology.
   Results:
   Discriminant analyses revealed that two functions, ER skills and impulsivity/lability, differentiated among adolescents who were elevated in internalizing symptoms only, in externalizing symptoms only, in both domains, or in neither domain. Regarding social contextual variables, family cohesion was associated with adaptive ER behaviors for girls along the internalizing dimension and all adolescents reporting externalizing behaviors. Relational victimization predicted difficulties with ER in both symptom domains for all adolescents. Within the internalizing domain, friendship support was related to adaptive ER.
   Conclusion:
   Facets of ER do differentiate between global indices of internalizing and externalizing behaviors and suggest that both general and specific factors contribute to adolescents' unique learning history with emotions and characteristic patterns for managing emotions.

AB The specific aim of this study was to examine pathways leading to internalizing symptoms and self-esteem in Latino adolescents. Adolescent feelings of interpersonal humiliation, family conflict and commitment, and friendships with peers were investigated as potential mediators linking acculturation stress to subsequent adolescent self-esteem and internalizing symptoms. Path analyses on data from a sample of 288 Latino adolescents (average age 15 years; 66% foreign-born) showed that acculturation conflicts and perceived discrimination were risk factors for both internalizing problems at baseline and parent-adolescent conflict 6 months later. Baseline internalizing problems, and Time 2 variables (humiliation, parent-adolescent conflict, negative peer relationships, and changes in familism) mediated the effects of acculturation stress on Time 3 (T3) internalizing symptoms and self-esteem. Latino cultural involvement was a key cultural asset, impacting T3 internalizing symptoms and self-esteem, by decreasing feelings of humilialion and by promoting familism. Familism was also a critical cultural asset associated with lower parent-adolescent conflict and higher self-esteem. Study limitations and implications for practice with Latino families were discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Previous research suggests that the quality of parents' relationships can influence their children's adjustment, but most studies have focused on the negative effects of marital conflict for children in White middle-class families. The current study focuses on the potential benefits of positive marital quality for children in working-class first generation Mexican American families using observational and self-report data. This study examined the links between positive marital quality and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors 1 year later when the child was in sixth grade (N = 134 families). Positive marital quality was negatively correlated with child internalizing behaviors. Parent acculturative stress was found to mediate the relationship between positive marital quality and child internalizing behaviors in sixth grade.

AB The purposes of this study were 1) to assess and describe the occurrence, frequency, severity, and distress of symptoms reported by Taiwanese pediatric cancer patients who were between 10 and 18 years of age, and 2) to use statistical analysis to determine whether the multiple dimensions (i.e., frequency, severity, or distress) of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) 10-18 alone can provide sufficient useful information for the assessment of symptoms that, patients report as distressing. A total of 144 Taiwanese pediatric cancer patients and their mothers participated in this cross-sectional, study. The frequency of symptoms for all patients ranged front 52% for "lack of energy" to 10% for "feeling nervous." The most common symptoms (occurrence > 40%) were "lack of energy," "lack of appetite, " "feeling drowsy, " "sweating; " "worrying, " ",nausea, " "dry mouth, " "pain, " and "lack of concentration. " Patients in. the "on-treatment group" had, more distressing symptoms than those in the "off-treatment, group. " The severity and distress subscales did provide the most information for symptom assessment and were the two best subscales to represent, the impact, of symptoms on quality of life, fatigue, and internalizing behaviors. The findings of this study suggest that revising the current format of the MSAS 10-18 into three, separate instruments (one for each of the subscales) might provide snore accurate, data for assessments. Such a modification would change the scoring system and provide for more accurate data analysis. J Pain Symptom Manage 2009;38:738-746. (C) 2009 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

AB Objective To examine the extent to which stress, coping, and temperament accounted for variability in adjustment among children with cancer. Methods Seventy-five mothers of children with cancer (ages 5-17) completed questionnaires regarding their child's cancer-related stress; coping; temperament characteristics including positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and effortful control (EC); and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Assessments occurred within one year of initial diagnosis or relapse (M = 5.74 months; SD = 4.72). Results Cancer-related stress was positively associated with symptoms of depression in children. NA was positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Primary control coping moderated the association between NA and depression, and primary and secondary control coping mediated this association. Conclusion Results partially support the utility of an integrated model including cancer-related stress, coping, and NA in identifying children at risk for internalizing symptoms during treatment. Additional research is needed to inform interventions for this population.

AB Considerable research has focused on the reliability and validity of informant reports of family behavior, especially maternal reports of adolescent problem behavior. None of these studies, however, has based their orientation on a theoretical model of interpersonal perception. In this study we used the social relations model (SRM) to examine family members' reports of each others' externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. Two parents and two adolescents in 69 families rated each others' behavior within a round-robin design. SRM analysis showed that within-family perceptions of externalizing and internalizing behaviors are consistently due to three sources of variance; perceiver, target, and family effects. A family/contextual effect on informant reports of problem behavior has not been previously reported.

AB Initiation of drug use and other risky behavior in preadolescence is associated with poor developmental outcomes. In this research, we examine models that ascribe the trajectory to (a) weak executive cognitive function (ECF), (b) early manifestation of externalizing problems, or (c) heightened levels of trait impulsivity. We test the explanatory power of these factors in a structural equation model with a community sample of 387 preadolescents ages 10-12 years. Participants were tested with a computerized battery of tasks to assess three facets of ECF (working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing) as well as with an audio assisted computerized self-interview to obtain reports of impulsivity and risk behaviors (use of cigarettes and alcohol as well as engaging in fighting and gambling for money) and a self-administered questionnaire to assess externalizing and internalizing problems. The best fitting model explained both early risk taking and externalizing symptoms as the result of individual differences in impulsivity. Although no ECF was directly related to risk taking, working memory and one measure of reward processing performance (reversal learning) were inversely related to impulsivity. The results are discussed in regard to theories of early risk taking with particular focus on the potential relation between ECF and impulsive behavior tendencies and the implications for early intervention to prevent the dysfunctional trajectory associated with early risk behavior.

AB The relationship between prenatal cocaine use and preschooler's physical and cognitive development and behavioral characteristics was examined, controlling for other influences on child development. On average, children were 38.5 months old, women were 29.4 years old, had 12.3 years of education, and 47% were African American. During the first trimester, 18% of the women were frequent cocaine users (>= 1 line/day). First trimester cocaine exposure predicted decreased head circumference at 3 years and lower scores on the short-term memory subscale of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (SBIS) [74]. There was no significant relationship between prenatal cocaine use and the other SBIS scales. First trimester cocaine use also predicted more total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist [3] and higher scores on the fussy/difficult scale of the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire [6]. Children who were exposed to cocaine throughout pregnancy had more behavior problems and were more fussy compared to children of women who never used cocaine prenatally. A repeated measures analysis showed that children of first trimester cocaine users became more fussy over time. These detrimental effects on growth and behavior are consistent with other reports in the literature and with the hypothesis that prenatal cocaine exposure affects development through changes in neurotransmitter systems.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test a developmental model of neurobehavioral dysregulation relating prenatal substance exposure to behavior problems at age 7.
   METHODS: The sample included 360 cocaine-exposed and 480 unexposed children from lower to lower middle class families of which 78% were black. Structural equation modeling was used to test models whereby prenatal exposure to cocaine and other substances would result in neurobehavioral dysregulation in infancy, which would predict externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in early childhood. Structural equation models were developed for individual and combined parent and teacher report for externalizing, internalizing, and total problem scores on the Child Behavior Checklist.
   RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that all of the models met criteria for adequate fit with 7 of the 9 models explaining 18% to 60% of the variance in behavior problems at age 7. The paths in the models indicate that there are direct effects of prenatal substance exposure on 7-year behavior problems as well as indirect effects, including neurobehavioral dysregulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal substance exposure affects behavior problems at age 7 through 2 mechanisms. The direct pathway is consistent with a teratogenic effect. Indirect pathways suggest cascading effects whereby prenatal substance exposure results in neurobehavioral dysregulation manifesting as deviations in later behavioral expression. Developmental models provide an understanding of pathways that describe how prenatal substance exposure affects child outcome and have significant implications for early identification and prevention.

AB Objectives
   The purpose of this study was to examine relational aggression and its relationship with adverse psychosocial and physical health symptoms among urban, African American youth.
   Design and Sample
   Quantitative, cross-sectional survey design.
   The sample consisted of 185 predominantly African American (95.1%) seventh-grade students (mean age: 13.0; female: 58%) attending 4 urban middle schools.
   Measures
   The Children's Social Behavior Scale and Social Experience Questionnaire were used to measure relational aggression and relational victimization. The Pediatric Symptom Checklist was used to assess psychosocial difficulties, including internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and attention problems. Physical health symptoms were measured with questions about colds/flu, headaches, and stomach aches.
   Results
   2-way multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in externalizing behavior, with perpetrators reporting higher levels than nonperpetrators. Victims reported more internalizing behavior than nonvictims; however, this was only significant for males. For females, significant negative effects on health outcomes were found, resulting from the interaction of perpetration and victimization.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that relational aggression is a common occurrence among urban, minority adolescents and may result in adverse health outcomes. These results provide several avenues for future research and implications for healthcare practice. Intervention strategies are needed to prevent relational aggression and continual or subsequent adverse health symptoms.

AB Objective: This systematic review examined the effectiveness of school social work practices using meta-analytic techniques. Method: Hierarchical linear modeling software was used to calculate overall effect size estimates as well as test for between-study variability. Results: A total of 21 studies were included in the final analysis. Unconditional random effects model shows an overall weighted mean effect size estimate of .23 for externalizing problem outcomes and .40 for internalizing problem outcomes; both categories were statistically significant at the p < .05 level. Subgroup analysis for academic outcomes showed mixed results for knowledge, attendance, and grade point average outcome measures. Conclusions: Results highlight the positive impact school social workers may have on student emotional, mental, behavioral, and academic outcomes.

AB The objective of this study is to explore the effects of sex-stereotype conformity and the internalization of traffic rules on risk-taking among adolescent pedestrians. Sex-stereotype conformity, danger perception, internalization of traffic rules and risky behaviors self-reported by 278 adolescent pedestrians (130 boys and 148 girls) aged 12-16 were measured. The results show an effect of sex-stereotype conformity on the internalization of traffic rules and risky behavior. Furthermore, the results show an effect of internalizing traffic rules on the risky pedestrian behaviors. Thus, it appears that, more than biological sex, it is the level of masculinity and the level of internalization of the rules that explain gender differences in risk-taking among adolescent pedestrians.

AB The presence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to decreased quality of life (QoL) among adults, yet little is known about the impact of OCD on QoL in pediatric patients. Sixty-two youth with OCD and their parent(s) were administered the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale following a clinical interview. Children completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Parent Proxy Inventory and Child Behavior Checklist. QoL scores for OCD patients were significantly lower than for healthy controls, but similar to QoL in a general psychiatric sample on the majority of domains. Parent-child agreement on QoL was moderate to strong across age groups. Results indicate that, in youth with OCD, QoL is reduced relative to healthy controls, related to OCD symptom severity per parent-report, and are strongly predicted by the presence of comorbid externalizing and internalizing symptoms.

AB Over the last ten years a considerable amount of literature has described the socio-emotional discomfort that is often associated with learning disorders at all ages, but a comprehensive review about internalizing symptoms in dyslexia is needed.
   Medical and psychological search engines (PubMed, PsychArticles and Academic Search Elite) were used to identify all those studies published in peer-reviewed journals, relative to the association of reading difficulties, dyslexia, or learning disorders/disabilities, and internalizing symptoms, anxiety, or depression.
   The present review of studies confirms dyslexia as a specific risk factor for an increased internalizing, anxious and depressive symptomatology. The severity of dyslexia, its comorbidity with attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity disorder, the level of perceived social support and female gender are some of the factors that mostly influence its psycho-social outcomes.
   Findings of this review confirm that suitable social, health and school policies aimed at identifying and treating dyslexia as a cause of discomfort are called for, and confirm the clinical need to assess and contrast additional risk factors that may increase the probability of this suffering in dyslexic students.

AB This study used data from 340 mother-child dyads to examine characteristics of children with co-occurring diagnoses of anxiety and externalizing disorders and compared them with children with a sole diagnosis or no diagnosis. Comparisons were made using 4 child-diagnostic groups: anxiety-only, externalizing-only, co-occunence, and no-problem groups. Most mothers were characterized by low income and histories of psychiatric diagnoses during the child's lifetime. Analyses using multinomial logistic regressions found the incidence of co-occurring childhood disorders to be significantly linked with maternal affective/anxiety disorders during the child's lifetime. In exploring implications for developmental competence, we found the co-occurrence group to have the lowest level of adaptive functioning among the 4 groups, faring significantly worse than the no-problem group on both academic achievement and intelligence as assessed by standardized tests. Findings underscore the importance of considering co-occurring behavior problems as a distinct phenomenon when examining children's developmental outcomes.

   Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), we ran logistic regression models to examine the relationship between hypothesized protective factors (social competence, adaptive functioning skills, and peer relationships) and outcomes (externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, reading competence).
   Results: For each hypothesized protective factor, we found variation in individual scores and sample mean scores at the lower end of the scales, Indicating that these children fare worse than most children However, many children experienced large changes in their individual scores over time Suggesting that children can and do improve on these hypothesized protective factors. In examining the relationship between hypothesized protective factors and Outcomes, children with higher levels of social competence were significantly more likely to he in I lie normal range for both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Children with higher mean adaptive functioning skills were more likely to be in the normal range for both externalizing behavior and reading competence. The positive nature of the child's peer relationships was also related to externalizing behavior and reading competence.
   Conclusions: Overall. Our analyses Support the idea that social competence, adaptive functioning skills, and peer relationships are related to Outcomes for children investigated for maltreatment While further research is needed to establish a causal link, this work identifies three individual-level hypothesized protective factors as potential sources of variation in outcomes.
   Practice implications: To prevent or alleviate the harmful consequences maltreatment, it is necessary to understand factors that help children move beyond poor Outcomes Our analyses suggest that a strong relationship exists between a child's social competence. adaptive functioning skills and positive peer relationships and select outcomes three years after being investigated for maltreatment With these individual-level protective factors related to more positive outcomes. it suggests that intervening to increase protective factors could improve outcomes for maltreated and at-risk children (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The present study examined possible explanations for symptom development and variability in sexually abused adolescents A theoretical model of sexual abuse, in which appraisal. coping and crisis support play prominent roles, was tested in a clinical group of 100 sexually abused adolescents
   Method: Participants, aged 12-18 years, completed questionnaires regarding severity of abuse, negative appraisals, crisis support, coping strategies. and trauma-related stress symptoms
   Results: Since severity of abuse had no influence oil the association between appraisals and symptoms it was eliminated from our model Structural equation modeling analyses showed a significant interrelationship between the examined concepts Adolescents who appraised the abuse as more threatening showed more internalizing and externalizing trauma symptoms. Moreover, more negative appraisals were associated with more avoidance as well as with more active coping strategies Direct crisis Support was associated with less negative appraisals and with the use of more active coping strategies
   Conclusions: The study showed that especially the buffering role of crisis Support and the role of negative appraisals explained symptom development and variety in sexually abused adolescents
   Practice implications: Adaptation to sexual abuse Includes the ways in which adolescents perceive the event as threatening and harmful. how they cope with the abusive experience. and how they receive direct support from their family Clinicians. therefore, need to expand the focus of their assessments beyond age- and trauma-specific symptoms, to age-and trauma-specific appraisals, coping, and social Support The assessment of these factors should take place as soon as possible after the disclosure of the abuse Individualized treatment plans and clinical interventions need to be based on these personal and environmental variables, rather than reliance oil the influence of abuse-related characteristics, such as the severity or type of abuse (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present study is a preliminary examination of the internal, criterion, and convergent validity of the Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS; Schniering and Rapee 2002), a developmentally sensitive measure of cognitions associated with childhood internalizing and externalizing disorders, among clinically anxious and non-clinical children. Participants included 40 children (ages 7-14) with a clinical anxiety disorder and 40 non-clinical children with no prior anxiety disorder diagnosis. Results supported the internal consistency and criterion validity of the measure. In addition, controlling for age, sex, and clinical status, convergent validity was largely supported, with the Physical Threat subscale correlating with self-report of generalized anxiety and separation anxiety, and the Social Threat and Personal Failure subscales correlating with self-report of social anxiety and major depression. Limitations and suggestions for further research on the utility of the CATS are discussed.

AB Background The nature of the association between birth weight and behavioural problems in adolescence is unclear. Recent studies are limited by their capacity to adjust for important obstetric and measurement issues.
   Aim To examine the nature of the association between birth weight and a range of behavioural symptoms, including anxiety/depression and social problems, in adolescence.
   Methods Data from 4971 mothers and their children participating in the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a prospective, population-based birth cohort, are presented. This study commenced in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. Mothers and their children were followed up at 3-5 days post-birth, and 6 months, 5 years and 14 years after the initial interview. Internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems, social problems and anxiety/depressive symptoms were assessed using Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR) of the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL).
   Results There was no evidence of a linear association between birth weight and behavioural symptoms, when birth weight z-scores were examined as a continuous variable. However, a non-linear association was identified when birth weight z-scores were categorized into quintiles. Children in the lowest and highest quintiles were at higher risk of increased anxiety/depressive and social problems symptoms. After adjustment for potential confounders, birth weight showed a non-linear association with the log odds of social problems {Quintile 1 odds ratio (OR) 1.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 2.23] Quintile 5 OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.12, 2.20)}.
   Conclusions Our findings provide further support for an association between birth weight and some adolescent behaviour problems. This association is likely to be non-linear, affecting babies at both the lower and higher ends of the birth weight distribution.

AB This study examined whether depressed adolescent outpatients with deliberate self-harm behaviour (DSH) differed from non-suicidal depressed adolescent outpatients in depressive and anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, perceived social support and number of negative life-events. Depressed adolescent outpatients (n = 155) aged 13-19 years were interviewed using K-SADS-PL for DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses and completed self-report questionnaires. Suicidal behaviour was assessed by K-SADS-PL suicidality items. Depressed adolescents with DSH were younger, perceived less support from the family, had more severe depressive symptoms and used more alcohol than non-suicidal depressed adolescents. Adolescents with DSH and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts had more depressive and anxiety symptoms than adolescents with DSH only. Adolescents with severe internalizing distress symptoms are at risk not only for DSH, but also additional suicidal behaviour. Family interventions may be needed in the treatment of depressed adolescents with DSH. (C) 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The primary goal of this study was to investigate the specificity of the social versus nonsocial components of self-reported behavioral inhibition during childhood with young adults' current symptoms of anhedonic depression, social anxiety, and anxious arousal. As hypothesized, the social component of BI demonstrated some specificity for symptoms of social-anxiety versus other internalizing disorders. Furthermore, results support the hypothesis that the relationship between BI and depressive symptoms is mediated by levels of social anxiety and anxious arousal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social anxiety is the fear of social situations and being negatively evaluated by others. Most previous studies of childhood social anxiety have employed clinical samples of children aged 10 years and older. The current study explored the correlates of social anxiety in an unselected sample of young children. Participants were n = 178 elementary school children in grade 2 (aged 7-8 years). Children were individually administered the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (SASC-R), as well as measures of socio-emotional adjustment. Teachers completed measures of children's socio-emotional problems and school adjustment. Results indicated that social anxiety was positively associated with self-reported loneliness, school avoidance, and internalizing coping, and negatively related to school liking. However, social anxiety was mostly unrelated to teacher-rated outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of use of the SASC-R for this type of population and reasons for the disparity between child and teacher reports of adjustment outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated the role of parents' and children's religiosity in behavioral adjustment among maltreated and nonmaltreated children. Data were collected on 170 maltreated and 159 nonmaltreated children from low-income families (mean age = 10 years). We performed dyadic data analyses to examine unique contributions of parents' and children's religiosity and their interaction to predicting child internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. A four group structural equation modeling was used to test whether the structural relations among religiosity predictors and child outcomes differed by child maltreatment status and child gender. We found evidence of parent-child religiosity interaction suggesting that (1) parents' frequent church attendance was related to lower levels of internalizing symptomatology among nonmaltreated children with low church attendance and (2) parents' importance of faith was associated with lower levels of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology among nonmaltreated children with low faith. The results suggest that independent effects of parents' religiosity varied depending on children's religiosity and parent-child relationship.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) is a widely used parent-report measure of youth internalizing and externalizing problems. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that the CBCL may not adequately assess clinical problems in diverse populations. We investigated the measurement equivalence (ME) of the CBCL in an African American adolescent sample (N = 145). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated poor factor model fit; however, modification indices and an alternative two-factor model produced improved fit statistics. Internal consistency coefficients of CBCL scales ranged from alpha =.65 to .88 and were generally lower than those reported for the normative sample. The CBCL exhibited convergent validity with conceptually similar scales on the Parent Report Scale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children; however, the correlations were weaker than those reported for the normative sample. The CBCL Internalizing composite failed to predict clinician-rated Emotional problems, however, the Externalizing composite predicted clinician-rated behavior problems. In summary, the CBCL did not exhibit unequivocal evidence of ME, as it both possesses and lacks a number of statistical attributes that would demonstrate its equivalence with African Americans. Future empirical and theoretical work is discussed.

AB Background:
   Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the top ten leading causes of disabilities. We know little, however, about the onset, developmental course and early risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS).
   Objective:
   Model the developmental trajectories of DAS during early childhood and to identify risk factors for atypically high DAS.
   Method:
   Group-based developmental trajectories of DAS conditional on risk factors were estimated from annual maternal ratings (11/2 to 5 years) in a large population sample (n = 1759).
   Results:
   DAS increased substantially in two of the three distinct trajectory groups identified: High-Rising (14.7%); Moderate-Rising (55.4%); and Low (29.9%). Two factors distinguished the High-Rising group from the other two: Difficult temperament at 5 months (High-Rising vs Moderate-Rising: OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.13-1.55; High-Rising vs Low: OR = 1.31, CI = 1.12-1.54) and maternal lifetime major depression (High-Rising vs Moderate-Rising: OR = 1.10; CI = 1.01-1.20; High-Rising vs Low: OR = 1.19; CI = 1.08-1.31). Two factors distinguished the High-Rising group from the Low group: High family dysfunction (OR = 1.24; CI = 1.03-1.5) and Low parental self-efficacy (OR = .71; CI = .54-.94).
   Conclusions:
   DAS tend to increase in frequency over the first 5 years of life. Atypically high level can be predicted from mother and child characteristics present before 6 months of age. Preventive interventions should be experimented with at risk infants and parents.

   LIABILITY; ADULTHOOD
AB Background:
   Behavior genetic methods can help to elucidate gene-environment (G-E) interplay in the development of internalizing (INT) disorders (i.e., major depression and anxiety disorders). To date, however, no study has conducted a comprehensive analysis examining multiple environmental risk factors with the purpose of delineating general mechanisms of G-E influence in the development of INT disorders.
   Methods:
   The sample consisted of 1315 male and female twin pairs participating in the age 17 assessment of the Minnesota Twin Family Study. Quantitative G-E interplay models were used to examine how genetic and environmental risk for INT disorders changes as a function of environmental context. Multiple measures and informants were employed to construct composite measures of INT disorders and six environmental risk factors including: stressful life events, mother-child and father-child relationship problems, antisocial and prosocial peer affiliation, and academic achievement and engagement.
   Results:
   Significant moderation effects were detected between each environmental risk factor and INT such that in the context of greater environmental adversity, nonshared environmental factors became more important in the etiology of INT symptoms.
   Conclusion:
   Our results are consistent with the interpretation that environmental stressors have a causative effect on the emergence of INT disorders. The consistency of our results suggests a general mechanism of environmental influence on INT disorders regardless of the specific form of environmental risk.

AB Children and adolescents who are overweight are a heterogeneous group. Whether pretreatment characteristics, such as dietary restraint and psychopathology, are related to differential treatment Outcomes was not studied before. Using cluster analysis, the authors of this study examined the validity of subtyping along dietary restraint and internalizing psychopathology in 2 independent samples of treatment-seeking children and adolescents who were overweight (Study 1: n = 200; Study 2: n = 120). Three subtypes emerged: a dietary restraint/intemalizing (DR/IN) group, a pure internalizing (IN) group, and a nonsymptomatic (NS) group. The DR/IN subtype showed more problems than the NS subtype, with complete consistency across the 2 studies for 1/4 of the validating variables. Although total weight change was not different across subtypes, compared with NS, the DRAN and IN subtypes had a less positive weight prognosis during follow-up. Restraint scores only showed increases over time in the initially low-restraint IN group. These findings suggest that individual characteristics, such as degree of dietary restraint and internalizing psychopathology, can be useful in (a) classifying children and adolescents who are overweight, (b) stipulating specific treatment guidelines, and (c) making differential prognoses.

AB Peer victimization experiences represent developmentally salient stressors among adolescents and are associated with the development of internalizing symptoms. However, the mechanisms linking peer victimization to adolescent psychopathology remain inadequately understood. This study examined emotion dysregulation as a mechanism linking peer stress to changes in internalizing symptoms among adolescents in a longitudinal design. Peer victimization was assessed with the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire (M. J. Prinstein, J. Boergers, & E. M. Vemberg, 2001) in a large (N = 1,065), racially diverse (86.6% non-White) sample of adolescents 11-14 years of age. Emotion dysregulation and symptoms of depression and anxiety were also assessed. Structural equation modeling was used to create a latent construct of emotion dysregulation from measures of discrete emotion processes and of peer victimization and internalizing symptoms. Peer victimization was associated with increased emotion dysregulation over a 4-month period. Increases in emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between relational and reputational, but not overt, victimization and changes in internalizing symptoms over a 7-month period. Evidence for a reciprocal relationship between internalizing symptoms and relational victimization was found, but emotion dysregulation did not mediate this relationship. The implications for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Objective: Individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS) often display comorbid symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as externalizing and internalizing behaviors. This study was aimed to examine the impacts of tic severity, ADHD symptoms, and OCD on internalizing (e.g., anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., aggression) psychopathology. Methods: Using linear regressions, we examined how tics, ADHD, and OCD symptoms predicted the externalization and internalization behaviors measured by the Child Behavior Checklist in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with TS. in addition, Child Behavior Checklist scales were compared among children with TS without ADHD, TS and ADHD, ADHD without TS, and unaffected control group. Results: In the TS group, externalizing behaviors were predicted by tic severity, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity but not by OCD symptoms, whereas internalizing behaviors were predicted by inattention and OCD symptoms but not by tic severity or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Comparison among different clinical groups revealed main effects of TS and ADHD on both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Conclusion: These findings suggest that tics, ADHD, and OCD symptoms differentially explain the variance in externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems in individuals with TS. In addition, the data support the notion that TS is itself a risk factor for behavioral problems, mandating that children with TS even without ADHD and OCD still need to be assessed and treated for psychopathology.

AB We extended past research that focused on the relation between family conflict and preadolescents' depressive and anxiety symptoms. In a sample of 160 11- to 12-year-olds, we examined whether private religious practices moderated the relations between family conflict and preadolescents' depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although preadolescents' depressive and anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with their private religious practices, preadolescents' private religious practices moderated the relations between: (a) both mother- and preadolescent-reported family conflict and preadolescents' anxiety symptoms; and (b) both mother- and preadolescent-reported family conflict and preadolescents' depression symptoms. The relation between family conflict and depression and anxiety symptoms was significantly stronger for preadolescents low, versus high, in their private religious practices. Preadolescents' sex was not differentially related to these findings. Results highlight the role that private religious practices may play in moderating the relation between family conflict and preadolescents' internalizing symptoms. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Possible differences between childhood-limited antisocial youth and their stable high-antisocial counterparts were examined. Children were 11 years old at wave 1 (T1) and 13.5 at wave 2 (T2). At both waves, the same parent, teacher, and self-reports of antisocial behavior were used. Stable highs and childhood-limited antisocial youth differed somewhat in family and individual background. Stable highs had less effortful control, perceived more overprotection, had a higher level of familial vulnerability to externalizing disorder, and lived less often with the same parents throughout their lives than the childhood-limited group. Both groups had similar levels of service use before T1, but after that period, the childhood-limited youth received more help from special education needs services than from problem behavior services, and vice versa for stable highs. The results suggest that the childhood-limited antisocial youth recovered not only from antisocial behavior but also from academic failure, peer rejection, and internalizing problems.

AB This study examined the relationship between mother and infant adrenocortical levels and reactivity to an emotion eliciting task. The impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on these relationships was assessed as a moderator. The sample (n = 702 mother-infant dyads) was racially diverse and from predominantly low-income, rural communities. During a home visit, the dyad's saliva was sampled before, 20 min, and 40 min after standardized tasks designed to elicit the infant's emotional arousal and later assayed for cortisol. Mothers completed self-report measures of their partner's violence, and parenting behaviors were assessed via structured interview and mother-child interactions. In response to the task, infants had positive, and mothers had negative, cortisol slopes. Contrary to expectations, there were no IPV-related differences in mean pretask cortisol levels or reactivity in the mothers or infants. Mother-infant dyads from households characterized by either (1) violence or (2) restrictive and punitive parenting behaviors exhibited correlated cortisol reactivity measured in response to the infant challenge task. The findings suggest that social contextual features of the early caregiving environment may influence individual differences in the coordination between maternal and infant adrenocortical reactivity.

Higher levels of current depressive symptoms in parents were associated with higher levels of interparental conflict and higher levels of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents, and interparental conflict was positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children/adolescents. Consistent across a series of multiple regression models, children and adolescents' perceptions of self-blame and use of secondary control coping (acceptance, distraction, cognitive restructuring, positive thinking) were significant, independent predictors of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB Maternal reports of 60 preschool-aged children were used to investigate trauma responses to living in households where domestic violence was present. Post-trauma symptoms were measured using developmentally modified criteria based on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Mothers' level of anxiety, depression, somatization, and self-reported parenting stress were also assessed. Results suggested that, in addition to clinical levels of Internalizing, Externalizing and Total Problem scores on the CBCL, young children displayed a range of post-trauma symptoms. Mothers reported a high level of violence, and a significant relationship was found between self-reported levels of distress and parenting stress. Parenting stress was found to be the strongest predictor of children's scores on the CBCL. Although domestic violence alone was not significantly correlated to child outcomes, results indicated that maternal distress adversely impacted on the parent-child relationship. The importance of the child's relationship with the primary caregiver was discussed. Implications regarding further research, developmentally appropriate diagnostic criteria, and early interventions with the primary caregiver are highlighted.

AB This study examined the mediating roles of several family variables in the relation between IPV witnessing and children's emotional and behavioral problems among 129 low-income, African American children ages 8 to 12. According to the mediational model tested, experiencing or witnessing IPV negatively impacted the following family variables: maternal psychopathology, family cohesion, and relatedness quality, which were subsequently associated with diminished child adjustment. These findings were stronger when child reports were considered and when the outcome variable was internalizing problems. Findings from this study support the value of targeting these variables in the development of culturally appropriate child witness interventions for low-income African American families. Recommendations for future interventions based on study conclusions are offered.

AB Objective: Life stressors and family socioeconomic position have often been associated with mental health status. The aim of the present study is to contribute to the understanding of the pathways from low socioeconomic position and life stressors to mental problems. Method: In a cross-sectional analysis using data from a longitudinal study of early adolescents (N=2,149, 51% girls; mean age 13.6 years, SD 0.53, range 12-15), we assessed the extent of mediation of the association between family socioeconomic position and mental health problems by different types of life stressors in multiple regression models. Stressors were rated as environment related or person related. Information on socioeconomic position was obtained directly from parents, and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were assessed by reports from multiple informants (parents, self, and teachers). Results: Low socioeconomic position was associated with more mental health problems and more life stressors. Both environment-related and person-related stressors predicted mental health problems independently of socioeconomic position. The associations between socioeconomic position and all mental health outcomes were partly mediated by environment-related life stressors. Mediation by environment-related and person-related stressors as assessed by linear regression amounted to 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35%-78%) and 7% (95% Cl -25% to 38%) for internalizing problems and 13% (95% Cl 79%-9%) and 5% (95% Cl -2% to 13%) for externalizing problems, respectively. Conclusions: Environment-related, but not person-related, stressors partly mediated the association between socioeconomic position and adolescent mental problems. The extent of mediation was larger for internalizing than for externalizing problems. Because the effect sizes of the associations were relatively small, targeted interventions to prevent impaired mental health may have only modest benefits to adolescents from low socioeconomic background.

AB Purpose: Urge incontinence and voiding postponement are common subtypes of daytime wetting in children. We analyzed clinical and behavioral differences in children with urge incontinence, voiding postponement and healthy controls at 2 centers.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 49 consecutive children 5 to 13 years old with urge incontinence (22) or voiding postponement (27) who presented to the department of urology or child psychiatry were examined as well as 32 age and gender matched controls. Instruments included physical examination, sonography, uroflowmetry, urinalysis, a 48-hour bladder diary, the Child Behavior Checklist, a structured psychiatric interview and an intelligence test.
   Results: The incontinent group consisted of 28 boys and 21 girls with a mean age of 7.35 years. Controls included 13 girls and 19 boys with a mean age of 7.31 years. Incontinent children had a higher rate of pathological uroflow curves (33% vs 25%) and urinary tract infection (6% vs 3%), greater post-void residual volume (6.3 ml vs 3.8 ml) and a thicker bladder wall. Mean IQ was the same in the 2 groups (103). The Child Behavior Checklist showed that significantly more incontinent children had clinical total behavior (41% vs 9%, p <0.01), and externalizing (35% vs 0%, p <0.001) and internalizing (29% vs 6%, p <0.05) scores than controls. Also, more children with voiding postponement had total clinical scores than those with urinary incontinence (56% vs 24%, p <0.05). Of incontinent children 49% fulfilled the criteria for at least 1 ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis vs 9% of controls (p <0.001). There were no differences between children recruited at the departments of urology and child psychiatry.
   Conclusions: This study shows that urge incontinence and voiding postponement are significantly associated with somatic complaints and psychological abnormalities compared to a control population. Children with voiding postponement have more externalizing behavioral disorders. Children seen at urological departments carry the same psychiatric risks and require the same attention to behavioral problem diagnosis.

AB The goal of this study was to examine initial levels and rates of change in the intensity and breadth of participation in organized activities during the adolescent years, and how these participation practices were related to youth outcomes in later adolescence. The main objectives were (a) to examine growth curves of intensity and breadth of participation from Grades 7 through 11 and their interrelations, and (b) to test the associations between these dimensions of participation and academic orientation, risky behaviors, internalizing problems, and civic development in Grade 11. A homogenous sample of 299 youth (mean age = 13.37, SD = .41; 62% girls) were surveyed annually using questionnaires and phone interviews. The main results revealed that (a) even though both intensity and breadth of participation decreased over time, intensity of participation showed steeper declines by later grades, and (b) initial levels of participation were better predictors of later outcomes than rates of change over time. Regardless of the levels of change taking place over time, results revealed that youth with high initial levels of participation (both intensity and breadth) were more committed to school and developed more positive values towards society by Grade 11 than those who participated less. This might suggest that a high level of participation during early-to-mid-adolescence is particularly important when it comes to later outcomes.

AB Reminiscing has been shown to be a critical conversational context for the development of autobiographical memory, self-concept, and emotional regulation (for a review, see Fivush, Haden, & Reese, 2006). Although much past research has examined reminiscing between mothers and their preschool children, very little attention has been given to family narrative interaction with older children. In the present study, we examined family reminiscing in spontaneous narratives that emerged during family dinnertime conversations. The results revealed that mothers contributed more to the narratives than did fathers in that they provided, confirmed, and negated more information, although fathers requested more information than mothers. In exploratory analyses, mothers' contributions to shared family narratives were found to be related to fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors in their children, while fathers' contributions to individual narratives of day-today experiences were related to fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors in their children. These results indicate that mothers and fathers may play different roles in narrative construction with their children, and there is some suggestion that these differences may also be related to children's behavioral adjustment.

ID SELF-REPORT; PERSONALITY; VALIDATION; VALIDITY
AB This study examines how trait emotional intelligence, as measured using the 33-item Emotional Intelligence Scale, is related to internalizing and externalizing problem behavior in 325 adolescents in Hong Kong. An item factor analysis yields four dimensions of emotional intelligence. This set of Chinese data, together with a dataset from the UK (Petrides & Furnham, 2000), suggests the inadequacy of the original one-factor model in describing this type of intelligence. The female adolescents scored significantly higher in self-management of emotions and social skills, whereas no significant differences between genders were identified in awareness of others' emotions and positive use of emotions. There was an inverse relationship between emotional intelligence and problem behavior. The self-management of emotions was negatively associated with all types of problem behavior, whereas social skills were related to aggression and delinquency. Regression analysis suggests that poor use of emotions may lead to higher levels of problem behavior, such as depression, aggression and delinquency, whereas a higher degree of self-management may lead to less anxiety. The implications of the findings for enhancing emotional intelligence and the limitations of this study are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   To determine continuities of mental health problems of children across a 24-year follow-up period.
   Method:
   In 1983, parent ratings of emotional and behavioral problems were collected with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in a general population sample of 2076 children. Twenty-four years later, 1365 participants completed Adult Self-Reports (ASR) to assess emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results:
   Of the participants who were classified as deviant in childhood, 22.2% were also classified as deviant in adulthood. Both homotypic and heterotypic continuity was found. Childhood aggressive, delinquent, and anxious/depressed problems were associated with most adult psychopathology. Attention problems did not predict later problems independently.
   Conclusion:
   Even though assessed with parent-reports in childhood and analogous self-reports in adulthood, and over a large period of 24 years, continuity of psychopathology was found from childhood into adulthood. Anxious/depressed problems, delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior in childhood are core predictors for adult psychopathology.

AB The failure to identify specific non-shared environmental influences on behavior coupled with the belief that shared environmental factors contribute minimally to individual differences in behavior has led to the concern that major environmental determinants of behavior may be idiosyncratic, and therefore undetectable. We used data on adoptive (N = 246) and biologically related (N = 130) same-sex sibling pairs (mean ages = 16.1 years older sibling; 13.8 years younger sibling) from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS) to determine whether non-idiosyncratic environmental factors shared by siblings contributed to individual differences in a diverse set of behavioral outcomes. Evidence for shared environmental influence was sought for eight composite measures covering a wide array of adolescent functioning: Academic Achievement, Total IQ, Substance Use Disorders, Externalizing Disorders, Internalizing Disorders, Peer Groups, Disinhibited Personality, and Negative Emotionality. For six of eight composites, significant shared environmental effects, accounting for 14-22% of the variance, were observed for these same-sex sibling pairs. These findings support the use of adoptive sibling designs to directly estimate shared environmental effects and implicate the existence of systematic environmental influences on behavior that are potentially detectable.

AB Maternal depression has been linked to deficits in parenting that contribute to youth's development of externalizing and/or internalizing problems. Maternal sensitivity has been implicated within the infant literature as a foundational aspect of parenting contributing to a child's adjustment. This study examines the main and moderating effects of a construct labeled maternal sensitivity, within the context of depressive symptoms, on youth externalizing and internalizing problems in a sample of 65 mothers with a history of depression and their 84 children ages 9-15 years. Sensitivity was related to child externalizing problems. Although two-way interactions were not significant, exploratory moderation analyses indicated a significant three-way interaction among maternal depressive symptoms, maternal sensitivity, and youth gender for internalizing problems: among girls only, high depressive symptoms, low sensitivity, and the combination of these two variables were each associated with high levels of internalizing problems.

AB Based on formulations about the possible consequences for adaptation of gender non-normative behaviour, we investigated predictive and concurrent relations of hyperactivity and shyness to various aspects of adaptation focusing on possible effects of sex. At ages 5-6, parents and preschool teachers rated hyperactivity and shyness for 151 children (50% boys). At age 9, we obtained teacher ratings of hyperactivity, internalizing and externalizing problems, self-ratings of trait anxiety, and peer nominations of shyness, social preference, and aggression. Several effects of sex were found. Hyperactivity ratings were more strongly related across time and raters for boys than for girls. In the predictive analyses, boys' hyperactivity was more strongly related to aggression than was girls' hyperactivity, and in concurrent analyses, girls' hyperactivity was more strongly associated with low social preference than was boys' hyperactivity. There was a protective effect of shyness with regard to aggression that applied only to boys, that is, at high hyperactivity levels, boys with high shyness levels were less aggressive than boys with low shyness levels. There were also main effects of hyperactivity and shyness. In predictive and concurrent analyses, hyperactivity was associated with low social preference, high levels of externalizing problems and with aggression, whereas shyness was associated with high levels of internalizing problems. Finally, there was an interactive effect of hyperactivity and shyness. In the concurrent analyses, an exacerbating effect was demonstrated insofar as high shyness was associated with low social preference at high, but not at low levels of hyperactivity. The different developmental risks of hyperactivity and shyness were discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate prevalence and risk factors for emotional and behavioral problems in dependent children of cancer patients using a multinational research design. METHODS: The sample comprised 350 ill parents, 250 healthy partners, and 352 children. Parents assessed the child's psychological functioning using the Child Behavior Checklist, parental depression using the Beck Depression Inventory, family functioning using the General Functioning subscale of the Family Assessment Device, quality of life using short-form questionnaire, and adolescents (N = 168) self-reported psychological functioning using the Youth Self Report. RESULTS: Children and adolescents, in particular latency-aged boys and adolescent girls, were of higher risk of psychosocial problems than norms. There was a higher risk of problems when the father was ill than when the mother was ill, but it remains unclear whether this difference was due to the different diagnoses of fathers and mothers, gender or other factors. The best predictor of internalizing problems in children and adolescents was parental depression, and the best predictor of externalizing problems in children and adolescents was family dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the need for a family-oriented approach to psychological support of cancer patients. Cancer 2009;115:4030-9. (C) 2009 American Cancer Society.

AB Introduction
   Internalizing disorders of childhood are a common and disabling problem, with sufferers at increased risk of subsequent psychiatric morbidity. Several studies have found associations between parenting styles and children's internalizing, although few have considered the role of parental discipline. Parental discipline style may exert an effect on children's internalizing symptoms. Anxiety and depression are reliably found to run in families and parental anxiety has been shown to effect parenting behaviour. This study set out to examine the links between parental anxiety, parental discipline style and child internalizing symptoms.
   Method
   Eighty-eight parents of children aged 4-10 years were recruited through primary schools. All parents completed questionnaires including measures relating to: adult anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire), parental depression (Beck Depression Inventory - Fastscreen), parental discipline (The Parenting Scale), parenting-related attributions (Parenting Attitudes, Beliefs and Cognitions Scale) and child psychological morbidity (Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 version).
   Results
   Significant correlations were found between both parental anxiety and child internalizing symptoms with ineffective discipline and negative beliefs about parenting. Particularly strong correlations were found between parental anxiety and child internalizing symptoms with harsh discipline. Parents of anxious/withdrawn children were more likely to hold negative beliefs about their child. The link between parental anxiety and child internalizing symptoms was mediated by harsh discipline. The link between parental anxiety and harsh discipline was mediated by parental beliefs about the child.
   Conclusion
   Discipline style may be an important factor in the relationship between parent anxiety and child internalizing symptoms.

AB This report describes the development and psychometric properties of the Children's Florida Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (C-FOCI). Designed specifically as a brief measure for assessing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, the C-FOCI was created for use in both clinical and community settings. Study 1 included 82 children and adolescents diagnosed with primary Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and their parents. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) was administered to assess symptom severity. Thereafter, parents completed the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Parent Version and Child Behavior Checklist, and youth completed the C-FOCI, Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Child Version, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form. A subgroup of 21 individuals was retested with the C-FOCI after completing 14 sessions of intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy. Construct validity of the C-FOCI was supported vis-A -vis evidence of treatment sensitivity, and moderate relations with clinician-rated symptom severity, the CY-BOCS Symptom Checklist, child- and parent-rated functional impairment, child-rated anxiety, and parent-rated internalizing symptoms. Discriminant validity was evidenced by weak relationships with parent-reports of externalizing symptoms. For Study 2, 191 non-clinical adolescents completed the C-FOCI to assess the feasibility of internet administration. Overall, internal consistency was acceptable for the C-FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale, and respondents were able to complete the measure with little difficulty. Taken together, the findings of Studies 1 and 2 provide initial support for the reliability and validity of the C-FOCI for the assessment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the moderating influence of race/ethnicity on the relationship between child maltreatment and internalizing symptoms (e.g., affective and somatic problems) and externalizing behavior (e.g., rule breaking behavior and aggression) among African-American and Caucasian children aged 7 to 12 years old. Using a longitudinal comparison group design and a sample of 190 youth of which 36% had substantiated cases of child maltreatment, results of a structural equation modeling revealed that race/ethnicity did not have a conditioning influence on the link between internalizing and externalizing behavior among maltreated youth. However, African-American youth's internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior was consistently significantly higher than their Caucasian counterparts. These findings provide evidence for racial/ethnic differences in the pathways between being child maltreatment and maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Thus, adapting evidence-based strategies that target cultural specific internalizing behaviors and externalizing behaviors among maltreated youth may significantly reduce the risk of short and long-term maladaptive behavior.

These possibilities include the identification and addition of emotion-regulation skills to existing treatment packages and broadening the scope of those emotions addressed in cognitive-behavioral treatments. Current emotion-focused interventions designed to meet one or both of these goals are discussed, and the developmental influences relevant to the selection of emotion-focused treatment goals are explored using the framework of a modal model of emotion regulation. These various lines of evidence are woven together to support the utility of a novel emotion-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Youth, a transdiagnostic treatment protocol that aims to treat the range of emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety and depression) simultaneously. Avenues for future directions in treatment outcome and assessment of emotion regulation are also discussed.

AB Background: Exposure to adverse family environments in childhood can influence the risk trajectory for developing substance use disorders in adolescence. Evidence for this is largely based on cross-sectional studies which have been unable to establish the temporality of this association and investigate underlying pathways.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 1421 adolescents from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, a three wave longitudinal study conducted between 1994 and 2001 that followed children from ages 10 to 22. Logistic regression analyses with multiple imputation were conducted to examine the relation between familial conflict in childhood and substance use disorders in late adolescence and emerging adulthood. We conducted mediational analyses to determine if internalizing and externalizing problems explain this relationship, and we investigated whether external social support mitigates the adverse effects of familial conflict on the development of substance use disorders.
   Results: Familial conflict was significantly associated with the risk of substance use disorders during adolescence (odds ratio: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02-1.47), and 30% of this effect was due to higher levels of externalizing problems (but not internalizing problems). External social support in childhood did not buffer the effects of familial conflict on substance use disorders during adolescence.
   Conclusion: Exposure to familial conflict early in life increases the risk of substance use disorders during late adolescence and emerging adulthood, due partly to higher levels of externalizing problems, but not internalizing problems. Future research is needed to identify additional pathways underlying this association, and the extent to which these pathways are modifiable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Standardized diagnostic interviews (SDIs) have become de facto gold standards for clinical research. However, because clinical practitioners seldom use SDIs, it is essential to determine how well SDIs agree with clinical diagnoses. In meta-analyses of 38 articles published from 1995 to 2006 (N = 15,967 pro-bands), mean kappas (z-transformed) between diagnoses from clinical evaluations versus SDIs were 0.27 for a broad category of all disorders, 0.29 for externalizing disorders, and 0.28 for internalizing disorders. Kappas for specific disorders ranged from 0.19 for generalized anxiety disorder to 0.86 for anorexia nervosa (median = 0.48). For diagnostic clusters (e.g. psychotic disorders), kappas ranged from 0.14 for affective disorders (including bipolar) to 0.70 for eating disorders (median = 0.43). Kappas were significantly higher for Outpatients than inpatients and for children than adults. However, these effects were not significant in meta-regressions. Conclusions: Diagnostic agreement between SDIs and clinical evaluations varied widely by disorder and was low to moderate for most disorders. Thus, findings from SDIs may not fully apply to diagnoses based on clinical evaluations of the sort used in the published studies. Rather than implying that SDIs or clinical evaluations are inferior, characteristics of both may limit agreement and generalizability from SDI findings to clinical practice.
