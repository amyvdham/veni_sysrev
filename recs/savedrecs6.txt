AB The developmental trajectories of maladaptive perfectionism, along with their consequences and origins, were examined in middle childhood. A sample of Singaporean children and their parents (N=302) were recruited for a longitudinal study when the children were 7 years old. Subsequent follow-up assessments were made at ages 8, 9, and 11. A multimethod approach was adopted where parent reports, child reports, and observational data on a dyadic interaction task were obtained. Using latent class growth modeling, four distinct classes were obtained for critical self-oriented perfectionism (SOP-C), whereas two classes emerged for socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP). Children with high and/or increasing SOP-C and SPP trajectories constituted 60% and 78% of the sample, respectively. For both SOP-C and SPP, trajectories with high initial status were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parental intrusiveness and negative parenting predicted high and/or increasing SOP-C trajectories, whereas the child temperament dimension of surgency predicted high SPP trajectory. Both SOP-C and SPP trajectories tended to co-occur, suggesting a mutually reinforcing process. This study yields important findings that help advance current understanding of the emergence and developmental pathways of maladaptive perfectionism in children.

AB This longitudinal study examined relations between the physical quality of housing, neighborhood, and their interactive effect on the life course development of 341 U.S. rural children from ages 9-24 years. Standardized instruments assessed housing quality (structural, clutter/cleanliness, indoor climate, hazards. crowding/privacy) and neighborhood quality (street connectivity, density, land use mix; proximate building/sidewalk conditions; neighborhood stability; proximity to nature/amenities). Analyses focused on two critical components of child development: 1) psychological health and 2) helplessness. Growth curve analyses with multilevel modeling revealed that lower quality housing was associated with poorer psychological health (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) as well as marginally more helplessness on a behavioral task over 15 years, from ages 9-24 years. All analyses statistically controlled for income level. Neither neighborhood quality nor its interaction with housing quality was related to psychological health or motivation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human and animal studies have shown that physical challenges and stressors during adolescence can have significant influences on behavioral and neurobiological development associated with internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression. Given the prevalence of asthma during adolescence and increased rates of internalizing disorders in humans with asthma, we used a mouse model to test if and which symptoms of adolescent allergic asthma (airway inflammation or labored breathing) cause adult anxiety- and depression-related behavior and brain function. To mimic symptoms of allergic asthma in young BALB/cJ mice (postnatal days [P] 7-57; N=98), we induced lung inflammation with repeated intranasal administration of house dust mite extract (most common aeroallergen for humans) and bronchoconstriction with aerosolized methacholine (non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist). Three experimental groups, in addition to a control group, included: (1) "Airway inflammation only", allergen exposure 3 times/week, (2) "Labored breathing only", methacholine exposure once/week, and (3) "Airway inflammation + Labored breathing", allergen and methacholine exposure. Compared to controls, mice that experienced methacholine-induced labored breathing during adolescence displayed a similar to 20% decrease in time on open arms of the elevated plus maze in early adulthood (P60), a similar to 30% decrease in brainstem serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA expression and a similar to 50% increase in hippocampal serotonin receptor la (5Htrla) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhrl) expression in adulthood (P75). This is the first evidence that experimentally-induced clinical symptoms of adolescent asthma alter adult anxiety-related behavior and brain function several weeks after completion of asthma manipulations.

AB The study had two goals: (1) to explore the relations between self-assessed childhood depression and other adaptive and clinical variables (2) to identify predictor variables of childhood depression. Participants were 420 students aged 7-10 years old (53.3% boys, 46.7% girls). Results revealed: (1) positive correlations between depression and clinical maladjustment, school maladjustment, emotional symptoms, internalizing and externalizing problems, problem behaviors, emotional reactivity, and childhood stress; and (2) negative correlations between depression and personal adaptation, global self-concept, social skills, and resilience (sense of competence and affiliation). Linear regression analysis including the global dimensions revealed 4 predictors of childhood depression that explained 50.6% of the variance: high clinical maladjustment, low global self-concept, high level of stress, and poor social skills. However, upon introducing the sub-dimensions, 9 predictor variables emerged that explained 56.4% of the variance: many internalizing problems, low family self-concept, high anxiety, low responsibility, low personal self-assessment, high social stress, few aggressive behaviors toward peers, many health/psychosomatic problems, and external locus of control. The discussion addresses the importance of implementing prevention programs for childhood depression at early ages.

AB Background: Previous research has found strong associations between adolescents' hazardous alcohol use and their perception of peer behavior, as well as own spending money and a range of antisocial behaviors. However, there is insufficient evidence of gender-specific predictors among adolescents with elevated antisocial behavior and alcohol use to design effective selective interventions. The aims of this study were to test short-term predictors of Heavy Episodic Drinking (HED) and risk-use of alcohol among 12-18-year-old females and males with elevated externalizing and delinquent behavior, and alcohol use.
   Methods: Eighty-five females, 77 males, and their parents, originally recruited for a parent intervention, were assessed at baseline and 6 months later with several validated instruments measuring externalizing and internalizing behavior, alcohol use, psychosocial distress, and delinquency.
   Results: The perception of peer drinking significantly predicted both genders' HED and risk-use, and also externalizing behavior predicted female risk-use. Rule-breaking behavior and social problems predicted both HED and risk-use among males, while rule-breaking predicted female HED and social problems predicted female risk-use. The parents' ratings of externalizing behavior predicted only their sons' risk-use. Lastly, no differences in prediction strength were found to be statistically significant differences between genders.
   Conclusions: Females and males shared several predictors of hazardous alcohol use, and perception of peer drinking emerged as a strong predictor. This suggests that interventions may target both genders' hazardous use of alcohol, and should address peer-resisting skills.

AB Altered functional connectivity (FC) between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala is widely implicated as a neural mechanism explaining risk for psychopathology among those exposed to early life trauma. Nonetheless, contemporary neuroimaging research has shifted toward large-scale network models of brain function, and it is not clear how this common bi-nodal finding fits into larger-scale network models. Here, using dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) approaches combined with large-scale network analyses, the larger role of bi-nodal FC between mPFC and amygdala among a sample of adolescent girls is investigated. The sample was comprised of 30 healthy control girls and 26 girls exposed to either physical or sexual assault who underwent a resting-state scan during 3T MRI. DFC using a sliding window approach was used to create weighted, undirected, graphs from the resting-state data following parcellation with a 215 regions-of-interest (ROI) atlas. Using a priori ROI, the predicted finding of lessor FC between mPFC and amygdala as a function of early life trauma was replicated in this sample. By contrast, early life trauma was associated with greater large-scale network modularity. Using a dynamic FC approach, it is also demonstrated that within-subject variability in this bi-nodal FC closely tracks within-subject fluctuations in large-scale network patterns, including connectivity between a limbic and default mode network (in which the amygdala and mPFC nodes belong, respectively) as well as overall modular organization. These results suggest that bi-nodal FC, such as amygdala-mPFC FC, may generally reflect larger-scale network patterns. Future research is necessary to understand whether these associations between nodal FC and large-scale network organization better reflect top-down processes (larger-scale network organization drives bi-nodal FC) or bottom-up processes (bi-nodal FC drives larger-scale network organization) and the related impact of early life trauma.

AB Background: During the last decade there is a growing scientific interest in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). The aim of the current paper was to review systematically the literature with a special focus on the associations between self-injurious behaviours and externalizing psychopathology. An additional aim was to review terminology and measurements of self-injurious behaviour and the connection between self-injurious behaviours and suicide in the included publications.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on 31st December 2016 in five databases (PubMed, OVID Medline, OVID PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science) with two categories of search terms (1. nonsuicidal self-injury, non-suicidal self-injury, NSSI, self-injurious behaviour, SIB, deliberate self-harm, DSH, self-injury; 2. externalizing disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, conduct disorder, CD, oppositional defiant disorder, OD, ODD).
   Results: Finally 35 papers were included. Eleven different terms were found for describing self-injurious behaviours and 20 methods for measuring it. NSSI has the clearest definition. All the examined externalizing psychopathologies had strong associations with self-injurious behaviours according to: higher prevalence rates in externalizing groups than in control groups, higher externalizing scores on the externalizing scales of questionnaires, higher symptom severity in self-injurious groups. Eight studies investigated the relationship between suicide and self-injurious behaviours and found high overlap between the two phenomena and similar risk factors.
   Conclusions: Based on the current findings the association between externalizing psychopathology and self-injurious behaviours has been proven by the scientific literature. Similarly to other reviews on self-injurious behaviours the confusion in terminology and methodology was noticed. NSSI is suggested for use as a distinct term. Further studies should investigate the role of comorbid conditions in NSSI, especially when internalizing and externalizing pathologies are both presented.

AB Prevalence rates for school absenteeism vary between 5% and 10% depending on the definition of school absenteeism and the sample investigated. Studies of adolescents show associations between school absenteeism and psychiatric disorders. Apart from substance use, delinquency, school dropout as well as the transition phase between school and vocational training are associated with the externalizing form of school absenteeism. Anxiety and depression are related to the internalizing type of absenteeism. Parental unemployment in particular can negatively affect the children with respect to psychological and social well- being. This study examined the prevalence of school absenteeism in adolescents from parents receiving unemployment benefits. It examined the feasibility of a psychiatric liaison department counseling on school absenteeism at a vocational services center. A total of 977 adolescents aged between 15 and 16.9 years living with unemployed parents in a major German city were systematically asked by the vocational services center to send a written confirmation of their school affiliation and copies of their latest school report. A school report was sent in by 785 adolescents from which the number of missed days at school, either with or without an excuse were evaluated. The mental stress was measured in a subgroup with severe absenteeism (9 out of 60 participants with more than 60 h skipped). Out of 785 adolescents 21.1% were inexcusably absent from class for at least 2.5 days during half a school year. There was a positive correlation between excused and unexcused absenteeism, which was associated with class level and a retarded school development. Because of a low participation rate for the subgroup with severe absenteeism the psychopathological assessment could not be fully undertaken.

AB Children from substance-involved families are exposed to various stressors in their family life. Especially problematic parenting behavior as a result of the parental substance use, like e.g. neglect and other dysfunctional parenting practices, pose a great developmental risk factor for these children. As a consequence, children frequently develop externalizing and internalizing symptoms or own substance-related problems. Despite their relevance, parenting trainings for substance-abusing parents in particular are scarce in Germany. However, there are several US-American behavioral and attachment based programs for substance-abusing parents that have been proven effective.

AB Research has widely supported the numerous negative outcomes for victims of child sexual abuse (CSA), but little attention has been paid to the experiences of non-abused, non-offending siblings following the victim's disclosure. This review presents evidence indicating that this overlooked sibling population merits both clinical and research attention. Siblings may experience significant emotional and behavioral responses to the victim's disclosure due to changes within the family system. A sibling's internalizing and externalizing behaviors can increase family distress post-abuse, while a supportive sibling can contribute to the victim's recovery. The current state of clinical services for siblings is described. Services including the entire family have been found to be especially beneficial in reducing the negative impact of CSA. Although siblings may present to treatment with subclinical symptoms of distress on average, there is a heterogeneity in emotional and behavioral responses similar to that found in victims. There are currently no measures designed to specifically capture the sibling's experience and impairment following the victim's CSA. Recommendations for future research are provided.

AB In accordance with Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory previous studies have demonstrated the association of individual differences in the sensitivity of two basic brain systems that respond to punishing and rewarding stimuli with variations in personality and psychopathology. However, the underlying mechanisms between these constructs remain largely unknown. The aim of the current study was to test whether personality acted as a mediator between sensitivity to reward and punishment on the one hand and internalizing and externalizing problems on the other hand. Mediation was tested in a sample of 1559 adolescents using a set of regressions. Results indicate that sensitivity to reward and punishment contribute to personality differences, which, in turn, predict internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Chronic undernutrition and hunger remain significant problems for children, in global perspective, and may have important implications for children's ability to function effectively at school. In this paper, we capitalize on a longitudinal data set of children in 100 villages in Gansu Province to estimate differences in achievement, behavior, and long-term persistence associated with chronic undernourishment and short term hunger. We show that chronic undernourishment and short-term hunger relate to children's school functioning in distinct ways: chronically undernourished children have poorer literacy acquisition and subsequent school persistence, while children who report subjective hunger have more behavioral problems.

AB This meta-analytic review examines the association between early attachment (assessed at 1-5 years) and child temperament (assessed at birth-12 years), and compares the strength of this association with recently documented meta-analytic associations between early attachment and social competence, externalizing behavior, and internalizing symptoms. Based on 109 independent samples (N = 11,440) of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, temperament was weakly associated with attachment (in) security (d =.14, CI [0.08, 0.19]) but modestly associated with resistant attachment (d =.30, CI [0.21, 0.40]). Temperament was not significantly associated with avoidant (d =.10, CI [-0.02, 0.19]) or disorganized (d =.11, CI [-0.03, 0.25]) attachment. Across developmental domains, early attachment security was more strongly associated with social competence and externalizing behaviors than internalizing symptoms and temperament.

AB Although both mothers and fathers are essential sources of information to address early socioemotional/behavioral (SEB) problems, there continues to be a dearth of studies considering both parental views. A sample of 208 toddlers (M-age = 19.3 months) was recruited through public child health centers. Both parents of 172 toddlers (76 boys, 96 girls) completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1-5 (T.M. Achenbach & L.A. Rescorla, 2000; Finnish translation by F. Almqvist, 2001). Correspondence (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICCs) between the maternal and paternal CBCL ratings was good (.64) for the Internalizing and excellent (.76) for the Externalizing and Total Problems scores whereas ICCs varied from .45 for the Withdrawn to .76 for the Sleep Problems and Aggressive Behavior syndrome scores. Regarding discrepancies, mothers consistently reported higher CBCL scale scores than did fathers. Most significant differences between the parental ratings were found on the Aggressive Behavior syndrome, Externalizing, and Total Problems scales. Interparental rating discrepancies increased with elevations in the corresponding CBCL scale scores. Positive correlations were found between maternal, but not paternal, parenting stress and interparental rating discrepancies on the CBCL. The observed differences between maternal and paternal ratings highlight the importance of gathering reports from both parents when assessing early SEB problems. The findings are more profoundly discussed in the article.

TI Anger regulation and school-related somatic complaints in children with

AB Somatic complaints are a widespread problem among children, and are considered as an important precursor to internalizing problems. Particularly, children with special educational needs are at risk of suffering from school related somatic complaints. However, there is a lack of research on the role of anger regulation for the development of somatic complaints. Moreover, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. We assumed that the effect of anger regulation on somatic complaints is mediated by school-related affect, and that the effect of anger regulation on school-related affect is moderated by intelligence. A representative German sample of 467 elementary school children with special educational needs participated in the study. We collected longitudinal data at two measurement occasions (Grade 3 and Grade 4). Children were asked about their use of adaptive anger regulation strategies, their school-related affect, and their somatic complaints in school, and they completed an intelligence test at the first measurement point. Somatic complaints again were assessed one year later. As expected, adaptive anger regulation strategies were not related directly to somatic complaints, but were positively related to school-related affect, which, in turn, predicted decreased somatic complaints over and above initial levels. Also, as expected, children higher in intelligence benefitted more from using adaptive anger regulation strategies in terms of school-related affect. Our findings support the assumption that adaptive anger regulation strategies and intelligence may be important protective factors and potential starting points in the prevention of somatic complaints in children with special educational needs.

AB Objective: Victimization by violence elevates adolescents' risk for developing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Recent findings suggest that disruptions in developmental processes associated with post-traumatic stress (PTS) reactions may partially account for the relationship between victimization and the subsequent development of psychopathology during adolescence. The present study tested the temporal sequencing of these associations using multi-informant measurements in a large, diverse sample of adolescents at high-risk for victimization.
   Method: Data were collected from a multi-site consortium of prospective studies, the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Information about 833 youth's victimization experiences (i.e., direct, indirect, familial, and non-familial violence), PTS, and affective, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms were gathered from youth and their caregivers during biannual face-to-face interviews when youth were between the ages of 4 and 14 years, and continuously from official child protective services records.
   Results: Structural equation modeling revealed that cumulative victimization contributed to elevations in youth and caregiver reported late childhood and early adolescent psychopathology. While PTS mediated the association between victimization and youth reported ADHD, ODD, CD, major depressive, and generalized anxiety symptoms during adolescence, it only mediated the association between victimization and caregiver reported affective symptoms.
   Conclusions: PTS reactions following childhood victimization partially accounted for escalations in psychopathology during the transition to adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of integrating trauma-informed assessment and intervention approaches with at-risk adolescents. Researchers should determine whether trauma-focused interventions sufficiently ameliorate other psychopathology among victimized adolescents or if additional interventions components are necessary.

AB Emotional maltreatment is a common form of child abuse with a powerful negative impact on mental health. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of emotional maltreatment on mental health and mental well-being in a general population of Swedish 12- to 13-year old girls and boys. Data was collected via self-report questionnaires in classroom settings from 1134 students. Emotional maltreatment had significant effects on mental health and mental well-being for both girls and boys. Moreover, there were significant interaction effects between gender and levels of emotional maltreatment. Girls reported decreased mental health and mental well-being at lower degrees of emotional maltreatment compared to boys. Furthermore, girls reported larger decreases in mental health in response to exposure of emotional maltreatment. For internalizing symptoms, mental wellbeing and psychosomatic symptoms, exposure level of emotional maltreatment seemed to magnify the gender differences. For externalizing symptoms, there were no differences between girls and boys in the group reporting no emotional maltreatment and the increase in externalizing symptoms were of equal magnitude for both genders. Given the impact of emotional maltreatment on mental health in the general population, results from this study implies that a trauma-informed perspective is necessary in understanding gender differences in mental health in early adolescence. Further research is needed in order to understand the underlying processes generating the differences in girls and boys responses to emotional maltreatment. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB In the present study, our aim was to examine longitudinal posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories in a Norwegian sample of adults who had experienced sexual abuse during childhood, and to identify predictors of PTSS-trajectory belongingness. The sample consisted of 138 adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (96.4% women, mean age = 42.9 years, mean age at the first abuse = 5.9 years), recruited from support centers for sexual abuse survivors. The majority (78.3%) reported penetrative abuse, and a large proportion of the sample reported that the perpetrator was a biological parent (38.4%) or someone they trusted (76.1%), reflecting a high severity level of the abusive experiences. Latent Profile Analyses revealed the best overall fit for a two PTSS-trajectories model; one trajectory characterized by sub-clinical and decreasing level of PISS (54.9%), and the other by high and slightly decreasing level of PTSS (45.1%). Increased odds for belonging to the trajectory with clinical level symptoms was found among those who reported higher levels of exposure to other types of childhood maltreatment (OR = 3.69, p = 0.002), sexual abuse enforced by physical violence (OR = 3.04, p = 0.003) or threats (OR = 2.56, p = 0.014), very painful sexual abuse (OR = 2.73, p = 0.007), or who had experienced intense anxiety, helplessness or fear during the abuse (OR = 2.97, p = 0.044). Those in the trajectory with clinical level PTSS reported lower levels of perceived social support and more relational difficulties compared to those in the sub-clinical PTSS trajectory. In conclusion, different longitudinal PTSS trajectories can be found among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Significant predictors of PTSS-trajectory belongingness are discussed alongside their potential implications for preventive efforts and clinical interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Little is known about adolescent exposure to and factors associated with violence in Malawi. The aim of this research was to describe the prevalence of exposure to violence among adolescents in Malawi, and test the hypotheses that such exposures are associated with gender-based violent attitudes, and with internalizing and externalizing problems. In 2014, 561 primary school pupils were interviewed (50% girls), and logistic regression analysis was performed on gender-stratified data, adjusting for sociodemographic differences. Both girls and boys had witnessed domestic violence (28.5% & 29.6%), experienced emotional abuse at home (23.1% & 22.9%), physical abuse at home (28.1% & 30.4%), physical abuse at school (42.4% & 36.4%), and been bullied (33.8% & 39.6%). Among girls, internalized violent attitudes towards women were associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 2.1) and physical abuse at school (OR 1.7). Condoning rape was associated with physical abuse at school (OR 1.9). Bullying perpetration was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 4.5). Depression was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 3.8) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.4). Among boys, violent attitudes towards women and condoning rape were not associated with violence exposure. Bullying perpetration was associated with having been a victim of bullying (OR 2.9) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.7). Depression was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 2.9), domestic violence (OR 2.4) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.5). These findings can inform programs designed to reduce violence victimization among Malawian girls, both in homes and schools. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Childhood victimization impacts on the well-being of children and young people, particularly those experiencing an extreme amount of different types of victimization (i.e., poly-victims). However, limited attention has been given to the impact of different categories of extrafamilial victimization (experienced outside of the family), particularly in the UK. The intricacies of the significant detrimental impact poly-victimization has on victims are also poorly understood. In this study, 730 young people, aged 13 to 16 years (mean 13.8 years), from one county in the UK, were surveyed about their lifetime and past year experiences of extrafamilial victimization, the locations in which these occurred, and current trauma symptoms. The results showed that interpersonal forms of extrafamilial victimization (e.g., sexual victimization) were significant predictors of trauma, whilst more indirect forms of extrafamilial victimization (e.g., witnessing the victimization of others) were not. When extrafamilial poly-victimization and number of extrafamilial victim locations were accounted for within regression models, however, this impact was reduced. Poly-victimization within the past year was the strongest predictor of trauma symptoms. Number of victim locations did not significantly predict trauma symptoms above and beyond the impact of poly-victimization, although it was a contributory predictor. These findings suggest that a holistic exploration of a young person's extrafamilial victim experiences is needed in any clinical assessment or research into its psychological impact. Specifically, attention should be given to the experiencing of extreme levels of victimization (e.g., poly-victimization). Further longitudinal research is needed to understand why poly-victimization has the greatest impact on psychological well-being. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To explore the structure of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) criteria and their distribution according to the different severity level of IGD. The associations of psychiatric comorbidities to each IGD symptom and to the IGD severity were also investigated.
   Methods Consecutively recruited 330 Korean middle school students underwent face-to-face diagnostic interviews to assess their gaming problems by clinicians. The psychiatric comorbidities were also evaluated with a semi-structured instrument. The data was analyzed using principal components analysis and the distribution of criteria among different severity groups was visualized by plotting univariate curves.
   Results Two principal components of 'Compulsivity' and 'Tolerance' were extracted. 'Decrease in other activities' and 'Jeopardizing relationship/career' may indicate a higher severity of IGD. While 'Craving' deserved more recognition in clinical utility, 'Tolerance' did not demonstrate much difference in distribution by the IGD severity. Internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders differed in distribution by the IGD severity
   Conclusion A hierarchic presentation of IGD criteria was revealed. 'Decrease in other activities' and 'Jeopardizing relationship/career' may represent a higher severity, thus indicating more clinical attention to such symptoms. However, 'Tolerance' was not found to be a valid diagnostic criterion.

AB This cross-national study examined the connections between parental working time patterns (i.e., regular day work vs. nonstandard working hours) and children's socio-emotional wellbeing defined in terms of internalizing and externalizing problems and prosocial behavior. We also examined how the total number of hours worked, changes in work schedules; working overtime at short notice, and having an influence over one's work schedules were linked with children's wellbeing. Data were collected by a web survey from Finnish (n = 358), Dutch (n = 200) and British (n = 267) parents with children aged 3 to 12 years. The results showed, that in all three countries parents working nonstandard hours reported more internalizing problems among their children compared to parents in regular day work. In addition, parents whose work included overtime at short notice reported more internalizing problems among their children compared to parents who did not work overtime. Parental nonstandard working time was related to lowered prosocial behavior in children, as reported by parents, but only in the United Kingdom. Overall, the findings of this cross-national study indicated a universal, although weak association between nonstandard working hours and higher child internalizing problems. However, flexible arrangements both in working life and daycare services may help to promote children's socioemotional wellbeing such as prosocial behaviors - in families where parents work nonstandard times.

AB Objectives: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) is a revision of the standardized assessment for individuals with suspected autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The study examines the diagnostic accuracy of the original and revised algorithms for Modules 1 through 3. Methods: In a large clinical sample of children and adolescents (N = 1080, age 1.7 to 20.5), the differentiation of ASD from relevant differential diagnoses was investigated. As studies on the diagnostic accuracy for girls are sparse, comparisons concerning the diagnostic accuracy for gender subgroups were undertaken. Results: The revised algorithms exhibit an improvement in sensitivity (84.9 %) and a slight reduction in specifi city (85.7 %). The improvements in the ADOS-2 pertain especially to cases with core autism and girls. Including the repetitive behavior domain in the algorithm contributes to a correct clinical ASD classification in modules 2 and 3. This was not found for younger children examined with module 1. Results also suggest less effective diagnostic differentiation for children and adolescents with internalizing disorders and conduct disorder. Conclusions: Good diagnostic accuracy was found for children in the average range of cognitive abilities. Results suggest good diagnostic utility for the ADOS-2 in clinical settings, provided that thorough diagnostics are given by experienced examiners.

AB Objective: The aims of this study were (1) to assess obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) dimensionally in a school-aged community sample and to correlate them with clinical and demographical variables; (2) to determine a subgroup with significant OCS "at-risk for OCD'') using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-OCS) and (3) to compare it with the rest of the sample; (4) To review the CBCL-OCS subscale properties as a screening tool for pediatric OCD.
   Methods: Data from the Brazilian High Risk Cohort were analyzed. The presence and severity of OCS were assessed through the CBCL-OCS subscale. DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses were obtained by the Developmental and Well-Being Assessment. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Youth Strengths Inventory, and the CBCL internalizing and externalizing behavior subscales.
   Results: A total of 2512 (mean age: 8.86 +/- 1.84 years; 55.0% male) children were included. Moderate correlations were found between OCS severity and functional impairment (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). Children with higher levels of OCS had higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity and behavioral problems (p < 0.001). A score of 5 or higher in the CBCL-OCS scale determined an "at-risk for OCD'' subgroup, comprising 9.7% of the sample (n = 244), with behavioral patterns and psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., tics [odds ratios, OR = 6.41, p < 0.001]), anxiety disorders grouped [OR = 3.68, p < 0.001] and depressive disorders [OR = 3.0, p < 0.001] very similar to those described in OCD. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CBCL-OCS for OCD diagnosis were, respectively, 48%, 91.5%; 15.1%, and 98.2%.
   Conclusions: The dimensional approach suggests that the presence of OCS in children is associated with higher rates of comorbidity, behavioral problems, and impairment. The "at-risk for OCD'' group defined by the CBCL revealed a group of patients phenotypically similar to full blown OCD.

AB Objective Identify profiles of functioning in families of children with asthma and examine whether profile membership predicts subsequent child mental and physical well-being. Methods Primary caregivers and children (N = 1,030) from the Childhood Asthma Management Program completed questionnaires assessing family functioning and child adaptation at five time points. Asthma severity was also assessed via spirometry. Results Latent profile analyses identified a four-profile solution as best fitting the data: cohesive, permissive, controlling/disengaged, and controlling/enmeshed families. Distal outcome analyses using Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars techniques suggested that children from families that were more cohesive had fewer internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These associations remained stable across time. Family profiles did not differ with regards to child asthma severity. Conclusion Results highlight the importance of looking beyond the effects of distinct components of family functioning and instead using pattern-based approaches. Recommendations for incorporating screenings and services for families in pediatric care settings are provided.

AB Objective To examine maternal and child internalizing symptoms as predictors of early adolescent emotional eating in a longitudinal framework spanning three critical developmental periods (preschool, elementary school, and early adolescence). Methods Participants were 170 children recruited at preschool age for a longitudinal study. When children were 5.25 years, their mothers completed ratings of their own internalizing symptoms. During the spring of 4th grade, children completed measures of internalizing symptoms. In early adolescence, youth completed a measure of emotional eating. Results Maternal and child internalizing symptoms predicted adolescent emotional eating. The results indicated that child psychopathology moderated the association between maternal psychopathology (except for maternal anxiety) and early adolescent emotional eating. There was no evidence of mediation. Conclusions Pediatric psychologists are encouraged to provide early screening of, and interventions for, maternal and child internalizing symptoms to prevent children's emotional eating.

AB Researchers' interest have recently moved toward the identification of recurrent psychopathological profiles characterized by concurrent elevations on different behavioural and emotional traits. This new strategy turned to be useful in terms of diagnosis and outcome prediction. We used a person-centred statistical approach to examine whether different groups could be identified in a referred sample and in a general-population sample of children and adolescents, and we investigated their relation to DSM-IV diagnoses. A latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) syndrome scales of the referred sample (N = 1225), of the general-population sample (N = 3418), and of the total sample. Models estimating 1-class through 5-class solutions were compared and agreement in the classification of subjects was evaluated. Chi square analyses, a logistic regression, and a multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the relations between classes and diagnoses. In the two samples and in the total sample, the best-fitting models were 4-class solutions. The identified classes were Internalizing Problems (15.68%), Severe Dysregulated (7.82%), Attention/Hyperactivity (10.19%), and Low Problems (66.32%). Subsequent analyses indicated a significant relationship between diagnoses and classes as well as a main association between the severe dysregulated class and comorbidity. Our data suggested the presence of four different psychopathological profiles related to different outcomes in terms of psychopathological diagnoses. In particular, our results underline the presence of a profile characterized by severe emotional and behavioural dysregulation that is mostly associated with the presence of multiple diagnosis.

AB Objective: Although most people will experience a traumatic event at some point in their life, only some will develop significant psychological symptoms in the aftermath. In the current study, we use a preexisting longitudinal study located in Long Island to examine the impact of Hurricane Sandy on internalizing symptoms in a large sample of children, We focused on temperamental fear and a biomarker of risk for anxiety, the error-related negativity (ERN). The ERN is a negative deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) occurring when individuals make mistakes and is increased in anxious individuals.
   Method: The final sample consisted of 223 children who had undergone an observational assessment of fear at age 3 years and an electroencephalogram assessment of the ERN at age 6 years. At the age 9 year assessment, internalizing symptoms were assessed, and then again after the hurricane (-65 weeks later).
   Results: A significant three-way interaction among fearfulness, hurricane stressors, and the ERN in predicting posthurricane increases in internalizing symptoms suggested that children who were high in fear at age 3 years and experienced elevated hurricane stressors were characterized by subsequent increases in internalizing symptoms, but only when they were also characterized by an increased ERN at age 6 years.
   Conclusion: These findings support a diathesis stress model, suggesting that early temperament and prestressor biological markers confer risk for increased psychological symptoms following environmental stressors.

AB Objective: Hispanic youth in the general community experience traumatic events and display symptoms of psychological distress more frequently than do Caucasian youth. However, little is known about how traumatic experiences in this ethnic minority population relate to psychopathology in clinical samples and whether these outcomes vary by gender and are impacted by family functioning. We hypothesized that traumatic stress reactions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and internalizing and externalizing symptoms, would vary by gender and by family functioning in a clinical sample of Hispanic youth. Method: The current study utilized baseline data from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 200 Hispanic adolescents (122 boys and 78 girls) referred to treatment for experiencing clinical symptoms of 1 or more behavioral disorders and conflictual family relations. The rate of traumatic events, differences in outcomes depending on trauma exposure, and the effects gender, family functioning, and trauma on psychopathology and PTSD symptoms were examined. Results: Analyses revealed that 61% of Hispanic youth in this clinical sample experienced at least 1 traumatic event. Although only 12% of the sample reported PTSD scores in the clinical range, girls reported higher PTSD scores than did boys. Poor family cohesion was particularly detrimental to girls compared with boys and related to internalizing and PTSD symptoms. High family conflict predicted PTSD symptoms in boys but not in girls. Conclusions: These findings have clinical implications for working with Hispanic populations, suggesting that culturally sensitive interventions should incorporate family-based interventions for individuals who experience trauma to strengthen family bonds and decrease family conflict.

ID ANXIETY; IMPACT; RISK
AB The mental health impact of parental detention and deportation on citizen children is a topic of increasing concern. Forced parent-child separation and parental loss are potentially traumatic events (PTEs) with adverse effects on children's mental health. Objective: This study examines post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychological distress among 91 Latino U.S.-born children (ages 6 to 12), living in mixed-status families with a least 1 undocumented parent at risk for detention or deportation. Method: Multiagent (child, parent, teacher, clinician) and standardized assessments were conducted at baseline to assess for child trauma and psychological distress. Results: Analyses indicate that PTSD symptoms as reported by parent were significantly higher for children of detained and deported parents compared to citizen children whose parents were either legal permanent residents or undocumented without prior contact with immigration enforcement. Similarly, findings revealed differences in child internalizing problems associated with parental detention and deportation as reported by parent as well as differences in overall child functioning as reported by clinician. In addition, teachers reported higher externalizing for children with more exposure to PTEs. Conclusions: These findings lend support to a reconsideration and revision of immigration enforcement practices to take into consideration the best interest of Latino citizen children. Trauma-informed assessments and interventions are recommended for this special population.

AB BackgroundEmotional lability (EL) is frequent in school-aged children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with more frequent comorbidities and more severe impairment. However, little research has investigated the association between EL, ADHD and comorbid symptoms in preschoolers. This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety).
   MethodOne hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted.
   ResultsHigher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety.
   ConclusionsEmotional lability seems to be a potential marker for ADHD symptoms with internalizing problems in preschoolers and could be a target for diagnosis and early interventions. This finding should be treated with caution as the study was limited by the low response rate of the participants and consequently the small sample size.

AB Background: Research examining the association between internalizing and externalizing dimensions of psychopathology has relied heavily on variable-centered analytical techniques. Person-centered methodologies complement the variable-centered approach, and may help explain the medium-to-large correlations that exist between higher order dimensions of psychopathology. What little person-centered research exists has been cross-sectional and utilized adult samples. The present study sought to take a person-centered approach to the modeling of psychiatric comorbidity during a key developmental phase; middle childhood through adolescence.
   Methods: Analysis was conducted on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N= 9282). Latent transition analysis (LTA) was conducted using eight DSM-IV disorders assessed at ages 7.5 and 14 years as measured indicators.
   Results: At both time points, a four class solution provided the best fit, with classes labeled as (i) normative, (ii) primarily internalizing, (iii) primarily externalizing, and (iv) high-rislc/multimorbid. There was considerable individual-level stability across time, with approximately 80% of children remaining in the same class at both time points. Those in the internalizing class at baseline were more likely to transition to a less severe class (i.e., the normative class).
   Conclusions: Person-centered methodologies demonstrate that the association between internalizing and externalizing is accounted for by a sub-population at high risk for experiencing psychiatric comorbidity, and 'cross-class' disorders which link the internalizing and externalizing spectra.

A total of 108 mothers (M-age=30.68 years, SDage=6.06) reported on their parenting stress as well as their preschoolers' (M-age=3.50 years, SDage=0.51, 61% boys) negative emotionality and internalizing, externalizing, and sleep problems. Results indicated that the genetic sensitivity variable functioned according to a differential susceptibility model; however, the results involving physiological and behavioral sensitivity factors were most consistent with a diathesis-stress framework. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts to counter the effects of parenting stress are discussed.

AB Objective: Developmental models of temperament by environment interactions predict that children's negative emotionality exacerbates the detrimental effects of risky environments, increasing the risk for pathology. However, negative emotions may have an adaptive function. Accordingly, the present study explores an alternative hypothesis that in the context of high adversity, negative emotionality may be a manifestation of an adaptive coping style and thus be protective against the harmful effects of a stressful environment. Method: Prospective combined effects of negative emotionality and cumulative risk (confluence of multiple risk factors related to poverty) on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and allostatic load, an index of cumulative physiological dysregulation, were assessed in 239 children (46% female, baseline age = 9). Negative emotionality and cumulative risk were assessed at baseline. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were measured at 4- and 8-year follow-ups. Allostatic load was measured at baseline and both follow-ups using neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic parameters. Linear mixed-effect models were used to analyze the prospective associations between negative emotionality, cumulative risk, and the outcomes-allostatic load and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results: The combination of high cumulative risk exposure and high negative emotionality was associated with highest levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. However, consistent with the alternative hypothesis, negative emotionality reduced the effects of high cumulative risk on allostatic load. Conclusions: In the context of risky environments, negative emotionality may offer some physical health benefits.

AB Although theory and research evidence indicate that less securely attached persons are more likely than their secure peers to experience emotion regulation difficulties, this is not necessarily a pre-ordained outcome. Emotion regulation difficulties may be more proximally predicted by individuals' maladaptive psychological defenses such as humor styles. This study explored the interrelationships between adult attachment orientations (attachment anxiety and avoidance) and perceived bonds with parents (perceived levels of parental care and control), emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating humor). Attachment anxiety, avoidance, and maternal care and overprotection were associated in expected directions with aggressive and self-defeating humor, but paternal care and overprotection were not. Additionally, aggressive and self-defeating humor were positively associated with expressive suppression and negatively associated with cognitive reappraisal. Self-defeating humor partially mediated the relationship between a number of attachment predictors (attachment anxiety, avoidance, maternal care, and maternal control) and expressive suppression. For example, attachment anxiety predicted higher use of self-defeating humor, which in turn predicted higher levels of expressive suppression. Finally, aggressive humor partially mediated the relationship between avoidance and cognitive reappraisal. Avoidance predicted higher use of aggressive humor, which in turn predicted lower levels of reappraisal. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB BackgroundMultidimensional family therapy (MDFT) is a well-established treatment for adolescents showing both substance abuse and/or antisocial behavior.
   MethodThe effectiveness of MDFT in reducing adolescents' substance abuse, delinquency, externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, and family malfunctioning was examined by means of a (three-level) meta-analysis, summarizing 61 effect sizes from 19 manuscripts (N=1,488 participants).
   ResultsCompared with other therapies, the overall effect size of MDFT was significant, albeit small in magnitude (d=0.24, p<.001), and similar across intervention outcome categories. Moderator analysis revealed that adolescents with high severity problems, including severe substance abuse and disruptive behavior disorder, benefited more from MDFT than adolescents with less severe conditions.
   ConclusionsIt can be concluded that MDFT is effective for adolescents with substance abuse, delinquency, and comorbid behavior problems. Subsequently, it is important to match specific characteristics of the adolescents, such as extent of impairment, with MDFT.

AB BackgroundIrritability, a frequent complaint in children with psychiatric disorders, reflects increased predisposition to anger. Preliminary work in pediatric clinical samples links irritability to attention bias to threat, and the current study examines this association in a large population-based sample.
   MethodsWe studied 1,872 children (ages 6-14) using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and dot-probe tasks. Irritability was defined using CBCL items that assessed temper tantrums and hot temper. The dot-probe task assessed attention biases for threat-related (angry face) stimuli. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess specificity of associations to irritability when adjusting for demographic variables and co-occurring psychiatric traits. Propensity score matching analysis was used to increase causal inference when matching for demographic variables and co-occurring psychiatric traits.
   ResultsIrritability was associated with increased attention bias toward threat-related cues. Multiple regression analysis suggests associations between irritability and threat bias are independent from demographic variables, anxiety, and externalizing traits (attention-deficit/hyperactivity, conduct, and headstrong/hurtful), but not from broad internalizing symptoms. Propensity score matching analysis indicated that this association was found for irritable versus nonirritable groups matched on demographic and co-occurring traits including internalizing symptoms.
   ConclusionsIrritability in children is associated with biased attention toward threatening information. This finding, if replicated, warrants further investigation to examine the extent to which it contributes to chronic irritability and to explore possible treatment implications.

AB A large body of work documents the heavy mental health burden of youth exposure to disasters, but the majority of this research has focused on posttraumatic stress and internalizing symptoms. Less is known about associations between disaster exposure and children's conduct problems (CPs), or variables that may moderate such relationships. Given well-documented links between CPs and children's exposure to community violence, youth with greater prior community violence exposure through residence in high-crime areas may be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of disaster exposure on CPs. We surveyed Boston-area caregivers (N=460) in the first 6months following the 2013 Marathon bombing on their children's event-related exposures, as well as CPs. To estimate prior violent crime exposure, children's neighborhoods were assigned corresponding violent crime rates obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's uniform crime reporting statistics. Almost 1 in 6 Boston-area children assessed in this convenience sample showed clinically elevated CPs in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt. Prior violent crime exposure significantly moderated the link between children's manhunt exposure (but not bombing exposure) and child CPs. Manhunt exposure was related to increased CPs among children living in areas with high and medium (but not low) levels of prior violent crime. Children living in neighborhoods characterized by violent crime may be at particularly increased risk for developing CPs after violent manmade disasters. As most postdisaster child intervention efforts focus on posttraumatic stress, efforts are needed to develop programs targeting child CPs, particularly for youth dwelling in violent neighborhoods.

AB The goal of the current study was to examine conflict appraisals and diurnal cortisol production as mediators of the robust association between marital conflict and adolescent adjustment problems. Parents reported their marital conflict and were observed engaging in a marital conflict discussion; they also reported adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Adolescents (n=105, 52% female, 10-17 years of age) appraised their parents' marital conflict and reported their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. After the laboratory visit, adolescents provided four saliva samples on each of 2 consecutive days to assess diurnal cortisol production. More-negative marital conflict predicted more self-blame for parental conflict, which in turn predicted less robust decreases in cortisol across the day. Further, this flattened cortisol production pattern mediated the relationship between greater self-blame for parental conflict and adolescents' elevated internalizing behaviors. Feeling responsible for parental conflict appears to be particularly damaging in terms of physiological regulation and adjustment, and may therefore be a particularly useful intervention target.

AB Adolescents and adults with major depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms show reduced reward responses and tend to show enhanced responses to negative stimuli. However, reward-related behaviors and adaptive responses to negative feedback undergo dramatic changes across puberty. Thus, key questions remain regarding how altered incentive processing relates to depressive and anhedonic symptoms in prepubertal child populations. Twenty-four nonclinical prepubertal children 7-10 years of age (15 male; 16 Caucasian) completed two signal detection tasks that assessed behavioral responsivity to candy gain and loss feedback, respectively. These tasks were based on Pizzagalli's probabilistic reward task where asymmetric feedback leads to greater bias toward the more frequently rewarded response in more hedonic or nondepressed adults. We further modified the task to create a version where incorrect responses could result in losses from an original allotment of candy. Children and parents/guardians also completed individual difference questionnaires to assess the child's depressive symptoms, general affect, and hedonic capacity/approach motivation. Regressions indicated a relation between hedonic capacity/approach motivation (child self-report) and response bias in both gain and loss tasks. No significant relations were observed between depressive (child self-report), internalizing (parent report), or externalizing symptoms (parent report) and bias in either the gain or loss task in this small sample. These results suggest that reduced hedonic capacity/approach motivation is associated with blunted responses to both gain and loss feedback in prepubertal children.

AB This study examined sleep patterns and sleep problems in relation to smoking and alcohol use in Chinese adolescents. A questionnaire survey of 2090 adolescent students was conducted in Lijin County, Shandong, China. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. After adjustment for demographics and internalizing and externalizing problems, poor sleep quality was associated with increased risk of smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.40), alcohol use (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.81-3.89), and getting drunk (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.72-4.57); sleeping 7 hours (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.20-2.43) and sleeping 6 hours or less per night on weekdays (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.25-3.10) were significantly associated with increased risk for alcohol use, and sleeping 6 hours or less per night on weekends (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.18-3.70) were significantly associated with increased risk for getting drunk; and hypnotic medication use was significantly associated with ever smoking (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08-2.99). These findings highlight the potential role of sleep intervention in the prevention of adolescent substance use.

AB Child temperament as well as parenting behaviors have been linked to adolescent depression. Beyond their main effects, the interplay between these factors is of interest. For example, in an interactive model, a differential susceptibility of temperamental variants to parenting has been suggested. However, so far, the differential susceptibility hypothesis has mostly been studied with a focus on externalizing disorders. On the other hand, parenting may shape the child's temperament and vice versa in a transactional process. In a prospective, longitudinal at-risk sample (163 boys, 176 girls), we assessed emotional (easy-difficult) and regulative (self-control) temperament at ages 4.5, and 8 years, respectively, as well as parenting quality at age 4.5 years using the HOME inventory. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to investigate the prediction of depressive symptoms at age 11, measured by the Child Depression Inventory, including interaction terms between the temperament variable and parenting. We additionally tested whether parenting was mediated by child temperament. As previously reported, both self-control and parenting were longitudinally associated with preadolescent depressive symptoms. There were no interactive effects between temperament and parenting. However, the effects of parenting were partly mediated by self-control. Our data do not support a differential susceptibility of temperamental variants in the development of preadolescent depression. However, our results are in line with the assumption that parenting may shape young children's temperament, with positive parenting in the early childhood fostering the development of regulative temperament.

AB Objective: Despite early dietary treatment phenylketonuria patients have lower IQ and poorer executive functions compared to healthy controls. Cognitive problems in phenylketonuria have often been associated with phenylalanine levels. The present study examined the cognitive profile and mental health in adult phenylketonuria, in relation to phenylalanine levels and tetrahydrobiopterin treatment. Method: Fifty-seven early treated adult patients with phenylketonuria and 57 healthy matched controls (18-40 years) performed IQ subtests and executive function tests from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks. They also completed the Adult Self-Report on mental health problems. Analyses of variance were performed to examine group differences. Results: Patients with phenylketonuria had normal IQs although lower than controls. They performed poorer on working memory, inhibitory control, and sustained attention tasks. Patients reported Depressive and Avoidant Personality problems more frequently. Specifically, patients with childhood and lifetime phenylalanine >= 360 mu mol/L had poorer cognitive and mental health outcomes than controls. In a subset of patients, comparisons between patients on and off tetrahydrobiopterin showed that nontetrahydrobiopterin users (matched for childhood, pretreatment phenylalanine) were slower (on number of tasks) and reported more mental health problems. Conclusions: Adult patients had lower IQ and poorer executive functions than controls, resembling problems observed in younger patients with phenylketonuria, as well as more internalizing problems. Group differences and phenylalanine-outcome associations were smaller than those observed in younger populations. A subset of nontetrahydrobiopterin users, matched for childhood phenylalanine level, had a poorer outcome on some tests than tetrahydrobiopterin users, which might indicate an impact of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment beyond lowering phenylalanine. However, clinical relevance needs further investigation.

AB A previous article published in Prevention Science 3 years ago (Heinrichs et al. 2014) presented the results of a randomized controlled trial of the Triple P group program 4 years (FU4) after administration as a universal prevention approach in preschools. The present addendum resolves inconsistencies in outcome reporting (e.g., total scores of scales versus subscale scores) and provides information on measures that were additionally available to analyze further potential effects of the intervention. Effects in secondary outcome domains not reported in Heinrichs et al. (2014) are furthermore analyzed and reported. The original data analyses were varied using a different statistical model in this addendum. Re-analyses supported the original results, including changes in self-reported maternal and paternal positive parenting, in maternal dysfunctional parenting behavior as well as in maternal reports of child behavior. In addition, when analyzing the externalizing and internalizing dimensions, analysis revealed a statistically significant change in externalizing but not internalizing child symptoms. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcome domains. Considering important limitations in the study design [such as baseline differences at pre-assessment with mothers from intervention preschools reporting more child behavioral problems prior to introducing the intervention and predominantly non-significant effects from (a) fathers perspective, (b) teacher ratings at 1-year follow up (FU1), and (c) behavioral observations at FU1], we believe that this trial alone cannot be taken as sufficient evidence for a significant and meaningful change in child behavioral problems, which is the ultimate goal of child prevention programs. Therefore, future studies need to replicate and extend upon these results by including larger sample sizes and overcome the discussed limitations.

AB Increasing evidence from experimental and non-experimental research has shown that children residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibit greater levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, above and beyond individual characteristics, and family or school contexts. Using the ECLS-K, a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of U.S. school children, this study examined direct neighborhood effects on internalizing (N = 14,870; N = 10,610) and externalizing (N = 14,960; N = 10,730) behaviors at the beginning and end of elementary school. Using IPTW propensity scores to mitigate selection bias and ordinary least squares regression, we examined direct neighborhood effects when children were 7 years old (1st grade) and when they were 11 years old (5th grade). We also examined neighborhood effect modification by child child race/ethnicity, sex, family structure, and family SES. Both the direct effect and effect modification models indicated that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods had no impact on either internalizing or externalizing behaviors at the beginning of elementary school (age 7). At the end of elementary school (age 11), we found small, yet significant direct neighborhood associations with effect sizes ranging from 0.12 to 0.18 standard deviations. The effect modification analysis revealed that being black (relative to white) was the strongest moderator of the relationship between neighborhood context and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in 5th grade, with effect sizes ranging from 0.27 to 0.59 standard deviations. Being Hispanic in high poverty neighborhoods was found to be protective for externalizing behaviors, suggesting the presence of the Hispanic health paradox. We also found, that in some neighborhood contexts, child sex, family structure, and family socioeconomic status amplified or dampened the effect of neighborhood, but only for externalizing behaviors. These results demonstrate the importance of age-dependent neighborhood effects and that children with different demographic profiles respond differently to the social contexts in which they are exposed.

AB The Goal-Corrected Partnership Adolescent Coding System (GPACS) has shown promise in assessing a secure as well as three atypical patterns of parent-adolescent interaction during a conflict discussion. The current study of 186 economically disadvantaged families examines the degree to which four GPACS patterns: secure/collaborative, hostile/punitive, role confused, and disoriented, prospectively predict adolescents' social competence and maladaptive behavior (internalizing, externalizing, and risk behaviors) at age 15 years after controlling for these social behaviors at age 13 years and contemporaneous GPACS scores. Adolescents from secure/collaborative dyads at age 13 were more likely to have a secure state of mind in the Adult Attachment Interview at age 15 and showed higher levels of teachers' ratings of empathy and lower levels of teachers' ratings of externalizing behaviors at age 15 years. Adolescents in disoriented dyads showed higher levels of teacher-rated internalizing problems, while male adolescents in role confused dyads reported higher levels of involvement in risk behaviors, including unprotected sexual activity and substance use problems.

AB Institutional caregiving is associated with significant deviations from species-expected caregiving, altering the normative sequence of attachment formation and placing children at risk for long-term emotional difficulties. However, little is known about factors that can promote resilience following early institutional caregiving. In the current study, we investigated how adaptations in affective processing (i.e., positive valence bias) and family-level protective factors (i.e., secure parent-child relationships) moderate risk for internalizing symptoms in previously institutionalized (PI) youth. Children and adolescents with and without a history of institutional care performed a laboratory-based affective processing task and self-reported measures of parent-child relationship security. PI youth were more likely than comparison youth to show positive valence biases when interpreting ambiguous facial expressions. Both positive valence bias and parent-child relationship security moderated the association between institutional care and parent-reported internalizing symptoms, such that greater positive valence bias and more secure parent-child relationships predicted fewer symptoms in PI youth. However, when both factors were tested concurrently, parent-child relationship security more strongly moderated the link between PI status and internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that both individual-level adaptations in affective processing and family-level factors of secure parent-child relationships may ameliorate risk for internalizing psychopathology following early institutional caregiving.

AB Numerous investigations have demonstrated that child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) promotes secure attachment between mothers and offspring. However, the role of postintervention attachment security as it relates to long-term child outcomes has never been evaluated. The present study therefore examined postintervention attachment status as a mediator of the association between CPP for depressed mothers and their offspring and subsequent peer relations among offspring. Depressed mothers and their toddlers were randomized to receive CPP (n = 45) or to a control group (n = 55). A prior investigation with this sample indicated that offspring who received CPP attained significantly higher rates of secure attachment postintervention, whereas insecure attachment continued to predominate for offspring in the control group. The present study examined follow-up data of teachers' reports on participants' competence with classroom peers when they were approximately 9 years old. Findings indicated that children who received CPP were more likely to evidence secure attachments at postintervention, which in turn was associated with more positive peer relationships at age 9.

AB Although evidence shows that attachment insecurity and disorganization increase risk for the development of psychopathology (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, Lapsley, & Roisman, 2010; Groh, Roisman, van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Fearon, 2012), implementation challenges have precluded dissemination of attachment interventions on the broad scale at which they are needed. The Circle of Security-Parenting Intervention (COS-P; Cooper, Hoffman, & Powell, 2009), designed with broad implementation in mind, addresses this gap by training community service providers to use a manualized, video-based program to help caregivers provide a secure base and a safe haven for their children. The present study is a randomized controlled trial of COS-P in a low-income sample of Head Start enrolled children and their mothers. Mothers (N = 141; 75 intervention, 66 waitlist control) completed a baseline assessment and returned with their children after the 10-week intervention for the outcome assessment, which included the Strange Situation. Intent to treat analyses revealed a main effect for maternal response to child distress, with mothers assigned to COS-P reporting fewer unsupportive (but not more supportive) responses to distress than control group mothers, and a main effect for one dimension of child executive functioning (inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility when maternal age and marital status were controlled), with intervention group children showing greater control. There were, however, no main effects of intervention for child attachment or behavior problems. Exploratory follow-up analyses suggested intervention effects were moderated by maternal attachment style or depressive symptoms, with moderated intervention effects emerging for child attachment security and disorganization, but not avoidance; for inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility; and for child internalizing but not externalizing behavior problems. This initial randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of COS-P sets the stage for further exploration of what works for whom in attachment intervention.

AB Children's social competence and behavioral adjustment are key issues for child development, education, and clinical research. Cross-cultural analyses are necessary to provide relevant methods of assessing them for cross-cultural research. The aim of the current study was to contribute to this important line of research by validating the 3-factor structure of the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation (SCBE-30; LaFreniere & Dumas, 1996) among Belgian and Vietnamese children and by comparing Belgian and Vietnamese children's social competence and behavioral adjustment. Parent reports were collected relating to 607 children ages 5 to 7: 243 from Belgium and 364 from Vietnam. The results support the universality of the 3-factor structure of the SCBE-30 encompassing social competence, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior. They give strong support to the relevance of this theoretically and empirically based instrument for conducting cross-cultural studies. However, they also reveal significant cultural variations with regard to individualist and collectivist values in the 2 countries under consideration.

AB In this study, we used data from life histories of 424 non-incarcerated (n = 266) and incarcerated (n = 158) women to examine the extent to which women are exposed to multiple forms of victimization, including child abuse, intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and traumatic life events. We assessed the effects of polyvictimization (e. g., multiple victimizations) on women's healthrelated outcomes (e. g., attempted suicide, drug and alcohol problems) as well as whether the prevalence rates and effects of victimization were significantly different between the subsamples of women. Results indicate that incarcerated women experience significantly more victimization than non-incarcerated women, and while polyvictimization was associated with a higher likelihood of alcohol problems, drug problems, and attempted suicide among non-incarcerated women, it was only marginally associated with an increased likelihood of alcohol problems among incarcerated women. Finally, low levels of polyvictimization affected alcohol and drug problems among incarcerated and non-incarcerated women differently.

AB Experiencing sexual trauma has been linked to internalizing and externalizing psychopathologies. Insecure attachment has been shown to moderate the relation between sexual trauma and trauma symptoms among adults. However, few studies have explored relations among sexual trauma, attachment insecurity, and trauma symptoms in adolescence, and none have used developmentally appropriate measures. The present study sought to examine attachment security as a potential moderator of the relation between having a history of sexual trauma (HST) and trauma symptoms among adolescents at an inpatient psychiatric facility. Attachment to caregivers was measured by the Child Attachment Interview (CAI) and trauma symptoms by the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Children (TSCC). HST was assessed with responses to two separate interviews that asked about traumatic experiences: the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (C-DISC) and the CAI. Moderation analyses were conducted using univariate General Linear Modeling (GLM). Of the 229 study participants, 50 (21.8%) had a HST. The relation between HST and trauma symptoms was significantly moderated by insecure attachment with both mother, F(1, 228) = 4.818, p = .029, and father, F(1, 228) = 6.370, p = .012. Specifically, insecurely attached adolescents with a HST exhibited trauma symptoms at levels significantly greater than securely attached adolescents with a HST and adolescents with no HST. Results are consistent with previous research that suggests secure attachment may protect against the development of trauma symptoms among those who have experienced a sexual trauma.

AB High achievement expectations and academic pressure from parents have been implicated in rising levels of stress and reduced well-being among adolescents. In this study of affluent, middle school youth, we examined how perceptions of parents' emphases on achievement (relative to prosocial behavior) influenced youth's psychological adjustment and school performance, and examined perceived parental criticism as a possible moderator of this association. The data were collected from 506 (50 % female) middle school students from a predominately white, upper middle class community. Students reported their perceptions of parents' values by rank ordering a list of achievement- and prosocial-oriented goals based on what they believed was most valued by their mothers and fathers for them (the child) to achieve. The data also included students' reports of perceived parental criticism, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and self-esteem, as well as school-based data on grade point average and teacher-reported classroom behavior. Person-based analyses revealed six distinct latent classes based on perceptions of both mother and father emphases on achievement. Class comparisons showed a consistent pattern of healthier child functioning, including higher school performance, higher self-esteem, and lower psychological symptoms, in association with low to neutral parental achievement emphasis, whereas poorer child functioning was associated with high parental achievement emphasis. In variable-based analyses, interaction effects showed elevated maladjustment when high maternal achievement emphasis coexisted with high (but not low) perceived parental criticism. Results of the study suggest that to foster early adolescents' well-being in affluent school settings, parents focus on prioritizing intrinsic, prosocial values that promote affiliation and community, at least as much as, or more than, they prioritize academic performance and external achievement; and strive to limit the amount of criticism and pressure they place on their children.

Teacher attunement was measured as the agreement between teacher- and peer-nominations for students who start fights. Teachers rated their students on the following characteristics: academic competence, affiliation, popularity, internalizing behavior, and Olympian qualities. Higher affiliation, popularity, and internalizing behavior were associated with decreased odds for teacher attunement to aggressive youth. Higher Olympian qualities were associated with increased odds for teacher attunement to aggressive youth. Implications for interventions are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 43:263-272, 2017.

AB Compared with full-terms, preterm individuals are more at risk from infancy to adulthood for developing internalizing symptoms. Early maternal interactive behavior, especially maternal sensitivity, has been found to be a resilience factor in the developmental outcome of preterm children. The present longitudinal study aimed at examining whether early interactive parenting behaviors have a long term impact on the internalizing symptoms of preterm-born young adolescents. A total sample of 36 very preterm and 22 full-term children participated in an 11-year follow-up study. Maternal interactive behavior was assessed during a mother-infant interaction when the infant was 18 months old. At 11 years, internalizing symptoms were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction between groups (preterm/full-term) and maternal sensitivity at 18 months significantly explained CBCL internalizing symptoms at 11 years (beta = -0.526; p < 0.05). Specifically, although prematurity was related to internalizing problems, preterm children with higher maternal sensitivity did not differ from their full-term-born peers on the CBCL internalizing problems domain. These results suggest that maternal sensitivity is a long-term resilience factor preventing the development of internalizing problems at early adolescence in very preterm individuals.

AB Cohabiting family structures are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States but are less stable than married family unions. In this longitudinal study we examine the change in psychosocial adjustment of adolescents when a non-biologically related male cohabiting partner (MCP) transitions out of the family home. Of particular interest, the role of maternal and MCP depressive symptoms was examined as a moderator. At wave 1, the sample was comprised of 111 low-income urban Black families, consisting of an adolescent (42.3 % male; Mage = 13), a biological mother, and a non-biologically-related male cohabiting partner (MCP). Wave 2 and 3 assessments occurred over the course of the subsequent 29 months, with 38 % of MCPs transitioning out of the home. We used latent growth curve modeling to characterize trajectories of youth internalizing and externalizing symptom change across the 3 waves. Both maternal and MCP depressive symptoms interacted with whether a transition occurred, consistent with the notion that adolescent problem behaviors are shaped by the dynamic interplay of individual- and family-characteristics.

AB With increasing awareness that ADHD is chronically disabling, a burgeoning literature has examined childhood clinical indicators of ADHD persistence. This study investigates whether childhood factors reflecting biological risk and cognitive reserve have additive predictive value for the persistence of ADHD that is unique beyond childhood indicators of disorder severity. One-hundred thirty children with ADHD (mean age = 8.9 years, 75 % male) were followed into adolescence (mean age = 14.0 years). Childhood ADHD and co-morbidities were assessed via interviews with parents and teachers; parental psychopathology was assessed via parent interview; exposure to neurobiological and psychosocial adversity were indexed by parent questionnaire; and cognitive reserve was evaluated through children's performance on measures of IQ and executive functioning. Univariate analyses identified childhood inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, co-morbid oppositional defiant disorder, overall impairment, and paternal anxiety and depression as more prevalent amongst adolescents with persistent compared with remitted ADHD. Only child-level predictors remained significant in a final multivariate model. These results suggest that children who are most likely to experience persistent ADHD have a more severe clinical presentation in childhood, reflected by increased levels of inattention, oppositional behavior, and impairment. They also are more likely to have fathers with internalizing concerns, but these concerns do not uniquely predict ADHD persistence beyond child-level factors. Contrary to expectations, childhood adversity and cognitive functioning did not predict the course of ADHD.

AB Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. report higher rates of several mental, emotional, and behavioral problems such as substance use, sexual risk behaviors, and internalizing and externalizing problems. There is evidence of common pathways in the development of mental, emotional, and behavioral problems with certain subgroups of Hispanic adolescents being at greater risk. In the present article, we report analysis of baseline data for 959 Hispanic adolescents who participated in one of two randomized controlled trials evaluating a family-based preventive intervention. Utilizing latent class analysis, we identified subgroups of Hispanic adolescents based on socio-ecological risk and protective factors (e.g., parent-adolescent communication, parental involvement in school). Three distinct socio-ecological risk subgroups (high, medium, and low risk) were identified and exhibited significant differences from each other across a majority of socio-ecological risk and protective factors. Adolescents in higher socio-ecological risk subgroups reported greater mental, emotional, and behavioral problems across all outcomes. Individual comparisons revealed significant differences between the low socio-ecological risk group and both the medium and high socio-ecological risk group in lifetime alcohol use, smoking, and sex, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications for intervention include focusing on specific risk subgroups and targeting shared risk and protective factors rather than specific mental, emotional, and behavioral outcomes.

AB The People in My Life questionnaire (PIML) is one of the few available self-report measures for assessing children's representations of the relationship with attachment figures (parents and peers) in middle childhood. The current study presents validation studies of the PIML in a sample of Portuguese children aged between 8 and 12 years (N = 314) and adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years (N = 281). The original factor structure, composed of a second-order factor of attachment and three first-order factors (Trust, Communication, and Alienation), was confirmed for both scales (Parents Attachment and Peers Attachment) in the sample of children and replicated in the sample of adolescents using confirmatory factor analyses. The Portuguese version of the PIML showed adequate internal consistency and correlated as expected with measures of intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning (internalizing and externalizing problems, prosocial behavior, quality of life, self-compassion, and emotion regulation strategies). The PIML proved to be a psychometrically robust measure of children's representations of their relationships with parents and peers, representing an important advance in the measurement of attachment in middle childhood.

AB Father's mental health is an emerging area of interest that is beginning to be recognized in research, and to a lesser extent in clinical practice and society. Fathers are part of a parenting dyad with 2 partners who are responsible for their children's emotional development. Similar to mothers, the risk for mental health problems increases once a male becomes a father, but there is limited research examining this issue. The purpose of this review is to present the available literature on father's mental health and its effect on child emotional health through various mechanisms. In general, father's mental health was found to be related to increased child internalizing and externalizing behaviors, but each disorder had different risk factors, and a unique effect on parenting behaviors and the child's emotional health. The most developed paternal mental health literature is focused on depression. However, key conceptual and methodological problems exist that may limit our understanding of paternal depression. Additionally, the focus on paternal depression may not accurately represent the largest risk for paternal psychopathology and the resultant child mental health outcomes because men have an increased likelihood of displaying externalizing behaviors. Implications for research, clinical practice, and policy are discussed.

AB Significant controversy surrounds the efficacy of the newer antidepressants for children and adolescents with depression. The controversy largely hinges on meta-analyses of studies that suggest that antidepressants are minimally effective, not effective, or equivalent to placebo. In this review, the author discusses several scientific and clinical complexities that are important to understand in reviewing the antidepressant literature: the strengths and weaknesses of meta-analyses; the scientific and regulatory context for the large number of antidepressant trials in the late 1990s and early 2000s; and the distinction between a negative trial, where the treatment does not demonstrate efficacy, and a failed trial, where methodological problems make it impossible to draw any conclusion about efficacy. It is the premise of this review that meta-analyses that include the large number of industry-sponsored antidepressant trials distort the picture of antidepressant efficacy for teen depression. Industry-sponsored child and adolescent depression trials suffer from a number of implementation challenges and should be considered failed trials that are largely uninformative and not eligible to be included in efficacy meta-analyses. In contrast to the industry-sponsored trials, depression trials funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) (N=2) are characterized by many methodological strengths, lower placebo response rates (30%-235%), and meaningful between-group differences (25%-230%) that support antidepressant efficacy. The NIMH-funded trials, taken together with the demonstrated efficacy of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors for childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder and the anxiety disorders, suggest a broad and important role for antidepressant medications in pediatric internalizing conditions.

AB Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate atypical processing of, and memory for, self-referenced information, which may contribute to the heightened rates of co-occurring internalizing problems. We assessed affective and cognitive aspects of self-referential processing in verbally-fluent children with ASD (N=79), and an age-matched comparison sample (COM, N=73) of children without an autism diagnosis. We examined group differences in these two aspects of the self-system, and their joint contributions to individual differnces in internalizing problems. Using a self-referenced memory (SRM) task, participants indicated whether a series of positive and negative trait adjectives described themselves and a well-known fictional character. Participants were then surprised with a recognition memory test on the same adjectives. Overall, individuals with ASD showed a reduction in the extent to which they preferentially endorsed positive over negative trait adjectives about themselves, and a reduction in their preferential memory for self-over other-referenced information. Across the full sample, these two aspects of self-referential processing jointly predicted self-reported internalizing problems. Specifically, self-evaluations were strongly and inversely associated with internalizing problems but only for children with relatively high SRM. These findings suggest that the salience of the self influences the extent to which affective self-evaluations impact emotional functioning for youth both with and without ASD. Implications for basic (e.g., developmental) and translational (e.g., intervention) research are discussed. (C) 2016 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Children who have been exposed to maltreatment and other adverse childhood experiences (ACES) are at increased risk for various negative adult health outcomes, including cancer, liver disease, substance abuse, and depression. However, the proximal associations between ACES and behavioral outcomes during the middle childhood years have been understudied. In addition, many of the ACE studies contain methodological limitations such as reliance on retrospective reports and limited generalizability to populations of lower socioeconomic advantage. The current study uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a national urban birth cohort, to prospectively assess the adverse experiences and subsequent behavior problems of over 3000 children. Eight ACE categories to which a child was exposed by age 5 were investigated: childhood abuse (emotional and physical), neglect (emotional and physical), and parental domestic violence, anxiety or depression, substance abuse, or incarceration. Results from bivariate analyses indicated that Black children and children with mothers of low education were particularly likely to have been exposed to multiple ACE categories. Regression analyses showed that exposure to ACES is strongly associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors and likelihood of ADHD diagnosis in middle childhood. Variation in these associations by racial/ethnic, gender, and maternal education subgroups are examined. This study provides evidence that children as young as 9 begin to show behavioral problems after exposure to early childhood adversities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the secondary effects of Behavioral Couples Treatment (BCT) for parents with substance use disorder on youth reports of internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms). Participants were 59 triads (father, mothers, and youth; 32 girls, 27 boys) in which one or both parents met criteria for drug or alcohol use disorder (or both). Mothers, fathers, and youth completed pretreatment, post-intervention, and 6-month post-intervention follow-up assessments. Two piecewise latent growth models examined whether number of sessions attended was associated with parents' relationship satisfaction or its growth over time, and in turn if parents' relationship satisfaction was uniquely associated with youth depressive/anxiety symptoms or their growth over time. A significant indirect effect at post-intervention revealed the number of sessions attended contributed to decreases in youth depressive symptoms via increases in mothers' and fathers' relationship satisfaction. Mothers' relationship satisfaction uniquely mediated the relationship between number of sessions attended and youth depressive symptoms at post-intervention. With regards to fathers, there was a non-significant trend such that increases in sessions attended was associated with decreases in youth depressive symptoms post- intervention via increasing relationship satisfaction among fathers. Findings suggest that BCT may have protective secondary effects in reducing youth reports of depressive symptoms among couples in which one or both parents have substance use disorder.

AB This review provides a comprehensive investigation of the pattern and strength of findings in the literature regarding the environmental moderators of the relationship between exposure to community violence and mental health among children and adolescents. Twenty-nine studies met criteria for inclusion in our analysis of family, school, and community variables as moderators. Dependent variables included internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder) and externalizing symptoms (e.g., aggression, substance use). Effect sizes for the interactions of exposure to violence and potential moderators were summarized by their patterns of protective processes. The majority of studies in the literature examined family characteristics as moderators of the exposure to violence-symptom relationship, rather than school- or community-level factors. Our results indicated more consistent patterns for (a) close family relationships and social support for internalizing symptoms and (b) close family relationships for externalizing symptoms. Overall, the most common type of protective pattern was protective-stabilizing, in which youth with higher levels of the environmental attribute demonstrate relative stability in mental health despite exposure to violence. We found no consistent evidence that parental monitoringa dimension inversely associated with exposure to violence in prior studiesmoderated the relationship between exposure to violence and symptoms. The study emphasizes the importance of strengthening family support for young people's exposure to community violence; more research is needed to provide a solid evidence base for the role of school and community-level protective factors for youth exposed to violence.

AB The extant literature suggests that peer victimization is a risk factor for eating disorders. This study examined the relationships between peer victimization, occurring prior to and during college and three types of eating disorder symptoms (bulimic symptoms, dietary restraint, and drive for muscularity) in undergraduate men and women. Participants completed self-report measures using an online system at two time points approximately eight weeks apart. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed that pre-college peer victimization was associated with higher levels of drive for muscularity and bulimic symptoms. Peer victimization occurring during college predicted increases in all three types of subsequent eating disorder symptoms. Finally, bulimic symptoms, but not dietary restraint or drive for muscularity predicted increases in future peer victimization. The findings expand the understanding of the bidirectional relationship between peer victimization and eating disorder symptoms among college men and women.

AB Objective: The Cool Little Kids parenting group program is an effective intervention for preventing anxiety disorders in young children who are at risk because of inhibited temperament. The program has six group sessions delivered by trained psychologists to parents of 3-to 6 -year -old children. An online adaptation (Cool Little Kids Online) has been developed to overcome barriers to its wide dissemination in the community. This study tested the efficacy of Cool Little Kids Online in a randomized controlled trial.
   Method: A total of 433 parents of a child aged 3 to 6 years with an inhibited temperament were randomized to the online parenting program or to a 24 -week waitlist. The online program has 8 interactive modules providing strategies that parents can implement with their child to manage their child's avoidant coping, reduce parental overprotection, and encourage child independence. Parents were provided telephone consultation support with a psychologist when requested. Parents completed self report questionnaires at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks after baseline.
   Results: The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement over time in child anxiety symptoms compared to the control group (d = 0.38). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in anxiety life interference (ds = 0.33-0.35) and lower rates of anxiety disorders than the control group (40% versus 54%), but there were minimal effects on broader internalizing symptoms or overprotective parenting.
   Conclusion: Results provide empirical support for the efficacy of online delivery of the Cool Little Kids program. Online dissemination may improve access to an evidence based prevention program for child anxiety disorders.

AB BACKGROUND: Late-preterm birth (at 34(0/7)-36(6/7) wk gestation) increases the risk of early growth faltering, poorer neurocognitive functioning, and lower socio-economic attainment. Among early-preterm individuals, faster early growth benefits neurodevelopment, but it remains unknown whether these benefits extend to late-preterm individuals.
   METHODS: In 108 late-preterm individuals, we examined if weight, head, or length growth between birth, 5 and 20 months' corrected age, and 56 mo, predicted grade point average and special education in comprehensive school, or neurocognitive abilities and psychiatric diagnoses/symptoms at 24-26 y of age.
   RESULTS: For every 1 SD faster weight and head growth from birth to 5 mo, and head growth from 5 to 20 mo, participants had 0.19-0.41 SD units higher IQ, executive functioning score, and grade point average (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.002-0.59 SD), and lower odds of special education (odds ratio (OR) = 0.49-0.59, 95% Cls 0.28-0.97), after adjusting for sex, gestational age, follow-up age, and parental education. Faster head growth from 20 to 56 mo was associated with less internalizing problems; otherwise we found no consistent associations with mental health outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: Faster growth during the critical early period after late-preterm birth is associated with better adult neurocognitive functioning, but not consistently with mental health outcomes.

AB Background. Various sources indicate that mental disorders are the leading contributor to the burden of disease among youth. An important determinant of functioning is current mental health status. This study investigated whether psychiatric history has additional predictive power when predicting individual differences in functional outcomes.
   Method. We used data from the Dutch TRAILS study in which 1778 youths were followed from pre-adolescence into young adulthood (retention 80%). Of those, 1584 youths were successfully interviewed, at age 19, using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) to assess current and past CIDI-DSM-IV mental disorders. Four outcome domains were assessed at the same time: economic (e.g. academic achievement, social benefits, financial difficulties), social (early motherhood, interpersonal conflicts, antisocial behavior), psychological (e.g. suicidality, subjective well-being, loneliness), and health behavior (e.g. smoking, problematic alcohol, cannabis use).
   Results. Out of the 19 outcomes, 14 were predicted by both current and past disorders, three only by past disorders (receiving social benefits, psychiatric hospitalization, adolescent motherhood), and two only by current disorder (absenteeism, obesity). Which type of disorders was most important depended on the outcome. Adjusted for current disorder, past internalizing disorders predicted in particular psychological outcomes while externalizing disorders predicted in particular health behavior outcomes. Economic and social outcomes were predicted by a history of co-morbidity of internalizing and externalizing disorder. The risk of problematic cannabis use and alcohol consumption dropped with a history of internalizing disorder.
   Conclusion. To understand current functioning, it is necessary to examine both current and past psychiatric status.

AB Evidence suggests that higher order linguistic functioning such as text comprehension is particularly vulnerable to emotional modulation. Gender has been identified as an important moderating variable in emotional expression such that girls tend toward internalizing emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety) whereas boys tend toward externalizing emotions (e.g., anger, combativeness), which may influence the relationship between emotion and text comprehension. The present study examined whether gender moderates the relationship between emotional-behavioral problems and text comprehension among children (n = 187; boys = 115, girls = 72) with both word reading difficulties (RD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a sample widely acknowledged to be at increased risk for developing emotional-behavioral problems such as anxiety, poor academic self-concept, and delinquency. A moderated regression analysis tested for the significance of two separate interaction terms (i.e., gender x externalizing problems, gender x internalizing problems) after controlling for gender, IQ, basic reading skills, cognitive-linguistic processes closely related to reading, attentional problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Results indicated that gender significantly and uniquely moderates the relationship between emotional-behavioral problems and text comprehension. Specifically, text comprehensionwas relatively lower among girls with relatively higher externalizing problems, whereas no such association was observed among boys. These results contribute to our understanding of cognition-emotion interactions within reading development and raise important implications. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objectives: Considerable evidence suggests maternal psychopathology influences that of their offspring. The probability of a reverse causal pathway has been only rarely considered but is a concern, given around 10% of children manifest mental impairment during their early years. This study determines the extent to which child behavior problems at ages 5 and 14 years are associated with mothers' mental health at 21 years post birth.
   Study design: Longitudinal study.
   Methods: Data were taken from a sample of 3650 women from Mater and University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy birth cohort. Women's mental health was measured using the Mental Disorder Screening Tool at 21 years post birth. The Child Behavior Check List was used to measure internalizing, combined social/attention/thought disorder, and aggression at the age of 5 and 14 years. Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A number of confounders were used to test for independence.
   Results: Following all adjustments, child internalizing behaviors and combined social/ attention/thought disorder at 5 years, and all measures of child behavior problem at 14 years were associated with mothers meeting criteria for mental health impairment at 21 years post birth. Moreover mothers of children with behavior problems at 14 years were approximately 2e3 times more likely to these meet these criteria.
   Conclusions: Mothers of children with behavior problems at 5 and 14 years of age were more likely to have mental health impairment at 21 years post birth. Child health professionals should be cognizant of the motherechild relationship having mutual mental health vulnerability. (C) 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This brief report examines African American children's and caregivers' exposure to stressors and perceived support in relation to children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Forty-six children aged 8 to 12 years and their primary caregivers were recruited from an urban school in the Midwestern United States and interviewed separately. Adjusting for child's age and gender, caregiver's gender, and number of caregivers in the family, child-reported stressful life events were associated with child-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. When children reported greater support from caregivers, children reported fewer externalizing symptoms and caregivers reported fewer oppositional behaviors and ADHD symptoms on the part of their child. Caregivers' health- and relationship-related stressors were associated with child-reported externalizing symptoms, as well as caregiver-reported ADHD symptoms. Family-based mental health services within schools and communities may improve caregiver and child support systems, reduce caregiver-child conflict, and promote resilience to stress among urban, low-income African American families.

AB Background
   Difficult temperament in infancy is a risk factor for forms of later internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, including depression and anxiety. A better understanding of the roots of difficult temperament requires assessment of its early development with a genetically informative design. The goal of this study was to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in infant negative emotionality, their persistence over time and their influences on stability between 5 and 18 months of age.
   Method
   Participants were 244 monozygotic and 394 dizygotic twin pairs (49.7% male) recruited from birth. Mothers rated their twins for negative emotionality at 5 and 18 months. Longitudinal analysis of stability and innovation between the two time points was performed in Mplus.
   Results
   There were substantial and similar heritability (approximately 31%) and shared environmental (57.3%) contributions to negative emotionality at both 5 and 18 months. The trait's inter-individual stability across time was both genetically-and environmentally-mediated. Evidence of innovative effects (i.e., variance at 18 months independent from variance at 5 months) indicated that negative emotionality is developmentally dynamic and affected by persistent and new genetic and environmental factors at 18 months.
   Conclusions
   In the first two years of life, ongoing genetic and environmental influences support temperamental negative emotionality but new genetic and environmental factors also indicate dynamic change of those factors across time. A better understanding of the source and timing of factors on temperament in early development, and role of sex, could improve efforts to prevent related psychopathology.

AB Background: There is a high risk that young children who show early signs of mental health problems develop symptoms in the same or overlapping areas some years later. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is widely used to screen externalizing and internalizing problems early in life. In Sweden 80-90% of all children aged 1-5 years go to preschool and preschool is thus an appropriate context for finding early signs of mental health problems among children.
   Methods: This study is part of a longitudinal project too investigate the frequency of emotional and behavioural problems for children between 1 and 5 years of age in Sweden. The SDQ including the impairment supplement questions were rated by preschool teachers too establish Swedish norms for SDQ in preschool children.
   Results: The sample involved 815 children with a mean age of 42 months (SD = 16, range 13-71 months). 195 children were followed longitudinally for three years. There were significant differences between boys and girls on all subscales except for the Emotional subscale. The prevalence of behavioural problems was similar to other that in European countries, except for Prosocial behaviour, which was rated lower, and Conduct problems, rated higher. Swedish children were estimated to have more problems in the preschool setting, scored by preschool teachers. The development of behaviour over time differed for the different subscales of SDQ.
   Conclusions: The teacher version of the SDQ, for 2-4 year-olds, can be used as a screening instrument to identify early signs of emotional distress/behavioural problems in young children. Preschool teachers seem to be able to identify children with problematic behaviour with the use of SDQ at an early age. The development of behaviour over time differs for the different subscales of SDQ. The Swedish norms for SDQ are to a large extent, similar to findings from other European countries.

AB Few studies have investigated the relationship between post-natal inflammatory biomarkers at early age and child neurodevelopment outcomes. The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-4 cytokines, as well as cortisol at 6 and 12 months of age, and neurodevelopment and psychological problems at 30 months of age.
   The study was conducted on a sample of 51 full-term newborns who were followed up at 6, 12, and 30 months of age. Infant neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II, psychological problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL 1.5-5) and the mother's emotional symptoms were assessed with the General Health Questionnaire-28. When the infants were 6 and 12 months old, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-4 cytokines, and cortisol were measured in blood samples. The results showed that higher IL-6 at 12 months predicted higher scores in internalizing (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, withdrawn and attention problems) and externalizing problems (aggressive behavior) at 30 months. By contrast, high levels of IL-1 beta at 6 months were related to worse motor skills. Inflammatory biomarkers were not related to mental performance. IL-6 and 1-1 beta could be early markers of later psychological problems and psychomotor disabilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Data about psychosocial sequelae of childhood Hematopoietic StemCell Transplantation (HSCT) are limited and the association with a specific donor type or other medical factors is largely unknown (Chang et al., 2012). The aim of the present study was to compare the psychological aspects of pediatric HSCT survivors with healthy peers. A secondary aim was to detect whether parents and children differed in the perception of mental health status. The influence of medical factors on psychological status was also examined.
   Method: Thirty seven HSCT survivors (23 males) with a mean age of 14.4 years (SD = 3.03; range 8.16-18.33) were recruited. Twenty-six patients underwent an allogenic HSCT (matched unrelated donor, n = 20; matched sibling donor, n = 6) and 11 patients received an autologous HSCT. The children psychological aspects were assessed using the Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001) and compared to a group of matched healthy peers. At the same time, parents were requested to complete the Child Behavior Checklist 6- 18 (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). Medical and socio-demographic data were also collected.
   Results: HSCT survivors reported significantly higher levels of somatic complains (t(27) = 3.14; p = 0.004; mean = 3.1) when compared to healthy peers (mean = 1.5). The parent CBCL scores on "child total competence" exceeded the normative clinical cutoff in 48.6% cases. Inter-rater agreement between parent and patient reports was present only in three scales: total competence score (K = 0.06, p = 0.002), somatic complaints (K = 0.21, p = 0.003) and attention problems (k = 0.13; p = 0.02). According to Ancova models, internalizing problems were more frequent in HSCT from family donors (F-2 = 3.13; p = 0.06) or in the presence of acute complications (F-1 = 11.95; p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: In contrast to the perception of parents, pediatric HSCT survivors reported good psychological health. However, they complained about more somatic problems as compared with healthy peers. Medical aspects such as donor source and the presence of acute complications should be taken into consideration for the psychological approach in order to improve pediatric HSCT survivor care.

AB Parenting programs are currently treatment of choice for behavioral disorders in children and one of their main components is reducing the negativity bias in the child-parent dyad. The Rational Positive Parenting Program (rPPP) is a program with a special focus on parent emotion-regulation functional reappraisal strategies, which has recently received consistent support for reducing child externalizing and internalizing disorders. In the last years, online interventions were proliferated and the Attention Bias Modification (ABM) becoming a promising implicit therapeutic intervention based on attention deployment emotion-regulation strategy, or adjunctive module to usual treatments, with results in multiple domains, varying from pain to self-esteem and emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety). We conducted two studies to investigate (1) the efficacy of the ABM procedures applied to parents and (2) the efficacy of the online version of the rPPP augmented with an ABM module. A total of 42 parents of children aged 2-12 years old participated in the first study, being allocated either to the ABM training or wait-list. Positive results were reported by the parents participating in the ABM group for own distress, satisfaction, positive interactions with the child, and child's strengths. In the second study, 53 parents and their children were allocated either in the rPPP group or in the rPPP + ABM group. Results show that ABM training can boost the effects of the rPPP on the strengths of children reported by the parents after the intervention. Findings are discussed in the light of limited research on using online tools for coaching effective emotion-regulation strategies for parents.

AB Consistent with a holistic perspective emphasizing the integration of multiple individual characteristics within child systems, it was hypothesized that subgroups of anxious solitary (AS) children differentiated by agreeable, normal, attention-seeking, and externalizing behaviors would demonstrate enduring heterogeneity in peer relations over the last three years of elementary school, a period of relative ecological stability. Subgroup analyses were conducted with 661 children (mean age in third grade = 8.66 years, 51.6% female) who participated in peer sociometrics in the fall and spring of the third through fifth grades. Recess observations were conducted for a subset of these children (n = 227) once in the third and fourth grades and twice in fifth grade. About half of children retained the same subgroup classification from third through fourth and fifth grades a significant pattern of stability. Results revealed some normative patterns of change (particularly for recess observations) and group-specific patterns of change in peer relations over time. However, the overarching pattern was stability and the preservation of initial between-group differences in peer relations over time. Taken together, results revealed that Agreeable AS children demonstrated significantly superior relational adaptation relative to other AS children, whereas Normative, Attention-seeking, and Externalizing AS children demonstrated successively worse relational adversity. Attention-seeking AS children engaged in particularly high rates of solitary directed behavior and were most ignored by peers. Both Attention-seeking AS and Externalizing AS children were most often victimized by peers.

AB Objective: The present study investigated whether the effects of sleep duration and quality on adolescent adjustment were moderated by perceived attachment to mothers and fathers.
   Design: The study used a cross-sectional design.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from small town and semirural communities in Alabama.
   Participants: Participants were 106 adolescents (mean age = 13.61 years, SD =. 73; 55% girls; 28% African American, 72% European American) and their parents.
   Measurements: Sleep duration (minutes) and sleep quality (efficiency, number of long wake episodes) were derived using actigraphy, and subjective sleep/wake problems were derived with adolescent reports. Adolescents also reported on perceived attachment to mothers and fathers, internalizing symptoms, and self-esteem. Mothers and fathers reported on externalizing behaviors.
   Results: Path model analyses indicated that perceived attachment to parents moderated relations between adolescents' sleep quality and their adjustment. For externalizing symptoms and self-esteem, adolescents at greatest risk for maladjustment were those who reported poor quality sleep (ie, more sleep/wake problems, lower sleep efficiency) coupled with less secure attachment to parents. Conversely, adolescents who experienced better actigraphy-based sleep quality (ie, higher sleep efficiency, fewer long wake episodes) in conjunction with more secure attachment to parents experienced the lowest levels of anxiety symptoms. Less secure attachment was associated with high levels of anxiety symptoms independent of sleep quality. Similar patterns of associations emerged for attachment to mothers and fathers.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of examining the conjoint influence of sleep and adolescent parent relationships toward explication of adolescent's mental health. (C) 2016 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Despite the significant increase in the understanding of the hyperkinetic disorder (HKD), our knowledge of the factors associated with the persistence of the disorder and further development of psychopathology is insufficient. The long-term prospective studies have aimed at identifying factors that may determine the adverse course of HKD.
   Methods: The study group 54 patients (95.1% male) with HKD (mean age 8.1, SD +/- 1.7 years at the baseline assessment) was covered by a 12-year observation (mean age of participants: 19.1 +/- 1.7 years at the end of the study). Subjects were comprehensively assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and assessments of cognitive functions, including the school and family functioning, the treatment as well as internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results: Statistical analysis of the severity of HKD indicated significant reduction in the symptoms after 12 years. The birth complications (OR = 11.187; p = 0.045), chronic conflicts in family (OR = 0.129; p = 0.018) and depression of mother (OR = 6.033; p = 0.045) have proved to be significant risk factors for externalizing disorders in the study group. The single-parent family (OR = 0.099; p = 0.009) and coexistence of mothers' anxiety disorders (OR = 0.318; p = 0.043) were a significant predictors for the model of internalizing disorders. Only 28 (51.9%) of children used regular systematic therapy. Lack of the systematic treatment was a significant risk factor of transition of HKD to antisocial phenotypes (univariate regression model: R = 0.56; SE = 0.12; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Long-term clinical observation showed that the appropriate systematic treatment until adulthood may significantly reduce undesirable behaviours. Completion of the treatment programme should be monitored systematically for many years, which greatly influences the results of school education and increases the chances for correct psychosocial development. Parents' mental disorders/conflicts considerably decrease in the treatment effects, thereby increasing the risk of social maladjustment in patients with HKD.

AB A large body of research has linked relational aggression (RA) to indices of psychosocial and academic maladjustment. Recent work suggests that urban, minority adolescent girls who experience peer aggression are at particularly high risk for negative outcomes, including internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and yet this population has been underrepresented in the literature. Despite the high prevalence of RA, only a small portion of adolescents experience chronic victimization and/or develop serious, lasting effects. Identifying factors which confer vulnerability in the context of RA may have important implications for intervention and prevention. The present study theorized that heavy reliance on experiential avoidance (EA) would be associated with history of RA victimization, and would predict internalizing problems. We also hypothesized that self-reported EA would be positively related to sadness in adolescents who experienced negative mood following an in vivo laboratory-based social exclusion experience. Participants included 58 female adolescents (aged 11-14 years) recruited from urban schools and community centers. Results supported our hypotheses. EA was associated with history of RA victimization, and predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms, even when accounting for history of RA victimization. EA was also a significant predictor of more negative mood following a social exclusion experience, even when accounting for baseline mood. Implications and recommendations for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB Introduction: This observational study explores potential links between obese children's cortisol, and parental mental state, family functioning, and the children's symptoms of anxiety and depression.
   Material and Methods: A non-random sample of 104 obese children (55 boys), mean age 10.9 years (standard deviation 1.76), was recruited from a childhood obesity clinic. Obesity was defined as body mass index above the 95th age-and gender-specific percentiles. Neuroendocrine biomarkers were measured. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with self and parent-reported questionnaires (Anxiety, Depression and Stress Scales; Child Behaviour Checklist). Family functioning was assessed with parent-reported questionnaires (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scales-III).
   Results: A significant, negative correlation (r(s) = -0.779; p = 0.003) between girls' cortisol and their parents' anxiety symptoms was found, limited to high functioning families. Boys scored significantly higher than girls on parent-reported internalizing symptoms but not on self-report. No association was found between cortisol in children and parental depressive symptoms.
   Discussion: Whether the association between cortisol levels in obese children and parental mental health is effectively restricted to girls from high functioning families or is due to study limitations, requires further research. The lack of associations between cortisol in children and parental depressive symptoms, suggests a specific association between cortisol and parental anxiety symptoms.
   Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of taking into account family functioning, parental mental state and gender, when investigating neuroendocrine biomarkers in obese children associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

AB The proportion of adolescent migrants in Germany aged 15-20 years has risen to about 29.5 % in 2014 according to Federal census statistics. The purpose of the current study was to describe and to compare the psychological strains of adolescent 1st and 2nd generation migrants with non-migrants in a representative school survey. Acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was explored and its correlation with psychological strain was analyzed. Self-reported data of psychological strain (internalizing and externalizing problems) and acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity were gathered among 8 518 pupils aged 12-19 years across different school types. Among the surveyed adolescents, 27.6 % reported a migration background (5.8 % 1st generation migrants; 21.8 % 2nd generation migrants). Particularly 1st generation migrants scored higher in internalizing and externalizing problems than 2nd generation migrants or non-migrants. The differences, however, were small. Adolescents with migration background suffered from educational disadvantage, especially 1st generation migrants. Male adolescents reported significantly higher acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms than their female counterparts. Strong agreement with the measured concept of masculinity was found among pupils of lower secondary school and adolescents reported regularly tobacco and cannabis consumption. The acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was greater among migrants, particularly 1st generation migrants, than non-migrants. Overall, high acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was related to externalizing problems, which can be understood as dysfunctional coping mechanisms of social disadvantage and a lack of prospects.

AB Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) symptoms demonstrate a marked persistence over time, but little is known empirically about short-term processes that may account for this long-term persistence. In this study, we examined how self-reported and physiological stress reactivity were associated with persistence of SAD symptoms from early to late adolescence. A community sample of 327 adolescents (56% boys, M-age = 13.01 at T-1) reported their SAD symptoms for 6 successive years and participated in a public speaking task, during which self-reported (i.e., perceived nervousness and heart rate) and physiological (i.e., cortisol and heart rate) measures of stress were taken. Overall, our results point to a developmental process in which adolescents with a developmental history of higher SAD symptoms show both heightened perceived stress reactivity and heart rate reactivity, which, in turn, predict higher SAD symptoms into late adolescence.

AB The present study assessed sleep functioning in Trichotillomania (TIM; Hair-Pulling Disorder) and Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder (ExD), and a non-affected comparison group, and examined the prevalence and correlates of bedtime and sleep-related hair pulling and skin picking. Participants were adult internet survey respondents, who met diagnostic criteria for TIM (N=259), ExD (N=182), or did not meet criteria for these disorders (N=148). Individuals with TTM and ExD endorsed significantly greater sleep disturbance relative to the comparison group, even after controlling for internalizing (anxiety and depression) symptoms. Hair pulling and skin picking severity were not significantly correlated with sleep disturbance after controlling for internalizing symptoms. Pulling and picking during sleep occurred at rates of 13% and 27%, respectively. Picking severity, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance were significantly increased in those who engaged in picking during sleep relative to those who did not endorse this behavior. No significant differences were found between those endorsing pulling during sleep and those not endorsing this on demographic, clinical, or sleep variables. The present study highlights the potential role of sleep disturbance in TTM and ExD, and the need for further research in this area.

SO SLEEP

DT Article
DE obstructive sleep apnea; behavior; CBCL; CHAT
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHILDHOOD; TRIAL
AB Objectives: The childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with behavioral abnormalities. Studies on the effects of OSAS treatment on behavior are conflicting, with few studies using a randomized design. Further, studies may be confounded by the inclusion of behavioral outcome measures directly related to sleep. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of adenotonsillectomy on behavior in children with OSAS. We hypothesized that surgery would improve behavioral ratings, even when sleep symptom items were excluded from the analysis.
   Methods: This was a secondary analysis of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) data, with and without exclusion of sleep-specific items, from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). CBCL was completed by caregivers of 380 children (7.0+1.4 [range 5-9] years) with OSAS randomized to early adenotonsillectomy (eAT) versus 7 months of watchful waiting with supportive care (WWSC).
   Results: There was a high prevalence of behavioral problems at baseline; 16.6% of children had a Total Problems score in the clinically abnormal range. At follow-up, there were significant improvements in Total Problems (p < .001), Internalizing Behaviors (p = .04), Somatic Complaints (p = .01), and Thought Problems (p = .01) in eAT vs. WWSC participants. When specific sleep-related question items were removed from the analysis, eAT showed an overall improvement in Total (p = .02) and Other (p = .01) problems. Black children had less improvement in behavior following eAT than white children, but this difference attenuated when sleep-related items were excluded.
   Conclusions: This large, randomized trial showed that adenotonsillectomy for OSAS improved parent-rated behavioral problems, even when sleep-specific behavioral issues were excluded from the analysis.

AB Background: Children who engage in regular physical activity are protected from developing behavioral problems at home and school, but many children do not have the opportunity to participate in regular physical activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a noncurricular school-based physical activity program resulted in reductions in children's psychological problems in 2 domains: internalizing (eg, depression) and externalizing (eg, aggression) and whether these effects varied according to ethnicity, gender, and baseline psychological symptoms. Methods: One hundred and eleven third-grade students (mean age = 8.47; 55% African American, 42% Latino) from 4 schools participated in the study. Children in 2 schools received the Work to Play physical activity intervention during the study (intervention condition) and children in the other 2 schools did not receive the program until after the study was complete (waitlist control condition). Teachers and parents reported on children's psychological symptoms at baseline and at follow-up approximately 9 months later. Results: Regression analyses showed that children who participated in the program had fewer internalizing symptoms at follow-up. Ethnicity moderated intervention effects with significant decreases in internalizing symptoms for African American, but not Hispanic participants. Neither gender nor baseline psychological symptoms moderated the program's effectiveness. Conclusions: The Work-to-Play intervention program appeared to be effective in reducing internalizing symptoms for ethnic minority participants who are at the greatest risk for psychological problems.

AB In the present study, we examined how unstructured (e.g., spending time with friends or co-workers) and structured (e.g., attending social events at a place of workshop, sports teams) social participation changed from before to after high school for youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as the longitudinal and concurrent relations between social participation and internalizing symptoms. Participants included 36 families of youth with ASD who were all in their last year of high school at the first time point of data collection, and who were out of high school for an average of 9 months at the second time point. Social participation and internalizing symptoms were determined using parental report. There was no average change in the amount of unstructured social participation after high school exit, although substantial individual variability was observed. Participation in structured social activities significantly declined after high school exit. Youth who had more structured social participation while in high school were significantly more likely to have gains in their unstructured social participation after high school exit. Turning to relationships between internalizing and social activities, more internalizing symptoms while youth with ASD were in high school significantly predicted increasing social isolation after high school exit (both in terms of structured and unstructured activities). Results point to the likely need for additional supports during the transition to adulthood for youth with ASD who have internalizing problems. Autism Res2016.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are among the most debilitating psychiatric conditions. Behaviors and traits associated with these disorders can have profound influences on those surrounding the affected individual. Accordingly, researchers have begun to examine effects of these symptoms on parent-child relationships. Theoretical and empirical work suggests that one mechanism linking maternal psychopathology to child symptoms is familial transmission of emotion dysregulation. The authors examined children's emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child behavior problems 1 year later. Analyses revealed that a composite of maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms had a direct effect on child internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms. Associations between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and youth problems were partially mediated by child emotion regulation difficulties, even with maternal depression and other relevant covariates included in the models. Thus, maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child emotion regulation difficulties represent potential targets for prevention of psychopathology among youth.

AB Economic disparities in children's behavioral functioning have been observed in prior research. Yet, studies have ignored important perspectives from developmental psychopathology and have not delineated how aspects of income dynamics (i.e., cumulative family income versus income volatility) differentially relate to behavior problems. To address these limitations, the current study examined how both cumulative income and income volatility predict trajectories of children's internalizing and externalizing problems from kindergarten through fifth grade in a nationally representative sample of 10,900 children (51.4 % male). Results showed four distinct trajectories of internalizing problems and five distinct externalizing trajectories. Family income dynamics were related to trajectory group membership. Specifically, increased cumulative income decreased risk of membership in mid-increasing and mid-stable internalizing groups, and children whose families experienced multiple waves of income loss were 2.4 times as likely to be in the mid-increasing group instead of the low-stable group. With respect to externalizing, higher cumulative income increased the likelihood of belonging in the group exhibiting stably low externalizing problems. Experiencing income loss increased the risk of belonging in the trajectory group exhibiting chronically high externalizing behaviors. These results enhance our knowledge of the role of family income in the development of behavior problems.

AB Maternal depression is a well-documented risk factor for youth depression, and taking into account its severity and chronicity may provide important insight into the degree of risk conferred. This study explored the degree to which the severity/chronicity of maternal depression history explained variance in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms above and beyond current maternal depressive symptoms among 171 youth (58 % male) ages 8 to 12 over a span of 3 years. Severity and chronicity of past maternal depression and current maternal depressive symptoms were examined as predictors of parent-reported youth internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, as well as youth self-reported depressive symptoms. Severity and chronicity of past maternal depression did not account for additional variance in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms at Time 1 beyond what was accounted for by maternal depressive symptoms at Time 1. Longitudinal growth curve modeling indicated that prior severity/chronicity of maternal depression predicted levels of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms at each time point when controlling for current maternal depressive symptoms at each time point. Chronicity of maternal depression, apart from severity, also predicted rate of change in youth externalizing symptoms over time. These findings highlight the importance of screening and assessing for current maternal depressive symptoms, as well as the nature of past depressive episodes. Possible mechanisms underlying the association between severity/chronicity of maternal depression and youth outcomes, such as residual effects from depressive history on mother-child interactions, are discussed.

AB Objective: Symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) have been considered a potential subset of symptoms of ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I), or as a separate but related symptom dimension. We sought to characterize the relationships between SCT and both internalizing symptoms and executive functioning in adults with ADHD. Method: One hundred two adults diagnosed with ADHD completed clinical interviews and clinical rating scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent predictive power of SCT symptoms for executive dysfunction after considering ADHD inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Results: SCT was correlated with ADHD inattentive symptoms and dimensional measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, but not with clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder. SCT was independently predictive of executive function deficits over and above the effects of internalizing and ADHD symptoms. Conclusion: SCT in adults is associated with internalizing symptoms, ADHD inattentive symptoms, and, independently, with executive function deficits, particularly organization and problem solving.

AB Background: Psychopathy research has thus far focused mostly on child, male, and delinquent samples, but the results are most likely non-generalizable to adolescent girls with mental health disorders.Aim: The present study aimed to compare self-rated psychopathic traits between female psychiatric outpatients and girls in the community, and to investigate how psychopathic traits relate to psychiatric disorders.Method: The outpatient sample comprised 163 girls aged 15-17-years recruited from municipal mental health services. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed based on the ICD-10 classification. The community sample comprised 355 girls from secondary, vocational, and high schools. The Youth Psychopathic trait Inventory (YPI) served as a self-assessment tool.Results: Treatment-seeking girls exhibit a more impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle than do girls in the community. Girls with externalizing psychopathology, unlike those with an internalizing disorder, exhibit more deficient affective experience than do girls in the community. Psychopathic traits associate with having a psychiatric disorder, a depressive disorder, ADHD, and a conduct disorder.Conclusions: The psychiatric examination of treatment-seeking adolescent girls would likely benefit from screening for psychopathy and its underlying components.

AB Objective: Individuals' lay beliefs about mental health problems and attitudes toward mental health care are thought to be influenced by the cultural background of these individuals. In the current study, we investigated differences between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents and adolescents in lay beliefs about emotional problems and attitudes toward mental health care. Additionally, among immigrant Dutch parents, we examined the associations between acculturation orientations and lay beliefs about emotional problems as well as attitudes toward mental health care. Method: In total, 349 pairs of parents and their adolescent children participated in our study (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese-Dutch, 87 Turkish-Dutch, 82 Moroccan-Dutch). A vignette was used to examine participants' lay beliefs. Results: Immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents differed in their lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care, whereas hardly any differences were revealed among their children. Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch parents showed more passive and fewer active solutions to emotional problems compared to native Dutch parents. Additionally, Moroccan-Dutch and Surinamese-Dutch parents reported greater fear of mental health care compared to native Dutch parents. Furthermore, the results showed that immigrant Dutch parents who were more strongly oriented toward the Dutch culture reported less fear of mental health care. Conclusion: Our results showed clear differences in lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents but not between their children. Substantial differences were also found between parents from different immigrant Dutch populations as well as within the population of immigrant Dutch parents.

AB Children and adolescents with mental health problems need effective and safe therapies to support their emotional and social development and to avoid functional impairment and progress of social deficits. Though psychotropic drugs seem to be the preferential treatment, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions are essential in mental health care. For Germany, current data on the utilization of psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions in children with mental health problems is lacking. To analyse why certain children and adolescents with mental or behavioural disorders do and others do not receive non-drug treatment, we assessed predictors associated with specific non-drug psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment including psychosocial interventions, psychotherapy and other non-drug treatments. The study is based on data of two large German health insurance funds, AOK and TK, comprising 30 % of the German child and adolescent population. Predictors of non-drug psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment were analysed for 23,795 cases and two controls for every case of the same age and sex in children aged 0-17 years following a new diagnosis of mental or behavioural disorder in 2010. Predictors were divided according to Andersen's behavioural model into predisposing, need and enabling factors. The most prominent and significant predictors positively associated with non-drug psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment were the residential region as predisposing factor; specific, both ex- and internalizing, mental and behavioural disorders, psychiatric co-morbidity and psychotropic drug use as need factors; and low area deprivation and high accessibility to outpatient physicians and inpatient institutions with non-drug psychiatric/psychotherapeutic department as enabling factors. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the residential region as proxy for supply of therapist and socioeconomic situation is an influencing factor for the use of psychotherapy. The analysis sheds further light on predisposing, need and enabling factors as predictors of non-drug psychotherapeutic/psychiatric treatment in children and adolescents with mental or behavioural health disorders in Germany. More research is needed to further understand the factors promoting the gap between the need and utilization of mental health care.

AB Youth with depression are theorized to generate stress in their lives because of a complex interaction between their personal characteristics and their chronic environmental context. Using a moderated regression approach, we provided a novel test of this hypothesis by examining whether adolescent 5-factor model personality traits moderate the associations between early emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment and life events experienced in the past 6 months. Participants in this cross-sectional study were 110 adolescents (M = 16.24, SD = 1.53, age range = 13-17, 74.5% female) with major depressive disorder. The relation of physical maltreatment to dependent interpersonal life events was moderated by extraversion. Among physically maltreated youth, dependent interpersonal events were positively associated with extraversion. Further, the relation of sexual maltreatment to independent events were moderated by extraversion and agreeableness. Among sexually maltreated youth, independent events were negatively associated with extraversion and positively associated with agreeableness. The observed vulnerability-risk interactions are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of stress generation mechanisms in an integrated model of depression.

AB Emotion regulation is assumed to play an important role in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. However, the role of core components of emotion regulation, such as emotional awareness, is not well understood so far. Thus this meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with emotional awareness in youth. A systematic literature search (PsycINFO, Medline, Google Scholar) identified 21 studies, from which 34 effect sizes were extracted. Results from random effects models showed that difficulties in emotional awareness were significantly correlated with a medium effect size for each, depressive and anxiety symptoms separately, and for their combined effects (overall outcome). Additionally, further analyses revealed that age was a significant moderator of the relationship between emotional awareness with depressive and anxiety symptoms, with younger samples (mean age <= 12 years) showing a stronger association between difficulties in emotional awareness and depressive and anxiety symptoms as compared to older samples (mean age > 12 years). The results suggest that emotional awareness may be of relevance for depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. Future work is required to examine longitudinal developments, moderators, and mediators in multi-method approaches. Moreover, children and adolescents may benefit from interventions that aim to enhance emotional awareness.

AB Several studies examining alcohol use and depression in youth have focused on documenting prevalence of overlap, or temporal ordering in longitudinal samples. Fewer studies have examined pathways connecting alcohol use and depression over time. This study examined gender differences between depression and alcohol use across adolescence while examining peer and family pathways as possible mediators of effects. Data was collected longitudinally from 593 families from three urban public middle schools in the United States. Participants were recruited in 6th grade and followed through 9th grade. We examined gender differences using a nested model comparison approach. Results indicated the association between depression and alcohol use differs by gender. For males, depression and alcohol use were independent across adolescence, and no significant indirect pathways were observed. For females, bidirectional effects were found between alcohol use and depression, as well as an indirect effect from depression to alcohol use via peer deviance.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience internalizing and externalizing problems at higher rates than typically developing children, which could worsen social impairment. The present study compared impairment scores (social responsiveness scale, 2nd edition; SRS-2 scores) in 57 children (3-17 years, 82.5% male) with ASD, either with or without heightened levels of anxiety or ADHD symptoms, all per parent report. Children with heightened anxiety problems showed higher scores on four SRS-2 subscales (Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior). Children with heightened ADHD traits showed higher scores on two subscales (Social Communication and Social Awareness). These findings suggest similarities and differences in how social deficits in ASD may worsen with anxiety or ADHD symptoms.

AB The objective of this study was to examine whether mother, father, and closest grandparent involvement are associated with South African adolescents' mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems and prosocial behavior) and substance use. A sample of 512 Grade 8 and Grade 9 learners in Cape Town (M age = 14 years) completed a structured survey. Of the participants, 57% were female, and 85% identified themselves as colored (mixed race). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses, controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status, indicated that mother and father involvement were negatively associated with adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas mother and closest grandparent involvement were positively associated with prosocial behavior. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses revealed that parent involvement was negatively associated with past-month cigarette use, but not with past-month alcohol or past-year marijuana use. The findings suggest the importance of considering parents and grandparents in interventions to promote adolescent mental health.

AB Research shows that interparental conflict is positively associated with internalizing behaviors in children and adolescents, but few have considered these associations among young adults. This study uses the cognitive-contextual framework to explore whether appraisals of threat and self-blame explain the expected associations between interparental conflict and internalizing symptoms in a sample of young adults. Perceptions of interparental conflict, appraisals of threat and self-blame, and two aspects of internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety) were measured in 255 undergraduates (ages 18-21) at two Midwestern universities. Parallel mediation models demonstrated an indirect pathway through threat to depressive symptoms. In contrast, the indirect pathway through self-blame was supported when predicting anxiety. The importance of considering interparental conflict and its psychological consequences during young adulthood is discussed.

AB Children of immigrant background, despite problems with acculturation, poverty, and discrimination, have better mental health than children of native parents. We asked whether this is a result of immigrant families' characteristics such as family structure and relations. Using a new comparative study on the integration of immigrant-background youth conducted in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (N= 18,716), particularly strong associations with mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems) were found for family structure, family cohesion, and parental warmth. Overall, half of the advantage in internalizing and externalizing problems among immigrant-background youth could be accounted for by our measures of family structure and family relations, with family cohesion being particularly important.

AB Objective To examine the associations of peer victimization with internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, social competence, and academic performance in a clinical sample of adolescents with severe obesity, and whether self-worth and social support affect these associations. Methods Multisite cross-sectional data from 139 adolescents before weight loss surgery (M-age = 16.9; 79.9% female, 66.2% White; M-Body Mass Index [BMI] = 51.5 kg/m(2)) and 83 nonsurgical comparisons (M-age = 16.1; 81.9% female, 54.2% White; MBMI = 46.9 kg/m(2)) were collected using self-reports with standardized measures. Results As a group, participants did not report high levels of victimization. Self-worth mediated the effects of victimization on a majority of measures of adjustment, and further analyses provided evidence of the buffering effect of social support for some mediational models. Conclusions Self-worth and social support are important targets for prevention and intervention for both victimization and poor adjustment in adolescent severe obesity.

AB Gendered interpersonal processes may explain the elevated rates of internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls relative to boys. Two such processes are peer social rejection and social support. The current study assessed for gender differences in the effect of 7th grade peer social rejection on 10th grade internalizing symptoms, as well as the moderating effects of social support from family and from friends in a sample of 749 (49 % female) Mexican American adolescents, an understudied population with a unique social culture. Peer social rejection significantly predicted increased internalizing symptoms for girls. Although buffering effects of social support were not found, there were significant moderating effects of both sources of support for boys, such that at low levels of social support, peer social rejection was associated with decreased internalizing symptoms, and at high levels of social support, peer social rejection was associated with increased internalizing symptoms. The results help unpack the nuances of the interpersonal processes that lead to differential adjustment for adolescent boys and girls at this critical developmental stage.

AB The effects of video games on children's psychosocial development remain the focus of debate. At two timepoints, 1 year apart, 194 children (7.27-11.43 years old; male = 98) reported their gaming frequency, and their tendencies to play violent video games, and to game (a) cooperatively and (b) competitively; likewise, parents reported their children's psychosocial health. Gaming at time one was associated with increases in emotion problems. Violent gaming was not associated with psychosocial changes. Cooperative gaming was not associated with changes in prosocial behavior. Finally, competitive gaming was associated with decreases in prosocial behavior, but only among children who played video games with high frequency. Thus, gaming frequency was related to increases in internalizing but not externalizing, attention, or peer problems, violent gaming was not associated with increases in externalizing problems, and for children playing approximately 8 h or more per week, frequent competitive gaming may be a risk factor for decreasing prosocial behavior. We argue that replication is needed and that future research should better distinguish between different forms of gaming for more nuanced and generalizable insight.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an abbreviated, classroom-based, teacher-taught Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program as an intervention to improve mental health in adolescents. In a group-randomized controlled trial, students (N = 586, age 14-21) were nested within 34 classes, which were in turn nested within 14 schools. Individual classes were randomly assigned to either a four-session ACT program or a usual-curriculum control condition. Students were assessed using questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment, and a 12-month follow-up. Questionnaires assessed quality of life, internalizing and externalizing problems, thought and attention problems, and psychological inflexibility. Hierarchical linear modeling showed no significant improvements on any of the outcome measures compared with the control group. No substantive effect sizes for ACT across time were observed. These findings failed to support ACT in the format that was used in this current study, which was as an abbreviated, classroom-based, teacher-taught program to improve mental health for all students. We had a large sample and many outcome variables, but failed to find any statistically significant effects or substantive effect sizes. In this study, ACT was delivered by teachers as opposed to mental health professionals, so it is possible that professionally trained therapists are needed for ACT to be efficacious.

AB CONTEXT: Preterm birth increases the risk for mental disorders in adulthood, yet findings on abstract self-reported or subclinical mental health problems are mixed.
   OBJECTIVE: To study self-reported mental health problems among adults born preterm at very low birth weight (VLBW; <= 1500 g) compared with term controls in an individual participant data meta-analysis.
   DATA SOURCES: Adults Born Preterm International Collaboration.
   STUDY SELECTION: Studies that compared self-reported mental health problems using the Achenbach Young Adult Self Report or Adult Self Report between adults born preterm at VLBW (n = 747) and at term (n = 1512).
   DATA EXTRACTION: We obtained individual participant data from 6 study cohorts and compared preterm and control groups by mixed random coefficient linear and Tobit regression.
   RESULTS: Adults born preterm reported more internalizing (pooled beta =.06; 95% confidence interval.01 to.11) and avoidant personality problems (.11;.05 to.17), and less externalizing (-.10;-. 15 to-. 06), rule breaking (-.10;-. 15 to-. 05), intrusive behavior (-.14;-. 19 to-.09), and antisocial personality problems (-.09;-. 14 to-.04) than controls. Group differences did not systematically vary by sex, intrauterine growth pattern, neurosensory impairments, or study cohort.
   LIMITATIONS: Exclusively self-reported data are not confirmed by alternative data sources.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of adults born preterm at VLBW reveal a heightened risk for internalizing problems and socially avoidant personality traits together with a lowered risk for externalizing problem types. Our findings support the view that preterm birth constitutes an early vulnerability factor with long-term consequences on the individual into adulthood.

AB Elucidating the complex mechanisms by which harsh parenting increases risk of child psychopathology is key to targeted prevention. This requires nuanced methods that capture the varied perceptions and experiences of diverse families. The Family Socialization Interview-Revised (FSI-R), adapted from an interview developed by Dodge et al. (Child Development, 65, 649-665, 1994), is a comprehensive, semi-structured interview for characterizing methods of parental discipline used with young children. The FSI-R coding system systematically rates parenting style, usual discipline techniques, and most intense physical and psychological discipline based on rater judgment across two eras: (1) birth to the previous year, and (2) the previous year to present. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the FSI-R in a diverse, high-risk community sample of 386 mothers and their children, ages 3 to 6 years. Interrater reliability was good to excellent for codes capturing physically and psychologically harsh parenting, and restrictive/punitive parenting styles. Findings supported the FSI-R's convergent and incremental validity. Importantly, the FSI-R demonstrated incremental utility, explaining unique variance in children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms beyond that explained by traditional surveys and observed parenting. The FSI-R appeared particularly promising for capturing risk associated with young children's depressive symptoms, as these were generally not significantly associated with other measures of harsh parenting. Overall, findings support the added value of the FSI-R within a multi-method assessment of disciplinary practices across early child development. Future implications for prevention are discussed.

AB Past research suggests that exposure to parent psychological control and peer relational aggression and victimization experienced during adolescence is associated with relational intimate partner violence (IPV) in young adults (ages 22 to 29). However, the effects of continuities in these concerns across young adulthood have not been assessed. Relational IPV is characterized by behaviors intended to damage partner's emotional well-being and security in a romantic relationship (e.g., threatening to break up, purposefully ignoring, or causing jealousy). Six waves of data were collected biennially across 10 years from 662 participants (342 females) who were 12 to 18 years old in 2003. The 334 youth who were in a current romantic relationship at the sixth wave (T6, 10 years later) are the focus of this research. Tests of hypothesized structural equation models indicated that adolescent experiences of psychological control with fathers (but not mothers) predicted relational IPV at T6, but this association was no longer significant after accounting for continuity in father psychological control in young adulthood. Adolescent experiences of relational aggression and victimization with peers also predicted relational IPV at T6. This association remained significant for males, only, after continuity in experiences of relational aggression and victimization with peers in young adulthood was included in the model. Implications for the prevention of relational IPV in adolescence and young adults are discussed.

   Externalizing problems; Internalizing problems
ID PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; ABUSE; IMPACT; TRIAL
AB Research examining children with sexual behavior problems (SBP) almost exclusively relies on caregiver reports. The current study, involving a sample of 1112 children drawn from a prospective study, utilizes child self-reports and teacher reports, as well caregiver-reports. First, analyses examined children displaying any SBP; a second set of analyses specifically examined children displaying interpersonal forms of SBP. Caregivers reported greater internalizing, externalizing, and social problems for children with general SBP and/or interpersonal SBP when compared to children without SBP. Caregiver concerns were rarely corroborated by teacher and child reports. Protective services records indicated that SBP was linked to childhood sexual abuse, but sexual abuse occurred in the minority of these cases. Physical abuse was more common among children with interpersonal forms of SBP. The data in the current study suggest the need for multiple reporters when assessing children presenting with SBP and that conventional views of these children may be misleading.

AB Use of valid, affordable, accessible, and brief measures facilitates the assessment of mental health outcomes. The Child and Adolescent Behavior Assessment Scale, a brief, structured scale, assesses problem behavior through patient and/or informant report. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the scale's psychometric properties. In the cross-sectional study presented, a large national sample of youth (aged 5-18) admitted for psychiatric treatment (N = 32,689) was examined. The two major domains of problem behavior assessed were Internalizing and Externalizing. Reliability was good to excellent with alpha levels ranging from 0.874 to 0.917. Additional items measured Risk Behavior (alpha = 0.648). Subscale total scores correlated well with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children, 9-item version (BPRS-C-9). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the three-factor, multidimensional model of problem behavior as satisfactory for child and adolescent use, although further research is required to refine some items for clarity and improved model fit.

AB This study investigated the associations between stressful family life events and adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and the interactive effects of family life events and cortisol reactivity on problem behaviors. In a sample of 100 mothers and their adolescents (M age = 15.09; SD age = .98; 68 % girls), adolescent cortisol reactivity was measured in response to a mother-adolescent conflict interaction task designed to elicit a stress response. Mothers reported on measures of family life events and adolescent problem behaviors. Results indicated that a heightened adolescent cortisol response moderated the relations between stressful family life events and both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results support context-dependent theoretical models, suggesting that for adolescents with higher cortisol reactivity (compared to those with lower cortisol reactivity), higher levels of stressful family life events were associated with greater problem behaviors, whereas lower levels of stressful family life events were related to fewer problem behaviors.

AB This study evaluates the associations among the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavioral disorders (DBD) in the context of their relationships with reactive-proactive aggression and anxiety sensitivity in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The sample consisted of 342 treatment-naive children with ADHD. The severity of ADHD and DBD symptoms were assessed via parent-and teacher-rated inventories. Anxiety sensitivity, reactive-proactive aggression and severity of anxiety and depression symp-toms of children were evaluated by self-report inventories. According to structural equation modeling, depression and anxiety scores had a relation with the DBD scores through reactive-proactive aggression. Results also showed a negative relation of the total scores of anxiety sensitivity on DBD scores, while conduct disorder scores had a positive relation with anxiety scores. This study suggests that examining the relations of reactive-proactive aggression and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing and externalizing disorders could be useful for understanding the link among these disorders in ADHD.

AB Although there is evidence that environmental consequences for displaying tics and internalizing symptoms are related to tic severity in children with TS, less is known about the inter-relationships of these variables or how these factors jointly contribute to tic severity. This study included 45 children with Tourette syndrome. Caregivers reported on children's environmental consequences for displaying tics, internalizing symptoms, and tic severity. Results indicated that children with higher levels of internalizing symptoms experienced significantly more environmental consequences for displaying tics. Children with higher levels of separation anxiety symptoms demonstrated significantly greater tic severity. Environmental consequences for displaying tics accounted for significantly more variance in predicting tic severity than anxiety symptoms. This preliminary evidence suggests that environmental consequences for displaying tics, such as receiving accommodations or attention from others, have a greater influence on children's tic severity than emotional factors.

AB Selective mutism refers to a persistent and debilitating condition in which a child fails or refuses to speak in public situations. Research on treatment for selective mutism has progressed in recent years toward a more personalized model based on clinical profiles unique to a given child. Such profiles may include aspects of anxiety, oppositional behaviors, and communication problems as well as operant factors that maintain selective mutism. The present case represents a 6-year-old child with selective mutism with a multifaceted clinical profile that included internalizing and externalizing behavior problems with multiple operant factors. Initial personalized individual therapy focused on anxiety and contingency management procedures to address school refusal behavior and to lay the groundwork for later treatment of selective mutism. Group therapy with parent and child components focused on these procedures in more detail in addition to social skills development. Each component included detailed hierarchies for increasing frequency and audibility of speech in a clinic setting as well as in community and school settings.

AB Self-control may act as a protective factor against the development of internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents. However, little research has examined how self-control functions within and across different types of communities. Using two cohorts from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (N = 1,072; 51.40% female), we examined how self-control and neighborhood characteristics were independently and jointly associated with these behaviors. Using latent profile analysis, we categorized neighborhoods based on several characteristics known to be associated with youth outcomes, including violence, concentrated disadvantage, and collective efficacy. Then we examined how self-control was associated with youth internalizing and externalizing problems within and across neighborhoods. Results suggest that self-control was a protective feature in only some types of disadvantaged and dangerous neighborhoods. We discuss findings in terms of implications for programs and policies to support youth mental health.

AB The most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence are anxiety disorders. Temperament in early childhood, parental psychopathology, and genetic disposition play a central role in the development of anxiety. Aspects of emotion regulation and abnormalities of attachment patterns are increasingly the topics of discussion. Anxiety disorders often occur in combination with internalizing disorders (e.g., depression) as well as externalizing behavior (e.g., aggression). A transdiagnostic approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders appears to be especially promising.

AB Although it has been shown that anxiety disorders (AD) are often found in children and juveniles with a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD; i.e., conduct disorder [CD] and oppositional defiant disorder [ODD]), research in this field is limited. The few papers that addressed this topic found indications for both positive and negative effects of AD on the course and treatment of DBD. The objective of the current study was to examine mental health problems, traumatic experiences, psychopathic traits, and offending behavior in juveniles and emerging adults with DBD with AD compared with those without AD. The total sample contained 207 children, adolescents, and emerging adults (age 9-25, 73.4% males) with DBD with AD (N = 27) and with DBDwithout AD (N= 180) in residential youth care institutions in Switzerland between 2007 and 2011. Half of the sample was placed under civil law (50.5%), 37.8% under penal law, and 11.7% for other reasons (e.g., voluntarily). Psychopathologywas examined with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), a semistructured interview for mental disorders. In addition, mental health problems were assessed using the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-second version (MAYSI-2), traumatic experiences with the Essener Trauma-Inventar (ETI), and psychopathic traits using the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI). Finally, conviction rateswere requested at the Federal Statistical Office. Results showed that the group with DBD and AD comprised significantly more female subjects than did the DBDwithout AD group, 48.1% vs. 77.2%;.2(1, N = 207) = 10.17, p < 0.01. Both groups did not differ on age, time of measure, drop-out, or previous placements. Furthermore, the DBD with AD group had significantly less additional externalizing disorders than the group without AD, 11.1% vs. 38.3%;.2(1, N= 207) = 7.67, p < 0.01. No significant differences between both groups were found for internalizing disorders or substance use disorders. The DBD with AD group, however, reported significantly more depressed-anxious problems, t (231) = -2.19, p =.030, somatic complaints t(231) = -3.34, p = .001, and suicide ideation, t(231) = -2.13, p = .034, as well as more traumatic experiences, 100.0% vs. 83.0%;chi 2(1, N = 207) = 4.39, p = 0.04, than did the DBD groupwithout AD. Finally, no differences were found between the two groups for psychopathic traits and both conviction and reconviction rates. The results of the current study demonstrate that although the group of juveniles with DBD and AD in residential youth care institutions in Switzerland is burdened differently than those juveniles with DBD without AD (fewer externalizing problems, more traumatic experiences, more internalizing problems), they are not at increased or decreased risk for being convicted or reconvicted. More longitudinal research, however, is needed to understand the relationship between DBD and comorbid AD.

AB Secular trends refer to increasing or decreasing mental health problems over time. For the German-speaking area, studies on this subject are rare, especially those concerning changes in the magnitude of anxiety. The three available German studies show a mixed pattern regarding an increase in scores of internalizing problems. In two of those studies, anxiety was assessed confounded with features of depression. The goal of the present study was to use a measure that specifically taps anxiety in order to examine a change in anxiety scores over a period of 42 years. We analyzed norm data of a German self-report questionnaire of anxiety (AFS; Wieczerkowski et al., 1974, 2016) that measures test anxiety (subscale " Prufungsangst"), manifest anxiety (subscale " Manifeste Angst"), school reluctance (subscale " Schulunlust"), as well as social desirability (subscale " Soziale Erwunschtheit"). The norm sample of 1974 consisted of 2,374 children and adolescents (49% girls, aged 9-17) and the sample of 2016 comprised 2,267 children and adolescents (50% girls, aged 9-17). Results show that the mean scales scores on test anxiety and manifest anxiety are significantly lower in the 2016 sample than in the 1974 sample. However, effect sizes are small in test anxiety (d = 24) and negligible in manifest anxiety (d =.09). Interestingly, children and adolescents in the 2016 sample scored significantly higher on school reluctance and social desirability. Here the difference reached a small-to-medium (school reluctance; d = -. 39) and a medium effect (social desirability, d = -. 45). Thus, children and adolescents reported, on one hand, that they have less test anxiety; on the other hand, they dislike school more and tend more to present themselves in a positive manner. In absolute numbers, the discrepancies are relatively small: On average, the ratings in test anxiety are about one point lower, and the ratings in school reluctance as well as in social desirability are about one point higher. Over the period of 42 years, no or only a slight decrease in the anxiety scores can be found. In light of the growing aspiration toward achieving better grades seen over the past decades, we originally expected that children and adolescents in the 2016 sample would score higher in test anxiety than the participants in the 1974 sample. The contradictory result could be explained by the increase in school reluctance and social desirability. Children and adolescents of 2016 may compensate for higher expectations that usually result in higher anxiety with higher school displeasure and social desirability.

AB Recent clinical and theoretical research in the field of developmental psychopathology has focused on the importance of interactions in a child's development. The literature has investigated how children's early relationships contribute to the structure and expression of any subsequent psychological problems. The main focus of this pilot study is the application of the Lausanne Trilogue Play paradigm as part of psychodiagnostic assessments to elucidate family functioning in clinical settings. The research aims particularly to observe the characteristics of a family's interactions in the light of their child's psychopathological symptoms, based on a sample of 38 families with school-age children referred to a Neuropsychiatry Unit for Children and Adolescents for emotional or behavioral problems. The children's psychopathological symptoms were assessed by administering the Child Behavior Check List to their parents. Triadic family interactions were observed using the Lausanne Trilogue Play procedure. Statistically significant relationships emerged between the family's interaction patterns and the child's externalizing and internalizing problems, suggesting an interdependence between these relational and individual factors in the development of the young person's psychopathology. The clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Objective: Irritable mood is common in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Research to date has primarily comprised cross-sectional studies; thus, little is known about the antecedents of irritability. Furthermore, existing cross-sectional studies generally focus on the association between irritability and comorbidities and do not examine broader aspects of functioning. Finally, previous research has neglected to include child-report of irritability. This study aimed to address these gaps using data from a longitudinal study of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   Method: Children aged 5-13 years (mean = 10.2; standard deviation =1.9) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were recruited from pediatric practices across Victoria, Australia. This study reports on those who had reached adolescence (1 2 years or older, mean= 13.8; standard deviation= 1.2) at the 3-year follow-up (n= 140). Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. At follow-up, parent-reported and adolescent self reported irritability was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index. Parent and adolescent outcomes measured at follow-up included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity, sleep, behavior and parent mental health.
   Results: Children with externalizing problems at age 10 had higher parent-reported irritability (beta=0.31, 95% confidence interval = [0.17,-0.45], p= 0.001) in adolescence. Cross-sectional analyses found that irritability was associated with increased attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity and sleep problems; poorer emotional, behavioral and social functioning; and poorer parent mental health.
   Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of assessing for and managing early conduct problems in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as these predict ongoing irritability which, in turn, is associated with poorer functioning across a number of domains.

AB In preparation for the World Health Organization's development of the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) chapter on Mental and Behavioral Disorders, this article reviews the literature pertaining to severe irritability in child and adolescent psychopathology. First, research on severe mood dysregulation suggests that youth with irritability and temper outbursts, among other features of hyperactivity and arousal, demonstrate cross-sectional correlates and developmental outcomes that distinguish them from youth with bipolar disorder. Second, other evidence points to an irritable dimension of Oppositional Defiant Disorder symptomatology, which is uniquely associated with concurrent and subsequent internalizing problems. In contrast to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' (5th ed.) Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, our review of the literature supports a different solution: a subtype, Oppositional Defiant Disorder with chronic irritability/anger (proposal included in Appendix). This solution is more consistent with the available evidence and is a better fit with global public health considerations such as harm/benefit potential, clinical utility, and cross-cultural applicability. Implications for assessment, treatment, and research are discussed. (C) 2017 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In present study, we examined the protective role of peer acceptance in the links between two subtypes of social withdrawal (shyness, unsociability) and indices of young children's socio-emotional functioning. Participants were N = 112 Italian preschool children (n = 54 boys) aged 36-74 months (M = 56.85 months, SD = 10.14). Multi-source assessments included: (1) parental ratings of children's shyness and unsociability; (2) teacher ratings of children's internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social competence; (3) child interview assessments of preference for solitary play; and (4) peer (sociometric) ratings of peer acceptance. Among the results, shyness was associated with internalizing problems at preschool, whereas unsociability was related to a preference for solitary play. In addition, results from multiple regression analyses indicated significant interactions between peer acceptance and both shyness and unsociability in the association with indices of socio-emotional functioning. For example, at lower levels of peer acceptance, shyness was positively related to children's preference for solitary play, whereas children's unsociability was associated with externalizing problems. In contrast, these relations were attenuated at higher levels of peer acceptance. Findings are discussed in term of the potential protective role of young children's peer acceptance for different subtypes of social withdrawal during early childhood.

AB Research has demonstrated the importance of early family characteristics, such as the quality of caregiving, on children's later mental health. Information is, however, needed about the role of more holistic family systems and specific child-related socioemotional mechanisms. In this study, we conceptualize families as dynamic family system types, consisting of both marital and parenting trajectories over the transition to parenthood. First, we examine how early family system types predict children's anxiety, depression, peer exclusion, and emotion regulation. Second, we test whether couples' infertility history and other family related contextual factors moderate the effects of family system types on child outcomes. Third, we test whether children's emotion regulation and peer exclusion mediate the effects of family system types on anxiety and depression. The participants were 452 families representing cohesive, distant, authoritative, enmeshed, and discrepant family types, identified on the basis of relationship autonomy and intimacy from pregnancy to the child's age of 2 and 12 months. Children's anxiety, depression, emotion regulation, and peer exclusion were assessed at the age of 7-8 years. Structural equation modeling showed that distant, enmeshed, and discrepant families similarly predicted children's heightened anxiety and depression. Infertility history, parental education, and parity moderated the associations between certain family system types and child outcomes. Finally, emotion regulation, but not peer exclusion, was a common mediating mechanism between distant and enmeshed families and children's depression. The results emphasize the importance of early family environments on children's emotion regulation development and internalizing psychopathology.

AB This study clarifies within-family and between-family links between marital functioning and child well-being. Expanding on existing prospective research, this study tests whether changes in parents' marital functioning are associated with corresponding changes in their children's well-being, independent from associations that exist when comparing different families. Participants (N= 1,033) were members of married, opposite-sex couples with children who participated in five waves of a larger study of marriage in the U.S. Army. Spouses' constructive communication, verbal conflict, and marital satisfaction each showed between-family associations with parent-reported child internalizing and externalizing problems. In contrast, within-family associations were significant only for parents' communication behaviors. That is, parents who reported lower levels of marital satisfaction also reported lower child well-being, whereas change in parents' communication was associated with change in child well-being over time. Isolating within-family effects is important for understanding marital and child functioning and for identifying potential targets for effective intervention.

AB Little research has examined the effect of subtypes of social withdrawal on the development of psychopathology across childhood.
   Parents of 493 children (220 females) completed a measure of their child's conflicted shyness and social disinterest as well as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) when their child was age 3, and again at age 6. When children were age 9, parents completed the CBCL. From 3 to 6, conflicted shyness predicted increases in anxiety symptoms in boys and girls, and predicted depressive symptoms in boys.
   From 6 to 9, social disinterest predicted increases in anxiety symptoms in girls and boys, and predicted increases in depressive symptoms in boys. In addition, in boys, conflicted shyness at age 6 predicted increases in externalizing symptoms at age 9.
   Conflicted shyness appears to be particularly problematic in early to middle childhood, while social disinterest appears to be more maladaptive in later childhood, with some differences by gender. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Child abuse exerts a deleterious impact on a broad array of mental health outcomes. However, the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate this association remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a longitudinal design to prospectively identify neural mediators of the association between child abuse and psychiatric disorders in a community sample of adolescents.
   Method: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and assessments of mental health were acquired for 51 adolescents (aged 13-20; M=16.96; SD=1.51), 19 of whom were exposed to physical or sexual abuse. Participants were assessed for abuse exposure (time 1), participated in MRI scanning and a diagnostic structured interview (time 2), and 2 years later were followed-up to assess psychopathology (time 3). We examined associations between child abuse and neural structure, and identified whether abuse-related differences in neural structure prospectively predicted psychiatric symptoms.
   Results: Abuse was associated with reduced cortical thickness in medial and lateral prefrontal and temporal lobe regions. Thickness of the left and right parahippocampal gyrus predicted antisocial behavior symptoms, and thickness of the middle temporal gyrus predicted symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Thickness of the left parahippocampal gyrus mediated the longitudinal association of abuse with antisocial behavior.
   Conclusion: Child abuse is associated with widespread disruptions in cortical structure, and these disruptions are selectively associated with increased vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Identifying predictive biomarkers of vulnerability following childhood maltreatment may uncover neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking environmental experience with the onset of psychopathology.

AB Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder that can affect individuals across their lifespan. It is characterized by the core symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. ADHD develops as a result of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Children and adults with ADHD usually suffer concomitantly from other psychiatric comorbidities, including both externalizing and internalizing disorders. It is associated with functional impairment and poor long-term outcomes. This review aims to summarize the key findings from recent research into ADHD and its prevalence, core symptoms, cause and comorbidities from childhood to adulthood.

AB Theory and research suggests that individuals with greater social capital (i.e., resources and benefits gained from relationships, experiences, and social interactions) may be more likely to be active, prosocial bystanders in bullying situations. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine the association of social capital (social support and social skills) with prosocial bystander behavior, and the role of internalizing problems as a potential barrier to this relation among 299 students (45.8% girls, 95% White) in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Results indicate a positive relation between social capital and prosocial bystander behavior. In addition, internalizing problems were a significant risk factor that may hinder youth-particularly girls-from engaging in defending behavior. Prosocial bystanders are an essential component to prevent and reduce bullying and further research is needed to better understand how to foster prosocial behavior in bullying situations, perhaps by utilizing social capital, related to school bullying.

AB Social withdrawal, or refraining from social interaction in the presence of peers, places adolescents at risk of developing emotional problems like anxiety and depression. The personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness also relate to emotional difficulties. For example, high conscientiousness predicts lower incidence of anxiety disorders and depression, while high neuroticism relates to greater likelihood of these problems. Based on these associations, socially withdrawn adolescents high in conscientiousness or low in neuroticism were expected to have lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Participants included 103 adolescents (59 % female) who reported on their personality traits in 8th grade and their anxiety and depressive symptoms in 9th grade. Peer ratings of social withdrawal were collected within schools in 8th grade. A structural equation model revealed that 8th grade withdrawal positively predicted 9th grade anxiety and depressive symptoms controlling for 8th grade anxiety and depressive symptoms, but neuroticism did not. Conscientiousness moderated the relation of withdrawal with depressive symptoms but not anxiety, such that high levels of conscientiousness attenuated the association between withdrawal and depressive symptoms. This buffering effect may stem from the conceptual relation between conscientiousness and self-regulation. Conscientiousness did not, however, moderate the association between withdrawal and anxiety, which may be partly due to the role anxiety plays in driving withdrawal. Thus, a conscientious, well-regulated personality partially protects withdrawn adolescents from the increased risk of emotional difficulties.

AB Are internalizing and externalizing behavior problems interrelated via mutually reinforcing relationships (with each behavior leading to increases over time in levels of the other behavior) or mutually suppressing relationships (with each behavior leading to decreases over time in levels of the other behavior)? Past research on the directionality of these relationships has led to ambiguous results, particularly in adolescence. Furthermore, the extent to which prior results will generalize to adolescents with low levels of cognitive abilities remains unknown. This second limit is particularly important, given that these adolescents are known to present higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors than their peers with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities, and that the mechanisms involved in the reciprocal relationships between these two types of behaviors may differ across both populations. This study examines the directionality of the longitudinal relationships between externalizing and internalizing behavior problems as rated by teachers across three measurement waves (corresponding to Grades 8-10) in matched samples of 138 adolescents (34.78 % girls) with low levels of cognitive abilities and 556 adolescents (44.88 % girls) with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities. The results showed that the measurement structure was fully equivalent across time periods and groups of adolescents, revealing high levels of developmental stability in both types of problems, and moderately high levels of cross-sectional associations. Levels of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors were higher among adolescents with low levels of cognitive abilities relative to those with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities. Finally, the predictive analyses revealed negative reciprocal longitudinal relationships (i.e., mutually suppressing relationships) between externalizing and internalizing problems, a result that was replicated within samples of adolescents with low, and average-to-high levels of cognitive ability.

AB Although developmental trajectories of anxiety symptomatology have begun to be explored, most research has focused on total anxiety symptom scores during childhood and early adolescence, using racially/ethnically homogenous samples. Understanding the heterogeneous courses of anxiety disorder symptoms during middle to late adolescence has the potential to clarify developmental risk models of anxiety and to inform prevention programs. Therefore, this study specifically examined gender differences in developmental trajectories of anxiety disorder symptoms (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder) from middle to late adolescence in a diverse community sample (N = 1000; 57 % female; 65 % White), assessed annually over 2 years. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that girls exhibited a slight linear decrease in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder symptoms, whereas boys exhibited a stable course. These models suggested that one trajectory was appropriate for panic disorder symptoms in both girls and boys. Growth mixture models indicated the presence of four latent generalized anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: low increasing, moderate decreasing slightly, high decreasing, and very high decreasing rapidly. Growth mixture models also suggested the presence of five latent social anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: a low stable trajectory class and four classes that were qualitatively similar to the latent generalized anxiety disorder trajectories. For both generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder symptoms, girls were significantly more likely than boys to be in trajectory classes characterized by moderate or high initial symptoms that subsequently decreased over time. These findings provide novel information regarding the developmental course of anxiety disorder symptoms in adolescents.

AB The present study was designed to examine trajectories of personal identity coherence and confusion among Hispanic recent-immigrant adolescents, as well as the effects of these trajectories on psychosocial and risk-taking outcomes. Personal identity is extremely important in anchoring young immigrants during a time of acute cultural change. A sample of 302 recently immigrated (5 years or less in the United States at baseline) Hispanic adolescents (M-age = 14.51 years at baseline; SD = 0.88 years, range 14-17) from Miami and Los Angeles (47 % girls) completed measures of personal identity coherence and confusion at the first five waves of a six-wave longitudinal study; and reported on positive psychosocial functioning, depressive symptoms, and externalizing problems at baseline and at Time 6. Results indicated that identity coherence increased linearly across time, but that there were no significant changes in confusion over time and no individual differences in confusion trajectories. Higher baseline levels of, and improvements in, coherence predicted higher levels of self-esteem, optimism, and prosocial behavior at the final study timepoint. Higher baseline levels of confusion predicted lower self-esteem, greater depressive symptoms, more aggressive behavior, and more rule breaking at the final study timepoint. These results are discussed in terms of the importance of personal identity for Hispanic immigrant adolescents, and in terms of implications for intervention.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to investigate potential bidirectional relationships between sport participation and mental health during early adolescence. Methods: Data were taken from wave 5 (2012) and wave 6 (2014) of the K cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. In total, there were 4023 participants (mean age = 12.41 yr, SD = 0.49 yr, at baseline), and this sample was followed up 24 months later. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine bidirectional relationships between sport participation (hours per week for team, individual, and total sport participation) and mental health (total psychological difficulties, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems) as measured by the parent-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: Bidirectional relationships were evident between time involved in sport and overall mental health (Sport(12 ->)SDQ(14): beta = -0.048; SDQ(12 ->)Sport(14): beta = -0.062). Bidirectional relationships were also evident between time involved in sport participation and internalizing (social and emotional) problems (Sport(12 ->)SDQ(14): beta = -0.068; SDQ(12 ->)Sport(14): beta = -0.067). The relationship between time in organized sport and externalizing problems (conduct problems and inattention/hyperactivity problems) was not bidirectional. Externalizing problems predicted later sports participation (beta = -0.039), but not vice versa. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate bidirectional relationships between sport participation and adolescent mental health. The design and implementation of youth sport programs should maximize mental health benefits, and programs should be designed, implemented, and marketed to be attractive to participants with poor psychosocial health.

AB The rapid pace of fetal development by far exceeds any other stage of the life span, and thus, environmental influences can profoundly alter the developmental course. Stress during the prenatal period, including malnutrition and inflammation, impact maternal and fetal neurodevelopment with long-term consequences for physical and mental health of both the mother and her child. One primary consequence of maternal malnutrition, inflammation, and other sources of prenatal stress is a poor birth outcome, such as prematurity or growth restriction. These phenotypes are often used as indications of prenatal adversity. In fact, the original evidence supporting the fetal programming hypothesis came from studies documenting an association between birth phenotype and the development of subsequent physical and mental health problems. Fetal growth restriction in both term and preterm infants is associated with neonatal morbidities and a wide variety of behavioral and psychological diagnoses in childhood and adolescence, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, internalizing and thought problems, poor social skills, and autism spectrum disorder. Improving maternal-child health requires interventions that begin before pregnancy and continue throughout gestation and into the postpartum period. Such interventions might include supporting pregnancy intention, maternal nutrition, health/medical care, mental health, and providing social support. This article discusses the impact of maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy among women living in low-resource settings, with an emphasis on key knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to guide program and policy decisions at local, regional and global levels.

AB Socioeconomic disadvantage is consistently linked with higher risk for internalizing problems, and stress is likely one important mechanism explaining this increased risk. Few studies have examined socioeconomic differences in hair cortisol, a novel biomarker of long-term adrenocortical activity and chronic stress. Moreover, no studies have examined whether differences in hair cortisol might explain socioeconomic disparities in internalizing problems. To address these gaps, we first examined relations of socioeconomic status (SES; family income and parental education) to variation in both parents' and children's hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and then tested whether HCC and perceptions of stress mediated relations of SES to parents' and children's internalizing symptoms. Participants were a socioeconomically diverse sample of 35 parents and 26 children (ages 5-7). Parents completed questionnaires, and hair samples were collected from parents and children. Parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms on average 2 years after the initial visit. Results demonstrated that lower parental education was associated with higher HCC for both parents and children. Effects for child HCC held even after controlling for parent HCC. Lower family income was associated with higher parent HCC, but not child HCC. This relation was nonlinear, such that the relation between HCC and income was strongest among the most disadvantaged parents. Furthermore, associations of SES with parental anxiety were significantly mediated by parental perceptions of stress and marginally mediated by parent HCC. These findings suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with greater accumulation of cortisol in hair in parents and children, and that both perceived and biological markers of stress capture important facets of the experiences that underlie socioeconomic disparities in adult anxiety.

AB Although individuals born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1,000 g) are the most vulnerable of all preterm survivors, their risk for mental health problems across the life span has not been systematically reviewed. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to ascertain whether the risk for mental health problems is greater for ELBW survivors than their normal birth weight (NBW) peers in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Forty-one studies assessing 2,712 ELBW children, adolescents, and adults and 11,127 NBW controls were reviewed. Group differences in mental health outcomes were assessed using random effects meta-analyses. The impacts of birthplace, birth era, and neurosensory impairment on mental health outcomes were assessed in subgroup analyses. Children born at ELBW were reported by parents and teachers to be at significantly greater risk than NBW controls for inattention and hyperactivity, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. ELBW children were also at greater risk for conduct and oppositional disorders, autistic symptoms, and social difficulties. Risks for parent-reported inattention and hyperactivity, internalizing, and social problems were greater in adolescents born at ELBW. In contrast, ELBW teens self-reported lower inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior levels than their NBW peers. Depression, anxiety, and social difficulties were elevated in ELBW survivors in adulthood. Group differences were robust to region of birth, era of birth, and the presence of neurosensory impairments. The complex needs faced by children born at ELBW continue throughout development, with long-term consequences for psychological and social well-being.

   depression; Millennium Cohort Study; working memory

   PARENTS; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; THOUGHTS; BEHAVIOR
AB Background. Maternal depression may affect the emotional/behavioural outcomes of children with normal neurocognitive functioning less severely than it does those without. To guide prevention and intervention efforts, research must specify which aspects of a child's cognitive functioning both moderate the effect of maternal depression and are amenable to change. Working memory and decision making may be amenable to change and are so far unexplored as moderators of this effect.
   Method. Our sample was 17 160 Millennium Cohort Study children. We analysed trajectories of externalizing (conduct and hyperactivity) and internalizing (emotional and peer) problems, measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at the ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years, using growth curve models. We characterized maternal depression, also time-varying at these ages, by a high score on the K6. Working memory was measured with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Spatial Working Memory Task, and decision making (risk taking and quality of decision making) with the Cambridge Gambling Task, both at age 11 years.
   Results. Maternal depression predicted both the level and the growth of problems. Risk taking and poor-quality decision making were related positively to externalizing and non-significantly to internalizing problems. Poor working memory was related to both problem types. Neither decision making nor working memory explained the effect of maternal depression on child internalizing/externalizing problems. Importantly, risk taking amplified the effect of maternal depression on internalizing problems, and poor working memory that on internalizing and conduct problems.
   Conclusions. Impaired decision making and working memory in children amplify the adverse effect of maternal depression on, particularly, internalizing problems.

AB The purpose of this study is to find patterns in the latent profiles of behavioral problems of children aged 4, 5, and 6, in the child and caregiver variables that affected the composition of the latent profile group, and in the differences in children's social skills by latent profile groups. The study relies on a sample of 1461 children enrolled in the Panel Study on Korean Children. Fostering children's social abilities has been stressed in recent policy documents in Korea, including the Character Education Promotion Act and the recently introduced Nuri curriculum. Therefore, the current paper investigates factors influencing children's behavior problems via a longitudinal analysis. A latent profile analysis was performed and resulted in three profile models. Our findings are as follows: First, according to the latent profile of children's behavior problems, we came up with three group models that best fit the data. Group 1, named the non-problem group, had at all ages below standard scores for behavioral problems. Group 2, named the normal group, had average or slightly above average scores for behavioral problems, though such problems decreased as the child got older. Group 3, named the in-danger group, had average or above standard scores for externalizing behavioral problems, while the scores for internalizing behavioral problems were above the subclinical standard point at age 4 and at the clinical standard point at ages 5 and 6. Second, after exploring the influencing factors (at child and parent levels) for children belonging to the in-danger group, the study found that the child was more likely to belong to the in-danger group if female, if the level of activity and sociality was low, if the mother's parenting stress was high, and if the family income was low. Lastly, the study looked into whether there were any group differences in young children's social skills. The findings show that regarding capacity for cooperation and self-control, the scores of the non-problem group were higher than those for the in-danger group. Regarding capacity for exhibiting assertiveness and responsibility, the lowest scores among the three groups belonged to the in-danger group.

AB Background: To meet the required hours of intensive intervention for treating children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we developed an automated serious gaming platform (11 games) to deliver intervention at home (GOLIAH) by mapping the imitation and joint attention (JA) subset of age-adapted stimuli from the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) intervention. Here, we report the results of a 6-month matched controlled exploratory study.
   Methods: From two specialized clinics, we included 14 children (age range 5-8 years) with ASD and 10 controls matched for gender, age, sites, and treatment as usual (TAU). Participants from the experimental group received in addition to TAU four 30-min sessions with GOLIAH per week at home and one at hospital for 6 months. Statistics were performed using Linear Mixed Models.
   Results: Children and parents participated in 40% of the planned sessions. They were able to use the 11 games, and participants trained with GOLIAH improved time to perform the task in most JA games and imitation scores in most imitation games. GOLIAH intervention did not affect Parental Stress Index scores. At end-point, we found in both groups a significant improvement for Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule scores, Vineland socialization score, Parental Stress Index total score, and Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, externalizing and total problems. However, we found no significant change for by time x group interaction.
   Conclusions: Despite the lack of superiority of TAU + GOLIAH versus TAU, the results are interesting both in terms of changes by using the gaming platform and lack of parental stress increase. A large randomized controlled trial with younger participants (who are the core target of ESDM model) is now discussed. This should be facilitated by computing GOLIAH for a web platform.

AB Anxiety and depression are common mental health problems experienced by children in Australia. The impact of these internalizing disorders is pervasive, affecting many areas of life. By the time problems have been detected in children they can be severe in nature and harder to treat. Hence, early intervention is of utmost importance. Despite the existence of numerous prevention programs for children, there is limited empirical evidence for a program that has an impact on symptoms of both anxiety and depression. Physical activity and improved motor coordination have been indicated as having positive effects on children's mental health, although the impact of including these in a program targeting internalizing disorders has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Feelings and Friends (Year 3) program (FFY3), revised to include activities to build motor-coordination and encourage physical activity. Participants were 24 children from the Perth metropolitan area alongside one of each of their parents. Results indicated significant short-term intervention effects on one of the primary outcome variables; intervention group parents reported significant pre-post improvement in child depressive symptoms, which were maintained at 3-month follow-up (eta p(2) =0.10). There were also intervention effects observed for parent-reported separation anxiety (eta p(2) =0.10), externalizing symptoms (eta p(2)=0.19), and conduct problems (eta p(2) =0.16). An additional finding indicated the intervention students reported significant improvement from session one to session two in global distress (eta p(2) =0.22). No other significant intervention effects were evident. Findings from this study indicate that FFY3 is a promising intervention to address internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 8-9 year-old children.

AB Background: Difficult conditions during childhood can limit an individual's development in many ways. Factors such as being raised in an at-risk family, child temperamental traits or maternal traits can potentially influence a child's later behaviour. The present study investigated the extent of regulatory problems in 6-month-old infants and their link to temperamental traits and impact on externalizing and internalizing problems at 36 months. Moderating effects of maternal distress and maternal depressive symptoms were tested as well.
   Methods: In a quasi-experimental, longitudinal study, a sample of 185 mother-infant dyads at psychosocial risk was investigated at 6 months with SFS (infants' regulatory problems) and at 3 years with CBCL (children's behavioural problems), EAS (children's temperament), ADS (maternal depressive symptoms) and PSI-SF (maternal stress).
   Results: A hierarchical regression analysis yielded a significant association between infants' regulatory problems and both externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems at age 3 (accounting for 16% and 14% variance), with both externalizing and internalizing problems being linked to current maternal depressive symptoms (12 and 9% of the variance). Externalizing and internalizing problems were found to be related also to children's temperamental difficulty (18 and 13% of variance) and their negative emotionality. With temperamental traits having been taken into account, only feeding problems at 6 months contributed near-significant to internalizing problems at 3 years.
   Conclusions: Our results underscore the crucial role of temperament in the path between early regulatory problems and subsequent behavioural difficulties. Children's unfavourable temperamental predispositions such as negative emotionality and generally "difficult temperament" contributed substantially to both externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems in the high-risk sample. The decreased predictive power of regulatory problems following the inclusion of temperamental variables indicates a mediation effect of temperamental traits in the path between early regulatory problems and subsequent behavioural problems. Our results support the main effects of a child's temperament, and to some degree maternal depressive symptoms, rather than the diathesis stress model of interaction between risky environment and temperamental traits.

AB Objective: In this study, it is aimed to explore mother's which psychiatric symptoms are related to child's internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Method: The study group consisted of the mothers of 4-6 years old children, who were referred to Yildirim Beyazit University, Yenimahalle Training and Research Hospital, Child and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic. The control group consisted of 4-6 years old children who have never referred to a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic and their mothers. The mothers filled in the Child Behavior Check List 4-18 (CBCL/4-18), and Symptom Check List-90-R (SCL-90-R). The data were compared with the control group.
   Results: The study sample consisted of 61 children in the case group, age-matched 55 control children and their mothers. The most common referral complaint was delayed speech (34.4%). There were clinically significant internalizing disorders in 29 (49.2%) children from the study group and 5 (9.4%) from the control group and significant externalizing disorders in 18 (30.5%) children from the study group and 3 (5.7%) from the control group. The correlation analysis revealed that all emotional and behavioral problems of the children were significantly related to the psychiatric symptoms of the mothers. Psychiatric symptom scores of the mothers of children with internalizing and externalizing problems were found significantly higher than the scores of the mothers of children without problems.
   Conclusion: Mother's psychiatric symptoms are seen to be related to internalizing and externalizing problems of the child, independent of Psychiatric diagnosis. The fact that any psychiatric symptom of the mother would have an emotional or behavioral reciprocation on the child has to be taken into account by the clinician.

AB Stop Now And Plan (SNAP (R)) is an empirically supported cognitive behavioural program for children identified as presenting with externalizing problems. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the implementation of the SNAP (R) for Schools program as a universal prevention program for children not identified as presenting with internalizing or externalizing problems, specifically, whether the program would lead to reductions in emotion dysregulation, anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and anxiety sensitivity. It was hypothesized that the SNAP (R) for Schools program would reduce emotion dysregulation and internalizing constructs in non-identified, school-aged children. The sample consisted of elementary school children in Grades 3 and 4. Participating children completed a battery of symptom measures one week pre- (n = 65) and post-SNAP (R) (n = 57) as well as one month after (n = 54) completing SNAP (R) in their classrooms. For children who scored in the upper 10% on the measure total and/or subscale scores, reductions in emotion dysregulation, anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity were observed. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of SNAP (R) for reducing emotion dysregulation and internalizing symptoms in children with elevated internalizing symptoms and emotion dysregulation. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB Background: Obesity in children can increase the risks of various chronic diseases. Mental disorders associated with obesity in children include: depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, hyperkinetic disorders, and increased aggressiveness. This relationship is estimated due to vulnerable genetic expressions in obese individuals. This study aimed to find the association between obesity and behavioral/emotional disorder in primary school-aged children.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 children at Menteng 1 Elementary School, Jakarta from July to September 2015. The study was conducted to find the association between the childrens nutritional status and behavioral/emotional disorders screened by the 17-item Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17). Chi square analysis was applied in this study.
   Results: The prevalence of obese children at Menteng 1 Elementary School, Jakarta reached 23.2%, which is higher than Jakartas prevalence (14%). 8.7% of the subjects were obese and 13.6% of them were having behavioral/emotional disorders. 20.0% of the obese subjects had behavioral/emotional disorders. The prevalence was higher for internalizing sub-scale, which was consistent with other studies. Association between obesity and behavioral/emotional disorders was significant for externalizing sub-scale (p=0.036). Externalizing problems caused by obesity might be affected by the social stigma of their peer group. However, obesity in children did not have a statistically significant relationship in internalization sub-scale, attention, and PSC-17 total score (p>0.05). No significant associations towards those sub-scales were thought to be influenced by other factors, playing a role in causing mental disorders in children.
   Conclusion: In general, obesity was not associated with behavioral and emotional disorders in children, but obesity was related to externalizing behavioral/emotional disorders.

AB Most interventions intended to improve subjective well-being, termed positive psychology interventions (PPIs), have neglected to include relevant stakeholders in youth's lives and have not included booster sessions intended to maintain gains in subjective well-being. The current study investigated the impact of a multitarget, multicomponent (i. e., students plus parents), small group PPI on students' mental health (subjective well-being as well as symptoms of internalizing and externalizing forms of psychopathology) at postintervention and approximately two months follow-up. Forty-two seventh-grade students were randomly assigned either to immediately receive the PPI or to a wait-list control group. At postintervention, students who participated in the PPI evidenced significant gains in all indicators of subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect), and there was a trend for practically meaningful reductions in internalizing and externalizing problems relative to the control group. At follow-up, gains in positive affect were maintained. Findings provide preliminary support for this multicomponent PPI as an evidence-based schoolbased intervention that causes long-lasting improvements in early adolescents' positive affect, a primary indicator of subjective well-being.

AB The purpose of the current study was to understand the association between bullying experiences (i. e., bullying, victimization, and defending) and social, emotional, and cognitive factors. The social factor was social skills (i. e., empathy, assertion, cooperation, responsibility); the emotional factor was emotional difficulties (i. e., personal adjustment, internalizing problems, school problems), and the cognitive factor was executive functioning skills (i. e., selfmonitoring, inhibitory control, flexibility, emotional regulation). Data on students' perceptions of their own social skills, emotional difficulties, and bullying role behavior were collected from 246 sixth through eighth grade students. Teachers provided reports of students' executive functioning skills. Results indicated that (a) emotional difficulties were significantly and positively associated with victimization for boys and girls, (b) emotional difficulties were significantly and positively associated with defending for girls, (c) executive functioning was significantly and negatively associated with defending for boys, and (d) social skills were significantly and positively related to defending behavior for boys and girls. These results emphasize the importance of examining the social, emotional, and cognitive factors associated with bullying. Social skills and emotional and executive functioning appear to vary systematically across bullying roles and should be considered when developing targeted social emotional interventions to stop bullying, increase defending, and support victims or those at risk for victimization.

AB To investigate the association between mental disorders and recidivism in juveniles, a three-level meta-analysis of 20 manuscripts (17 independent studies, N = 5737 juveniles) was conducted. The study focused on internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, and comorbid disorders (combinations of an internalizing and externalizing disorder). Small to moderate mean effect sizes were found for externalizing disorders (d = 0.415,p < 0.001) and comorbid disorders (d = 0366, p < 0.001), and no relation was found between internalizing disorders and recidivism (d = 0.016, p = 0.877). For comorbid disorders, no significant variation was found between studies and between effect sizes within studies. Therefore, moderator analyses were only conducted for studies on internalizing and externalizing disorders. These analyses revealed that type of recidivism (e.g., rearrest, reincarceration), type of delinquency (e.g., overt and covert delinquency), and gender influenced the direction and magnitude of the associations between recidivism and internalizing and externalizing disorders.

AB This study aimed at determining whether adolescents and young adults use music as an agent of consolation when dealing with daily sorrow and stress. We furthermore tested whether three aspects of music listening, i.e., the music itself, its lyrics, and experiences of closeness to artists and fans, were experienced as comforting. Third, we explored whether consolation through music listening was related to music use and psychological problems. Overall, 1,040 respondents, age 13-30 years (M = 20.3, 70.7% female), responded to items measuring listening hours, music importance, music preferences, positive and negative affects elicited by music (PANAS), internalizing and externalizing problems, and consolation through music. Slightly over 69% reported that they (definitely) use music as a source of consolation. Furthermore, female respondents and respondents with higher levels of anxiousness/depression and lower levels of aggression sought consolation by music more often. The same result emerged for respondents with a preference for chart pop music, for those who found music important, and for those with stronger emotional reactions to music. Music's consoling effects were reported as resulting particularly from the sound and texture of the music itself, from attribution of personal meaning to music's lyrics, and, to a lesser extent, from perceptions of closeness to artists and other listeners.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Bullying is a form of interpersonal trauma that impacts all parties involved, including the youth who witness the bullying. Some bystanders choose to intervene and defend the child being bullied. Defending may be positively associated with psychosocial difficulties because youth are becoming more involved in a traumatic event, or because youth may be actively coping with the distress elicited from witnessing bullying; however, the link between defending and psychosocial difficulties has not yet been examined. The current study investigated the age-related differences and psychosocial difficulties associated with defending behaviour in school bullying. Data were collected from 5071 Canadian youth from Grades 4-12. Participants completed an online survey at school, which assessed demographic information, recent defending behaviour, location and frequency of witnessing bullying, and psychosocial difficulties (internalizing, anger, psychosomatic, academic, and relationship difficulties). A subsample of 1443 pure bystanders (no current bullying involvement) was used for regression analyses. Defending behaviour was more common among girls and among younger students. For boys, defending behaviour was associated with more psychosocial difficulties compared to boys who only witnessed the bullying. This relationship was less consistent for girls. Defending behaviour was also associated with more psychosocial difficulties at high levels of bullying exposure. These associations suggest that defending may come at a cost for youth, or that youth are defending their peers to cope with negative emotions associated with witnessing interpersonal trauma. More longitudinal research is needed to clarify these associations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study examines the additive and joint roles of chronic poverty-related adversity and three candidate neurocognitive processes of emotion regulation (ER)including: (i) attention bias to threat (ABT); (ii) accuracy of facial emotion appraisal (FEA); and (iii) negative affect (NA)for low-income, ethnic minority children's internalizing problems (N = 338). Children were enrolled in the current study from publicly funded preschools, with poverty-related adversity assessed at multiple time points from early to middle childhood. Field-based administration of neurocognitively-informed assessments of ABT, FEA and NA as well as parental report of internalizing symptoms were collected when children were ages 8-11, 6 years after baseline. Results suggest that chronic exposure to poverty-related adversity from early to middle childhood predicted higher levels of internalizing symptomatology when children are ages 8-11, even after controlling for initial poverty status and early internalizing symptoms in preschool. Moreover, each of the 3 hypothesized components of ER played an independent and statistically significant role in predicting children's parent-reported internalizing symptoms at the 6-year follow-up, even after controlling for early and chronic poverty-related adversity.

AB For youth with epilepsy, comorbid psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety, require further examination as they carry increased risk for reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The current study assessed whether rates of depression, anxiety, and withdrawal behaviors differed based on seizure location. Data included parental ratings on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) and the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) questionnaire for 132 children and adolescents (mean age = 1134, SD = 3.95) with generalized or partial (i.e., frontal [FLE] or temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE]) epilepsy. Our results identified clinically significant internalizing psychopathology in nearly half of our sample (41%). Although rates of internalizing behavior were similar between generalized and partial groups, children and adolescents with TLE demonstrated higher rates of depression compared to youth with FLE. No effects of laterality on internalizing behaviors were identified between TLE and FLE groups. Finally, for youth with TLE, parental depression ratings along with current number of antiepileptic medications (AEDs) were found to be significant barriers to HRQOL above and beyond anxiety, withdrawal, and epilepsy-specific variables. Temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with a two-fold risk of clinically significant depression ratings. These findings highlight the high prevalence of internalizing psychopathology features in pediatric epilepsy and offer further support for the relationship between depression and TLE in children and adolescents with epilepsy.

AB This study tested psychometric properties of the Children's Moods, Fears and Worries Questionnaire (CMFWQ) with a population sample of children at risk for developing internalizing problems. The CMFWQ was completed by 489 parents of 5-year-old children who had been screened for temperamental inhibition in preschools across eight government areas of Melbourne, Australia. Parents also completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Anxiety Diagnostic Interview Schedule (ADIS-P-IV). In this inhibited sample of children, the CMFWQ showed high internal consistency of items (=.95). The CMFWQ demonstrated convergent validity with the SDQ emotional symptoms' subscale and discriminant validity with the conduct problems' subscale. Supporting criterion validity, the CMFWQ significantly distinguished between groups of inhibited children with versus without ADIS anxiety disorders. Psychometric properties of the CMFWQ now extend to young inhibited children who are at risk for developing internalizing problems as they grow. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Prior research has documented robust associations between adolescent religiousness/spirituality (R/S) and psychopathology outcomes including externalizing and internalizing symptomatology, yet no previous studies have examined these associations with adolescent R/S profiles using a person-centred approach. We examined whether there are identifiable subgroups characterized by unique multidimensional patterns of R/S experiences and how these experiences may be related to externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. The sample consisted of 220 Appalachian adolescents between 12 and 18years old who were primarily White and primarily Christian. Latent profile analysis revealed three profiles of adolescent R/S: high religiousness (28.4%), introjectors (47.6%), and low religiousness (24.0%). These profiles were differentially related to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology such that the high religiousness group was significantly lower than the introjectors with respect to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and lower than the low religiousness group in externalizing symptomatology. Implications and suggestions for future research using person-centred approaches to better understand differential developmental trajectories of religious development are provided.

AB Concerns regarding the social- behavioral maladjustment of U. S. youth have spurred efforts among educators and policymakers to identify and remedy educational contexts that exacerbate children's anxiety, depression, aggression, and misconduct. However, investigations of the influence of collective classroom student characteristics on individuals' social- behavioral functioning are few. The present study examined concurrent and longitudinal relations between adversity factors facing the collective classroom student group and levels of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors across the elementary school years, and whether the pattern of relations differed for girls and boys. First-, third-, and fifth- grade teachers reported on the extent to which adversity- related factors (e. g., home/ family life, academic readiness, social readiness, English proficiency, tardiness/ absenteeism, student mobility, health) presented a challenge in their classrooms ( i. e., classroomlevel adversity [CLA]). Mothers reported on their child's internalizing and externalizing behavior at each grade. Autoregressive, lagged panel models controlled for prior levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior, mothers' education, family income-to-needs, and class size. For all children at each grade, CLA was concurrently and positively associated with externalizing behavior. For first-grade girls, but not boys, CLA was also concurrently and positively associated with internalizing behavior. Indirect effects suggested CLA influenced later internalizing and externalizing behavior through its influence on maladjustment in a given year. Discussion highlights possible methods of intervention to reduce CLA or the negative consequences associated with being in a higher-adversity classroom.

AB This study aimed to examine heterogeneity of neonatal brain network and its prediction to child behaviors at 24 and 48 months of age. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was employed to construct brain anatomical network for 120 neonates. Clustering coefficients of individual structures were computed and used to classify neonates with similar brain anatomical networks into one group. Internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems were assessed using maternal reports of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 24 and 48 months of age. The profile of CBCL externalizing and internalizing behaviors was then examined in the groups identified based on the neonatal brain network. Finally, support vector machine and canonical correlation analysis were used to identify brain structures whose clustering coefficients together significantly contribute the variation of the behaviors at 24 and 48 months of age. Four meaningful groups were revealed based on the brain anatomical networks at birth. Moreover, the clustering coefficients of the brain regions that most contributed to this grouping of neonates were significantly associated with childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors assessed at 24 and 48 months of age. Specially, the clustering coefficient of the right amygdala was associated with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors at 24 months of age, while the clustering coefficients of the right inferior frontal cortex and insula were associated with externalizing behaviors at 48 months of age. Our findings suggested that neural organization established during fetal development could to some extent predict individual differences in behavioralemotional problems in early childhood.

TI Attention to Threat as a Predictor of Shyness in the Context of

AB The duration of children's attention to putative threat has been documented as a consistent predictor of later anxiety in inhibited children across childhood (Fox, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 127, 2010, 33; Perez-Edgar & Fox, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 14, 2005, 681). However, attention to threat has not been broadly examined within existing behavioral contexts and has seldom been studied in very early childhood. Whereas toddlers with high levels of internalizing behavior may view fear-inducing stimuli as a threat, toddlers with high levels of externalizing behavior may demonstrate attention out of interest or sensation seeking. Thus, attention to threat was expected to predict increased toddler shyness in the context of either high internalizing problems or low externalizing behavior. We examined 117 twenty-four-month-old toddlers to determine whether attention to threat interacted with internalizing and externalizing behavior at 24 months of age to predict toddler shyness one year later. Results indicated that attention to threat predicted toddlers' lower shyness at 36 months when toddlers' externalizing behavior at age 24 months were high, but there was no significant interaction between toddlers' internalizing behavior and their attention to threat in predicting later shyness. These results expand our understanding of the contexts in which attention to threat in early childhood is a viable predictor of later shyness.

AB Background People with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable to develop psychopathology (in particular anxiety) and related challenging behaviour.
   A diagnostic guideline was developed to support professionals to better diagnose and thus treat psychopathology and related CB. This study examined preliminary outcomes from the application of this guideline.
   Method A comparative multiple case study with an experimental and a control condition.
   Results The application of the guideline showed a trend of decreases of internalizing problems (P = 0.07) and anxiety/depressed problems (P = 0.09). We found no statistically significant decreases of externalizing problems and no increases in perceived quality of life as compared with care as usual. Clients were not more satisfied with the support they received for coping with their emotional and behaviour problems.
   Conclusion The application of the Diagnostic Guideline for Anxiety and Challenging Behaviour did not show statistically significant changes in externalizing problems and Quality of Life. Despite the small sample size of n = 59, we did find a trend in decreasing internalizing problems and anxiety/depressed problems. Further research into either or not confirming these trends is recommended.

AB Parenting is a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral endeavor, yet limited research investigates parents' executive functions and emotion regulation as predictors of how parents interact with their children. The current study is a multimethod investigation of parental self-regulation in relation to the quality of parenting behavior and parent-child interactions in a diverse sample of parents and kindergarten-age children. Using path analyses, we tested how parent executive functions (inhibitory control) and lack of emotion regulation strategies uniquely relate to both sensitive/responsive behaviors and positive/collaborative behaviors during observed interaction tasks. In our analyses, we accounted for parent education, financial stress, and social support as socioeconomic factors that likely relate to parent executive function and emotion regulation skills. In a diverse sample of primary caregivers (N = 102), we found that direct assessment of parent inhibitory control was positively associated with sensitive/responsive behaviors, whereas parent self-reported difficulties in using emotion regulation strategies were associated with lower levels of positive and collaborative dyadic behaviors. Parent education and financial stress predicted inhibitory control, and social support predicted emotion regulation difficulties; parent education was also a significant predictor of sensitive/responsive behaviors. Greater inhibitory control skills and fewer difficulties identifying effective emotion regulation strategies were not significantly related in our final path model. We discuss our findings in the context of current and emerging parenting interventions.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between stuttering severity, psychological functioning, and overall impact of stuttering, in a large sample of adolescents who stutter.
   Method: Participants were 102 adolescents (11-17 years) seeking speech treatment for stuttering, including 86 boys and 16 girls, classified into younger (11-14 years, n =57) and older (15-17 years, n =45) adolescents. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between speech and psychological variables and overall impact of stuttering.
   Results: The impact of stuttering during adolescence is influenced by a complex interplay of speech and psychological variables. Anxiety and depression scores fell within normal limits. However, higher self-reported stuttering severity predicted higher anxiety and internalizing problems. Boys reported externalizing problems aggression, rule-breaking in the clinical range, and girls reported total problems in the borderline-clinical range. Overall, higher scores on measures of anxiety, stuttering severity, and speech dissatisfaction predicted a more negative overall impact of stuttering.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study of adolescents who stutter. Higher stuttering severity, speech dissatisfaction, and anxiety predicted a more negative overall impact of stuttering, indicating the importance of carefully managing the speech and psychological needs of adolescents who stutter. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between stuttering and externalizing problems for adolescent boys who stutter. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This systematic review examines whether negative affect symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and internalizing symptoms more broadly) predict subsequent adolescent substance use after controlling for co-occurring externalizing symptoms. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 61 studies that tested the association of interest. Findings varied depending on the type of negative affect symptom and to some extent on the substance use outcome. The most consistent associations were evident for depressive symptoms, particularly as predictors of substance use composite scores. No clear association between anxiety and substance use or between internalizing symptoms and substance use was evident, and indeed these associations were as often negative as positive. Mixed findings regarding the depression-substance use association, however, also call for greater attention to potential moderating factors that may help define who, when, and in what context depression serves as an important risk factor for later substance use above and beyond risk associated with externalizing symptoms.

AB Although childhood shyness has been associated with school- adjustment difficulties in contemporary research in China, the conceptual mechanisms that may underlie these relations remain underinvestigated. The goal of this study was to examine a complex theoretical model that explicates the roles of both peer preference and teacher- child relationships in the links between shyness and school adjustment in Chinese children. Participants were N = 1,275 3rd- through 7th- grade students (637 boys, 638 girls; M age = 10.78 years, SD = 1.55) attending public primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Measures of shyness, peer preference, teacherchild relationships, and aspects of school adjustment were obtained from multiple source, including peer nominations, child self- reports, teacher ratings, and school records. Results from mediation and moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that (a) shyness indirectly predicted greater internalizing problems and poorer academic achievement through its negative association with peer preference and (b) these indirect effects were moderated by teacher-child relationships, such that the negative association between shyness and peer reference was attenuated among children with higher quality of teacher- child relationships. Results are discussed in terms of the roles of peers and teachers in the links between shyness and school adjustment and their educational implications.

AB Although mentoring is a popular and effective means of intervention with youth, the positive effects of mentoring can be diminished by premature match closure of relationships. Program, mentor, and mentee characteristics were examined as predictors of premature match closure. Secondary data analyses were conducted on a large national database of mentoring programs consisting of match and youth risk information from 170 mentoring programs and 6468 matches from across the U.S. Premature closure was associated with mentee age at match inception and 19 individual mentee characteristics. The set of mentee characteristics were examined as part of a cumulative risk index encompassing seven conceptually combined categories including family background characteristics, school functioning problems, engagement in risky health behaviors, self-regulation difficulties, engagement in illegal or criminal activities, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Both the age of mentees when matched and the cumulative risk index score significantly predicted premature closure. Results are discussed in terms of directions for future research and suggestions for enhancing mentoring program practices.

AB Although there is substantial evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is some debate about how these treatments have their effects. Modern learning theory and cognitive and emotional processing theories highlight the importance of reducing avoidance, facilitating the constructive processing of feared experiences, and strengthening new inhibitory learning. We examined variables thought to be associated with unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences in a sample of 81 youth with elevated PTSD symptoms, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for abuse or traumatic interpersonal loss. Sessions during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT were coded for indicators of unproductive processing (overgeneralization, rumination, avoidance) and constructive processing (decentering, accommodation of corrective information), as well as levels of negative emotion. In previous analyses of this trial (Ready et al., 2015), more overgeneralization during externalizing symptoms over the 12-month follow-up. In contrast, more accommodation predicted improvement in internalizing symptoms and also moderated the negative effects of overgeneralization on internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The current study examined correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation. Overgeneralization was associated with more rumination, less decentering, and more negative emotion, suggesting immersion in trauma-related material. Accommodation was associated with less avoidance and more decentering, suggesting a healthy distance from trauma-related material that might allow for processing and cognitive change. Decentering also predicted improvement in externalizing symptoms at posttreatment. Rumination and avoidance showed important associations with overgeneralization and accommodation, respectively, but did not predict treatment outcomes. This study identifies correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation that might shed light on how these variables relate to unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences.

AB Attachment-based theories and related research illustrate that emotion regulation develops in the context of a secure relationship between a child and caregiver. When a secure bond is broken, such as in the context of betrayal trauma, children fail to develop necessary emotion regulation skills which can lead to an array of relational problems. The current study examined the relations between betrayal trauma history, type of communication during a stressful interpersonal laboratory task, and emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of trauma-exposed adolescents. Results showed that adolescents with a betrayal trauma history reported more emotion regulation difficulties and exhibited more aggressive and fewer positive communication behaviors when engaged in a stressful interpersonal task with their mothers than did adolescents exposed only to nonbetrayal trauma. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relation between betrayal trauma history and negative communication. The clinical and developmental implications from these findings are discussed.

AB Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a marker of parasympathetic activity, has been shown to moderate the relation between adversity and child behavioral outcomes; however, this work has been conducted in primarily Caucasian samples and limited in focus to family-level adversity. The current analysis extends the previous literature to examine the co-contribution of exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), baseline RSA, and RSA withdrawal to internalizing and externalizing behavior in a sample of primarily African American youth (n = 92) recruited using neighborhood mapping techniques from communities high in epidemiological indicators of adversity. Exposure to PTEs was associated with lower baseline RSA. Complex interactions were observed between sex of the child, baseline RSA and RSA withdrawal, and PTE exposure predicting to internalizing behaviors. Among girls with high (4+) levels of PTEs, high baseline RSA and RSA withdrawal predicted higher internalizing; for RSA withdrawal only, the inverse was observed for girls with low PTE exposure, for whom high RSA withdrawal predicted lower internalizing. No associations were observed from RSA to externalizing, or among boys to internalizing. Findings are consistent with distinct patterns among primarily African American samples and suggest the need for sex-specific conceptualizations of the link between environmental adversity, physiological reactivity, and internalizing behaviors.

AB In this article, we investigated the extent and nature of informant discrepancies on parent- and adolescent self-report versions of a checklist measuring youth exposure to life stressors. Specifically, we examined (a) mean-level differences, relative consistency, and consensus for family-level and youth-specific stressors and (b) the utility of parent-youth discrepancies in accounting for variance in youth temperament and psychopathology. Participants were 106 parent- child dyads (47 male, 59 female; 90.6% mothers) aged 13 to 18 years old (M = 16.01, SD = 1.29). The results revealed evidence for both congruence and divergence in parent and youth reports, particularly with respect to respondents' accounts of youth-specific stressors. Discrepancies for youth-specific stressors were associated with adolescents' negative affectivity, surgency, effortful control, and internalizing problems. Discrepancies for youth stressors may therefore reveal individual differences in emotionality and self-regulation, thus reflecting meaningful variance in adolescents' functioning.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is prevalent and is associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents. This study examined which sleep variables are associated with NSSI, independently from demographics and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. Participants consisted of 2090 students sampled from three high schools in Shandong, China and had a mean age of 15.49 years. Participants completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their demographic and family information, sleep duration and sleep problems, impulsiveness, hopelessness, internalizing and externalizing problems, and NSSI. A series of regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between sleep variables and NSSI. Of the sample, 12.6 % reported having ever engaged in NSSI and 8.8 % engaged during the last year. Univariate logistic analyses demonstrated that multiple sleep variables including short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, poor sleep quality, sleep insufficiency, unrefreshed sleep, sleep dissatisfaction, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, and nightmares were associated with increased risk of NSSI. After adjusting for demographic and mental health variables, NSSI was significantly associated with sleeping < 6 h per night, poor sleep quality, sleep dissatisfaction, daytime sleepiness, and frequent nightmares. Stepwise logistic regression model demonstrated that poor sleep quality (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI = 1.37-3.47) and frequent nightmares (OR = 2.88, 95 % CI = 1.45-5.70) were significantly independently associated with NSSI. In conclusion, while multiple sleep variables are associated with NSSI, poor sleep quality and frequent nightmares are independent risk factors of NSSI. These findings may have important implications for further research of sleep self-harm mechanisms and early detection and prevention of NSSI in adolescents.

AB To examine child factors and parental characteristics as predictors of discrepancies between parents' ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in a sample of preschool children with ADHD and behavior problems and in a nonclinical sample. We investigated correspondence and discrepancies between parents' ratings on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems broadband scales of the Child Behavior Checklist version for preschool children (CBCL/1.5-5). Parents of 152 preschool children, with ADHD and behavior problems (n = 72) and nonclinical children (n = 80), aged between 28 and 72 months (M = 47.26, SD = 12.7), completed the CBCL/1.5-5. Candidate predictors of discrepancy included the child's age and sex, and parents' levels of parenting stress, depressive mood, attention-deficit and disruptive behavior. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. Correspondence between parents, both for ratings on internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, was high (r = .63-.77). In the clinical sample, mothers rated the severity of externalizing behavior problems significantly higher than did fathers (p = < .001). Discrepancy between fathers and mothers on externalizing behavior problems was not predicted by child factors or interparental differences in psychopathology, but it was predicted by interparental differences in parenting stress (R (2) = .25, p < .001). This effect was significantly larger in the nonclinical sample (Delta R (2) = .06, p < .001). When parents disagree on the severity level of preschool children's externalizing behavior problems, the clinician should take into consideration that differences in parenting stress might be involved.

AB Background: Irritability and emotion regulation are both important transdiagnostic factors that contribute to the development of internalizing symptoms during adolescence. The current study examined whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms.
   Methods: To examine this relationship we analysed the indirect effect of irritability (measured using a single item from the Goldberg Mania Questionnaire) on internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) via the mediator, emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale) in 112 adolescent females.
   Results: Mediation analysis, using bootstrapping, showed a significant indirect effect and suggests that the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms is mediated by emotion dysregulation.
   Limitations: These include measuring irritability using a single item and employing a cross sectional design.
   Conclusions: These novel findings add to our understanding of the processes and mechanisms by which irritability contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms.

AB Racial socialization messages appear to have varying impacts on the adjustment of African American youth. To further explore this, we examined how two types of racial socialization messages might influence African American youth internalizing and externalizing behavior. The Youth Self Report was used to measure these behavior outcomes. Given that racial socialization messages may not be directly linked to behavior outcomes, we considered private regard, an aspect of racial identity, to serve as a mediator. Additionally, we examined global self-esteem as a mediator of the complex dynamic between racial socialization messages and behavior outcomes. Adolescents in our study completed paper assessments. Majority of the participants were female (56 %) and reside in a metropolitan area in the Mid-Atlantic region. Adolescent's ages ranged from 14 to 17 years with the average age being 15 years old. Path analysis revealed cultural pride and alertness to discrimination messages varied in their relation to private regard. Results also indicated a strong linkage between private regard, global self-esteem, and internalizing behaviors. Interestingly, the linkage between private regard, global self-esteem and externalizing behaviors was not as robust. Further, private regard appeared to directly and indirectly impact externalizing behaviors. The implications of these findings for racial socialization strategies, identity development (racial and global) as it pertains to behavior problems for African American adolescents are discussed.

AB While shame is essential for adaptive functioning, experiencing shame more often or intensely than others is strongly associated with psychopathology. To date, no measure of the behavioral expression of shame exists, despite the great potential for use in research and clinical settings. The present study aimed to assess the Shame Code, a new behavioral coding system of the expression of shame. Participants included 149 youth between the ages of 12 and 17 (50 % female, M = 14.5). Shame was elicited with a spontaneous speech task. Participants' overall Shame Code scores were correlated only with a state measure of shame, however, structural equation modeling results showed that Shame Code variables combined differentially to assess state and trait shame scores. A two-factor model was the best fit to the data. The first factor, Fidget, consisted of Hiding, Fidget (positively loaded), Nervous Positive, and Stillness (negatively loaded). The second factor, Freeze, was comprised of Stillness, Facial Tension, and Silence (positively loaded). The Fidget factor was associated with higher Trait Shame and the Freeze factor was associated with higher State Shame but lower Trait Shame. Therefore, the Shame Code not only effectively captured the behavioral manifestations of shame, but Shame Code variables also differentially predicted state and trait shame.

AB Emotional regulation within the context of social situations refers to an individual's ability to respond to emotions in socially acceptable ways in order to adapt quickly and to maintain good interpersonal relationships. Emotional regulation is a psychological characteristic at the core of social stability. The preschool period is a stage in which children's emotional regulation develops rapidly. Because homes and preschools are the two main places where preschoolers grow and spend their time, their mothers and peers play key roles in their social interactions. Therefore, the present study explored how the emotional regulation strategies of preschool children in China are affected by children's class grouping and their mothers' emotional expressivity. The participants were 182 preschoolers (ages 3-5) who were recruited for this study. The Emotional Regulation Strategy Questionnaire and the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire were used to explore preschoolers' emotional regulation strategies and their mothers' emotional expressivity, respectively. The study results are as follows. (1) As they develop, preschool children use more positive emotional regulation strategies and fewer negative emotional regulation strategies. (2) Children in mixed-age classes use fewer passive reaction strategies than children in same-age classes do. For replacement activity strategies, only 4-year-old children in mixed-age classes score higher than children in same-age classes. (3) Mothers' tendencies toward positive emotional expression can positively predict their children's use of positive emotional regulation strategies, and their displays of negative emotions can positively predict their children's use of negative emotional regulation strategies.

AB Internalizing mental health issues are a significant developmental and clinical concern during adolescence, but rarely identified as a problem among school staff. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examined the associations between adolescent emotional distress, school connectedness, and educational achievement by exploring potential mechanistic and interactive roles of perceived school connectedness on the emotion-education association. Emotional distress was negatively associated with adolescents' perceptions of belonging to school, which, in turn, may negatively influence educational achievement. School connectedness also had both additive and multiplicative interaction effects on the emotion-education relationship. Results support previous evidence of school connectedness as a protective factor for adolescents with internalizing mental health concerns, although much of the work to date has focused on externalizing problems. This study informs our understanding of how, why, and for whom emotional problems influence educational outcomes in light of social support in the school context.

AB The emotional competence screening and the social competence screening for parents and teachers were developed in Romania as brief, multiinformant, strength-focused assessment tools to identify children at risk of underdeveloped social-emotional competencies. The objective of the current study was to gather further reliability and validity evidence concerning the teacher and parent versions of the screeners. Findings provided evidence of high internal consistency, test-retest reliability (3-month interval), and moderate levels of cross-informant reliability. Principal axis factoring was employed for testing latent dimensions associated with the theoretical models underlying the scales' development. Construct validity was also established using measures of children's social-emotional competencies and internalizing/externalizing problems and yielded moderate-to-strong correlations across all forms of the screeners. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed relative to the clinical range scores from the internalizing/externalizing problem scales from Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment and yielded acceptable specificity and sensitivity indices. Receiver operating characteristic analyses and area under the curve values indicate that these measures have moderate-to-strong utility (AUCs >= .78) in detecting children at risk of internalizing and externalizing problems based on ratings of their social-emotional skills. These data support the notion that these instruments might prove potential candidates for school-wide screening practices.

AB Given the public health importance of depression, the identification of prevention programs with long-term effects on reducing the rate of depression is of critical importance, as is the examination of factors that may moderate the magnitude of such prevention effects. This study examines the impact of the Family Check-Up, delivered in public secondary schools beginning in sixth grade, on the development of major depression in adulthood (aged 28-30). The multilevel intervention program included (a) a universal classroom-based intervention focused on problem solving and peer relationship skills, (b) the Family Check-Up (selected), a brief assessment-based intervention designed to motivate parents to improve aspects of family functioning when warranted, and (c) family management treatment (indicated), focused on improving parenting skills. Demographic (gender and ethnicity) and baseline risk factors (family conflict, academic problems, antisocial behavior, and peer deviance) were examined as possible moderators in logistic regression analyses. Intervention effects on depression were moderated by baseline family conflict and academic performance, with stronger intervention effects for youth with low grade point averages and from low-conflict families at baseline. Such findings extend the emerging literature on prevention programs with long-term effects on depression, and highlight directions for future research to enhance such effects.

AB Objective: To investigate whether mental health problems differ between internationally adopted adolescents and their non-adopted peers and examine design and sample characteristics that might underlie differences among studies.
   Method: Studies published through August 2015 were collected through Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, ERIC, and Svemed+. Combined effect estimates were calculated using random-effects models.
   Results: Eleven studies investigating 17,919 adoptees and 1,090,289 non-adopted peers were included in the meta analysis. Internationally adopted adolescents reported more mental health problems across domains than their peers, with effect estimates (standardized mean differences [SMDs]) of 0.16 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.28) for questionnaire-based studies and 0.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.90) for register-based studies. They also reported significantly more externalizing difficulties (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38), although the effect estimate for internalizing difficulties was not statistically significant (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.24). Studies using categorical measurements of mental health problems, indicating more serious problems, yielded larger effect estimates than continuous measurements (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.41; SMD 0.13, 95% CI-0.01 to 0.26, respectively). The difference in mental health problems between international adoptees and their peers was somewhat larger when using parent report compared with self-report. More recent studies (conducted in 1995 and later) yielded larger estimates than older studies, although no significant difference was found for this analysis or subgroup analyses investigating sex and age at adoption.
   Conclusion: Although most internationally adopted adolescents are well adjusted, adoptees as a group report higher levels of mental health problems compared with non-adopted peers. This difference should be acknowledged and adequate support services should be made available.

AB Objective: Although enuresis is relatively common in early childhood, research exploring its antecedents and implications is surprisingly limited, perhaps because the condition typically remits in middle childhood.
   Method: We examined the prevalence, predictors, prognostic factors, and outcomes of primary enuresis in a large (N = 559) multi-method, multi-informant prospective study with a community-based sample of children followed from age 3 years to age 9 years.
   Results: We found that 12.7% of our sample met criteria for lifetime enuresis, suggesting that it is a commonly occurring childhood disorder. Males were more than twice as likely as females to have a lifetime diagnosis. Significant age 3 predictors of developing primary enuresis by age 9 included child anxiety and low positive affectivity, maternal history of anxiety, and low authoritative parenting. In addition, poorer global functioning and more depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 3 years predicted a greater likelihood of persistence through age 9. By age 9 years, 77% of children who had received a diagnosis of primary enuresis were in remission and continent. However, children who had remitted exhibited a higher rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and greater ADHD and depressive symptoms at age 9 compared to children with no lifetime history of enuresis.
   Conclusion: Results of the present study underscore the clinical significance of primary enuresis and demonstrate that it shows both strong antecedent and prospective associations with psychopathology. The findings also highlight the possible role of parenting in the development of enuresis.

AB Grounded in a dual-risk, biosocial perspective of developmental psychopathology, this study examined the role of higher vagal suppression in providing young adolescents protection from four parenting stressors. It was expected that lower vagal suppression would increase youth vulnerability to the deleterious effects of these parenting stressors. Depressive symptoms were examined as a central marker of socioemotional difficulties during early adolescence. The four parenting stressors examined were interparental hostility, maternal use of harsh discipline, maternal inconsistent discipline, and maternal psychological control. Participants were 68 young adolescents (Grade 6) and their mothers. Greater vagal suppression provided protection (i.e., lower depressive symptoms) from interparental hostility, harsh discipline, and maternal psychological control for boys but not for girls.

AB Aims To investigate whether: (1) childmaltreatment is associated with life-time cannabis use, early-onset cannabis use, daily cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis abuse in young adulthood; and (2) behaviour problems, tobacco use and alcohol use at age 14 are associated with cannabis use. Design Birth cohort using linked government agency child protection data to define exposure to child maltreatment. Setting The Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy in Brisbane, Australia. Participants Of the original cohort of 7223 mother and child pairs, obtained from consecutive presentations for prenatal care at a hospital serving a cross-section of the community, 3778 (52.3%) of the young people participated at age 21 years. Measurements Exposure to child maltreatment was established by substantiated government agency reports. Cannabis outcomes were by self-report questionnaire and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-Auto at age 21. Associations were adjusted for a range of potential confounders. Additional adjustment was carried out for variables measured at age 14-youth behaviour problems [Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)], tobacco use and alcohol use. Findings After adjustment, substantiated child maltreatment was associated with any life-time cannabis use [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-2.39], cannabis use prior to age 17 (OR = 2.47, 95 % CI = 1.67-3.65), daily cannabis use (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.49-4.81) and DSM-IV cannabis abuse/dependence (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.07-2.77). Externalizing behaviour and tobacco and alcohol use at age 14 were associated significantly with almost all cannabis outcomes (P < 0.05), with internalizing behaviour associated inversely (P < 0.05). Conclusions Children in Australia who are documented as having been maltreated are more likely to go on to use cannabis before the age of 17, use cannabis as an adult, use cannabis daily and meet DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence. Externalizing behaviour in adolescence appears partly to mediate the association with adult cannabis use.

AB Alcohol-related attitudes are evident before children have personal experience drinking alcohol and represent key proximal predictors of alcohol use, but relatively little is known about how early life characteristics predict these attitudes. Among late childhood lifetime alcohol abstainers (M-age = 10.67 years; 51% girls), we examine predictors of positive alcohol expectancies and perceived risk of alcohol use. Data from the Millennium Cohort Study, an ongoing nationally representative longitudinal study of children born in the UK, were available from 11,097 children who completed the self-report survey at modal age 11 and reported never drinking alcohol. A sequential structural model suggested that sociodemographic factors were distal predictors of age 11 alcohol attitudes that operated, in part, through family and child risk factors (measured at ages 3 to 7). Alcohol attitudes varied by sociodemographics; for example, boys had higher positive expectancies than girls and White British children had higher positive expectancies and lower perceived risk than Black British and Asian British children. In terms of family factors, parent alcohol problems predicted children's lower perceived risk, and higher parent child conflict predicted more positive expectancies. For child factors, children's greater cognitive skills predicted higher perceived risk, and internalizing problems predicted more positive expectancies. Indirect effects from sociodemographics through parent-child conflict and internalizing problems predicted positive expectancies; indirect effects through parent alcohol problems and cognitive skills predicted perceived risk. Future research should delve further into mechanisms underlying the development of alcohol attitudes and their potential as malleable targets for prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Experiencing traumatic events and abuse is unfortunately common in general, non-clinical samples. Recent research indicates that the ways in which individuals interpret traumatic experiences, as well as the ways that they manage challenging emotions in general, may statistically predict post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms to a greater extent than does trauma itself. Negative trauma appraisals, generalized emotion regulation (ER) difficulties, and low levels of self-compassion have each been shown to influence the connection between trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptoms. However, little is known regarding how these processes interact, or their relative contributions to mental health after trauma. The current study analyzed data from 466 university students who completed self-report measures of childhood abue, PTSD-symptoms, trauma appraisals, ER difficulties, and self-compassion. Childhood abuse exposure and PTSD symptoms were positively asociated with negative trauma appraisals and ER difficulties, and negatively associated with self-compassion. Self-compassion was inversely associated with negative trauma appraisals and ER difficulties. Multiple mediation analyses demonstrated that negative trauma appraisals, ER difficulties, and levels of self-compassion fully explained the link between abuse exposure and PTSD symptoms via several specific pathways. These findings suggest that researchers, clinicians, and abuse survivors can benefit from addressing these interconnected domains during treatment and recovery processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is robust evidence that the interparental relationship and parenting behaviors each have a significant influence on children's risk for emotional (internalizing) and behavioral (externalizing) problems. Indeed, interventions targeting the interparental relationship and parenting processes show significant intervention-related reductions in child internalizing and externalizing problems. However, most evidence-based parenting- and couple-focused interventions result in small to medium effects on children's emotional and behavior problems. It is proposed that there is opportunity to improve upon these interventions through incorporation of knowledge from quantitative genetic research. Three core recommendations are provided for practitioners engaging in intervention work with children and families. These recommendations are contextualized relative to what quantitative genetic studies can tell us about the role of the interparental relationship and parenting behaviors on child outcomes.

AB This meta-analytic review includes 135 studies, representing 17 countries, of child and adolescent (ages 4-17) samples of overt and relational peer victimization and examines the magnitude of overlap between forms of victimization and associations with five social-psychological adjustment indices. Results indicate a strong intercorrelation between forms of victimization ((r) over bar = .72). No gender difference with regard to relational victimization was found, but boys were slightly higher in overt victimization. Overt victimization is more strongly associated with overt aggression; relational victimization is more strongly related to internalizing problems, lower levels of received prosocial behavior from peers, and relational aggression. Both forms are related to externalizing problems. Age and method of assessment were explored as potential sources of variability in effect sizes.

AB After decades of research on early attachment relationships, questions remain concerning whether the evidence supports claims made by attachment theory, in particular, that variation in early attachment predicts children's developmental adaptation or maladaptation, and that characteristics of children's temperament does not determine attachment. To evaluate these claims, we conducted meta-analyses on early attachment and children's social competence with peers, externalizing problems, internalizing symptoms, and temperament. In this article, we summarize our findings, which support attachment theory-though we note caveats. We also call for new measurement models, a focus on mediating and moderating mechanisms, and multisite replications.

AB The developmental trajectories and origins of six cognitive vulnerabilities implicated in depression and anxiety among children were examined. A community sample of 7-year-old children and their parents were recruited (N=302), and follow-up assessments were made at ages 8, 9, and 11. Although the six cognitive vulnerabilities (i.e., negative cognitive style, dysfunctional attitudes, ruminative style, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and fear of negative evaluation) were conceptualized as disorder-specific vulnerabilities, a common latent factor accounted for their shared features. This core vulnerability represented a negative repetitive cognitive style pervaded with a sense of uncontrollability and uncertainty. Latent growth analysis revealed that the averaged trajectory was stable over time. Child negative affectivity, socioeconomic status, and negative life events (assessed at age 7) prospectively predicted the core vulnerability intercept factor. These findings provide novel evidence for a transdiagnostic mechanism that bears directly on a developmentally informed model for child internalizing symptoms.

AB Co-rumination refers to the process of engaging in repeated discussion of personal problems in dyadic relationships. The current systematic review and meta-analysis provided an evaluation of the relationship between co-rumination and internalizing problems in children, adolescents and young adults, along with an investigation of potential moderator variables. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they quantitatively assessed the relationship between co-rumination and depression, anxiety and/or internalizing problems using validated measures. An electronic search was conducted in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Medline, Scopus and the Cochrane Library database of systematic reviews for studies published since 2002. In addition, unpublished studies were located by contacting authors in the field and by online searches of dissertation databases. Thirty-eight studies were deemed eligible for inclusion comprising a total of 12829 community-based participants. A random-effects model was employed in the analysis, and effect sizes were obtained exclusively from cross-sectional data. Small to moderate effect sizes were found across four outcomes representing internalizing problems (mean corrected correlation range 0.14 to 0.26), with no significant variability across these variables. Female participants were found to score significantly higher on measures of co-rumination compared with males (d=-0.55). Moderator analyses revealed mixed findings. No significant effects were found for age, gender or publication status. A significant effect was found for co-rumination questionnaire version used (p=0.05), and a marginal effect found for co-rumination partner (same-sex best friend versus other confidants; p=0.08). These findings indicate that co-rumination may have a modest but significant association with internalizing problems. The implications of these findings and directions for further research are discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The present study investigated whether cortisol stress responses of 6-year-olds were associated with their behavioral functioning at school. Additionally, the moderating role of stress in the family environment was examined. To this end, 149 healthy children (M-age = 6.09 years; 70 girls) participated in an age-appropriate innovative social evaluative stress test. Saliva cortisol samples were collected six times during the stress test to calculate two indices of the cortisol stress response: cortisol stress reactivity and total stress cortisol. Teachers assessed children's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. Stress in the family environment was operationalized as maternally reported parenting stress. Results indicated a significant increase in cortisol concentrations in response to the stressor. No significant associations were found between cortisol stress responses and behavioral functioning at school and there was no evidence for moderation by maternal parenting stress. Potential theoretical and methodological explanations for these results are discussed.

AB Moderate inverse correlations are typically found between well-being and mental illness. We aimed to investigate the role of genes and environments in explaining the relationships between two aspects of well-being and two measures of internalizing symptoms. Altogether, 4700 pairs of 16-year-old twins contributed data on subjective happiness and life satisfaction, as well as symptoms of depression and emotional problems. Well-being was moderately correlated with internalizing symptoms (range=-0.45, -0.58). Multivariate twin model-fitting indicated both genetic and environmental overlap. Life satisfaction and happiness demonstrated different patterns of overlap, with stronger genetic links between life satisfaction and depression. Non-shared environmental influences were largely specific to each trait. This study supports the theory of mental health and illness being partly (but not entirely) correlated dimensions. There are also significant genetic and environmental factors to identify for well-being that go beyond the absence of mental illness. It is therefore possible that different interventions are needed for treating mental illness and promoting mental health.

AB Animal findings of long-term effects of maternal behaviors mediated via altered GR gene expression will, if translated into humans, have far reaching implications for our understanding of child and adolescent psychopathology. We have previously shown that mothers' self-reported stroking of their infants modifies associations between prenatal depression and anxiety and child outcomes at 29 weeks and 2.5 years. Here, we examine whether the effect of early maternal stroking is evident at 3.5 years, and in a much larger sample than in previous publications. A general population sample of 1233 first-time mothers completed anxiety measures at 20 weeks gestation, 865 reported on infant stroking at 9 weeks, and 813 on child symptoms at 3.5 years. Maternal stroking moderated the association between pregnancy-specific anxiety and internalizing (p = 0.010) and externalizing (p = 0.004) scores, such that an effect of PSA to increase symptoms was markedly reduced for mothers who reported high levels of stroking. There was no effect of maternal stroking on general anxiety. The findings confirm the previously reported effect of maternal stroking, and in a much larger sample. They indicate that there are long-term effects of early maternal stroking, modifying associations between prenatal anxiety and child emotional and behavioral symptoms.

AB When adolescents live with a parent with mental illness, they often partly take over the parental role. Little is known about the consequences of this so-called parentification on the adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. This survey study examined this effect cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a sample of 118 adolescents living with a parent suffering from mental health problems. In addition, the study examined a possible indirect effect via perceived stress. Path analyses were used to examine the direct associations between parentification and problem behavior as well as the indirect relations via perceived stress. The results showed that parentification was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems cross-sectionally, but it predicted only internalizing problems 1year later. An indirect effect of parentification on adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems via perceived stress was found, albeit only cross-sectionally. These findings imply that parentification can be stressful for adolescents who live with a parent with mental health problems, and that a greater awareness of parentification is needed to prevent adolescents from developing internalizing problems.

AB Background: Previous research has consistently shown that parenting behavior and children's psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing problems are closely interrelated. However, little is known about the impact of culture in this field.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate parenting behaviors, childhood psychopathology, and their interrelation in Iran, representing a rather collective culture, and in Germany, representing an individualistic culture.
   Materials and Methods: In this comparative study, participants were 221 children from Iran and Germany, who voluntarily agreed to participate. The sample was collected between 2010 and 2011. Levels of children psychopathology were assessed, using the child depression inventory (CDI), and youth self-report (YSR) questionnaire. Parents completed children behavior check list (CBCL), and parenting scale (PS). Repeated measures ANOVAs, independent sample t-test, and Spearman correlations were used.
   Results: Iranian parents reported a more frequent use of parenting style of laxness when compared to German parents (P < 0.001). Furthermore, both children and parents in Iran reported more symptoms of internalizing and externalizing problems than the German sample (P < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a stronger relationship between over-reactivity with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the Iranian group, while in the German sample, over-reactivity was related only to externalizing symptoms (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The study suggests that dysfunctional parenting such as over-reactivity is related to children's psychopathology across different cultures. Nonetheless, our research also provides evidence that specific parenting practices and the reported levels of childhood psychopathology differ between collective and individualistic cultures, and that culture seems to be an important factor in this field.

AB A substantial proportion of adolescents are non-responders to well-established treatments for anxiety and depression, and many existent approaches do not adequately address comorbidity. There is a need to develop and evaluate unified treatments for adolescents that flexibly address higher order factors shared among internalizing or emotional disorders. The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A) is a transdiagnostic treatment that targets shared vulnerability and maintenance factors in a flexible format. This study examined initial outcomes of a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of the UP-A. The UP-A outperformed waitlist at mid-treatment with respect to disorder severity and functional impairment, and there was a significant treatment effect in favor of the UP-A on all outcome measures at post-treatment. Within-subjects analyses collapsing across participants revealed significant improvements on outcome measures over time. Results support further study of the UP-A and its potential efficacy in treating adolescent anxiety and depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit emotional problems, which can be associated with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Parent co-regulation is often associated with child ER and emotional problems, though little work has been done with reference to youth with ASD. This study investigated the association among parent co-regulation, child ER, and internalizing and externalizing problems in 51 parents and school-aged children with ASD. Parent co-regulation strategies and scaffolding were not associated with parent-reported levels of child internalizing problems. Parent scaffolding and child ER predicted externalizing problems, after controlling for child age and IQ. Suggestions for future research on parent involvement in the emotional development of children with ASD are discussed, as well as implications for ER-focused interventions.

AB The study examines gender differences in the moderating effects of parental warmth and hostility on the associations between corporal punishment and child externalizing problem behavior in China. Three hundred fifty-eight preschool-aged children and their fathers and mothers were recruited to participate in this survey. The findings revealed that parental hostility but not parental warmth would moderate the associations between parental corporal punishment and child externalizing problem behavior, and the moderating effects had some interesting gender differences. Specifically, maternal hostility strengthened the link between paternal corporal punishment and child externalizing problem behavior for boys but not for girls, and paternal hostility strengthened the link between paternal corporal punishment and child externalizing problem behavior for girls but not for boys. These findings broaden our understanding of the contextual factors that account for the associations between harsh discipline and child outcomes, particularly within the Chinese cultural context.

AB This study was performed to examine the role of harsh parental discipline in mediating and moderating the effects of environmental adversity (family socioeconomic disadvantage and adverse life events) on emotional and behavioral problems across early-to-middle childhood. The sample included 16,916 children (48% female; 24% non-White) from the U.K.'s Millennium Cohort Study. We analyzed trajectories of conduct, hyperactivity, and emotional problems, measured at ages 3, 5, and 7 years, using growth curve models. Harsh parental discipline was measured at these ages with parent-reported items on the frequency of using the physical and verbal discipline tactics of smacking, shouting at, and "telling off" the child. As expected, family socioeconomic disadvantage and adverse life events were significantly associated with emotional and behavioral problems. Harsh parental discipline was related to children's trajectories of problems, and it moderated, but did not explain, the effect of environmental risk on these trajectories. High-risk children experiencing harsh parental discipline had the highest levels of conduct problems and hyperactivity across the study period. In addition, harsh parental discipline predicted an increase in emotional symptoms over time in high-risk children, unseen in their counterparts experiencing low levels of harsh parental discipline. However, children in low-risk families were also negatively affected by harsh parental discipline concurrently and over time. In conclusion, harsh parental discipline predicted emotional and behavioral problems in high-and low-risk children and moderated the effects of family poverty and adversity on these problems.

AB Mothers' and fathers' emotion socialization (ES) practices have been widely associated with child socioemotional outcomes. To extend this research, we examined the bidirectional relationship between parent ES practices (supportive and non-supportive parenting) and internalizing behavior problems in children of Anglo and Latino parents. Participants were 182 mothers and 162 fathers and their children with or without intellectual disability (ID). We compared the stability of mother and father ES practices across child ages 4-8. We utilized cross-lagged panel modeling to examine the bidirectional relationship between parents' ES and child internalizing behavior problems. Emotion socialization practices differed across time by parent gender, with mothers displaying higher levels of supportive parenting and lower levels of non-supportive parenting than fathers. Cross-lagged panel models revealed differential relationships between child internalizing behaviors and emotion socialization practices by parent gender and by ethnicity. Implications for intervening with culturally diverse families of children with ID are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This project examines the substance use and mental health concerns of a cross-sectoral, national, service-seeking sample of adolescents and emerging adults using an extended version of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GSS). It also aims to provide incremental evidence of the psychometric properties of the GSS.
   Methods: A sample of 2313 youth aged 12-24 years who presented for service participated in the project. Youth were recruited from 89 participating services across Canada representing eight major clinical and non-clinical sectors. Participants completed the GSS and provided sociodemographic data.
   Results: The majority of youth presenting for services endorsed concerns on the GSS and would be likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a disorder in a full diagnostic assessment according to the norms for the scale, while many endorsed multiple concerns. This was true in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Externalizing concerns and suicidality were significantly more common in younger participants, while substance use was significantly more common in older youth. Females were more likely to endorse internalizing and suicidality concerns, while males endorsed more substance use and crime/violence concerns. Internalizing and suicidality concerns were also more common in Canada's northerly regions. The reliability of the GSS was confirmed, however the factor structure revealed problems.
   Conclusions: Youth presenting across clinical and non-clinical service sectors endorse high levels of need, supporting the importance of universal, cross-sectoral screening. The GSS is a practical tool that service providers across sectors can employ to identify the addiction and mental health service needs of youth, although further psychometric work is warranted. Implications for screening and treatment in community contexts are discussed.

AB Background: A great part of the literature has confirmed the importance of both child and parents reports as source of factual information, especially for childhood emotional syndromes. In our study we aimed at: (i) calculating mother-child agreement and (ii) evaluating factorial structure of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) questionnaire in an Italian clinical sample. The novelty of this contribution is two-fold: first, from a clinical point of view, we investigated the parent-child agreement level and examined separately the factorial structures of both parent and child versions of the SCARED for the first time in an Italian clinical sample. Second, unlike previous studies, we used statistical approaches specifically suited to account for the ordinal nature of the collected variables.
   Method: In a clinical sample of 171 children and adolescents aged 8-18 and their mothers we evaluated inter-rater agreement using weighted kappa indices to assess agreement for each item belonging to a certain SCARED subscale. Exploratory factor analysis for ordinal data was then performed on the polychoric correlation matrix calculated on SCARED items. Differences in the numbers of symptoms reported by children and parents were evaluated as well.
   Results and Conclusions: Our results reveal moderate to strong mother-child agreement. A significant age effect is present. Two different factorial solutions emerged for parent and child SCARED versions (a 5 factor structure for parents and a 6 factor solution in the child version, including a new factor Worry about Parents). This study confirmed the importance of evaluating both child and parent reports in assessment protocols for anxiety disorders. Our findings could help clinicians to determine which information, and from which rater, must be accounted for in evaluating treatment decisions. Moreover, we find that patients characteristics, such as gender and age, should be taken into account when assessing agreement.

AB Prior research has demonstrated that adolescent delinquency and depression are prospectively related to adult alcohol use and that adolescent religiosity may influence these relationships. However, such associations have not been investigated using person-centered approaches that provide nuanced explorations of these constructs. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we examined whether adolescent delinquency and depression differentiated typologies of adult alcohol users and whether these relationships varied across religiosity profiles. Three typologies of self-identified Christian adolescents and 4 types of adult alcohol users were identified via latent profile analysis. Delinquency and depression were related to increased likelihood of membership in heavy drinking or problematic alcohol use profiles, but this relationship was most evident among those likely to be involved in religious practices. These results demonstrate the importance of person-centered approaches in characterizing the influences of internalizing and externalizing behaviors on subsequent patterns of alcohol use.

   ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
AB Children exposed to extreme early-life neglect such as in institutional rearing are at heightened risk for developing depression and anxiety disorders, and internalizing problems more broadly. These outcomes are believed to be due to alterations in the development of neural circuitry that supports emotion regulation. The specific neurodevelopmental changes that contribute to these difficulties are largely unknown. This study examined whether microstructural alterations in white matter pathways predicted long-term risk for internalizing problems in institutionally reared children. Data from 69 children were drawn from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized clinical trial of foster care for institutionally reared children. White matter was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) when children were between 8 and 10 years of age. Internalizing symptoms were assessed at the time of the MRI scan, and once children reached 12-14 years of age. Results indicated that neglect-associated alterations in the external capsule and corpus callosum partially explained links between institutional rearing status and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence. Findings shed light on neural-mechanisms contributing to increased risk for emotional difficulties among children reared in adverse conditions and have implications for prevention and intervention.

AB Aim of this systematic review is to assess short and long-lasting effects of antenatal exposure to untreated maternal depressive symptoms. Pertinent articles were identified through combined searches of Science.gov, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases (through August 2015). Forty-three, selected articles revealed that untreated gestational depression and even depressive symptoms during pregnancy may have untoward effects on the developing fetus (hyperactivity, irregular fetal heart rate), newborns (increased cortisol and norepinephrine levels, decreased dopamine levels, altered EEG patterns, reduced vagal tone, stress/depressive-like behaviors, and increased rates of premature deaths and neonatal intensive care unit admission), and children (increased salivary cortisol levels, internalizing and externalizing problems, and central adiposity). During adolescence, an independent association exists between maternal antenatal mood symptoms and a slight increase in criminal behaviors. In contrast, the relationship between gestational depression and increased risks of prematurity and low birth weight remains controversial. Given this background, when making clinical decisions, clinicians should weigh the growing evidences suggesting the detrimental and prolonged effects in offspring of untreated antenatal depression and depressive symptoms during pregnancy against the known and emerging concerns associated with in utero exposure to antidepressants.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) strategies have a clear impact on mental health outcomes. In 2 studies (N = 695, N = 433) we investigated gender differences in the use of 2 ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) to handle parent-child conflict in Taiwanese adolescents. We also identified the implications of these differences for some negative emotions (self-blame and resentment) and internalizing problems (psychosomatic symptoms and social withdrawal). Results of the correlation analyses in both studies indicated that reappraisal and suppression ER strategies are positively correlated only in male Taiwanese adolescents. Hierarchical regression analyses in the second study confirmed that reappraisal buffers male but not female adolescents against the negative effects of suppression on the arousal of negative affect and internalizing problems.

AB This study evaluated how change in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms was associated with residualized change in comorbid personality disorder (PD) features and vice versa over the course of 5-10 years. The sample was comprised of 79 female rape survivors who met criteria for PTSD and who were a part of a larger study examining the effects of trauma-focused therapy. PTSD was assessed with the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS-IV ( 1)] and PD features were assessed with the DSM-IV dimensional PD scales on the Schedule for Non-adaptive and Adaptive Personality [SNAP ( 2)]. PTSD symptom severity and PD features were assessed at baseline and between 5 and 10 years after completing treatment. Multiple regression analyses revealed that PTSD symptom change was related to residualized change in PD severity for paranoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, avoidant, and dependent PD (beta s ranged from -0.23 to -0.33; all ps < 0.05). In addition, for borderline and antisocial PDs, longitudinal stability of the PD was attenuated among those with greater PTSD symptom improvement (i.e., the relationship between these PDs over time was altered as a function of PTSD symptom change; beta s ranged from -0.27 to -0.29; all ps < 0.05). Similarly, change in severity of paranoid, schizotypal, antisocial, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) PD was associated with residualized change in PTSD symptoms (beta s ranged from -0.32 to -0.41; all ps < 0.05), and the longitudinal stability of PTSD was attenuated as a product of change in OC PD (beta = -0.27; p < 0.02). These findings suggest that these two sets of disorders may impact one another substantially, altering the course of even chronic, characterological conditions. This carries important clinical implications for the treatment of both PTSD and PDs.

AB The current study sought to examine the impact of family functioning (i.e., balanced cohesion and balanced flexibility) and individual factors (i.e., familism and global self-worth) on the incidence of mental health problems in a sample of Latino early adolescents. Additionally, the current study examined the way in which individual factors mediated the effects of family functioning on mental health problems in Latino youth. Eighty Latino parent-adolescent dyads participated in the current study, including 66 mothers and 14 fathers, as well as 42 female early adolescents and 38 male early adolescents. Parents and youth completed questionnaires assessing the incidence of mental health problems in youth, and adolescents completed additional questionnaires assessing acculturation, family functioning, familism, and global self-worth. Results indicated that adolescent acculturation was not significantly related to mental health outcomes in youth. However, adolescents' reports of increased family functioning predicted decreased externalizing problems in youth, as well as increased levels of familism and global self-worth in youth. Increased levels of familism predicted decreased externalizing problems in youth, and increased levels of global self-worth predicted decreased internalizing and externalizing problems in youth. Mediation results indicated that individual factors mediated the effects of family functioning on externalizing problems in youth. These results highlight the associations between family functioning, familism, global self-worth and the incidence of mental health problems and provide valuable information on the way in which individual variables mediate the effects of family functioning on mental health problems in Latino early adolescents.

AB The purpose of the current study was to predict concurrent levels of problem behaviors from young children's baseline cortisol and attachment classification, a proxy for the quality of caregiving experienced. In a sample of 58 children living at or below the federal poverty threshold, children's baseline cortisol levels, attachment classification, and problem behaviors were assessed at 17 months of age. We hypothesized that an interaction between baseline cortisol and attachment classification would predict problem behaviors above and beyond any main effects of baseline cortisol and attachment. However, based on limited prior research, we did not predict whether or not this interaction would be more consistent with diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility models. Consistent with diathesis-stress theory, the results indicated no significant differences in problem behavior levels among children with high baseline cortisol. In contrast, children with low baseline cortisol had the highest level of problem behaviors in the context of a disorganized attachment relationship. However, in the context of a secure attachment relationship, children with low baseline cortisol looked no different, with respect to problem behavior levels, then children with high cortisol levels. These findings have substantive implications for the socioemotional development of children reared in poverty. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   PSYCHOSIS; DEVELOP SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB Objective: To review findings with clinical relevance that add to knowledge about antisocial and aggressive behaviour among persons with schizophrenia.
   Method: Nonsystematic literature review.
   Results: Recent evidence shows that individuals who develop schizophrenia present cognitive deficits, psychotic-like experiences, and internalizing and externalizing problems from childhood onwards. Many of their relatives present not only schizophrenia-related disorders but also antisocial behaviour. While the increased risk of aggressive behaviour among persons with schizophrenia has been robustly established, recent findings show that by first contact with clinical services for psychosis, most people with schizophrenia who will engage in aggressive behaviour may be identified. At first episode, 2 distinct types are distinguishable: those who present a history of antisocial and aggressive behaviour since childhood and those who began engaging in aggressive behaviour as illness onsets. Antipsychotic medications and other treatments shown to be effective for schizophrenia are needed by both types of patients. Additionally, those with a history of antisocial and aggressive behaviour since childhood require cognitive-behavioural programs aimed at reducing these behaviours and promoting prosocial behaviour. Reducing physical victimisation and cannabis use will likely reduce aggressive behaviour. Evidence suggests that threats to hurt others often precede assaults.
   Conclusions: At first contact with services, patients with schizophrenia who have engaged in aggressive behaviour should be identified and treated for schizophrenia and for aggression. Research is needed to identify interactions between genotypes and environmental factors, from conception onwards, that promote and that protect against the development of aggressive behaviour among persons with schizophrenia.

AB This study examined the trajectory of problem behaviours in domestically adopted children in South Korea as they aged. This study used the Panel Study on Korean Adopted Children's longitudinal, three-wave data (2006, 2008 and 2010). Although data were collected at three time points, our data consisted of six time points, which covered the 5-10years age range of the adopted children at the time of survey. One hundred sixty-four children were included in the analysis, 75 of whom contributed to one time point, 74 to two time points and 15 to three time points. The trajectory of the problem behaviours of adopted children was examined using a piecewise hierarchical linear growth model. Because the initial exploration of the data suggested non-linear changes in behaviour problems over time, we split the growth trajectory into two time periods: Time 1 (5-7years) and Time 2 (7-10years). A two-rate model was used to estimate separate slopes for the two time periods. Results showed that the externalizing and internalizing problems of adopted children have different trajectories. Internalizing problems did not show significant changes after 5years of age, while externalizing problems increased until 7years of age and decreased significantly thereafter.

AB Children who come into contact with the child welfare system are at greater risk of experiencing internalizing and externalizing behaviors. This secondary analysis of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well Being explored how caregiver characteristics and behaviors, and caregiver child closeness influence these outcomes over time. The final sample was 877 caregiver and adolescent (11-17 years old) dyads. Weighted multivariate regression analyses were performed. Caregiver characteristics associated with depressive symptoms included age and education; caregiver health was not associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors. For adolescents, being female, older, or Hispanic was associated with internalizing behaviors. Although not significant for externalizing behaviors, caregiver adolescent closeness was protective against internalizing behaviors. Understanding factors that contribute to the mental health of child-welfare-exposed adolescents has far reaching implications for family-based interventions with child-welfare-involved youth.

   This was a cross-sectional study of children with epilepsy, and normal controls enrolled between July 2013 to June 2015. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used as a tool to assess the behavior based on parents reported observation.
   There were 60 children with epilepsy in 2-5 years and 80 in 6-14 years age groups, and 74 and 83 unaffected controls, respectively. Mean CBCL scores for most of the domains in children of both age groups were significantly higher than controls. Clinical range abnormalities were mainly detected in externalizing domain (23.3%) in 2-5 years, and in both internalizing (21.2%) and externalizing (45%) domains in children of 6-14 years. Younger age of onset, frequency of seizures and duration of disease had significant correlation with behavioral problems in both the age groups. Antiepileptic drug polytherapy was significantly associated with internalizing problems in older children.
   Age at onset, frequency of seizures and duration of disease were found to be significantly associated with occurrence of behavioral problems.

AB CASE: Lucy is a 12-year-old Latina whose mother brought her to the pediatric clinic for help with her anxiety symptoms, "hearing voices," and episodes of "spacing out." Lucy did not cry at birth secondary to vocal cord paralysis and still has the tracheostomy performed at a few days of life. In addition to her neonatal intensive care unit stay, she has been hospitalized for pneumonia. Her mother says she is "sickly" and has a weak immune system due to her asthma symptoms. Lucy also experiences somatic complaints related to gastroesophageal reflux and constipation.
   Lucy is described as being "in another world" and must be called several times before she responds. Lucy states she is nervous "all the time" and often experiences a fast heartbeat, chest pain, and headache. Her attention and internalizing problems began at age 4 years and have worsened since she entered adolescence. When she is alone in the dark, she sees an unknown person and becomes frightened. She hears the voice of her paternal uncle telling her something will harm her mother and runs crying to "check" on her. Lucy also says she hears voices of paternal family members fighting. She has dreamed that her paternal uncle stabbed her in an alley. Lucy reports experiencing sadness and feelings of wanting to die. She has not tried to harm herself and has no plan to do this. She states that she does not know when she is awake or asleep and "hate people talking in my head." She does not report drug use.
   Lucy's family is bilingual, English and Spanish. Her mother works part-time as a nutritionist, and her father is a machinist. Her father receives counseling for anger management, and there have been previous unsubstantiated child abuse reports involving Lucy and her younger brother. The maternal uncle has been involved in a gang and attempts to phone Lucy's mother, who does not wish to have contact with him. Lucy's mother expresses strong Christian religious and spiritual beliefs, including demons and spirits that may enter her home and can be cast off with prayer. Recently, the family purchased a "cuadro" (picture) at a yard sale, and Lucy's mother said this resulted in footprints in the bathroom that are disappearing with prayer, guidance from the church minister, and discarding of the "cuadro."
   The primary pediatrician ordered a home school program, given Lucy's frequent illnesses. She is progressing well with a special education teacher. Her recent psychological evaluation at school showed a below average nonverbal intelligence quotient, with strengths in the areas of perceptual, logical, and abstract relationships. Lucy's mother in the past has been hesitant to follow through with psychiatric evaluation because "it is up to God."
   In the clinic, she is pale and slender with an ethereal look. She is awake and alert with appropriate affect and mentation. Her tracheostomy is intact without any respiratory distress noted. There are no signs of drug use or active hallucinations. You are left wondering whether these voices need psychiatric management.

AB The current study examined longitudinal relations between overt and relational victimization, sadness and anger dysregulation, and depressive and anxiety symptoms across 6 months among an ethnically diverse sample of sixth graders (N = 485; 48% male; 65% African American). No direct longitudinal relations were found between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms or between internalizing symptoms and peer victimization, and these findings were consistent across gender and disability status. The relation between overt victimization and subsequent increases in relational victimization was stronger for youth with versus without high incidence disabilities. Significant indirect effects were found for overt victimization on both depressive and anxiety symptoms via sadness dysregulation. The strength of the indirect effects did not differ by gender. Findings highlight the merits of school-based violence prevention programs that address emotional management and are embedded within multi-tiered school environment interventions.

AB Improving mental health services for youth in usual care (UC) is one of the most critical issues in mental health services research. Identification of change groups in UC (e.g.,recovery, improvement, no response, deterioration) can help researchers gain a richer understanding of UC and facilitate efforts to tailor UC to individuals who may not be responding well to treatment. This study used the reliable change index (RCI; Jacobson & Truax, 1991) to examine change groups within youth UC on two parent report outcome measures-symptom severity and functioning-using a large, naturalistic sample of youth (N = 672) treated in UC served at four clinics operating under a large county-wide public mental health authority. Results indicated that the majority of youth exhibited no reliable change. Furthermore, findings revealed low concordance between how youth were classified on both outcome measures. Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict group membership from an expanded set of youth demographic and clinical variables. Findings indicated that baseline problem severity and lower baseline functioning generally predicted higher likelihood of being classified into a more positive change group. Older age predicted increased likelihood of being in a more positive change group, while diagnosis of an internalizing disorder or serious mental illness (SMI) both predicted greater likelihood of falling into a more negative change group. Overall, these results suggest the importance of a more nuanced understanding of change in UC, as well as work aimed at identifying targets for improvement for youth who are not responding well.

AB There is considerable evidence that parental corporal punishment (CP) is positively associated with children's behavioral and mental health problems. However, there is very little evidence addressing whether CP perpetrated by teachers or school staff is similarly associated with problematic student functioning. To address this gap in the research literature, data were collected from students in a locale where school CP continues to be widely practiced. Participants were 519 adolescents attending public or private schools in Puducherry, a city in eastern India. Students completed surveys assessing school CP, internalizing problems, social support, and resilience. The results indicated that 62% of the students reported experiencing school CP in the past 12 months, with males and those attending public schools being significantly more likely to report school CP than females and those in private schools. Youth who reported school CP reported more anxiety and depression. That relation was more pronounced in youth who reported family tension. Social support and resilience did not moderate the relations. The findings add to the substantial evidence about negative associations regarding the use of CP but in a new venuethe school, and provide some evidence for the need to change how students are disciplined in schools in India and elsewhere.

AB Rumination, and particularly ruminative brooding, perpetuates dysphoric mood states and contributes to the emergence of depression. Studies of adults and older adolescents have characterized the association between rumination and intrinsic functional connectivity within default mode (DMN), salience (SN) and executive control (ECN) networks; we know little, however, about the brain network basis of rumination during early puberty, a sensitive period for network reorganization. 112 early puberty boys and girls completed resting-state scans, the Ruminative Response Scale, and the Youth Self-Report questionnaire. Using independent components analysis and dual regression, we quantified coherence for each individual in networks of interest (SN, ECN, DMN) and in non-relevant networks (motor, visual) in which we predicted no correlations with behavioral measures. Boys and girls did not differ in levels of rumination or internalizing symptoms, or in coherence for any network. The relation between SN network coherence and rumination; however, and specifically ruminative brooding, was moderated by sex: greater SN coherence was associated with higher levels of brooding in girls but not in boys. Further, in girls, brooding mediated the relation between SN coherence and internalizing symptoms. These results point to coherence within the SN as a potential neurodevelopmental marker of risk for depression in early pubertal girls.

AB Background: All stages of development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have not been equally studied. While initiation of drinking has been given considerable attention, other stages have not been as thoroughly investigated. It is not clear whether the same factors are associated consistently across early and late transitions in AUD involvement. High-risk family samples that are enriched for AUD vulnerability and transitions in AUD development offer an opportunity to examine influences across multiple stages of AUD development.
   Methods: Data from adolescents and young adults from high-risk families were used to study 4 transitions in AUD development-time to first drink, first drink to first problem, first drink to first diagnosis, and first problem to first diagnosis. Cox modeling was used to compare associations of parental AUD, parental separation, peer substance use, offspring ever-use of cannabis, trauma exposures, and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology across transitions.
   Results: Hazards of most transitions were elevated for those who had ever used cannabis, those who attributed substance use to their peers, those with externalizing disorders, and those with parents with AUD. Many risk factors were linked to early initiation of alcohol, particularly cannabis use. Internalizing disorders were associated with later stages. Nonassaultive trauma was associated only with early initiation; assaultive trauma was not associated with any transition.
   Conclusions: In this large, ethnically diverse sample of high-risk youth, significant influences across transitions were fairly consistent, with externalizing disorders and cannabis ever-use elevating the likelihood of each stage, and peer and parental (and especially maternal AUD) influences linked to initiation and some later stages. Finally, in light of the increasingly permissive legal and social stances toward cannabis in the United States, the marked elevations of all alcohol outcomes observed for cannabis use underscore the importance of studying the underpinnings of this relationship.

AB The co-occurring development of internalizing and externalizing problems were examined in an inception cohort of 392 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 3 who were assessed on four occasions. Results indicated that internalizing and externalizing problems were stable over time and highly comorbid. Joint trajectory analysis suggested that 13% of the sample followed a dual high-risk trajectory. High risk was not found to be associated with intellectual ability or autism spectrum disorder symptom severity but was linked to lower income and gender: more girls than boys were found in the high/stable internalizing problems trajectory. The results suggest that 1 in 4 preschoolers followed a trajectory of internalizing or externalizing problems (or a combination of the two) that could be characterized as clinically elevated.

AB Despite major advances in the development of interventions for youth anxiety and depression, approximately 30% of youths with anxiety do not respond to cognitive behavioral treatment, and youth depression treatments yield modest symptom decreases overall. Identifying networks of modifiable risk and maintenance factors that contribute to both youth anxiety and depression (i.e., internalizing problems) may enhance and broaden treatment benefits by informing the development of mechanism-targeted interventions. A particularly powerful network is the rich array of family processes linked to internalizing problems (e.g., parenting styles, parental mental health problems, and sibling relationships). Here, we propose a new theoretical model, the triadic model of family process, to organize theory and evidence around modifiable, transdiagnostic family factors that may contribute to youth internalizing problems. We describe the model's implications for intervention, and we propose strategies for testing the model in future research. The model provides a framework for studying associations among family processes, their relation to youth internalizing problems, and family-based strategies for strengthening prevention and treatment.

AB The purposes of the present study were to: (1) describe rates of peer victimization in young adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, (2) evaluate the association between types of peer victimization (i.e., physical, relational, and reputational) and internalizing problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and self-esteem), and (3) examine whether associations between victimization and internalizing problems differ for males or females. Participants were 131 middle-school students (ages 11-15 years, 73 % male, 76 % White) diagnosed with ADHD who completed ratings of victimization, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Over half of the participants (57 %) reported experiencing at least one victimization behavior at a rate of once per week or more, with higher rates of relational victimization (51 %) than reputational victimization (17 %) or physical victimization (14 %). Males reported experiencing more physical victimization than females, but males and females did not differ in rates of relational or reputational victimization. Whereas relational and physical victimization were both uniquely associated with greater anxiety for both males and females, relational victimization was associated with greater depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem for males but not females. These findings indicate that young adolescents with ADHD frequently experience peer victimization and that the association between victimization and internalizing problems among young adolescents with ADHD differs as a result of victimization type, internalizing domain, and sex.

ID GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; CHILDREN; ACCULTURATION
AB Understanding the immigrant paradox on health outcomes among UK's immigrant adolescents will greatly complement the research on immigrants that has already been established there by economists and interdisciplinary fields. This study used the first Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 2004-2010 database (N = 15,770) to determine a) whether there was evidence of the immigrant paradox on internalizing mental health symptoms between first generation (n = 753) and second plus generation (n = 3042) 14/15 year old immigrant adolescents in England and b) whether differences (if any) were moderated by ethnicity group membership (Black African, Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Asian Other, White Immigrant). Findings demonstrate that overall first generation adolescent immigrants had statistically fewer internalizing symptoms as compared to second plus generation, and that this was especially true for Black African adolescents. Effect sizes measures however indicated that these differences were negligible. Implications for protective factors and future studies are briefly discussed.

AB The purpose of the study was to study the associations of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and coffee use and insomnia complaints (IC) in adolescents with special consideration of the influence of coffee consumption on these relationships. 7698 Subjects aged 11-17 years were investigated in a cross-sectional study within the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents. Self-report questionnaires were distributed to the participants. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to assess possible effects of coffee consumption on the association of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use with IC. Common risk factors for insomnia were included in the adjusted analyses. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and coffee use displayed significant bivariate associations with IC. After adjusting the first three substances for coffee consumption, their associations with IC were reduced considerably. After additionally adjusting for other potential confounders (age, gender, socio-economic status, externalizing and internalizing psychiatric problems, media use, bodyweight, medical condition), frequent coffee consumption, high alcohol intake and frequent smoking contributed to the prediction of IC in male subjects while frequent coffee consumption and high alcohol intake predicted the occurrence of IC in females. Coffee consumption could be an important risk factor for IC in adolescents and it significantly affects the association of smoking, alcohol, and marijuana with IC. Future research that includes long-term studies about psychoactive substance use (PSU) and sleep should also consider coffee consumption. Parents, educators, clinicians, and researchers should be aware of the potentially hazardous influence of PSU, especially coffee, alcohol and tobacco, on sleep in young individuals.

AB Childhood maltreatment is associated with alterations in neural architecture that potentially put these children at increased risk for psychopathology. Alterations in white matter (WM) tracts have been reported, however no study to date has investigated WM connectivity in brain networks in maltreated children to quantify global and local abnormalities through graph theoretical analyses of DTI data. We aimed for a multilevel investigation examining the DTI-based structural connectome and its associations with basal cortisol levels of 25 children with documented maltreatment experiences before age 3, and 24 matched controls (age: 10.6 +/- 1.75 years). On the global and lobar level, maltreated children showed significant reductions in global connectivity strength, local connectivity and increased path length, suggesting deviations from the small-world network architecture previously associated with psychopathology. Reductions in global connectivity were associated with placement instability, attenuated cortisol secretion and higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Regional measures revealed lower connectivity strength especially in regions within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in maltreated children. These findings show that childhood maltreatment is associated with systemic global neurodevelopmental alterations in WM networks next to regional alterations in areas involved in the regulation of affect. These alterations in WM organization could underlie global functional deficits and multi-symptom patterns frequently observed in children with maltreatment experiences.

AB Maltreated children in out-of-home care are at high risk for poor relationships with caregivers (i.e., biological parents and substitute caregivers) and high levels of internalizing symptoms. It is unclear if these poor relationships are related to, and account for a large portion of the variance in maltreated children's internalizing symptoms, above and beyond maltreatment type and out-of-home care factors. This study examined the relation between attachment quality with both biological parents and substitute caregivers and children's internalizing symptoms within a sample of 493 maltreated children (aged 9-11; 51.0 % male) recently placed in out-of-home care. A series of hierarchical regression models indicated that greater child-reported attachment quality with both biological parents and substitute caregivers was associated with fewer child-reported anxiety (beta = -.15, p < .01; beta = -.29, p < .001, respectively) and depression symptoms (beta = -.14, p < .01; beta = -.28, p < .001, respectively) as well as fewer child internalizing symptoms (beta = -.12, p < .05; beta = -.14, p < .01, respectively). Attachment quality with the biological parent and substitute caregiver each explained a significant proportion of the variance in children's internalizing symptoms, above and beyond child demographics, maltreatment type, and out-of-home care variables. The study also examined whether children's attachment with substitute caregivers moderated the relationship between children's attachment with biological parents and children's internalizing symptoms. No statistically significant moderation effects were found. Future clinical work should focus on enhancing attachment quality between children and both biological parents and substitute caregivers, as these relationships appear to individually relate to the children's internalizing symptomology.

AB The current study examined relational aggression as a potential mechanism that explains the association between off-time pubertal development and internalizing problems in youth. Youth gender was also examined as a moderator for the association between these variables. It was hypothesized that early pubertal maturation would be associated with higher levels of relationally aggressive behavior which, in turn, would be associated with elevated levels of internalizing problems. Parents of 372 children between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Parents responded to demographic information about themselves, as well as information about their child's pubertal timing, relationally aggressive behavior, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Findings indicated that early pubertal timing was associated with higher levels of anxiety directly, and higher levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms indirectly through higher levels of relational aggression. In all but one of the pathways examined, gender was not found to moderate the associations between the study variables of interest. This study is the first to examine relational aggression as a mechanism by which early pubertal timing leads to internalizing problems. The findings suggest that relational aggression could be a target for intervention among early developing youth who are at risk for internalizing problems.

AB Knowledge about the concordance of parent- and child-reported child physical abuse is scarce, leaving researchers and practitioners with little guidance on the implications of selecting either informant. Drawing from a 2008-2009 sample of 11- to 17-year-olds (N = 636) from Wave 1 of the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, this study first examined parent-child concordance in physical abuse reporting (Parent-Child Conflict Tactic Scale). Second, it applied multivariate regression analysis to relate parent-child agreement in physical abuse to parent-reported (Child Behavior Checklist) and child-reported (Youth Self Report) child behavioral problems. Results indicate low parent-child concordance of physical abuse (kappa = .145). Coreporting of physical abuse was related to clinical-level parent-reported externalizing problems ((y) over bar= 64.57), whereas child-only reports of physical abuse were the only agreement category related to child-reported internalizing problems (B = 4.17, p < .001). Attribution bias theory may further understanding of reporting concordance and its implications.

   PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; STRENGTHS; RUSSIANS; PROJECT; SAMPLE; SCALE
AB Background: We compare the mental health status of children who reside in Lithuania with parents who are either Lithuanian nationals or non-Lithuanian nationals.
   Method: Data were drawn from the School Child Mental Health Europe survey (SCMHE), a cross-sectional survey of school children aged 6-11 years. A total of 1152 Lithuanian children participated, among them 11.7% from a non-Lithuanian family. Child mental health was assessed using the Dominique Interactive (DI) and the parent- and teacher Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental attitudes were evaluated, and socio-demographics were collected.
   Results: Overall 26.7% of non-Lithuanian versus 17.2% of Lithuanian children reported having an internalizing disorder (p = 0.01) mainly due to separation anxiety (16.4% versus 10.2%, p = 0.04). Odds ratio (OR) for child-reported internalizing disorders was 1.86 (95% CI = 1.17-2.96) once adjusted for other factors including being a girl, to be younger, parental unemployment and low caring and low autonomy parental attitudes which were associated with greater odds of internalizing disorders. In addition, 31.9% of non-Lithuanian reported suicidal thoughts versus 22.0% of Lithuanian children p =.02); OR = 1.60 (95% CI = 1.04-2.46) once adjusted for single parent, parental unemployment, parental alcohol problems and oveneactivity attitude.

AB Background: Suicidal adolescents are heterogeneous, which can pose difficulties in predicting suicidal behavior. The Youth Self-Report (YSR) psychopathology profiles predict the future onset of psychopathology and suicide-related outcomes. The present study examined the prevalence and correlates of YSR psychopathology profiles among suicidal adolescents and prospective associations with post-discharge rates of suicide attempts and psychiatric rehospitalization.
   Methods: Participants were acutely suicidal, psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (N=433 at baseline; n=355 at follow-up) who were enrolled in a psychosocial intervention trial during hospitalization. Psychopathology profiles were assessed at baseline. Suicide attempts and rehospitalization were assessed for up to 12 months following discharge.
   Results: Latent profile analysis identified four psychopathology profiles: subclinical, primarily internalizing, and moderately and severely dysregulated. At baseline, profiles differed by history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and multiple suicide attempts (MA) as well as severity of suicide ideation, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, substance abuse, and functional impairment. The dysregulation profiles predicted suicide attempts within 3 months post-discharge. The internalizing profile predicted suicide attempts and rehospitalization at 3 and 12 months.
   Limitations: This study's participants were enrolled in a randomized trial and were predominantly female, which limit generalizability. Additionally, only a history of NSSI was assessed.
   Conclusions: The dysregulation profile was overrepresented among suicidal youth and associated with impairment in several domains as well as suicide attempts shortly after discharge. Adolescents with a severe internalizing profile also reported adverse outcomes throughout the study period. Psychopathology profiles warrant further examination in terms of their potential predictive validity in relation to suicide-related outcomes.

AB Background: Depressed mood is prevalent during pregnancy, with accumulating evidence suggesting an impact on developmental outcome in the offspring. However, the long-term effects of prenatal maternal depression regarding internalizing psychopathology in the offspring are as yet unclear.
   Methods: As part of an ongoing epidemiological cohort study, prenatal maternal depressed mood was assessed at the child's age of 3 months. In a sample of n=307 offspring, depressive symptoms were obtained via questionnaire at the ages of 19, 22, 23 and 25 years. At age 25 years, diagnoses of depressive disorder were obtained using a diagnostic interview. In a subsample of currently healthy participants, voxel-based morphometry was conducted and amygdala volume was assessed.
   Results: In n=85 young adults exposed to prenatal maternal depressed mood, no significantly higher risk for a diagnosis of depressive disorder was observed. However, they reported significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms. This association was especially pronounced when prenatal maternal depressed mood was present during the first trimester of pregnancy and when maternal mood was depressed pre- as well as postnatally. At an uncorrected level only, prenatal maternal depressed mood was associated with decreased amygdala volume.
   Limitations: Prenatal maternal depressed mood was not assessed during pregnancy, but shortly after childbirth. No diagnoses of maternal clinical depression during pregnancy were available.
   Conclusions: Self-reported depressive symptoms do not imply increased, but rather decreased symptom levels in young adults who were exposed to prenatal maternal depressed mood. A long-term perspective may be important when considering consequences of prenatal risk factors.

AB BackgroundChild and adolescent psychopathology has been linked to increased sleep problems, but there has been less investigation of this relationship in younger samples with early-onset psychopathology. This study examined three specific but commonly observed aspects of sleep behaviors in young children - (i) Sleep onset latency, (ii) Refusal to sleep alone, and (iii) Nighttime awakenings - measured during preschool, and investigated whether these sleep problems predicted anxiety and/or depression across the next 6years until school age (ages 9-13).
   MethodsData were analyzed from N=292 participants from a prospective longitudinal study of preschool-age children (ages 3-6). At baseline, parent-reported clinical interviews of psychiatric symptoms, as well as sleep problems were conducted using the Preschool-Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA). Follow-up clinical interviews were also conducted annually through school age using the Childhood and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA).
   ResultsParent-reported sleep onset latency and refusal to sleep alone were significant independent predictors of MDD and anxiety severity, but not ADHD severity across time, even after controlling for family income-to-needs ratio and maternal internalizing psychopathology. In exploratory analyses using only healthy preschoolers, parent-reported sleep onset latency and refusal to sleep alone also predicted anxiety severity.
   ConclusionsWe demonstrate that specific, yet relatively common sleep problems predict diagnostic severity of depression and anxiety across time, but not ADHD. Increased clinical attention to and screening for sleep onset latency and refusal to sleep alone during preschool may be warranted.

AB Negativity in parent-child relationships during adolescence has been viewed as a risk factor for teens' future personal and interpersonal adjustment. This study examined support from romantic partners and close friends during late adolescence as protective against maternal negativity experienced during early adolescence. A combination of observational, self-report, and peer-report measures were obtained from a community sample of 97 youth (58 % female), their mothers, closest friends, and romantic partners assessed at ages 13, 18, and 20. Moderating effects suggested a protective effect of romantic support against maternal negativity across a variety of psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, self-worth, social withdrawal, and externalizing behavior. Protective effects were found even after controlling for initial levels of outcome behavior and observed support from close friends throughout adolescence. Receiving support from a romantic partner may provide teens with new, positive ways of coping with adversity and help them avoid more serious distress that may be predicted from maternal negativity when such support is not available.

AB This study investigated the relationship between the three DSM-5 categories of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms (irritable mood, defiant behavior, vindictive behavior) and anxiety/depression in girls and boys with conduct problems (CP) while controlling for comorbid child psychopathology at baseline. Data were drawn from an ongoing longitudinal study of 6- to 9-year-old French-Canadian children (N = 276; 40.8 % girls) receiving special educational services for CP at school and followed for 2 years. Using linear regression analysis, the results showed that irritable mood symptoms predicted a higher level of depression and anxiety in girls and boys 2 years later, whereas the behavioral symptoms of ODD (e.g., defiant, vindictive symptoms) were linked to lower depression scores. The contribution of ODD symptoms to these predictions, while statistically significant, remained modest. The usefulness of ODD irritable symptoms as a marker for identifying girls and boys with CP who are more vulnerable to developing internalizing problems is discussed.

AB Prior research has identified OCD subtypes or "clusters" of symptoms that differentially relate to clinical features of the disorder. Given the high comorbidity between OCD and anxiety, OCD symptom clusters may more broadly associate with fear and/or distress internalizing constructs. This study examines fear and distress dimensions, including physical concerns (fear), separation anxiety (fear), perfectionism (distress), and anxious coping (distress), as predictors of previously empirically-derived OCD symptom clusters in a sample of 215 youth diagnosed with primary OCD (ages 7-17, mean age = 12.25). Self-reported separation fears predicted membership in Cluster 1 (aggressive, sexual, religious, somatic obsessions, and checking compulsions) while somatic/autonomic fears predicted membership in Cluster 2 (symmetry obsessions and ordering, counting, repeating compulsions). Results highlight the diversity of pediatric OCD symptoms and their differential association with fear, suggesting the need to carefully assess both OCD and global fear constructs that might be directly targeted in treatment.

SO CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Empathy; Internalizing problems; Maternal depression; Guilt; Emotional
   development
AB Recent theories posit that empathy, typically an adaptive characteristic, may be associated with internalizing problems when children are chronically exposed to mother's depression. We tested this postulation in a sample of children (N = 82, M (age) = 5 years). Children witnessed their mothers express sadness, anger, and happiness during a simulated phone conversation, and researchers rated children's negative affective empathy, positive affective empathy, and information-seeking (cognitive empathy) in response to their mother's emotions. The chronicity of mother's depression during the child's lifetime moderated associations between children's empathy and internalizing problems. As predicted, all three empathy measures were related to greater mother-rated internalizing problems in children of chronically (i.e., 2-3 years) depressed mothers. Greater positive empathy was related to lower internalizing problems in children of nondepressed mothers. Positive empathy may contribute to adaptive processes when mothers are not depressed, and positive, negative, and cognitive empathy may contribute to maladaptive processes when mothers are chronically depressed.

AB Two risk factors for negative outcomes in Latina/o youth are acculturation dissonance (i.e., discrepant family cultural orientations) and the endorsement of an assimilation strategy of acculturation (i.e., valuing dominant mainstream culture over culture of origin). Though these have been uniquely studied as risk factors for maladaptive behaviors among Latina/o youth, their interaction in relation to both externalizing and internalizing symptoms has yet to be fully examined.
   The present study examined the unique and interactive effects of acculturation dissonance and assimilation on both depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors among Latina/o adolescents.
   Participants were 135 Latina/o adolescents (ages 14-20) recruited from a charter high school. Students responded to a paper-and-pencil survey assessing demographic information, acculturation strategy, acculturation dissonance, depressive symptoms, and delinquency.
   Acculturation dissonance was uniquely associated with depressive symptoms, but interaction effects suggested this association depended on levels of assimilation. At high levels of assimilation, acculturation dissonance was not associated with depressive symptoms, since depressive symptoms were consistently high. In contrast, at low levels of assimilation, acculturation dissonance was positively associated with depressive symptoms. In contrast, acculturation dissonance was uniquely associated with delinquency, and this association did not depend on the level of assimilation.
   Dissonant cultural orientations within families of Latina/o youth confer risk for negative outcomes across internalizing and externalizing domains. For youth adopting an assimilation strategy of acculturation, risk for depressive symptoms may be increased. Implications of these findings and future directions are discussed.

AB The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety among African American children and adolescents and their negative sequalae suggest a need to further explore factors that may be protective of depression and anxiety among this population.
   The aim of this review was to examine empirical studies that focus on the association between family-level factors (e.g., parenting practices, family functioning) and depression and anxiety in African American children. Specifically, we examined the studies' characteristics and the relationship between various family-level factors and depression and anxiety outcomes and assessed the methodological quality of studies.
   This review was guided by systematic review methods postulated by Gough and colleagues and the Prisma Group. Electronic databases searched were Social Work Abstracts, PsycINFO, SocIndex, PubMed, Social Service Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts. Thirty-one studies published from 2003 to 2014 were included and assessed for methodological strength using the Quantitative Research Assessment Tool.
   The majority of the study samples were low income and resided in metropolitan or urban areas, and primary caregivers were female. Parenting practices (58 % of studies) were by far the most frequently examined family-level factor associated with depression and anxiety.
   Positive family-level factors (e.g., positive parenting, healthy family functioning and environment) was associated with decreased depression and anxiety. Findings from this review can inform the development or adaptation of family-based interventions that can effectively reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in African American children.

AB This correlational cross-sectional study was designed to investigate whether the intimate partner violence (IPV) suffered by mothers (physical and psychological maltreatment), the neglect suffered by children, and the maltreatment (physical and psychological) directly suffered by children are statistically associated with an increase in the probability of the child's suffering psychopathological problems. The sample consisted of 189 Spanish children aged 6 to 17 and their mothers, recruited from Centers of Specialized Assistance for Women Victims of IPV. The results of a canonical correlation analysis showed that the most significant problems suffered by the children were both externalizing and internalizing ones. In girls, the maltreatment suffered by their mothers was directly related to a larger frequency of somatic complaints than in boys. In addition, physical maltreatment to the mother and emotional maltreatment suffered by the child exhibited a statistically significant relationship with aggressive behaviour, thought problems, rule-breaking behaviour, attention problems, and withdrawn-depressed.

AB Family and social environment may play a part in children's post-violence adjustment. The goal of this paper is to examine which factors are related to internalizing symptoms in mothers and their children exposed to intimate partner violence. Participants were 208 mothers exposed to domestic violence. Mothers responded using the Conflict Tactics Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and other standardized scales. They also reported on their children's internalizing symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). For the whole group, children's CBCL scores were related to higher maternal depression and lower maternal self-esteem. Factors determining internalizing in children varied based upon the child's race. This study illustrates the importance of factors, such as maternal depression, maternal self-esteem, violence exposure, and social support, in determining whether a child exposed to domestic violence develops internalizing symptoms, and that ecological factors may have different effects on children based on race.

AB Background: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience impairments in social communication, and these deficits often make it difficult to form and maintain friendships with peers. Poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness are common among adolescents with ASD, and consequences of poor sleep may make social interactions difficult. Connections between sleep quality and social relationships in ASD samples have been understudied; the current study addresses this gap.
   Method: Participants were community samples of 19 adolescents with ASD and 10 neurotypical (NT) adolescents. Adolescents completed questionnaires about closeness and discord in relationships with a same-gender peer, and they reported on sleep-wake problems, daytime sleepiness, and internalizing problems. Adolescents also wore an actigraph for 7-nights.
   Results: Pearson correlations revealed significant associations between adolescents' reports of sleep problems and discordant peer relationships; more sleep-wake problems and more daytime sleepiness were associated with more discord with peers in the sample with ASD, but not in the NT sample. The closeness aspect of peer relationships was not significantly associated with sleep quality. Internalizing problems did not mediate between sleep quality and discordant relationships.
   Conclusions: Adolescents' reports of more sleep problems and daytime sleepiness, but not actigraph indicators of sleep quality, were directly associated with discordant peer relationships. Adolescents who are already challenged in social interactions due to ASD may be especially vulnerable to intense negativity in peer relationships when they also experience poorer nighttime sleep and more daytime sleepiness. NT adolescents may be better able to regulate social interactions despite poor sleep and feeling tired. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined whether attachment security moderates influences of two gender identity variablesfelt gender typicality and felt pressure for gender differentiationon preadolescents' well-being. We tested two hypotheses. The first was that attachment security protects children from the distress that can stem from feeling gender atypical or from feeling pressure for gender conformity. The second was that secure children derive well-being from believing they are similar to same-gender peers whereas insecure children derive well-being from believing it important to be different from other-gender peers. We assessed children's attachment security, gender identity, and well-being (self-esteem, internalizing problems) in two successive years (N=211, M initial age=10.1 years). Results supported the second hypothesis. Attachment security may govern children's contingencies of well-being.

AB Child- and family-related factors that predict internalizing symptoms are understudied in preschool years and have a negative influence on children's functioning. We examined observational assessments of preschoolers' temperamental fearfulness and exuberance, mother reports of negative control, warmth, and parenting stress in a sample of 109 Turkish preschoolers. High temperamental fearfulness and low joyful/exuberant positive affectivity in addition to low warmth and high parenting stress had significant effects on internalizing symptoms. Parenting stress had both direct and indirect relations to internalizing symptoms via lower maternal warmth. When comorbid elevations in externalizing symptoms were controlled, the results were consistent with the interpretation that poor parenting practices and stress associated with the parenting role predict maladaptation in general but that the specific form of maladaptation may be best predicted by individual differences in children's temperamental characteristics. This study contributes to our understanding of risk and protective factors that predict preschoolers' internalizing symptoms with a sample from a non-Western population. These findings can guide early prevention and intervention programs to address internalizing problems in a culturally-sensitive way.

AB Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is thought to involve an executive inhibitory control (IC) deficit, yet it is not clear if this is a general deficit affecting both cold and hot EC, and if methylphenidate (MPH) affects both systems in treated children. We explored this by using a Stroop-like task in children with ADHD as compared to controls, containing different types of emotional stimuli (six levels), and we investigated the role of intervention with MPH on IC as compared to placebo. Children with ADHD and controls (N = 40; 7-13 years old) were tested with a hot and cold Stroop-like task. This was followed by a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of the effect of MPH on these skills. Children with ADHD showed a specific difficulty inhibiting their responses, particularly to hot, angry and frustration-inducing stimuli. Further, treatment with MPH was effective in reducing errors toward frustration-inducing stimuli as compared to placebo (p < .05, eta (2) = .347), particularly with repeated exposure to the stimuli. Results indicate that children with ADHD experience executive control difficulties, particularly in hot negative emotional contexts. These emotion regulation difficulties are amenable to stimulant intervention.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that thyroid functioning would be uniquely associated with sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms but not Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) symptoms of ADHD. Method: Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was collected from a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized children (N = 570; ages = 6-12), with rates of TSH similar to those found in the normative pediatric population. Caregivers completed narrowband measures of SCT and ADHD symptoms and broadband measures of internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Results: A significant, positive relation was found between TSH concentration and SCT symptoms, but not between TSH and ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that the association between TSH and SCT remained significant after controlling for child demographic characteristics, broadband measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. However, effects were small in magnitude. Conclusion: Although preliminary, results indicate that thyroid functioning may be related to SCT. Given the small effects, however, it is important for future research to examine other endocrine and biological correlates that may inform models of the developmental psychopathology of SCT.

AB Background: In adolescence, psychological problems and regular use of alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis and other drugs (AOD) tend to cluster together, strongly indicating that certain groups of young people are at elevated risk of developing a problematic use of AOD.
   Objective: The aim of the present study was to develop an easy-to-implement screening instrument to identify subgroups of young people with different psychological problems at risk of problem use of AOD.
   Method: 3589 randomly selected young Danes between 15 and 25 years of age, from a national survey (n = 2702) and a municipality survey (n = 887), answered a 12-item questionnaire (YouthMap12) with 6 items identifying externalizing problems (EP6) and 6 items identifying internalizing problems (IP6). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to characterize groups at risk, and associations were estimated between EP6 and IP6 and regular use of AOD, and between latent class membership and regular use of AOD.
   Results: LCA identified 6 classes with varying degrees of externalizing and internalizing problems: 70% of youth were in the low problem score class, and the remaining 30% were at various levels of risk. Regular use of cigarettes, cannabis and alcohol was strongly associated with classes characterized by externalizing problems, while over-the-counter and prescription medicine was strongly associated with classes characterized by internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Youth at risk of problem use of AOD can be identified using a simple and easily administered instrument. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Across 5 decades, hundreds of randomized trials have tested psychological therapies for youth internalizing (anxiety, depression) and externalizing (misconduct, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) disorders and problems. Since the last broad-based youth meta-analysis in 1995, the number of trials has almost tripled and data-analytic methods have been refined. We applied these methods to the expanded study pool (447 studies; 30,431 youths), synthesizing 50 years of findings and identifying implications for research and practice. We assessed overall effect size (ES) and moderator effects using multilevel modeling to address ES dependency that is common, but typically not modeled, in meta-analyses. Mean post-treatment ES was 0.46; the probability that a youth in the treatment condition would fare better than a youth in the control condition was 63%. Effects varied according to multiple moderators, including the problem targeted in treatment: Mean ES at posttreatment was strongest for anxiety (0.61), weakest for depression (0.29), and nonsignificant for multiproblem treatment (0.15). ESs differed across control conditions, with "usual care" emerging as a potent comparison condition, and across informants, highlighting the need to obtain and integrate multiple perspectives on outcome. Effects of therapy type varied by informant; only youth-focused behavioral therapies (including cognitive-behavioral therapy) showed similar and robust effects across youth, parent, and teacher reports. Effects did not differ for Caucasian versus minority samples, but more diverse samples are needed. The findings underscore the benefits of psychological treatments as well as the need for improved therapies and more representative, informative, and rigorous intervention science.

AB African American men (AAM) who are exposed to trauma and adversity during their early life are at greater risk for poor health over their lifespan. Exposure to adversity during critical developmental windows may embed an epigenetic signature that alters expression of genes that regulate stress response systems, including those genes that regulate the inflammatory response to stress. Such an epigenetic signature may increase risk for diseases exacerbated by inflammation, and may contribute to health disparity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which exposure to early life adversity influences the psychological, cortisol, and proinflammatory response to acute stress (Trier Social Stress Test - TSST) in emerging adult AAM, ages 18-25 years (N = 34). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the cortisol and IL-6 pattern of response to the TSST with respect to childhood adversity factors and DNA methylation of the IL-6 promoter. Findings revealed that in response to the TSST, greater levels of childhood trauma and indirect exposure to neighborhood violence were associated with a greater TSST-induced IL-6 response, and a blunted cortisol response. Reduced methylation of the IL-6 promoter was related to increased exposure to childhood trauma and greater TSST-induced IL-6 levels. These results support the concept that exposure to childhood adversity amplifies the adult proinflammatory response to stress, which is related to epigenetic signature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB BackgroundCognitive behavioural therapy for low self-esteem (LSE) has shown promise as a trans-diagnostic model for treating mental health difficulties in adults. To ascertain the potential value of this treatment approach in working with young people with internalizing disorders, we need to develop our understanding of LSE within these mental health conditions. The aim of this review is to explore (a) the co-occurrence of clinically significant anxiety/depression and LSE in young people (aged 18 years and younger), and (b) the association between LSE in childhood and adolescence and mental health difficulties in later adolescence and emerging adulthood.
   MethodA systematic search of three electronic databases (PsychInfo/Pubmed/Google Scholar) was conducted to identify relevant studies.
   ResultsTen studies examining the association between LSE and clinically significant anxiety/depression in young people met the inclusion criteria, as did eight studies investigating the association between LSE in young people with internalizing difficulties in later adolescence/emerging adulthood. Although relatively few studies were identified, studies consistently supported the co-occurrence of LSE and internalizing disorders in young people, particularly in young people with co-morbid anxiety and depression. LSE in childhood and adolescence appears to be a relatively weak predictor of the development of anxiety and depression in later adolescence and early adulthood.
   ConclusionsFurther research investigating the relationship between low self-esteem and mental health difficulties in young people and its implications for treatment in this age group is indicated.

AB With increasing frequency of Internet use among adolescents, there are growing concerns about their risk for becoming attached to these forms of communication and increased vulnerability for negative online experiences, including cyber victimization. The effect of these experiences on adolescent mental health is not well understood. In this study, we examine how Internet attachment is related to anxiety and depression and assess the mediating effect of cyber victimization on these associations. Participants included 1,151 middle school students (51.4 percent males) aged 10 to 16 (M=12.7, SD=0.93). Structural equation models show that greater Internet attachment was associated with more cyber victimization and greater symptoms of anxiety and depression. Cyber victimization mediated the associations between Internet attachment and anxiety and between Internet attachment and depression. Implications for online awareness efforts are discussed.

AB A growing literature has documented the mostly deleterious intergenerational consequences of paternal incarceration, but less research has considered heterogeneity in these relationships. In this article, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,065) to estimate the heterogeneous relationship between paternal incarceration and children's problem behaviors (internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and early juvenile delinquency) and cognitive skills (reading comprehension, math comprehension, and verbal ability) in middle childhood. Taking into account children's risk of experiencing paternal incarceration, measured by the social contexts in which children are embedded (e.g., father's residential status, poverty, neighborhood disadvantage) reveals that the consequences-across all outcomes except early juvenile delinquency-are more deleterious for children with relatively low risks of exposure to paternal incarceration than for children with relatively high risks of exposure to paternal incarceration. These findings suggest that the intergenerational consequences of paternal incarceration are more complicated than documented in previous research and, more generally, suggest that research on family inequality consider both differential selection into treatments and differential responses to treatments.

AB This study explored how coping with war-related traumatic events in Sierra Leone impacted mental health outcomes among 529 youth (aged 10-17 at baseline; 25% female) using longitudinal data from three time points (Time 1 in 2002, Time 2 in 2004, and Time 3 in 2008). We examined two types of coping items (approach and avoidance); used multiple regression models to test their relations with long-term mental health outcomes (internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, adaptive/prosocial behaviors, and posttraumatic stress symptoms); and used mediation analyses to test whether coping explained the relation between previous war exposures (being raped, death of parent(s), or killing/injuring someone during the war) and those outcomes. We found that avoidance coping items were associated with lower internalizing and posttraumatic stress behaviors at Time 3, and provided some evidence of mediating the relation between death of parent(s) during the war and the two outcomes mentioned above. Approach coping was associated with higher Time 3 adaptive/prosocial behaviors, whereas avoidance coping was associated with lower Time 3 adaptive/prosocial behaviors. Avoidance coping may be a protective factor against mental illness, whereas approach coping may be a promotive factor for adaptive/prosocial behaviors in war-affected societies. This study has important implications for designing and implementing mental health interventions for youth in postconflict settings.

AB Although prior research has consistently documented the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and poor mental health outcomes, the mechanisms that underlie this link are still unclear. The present 3-wave longitudinal study tested the mediating role of anger regulation in the discrimination-mental health link among 269 Mexican-origin adolescents (M-age = 14.1 years, SD = 1.6; 57% girls), 12 to 17 years old. Three competing anger regulation variables were tested as potential mediators: outward anger expression, anger suppression, and anger control. Longitudinal mediation analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling that disaggregated within-person effects from between-person effects. Results indicated that outward anger expression was a significant mediator; anger suppression and anger control were not significant mediators. Within a given individual, greater racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with more frequent outward anger expression. In turn, more frequent outward anger expression was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression at a given time point. Gender, age, and nativity status were not significant moderators of the hypothesized mediation models. By identifying outward anger expression as an explanatory mechanism in the discrimination-distress link among Latino youths, this study points to a malleable target for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating the detrimental impact of racism on Latino youths' mental health during the developmentally critical period of adolescence.

AB Background: Problem behavior of young children is generally not assessed with structured child interviews. This paper examined how information about problem behavior, obtained by structured interviews with six-year-old children, relates to DSM-disorders obtained from parents and to treatment referral.
   Methods: In a population-based cohort, caregivers of 1084 young children (mean age 6.7 years) were interviewed with the DSM-based Diagnostic Interview Schedule-Young Child version (DISC-YC), and they scored the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Children themselves were interviewed about problem behavior using the semi-structured Berkeley Puppet Interview (BPI). Information regarding treatment referral to mental health services was obtained by parent-reported questionnaire when children were on average eight years old.
   Results: DSM-disorders and CBCL problems in the clinical range were cross-sectionally associated with higher levels of child self-reported problems. Associations were strongest in the externalizing domain (e.g. DISC-YC externalizing disorders with BPI externalizing scores: F(1, 416) = 19.39, P < 0.001; DISC-YC internalizing disorders with BPI internalizing scores: F(1, 312) = 3.75, P = 0.054). Moreover, higher BPI internalizing and externalizing problem scores predicted treatment referral two years later.
   Conclusions: We conclude that systematically interviewing preschool and young elementary school-aged children should be an integral part of child assessment. This approach may contribute to a better understanding of child development and may predict future problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Based on previous studies reporting on the association of objective sleep duration and physiologic changes (i.e., increased cortisol) in children, we examined the role of objective sleep duration on differentiating behavioral profiles in children with insomnia symptoms. Seven hundred children (ages 5-12, 47.8% male) from the Penn State Child Cohort underwent a nine-hour polysomnography and parent completed Pediatric Behavior Scale. Insomnia symptoms were defined as parent report of difficulty falling and/or staying asleep, sleep disordered breathing as an AHI of >= 1, and objective short sleep duration as a total sleep time < 7.7 h. Children with insomnia symptoms demonstrated more overall behavioral problems than controls. Significant interactions between insomnia symptoms and objective sleep duration on scores of externalizing behaviors, mood variability and school problems were found. Profile analyses showed that children with insomnia symptoms and normal sleep duration were associated with clinically elevated externalizing behaviors, inattention, mood variability, and school problems, while children with insomnia and short sleep duration were associated with an overall elevated profile in which internalizing behaviors were more prominent. Childhood insomnia symptoms are associated with a wide array of behavioral problems, for which objective sleep duration is useful in differentiating behavioral profiles. Children with insomnia symptoms and normal sleep duration had a behavioral profile consistent with limit-setting and rule-breaking behaviors, while children with insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration had a behavioral profile more consistent with internalizing behaviors resembling that of psychophysiological disorders.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to determine the unique utility of poor sleep health in predicting the onset of substance use in adolescents.
   Methods: Middle school students (N = 829, mean (M) age = 12.6 years, 52% female, 73% white) who participated in an ongoing prospective study of alcohol onset and progression completed a set of Web-based health behavior surveys over a 4-year period, with recruitment beginning in 2009. Surveys included assessments of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use as well as sleep duration, bedtime delay (from weekdays to weekends), and daytime sleepiness. Data were analyzed using discrete-time Cox Proportional hazard's regression.
   Results: Controlling for participant age at sleep assessment, gender, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, shorter sleep duration and greater daytime sleepiness in year 1 were associated with increased odds of having had a full drink of alcohol, having engaged in heavy episodic drinking, and having experienced alcohol-related consequences by year 4. Shorter sleep duration was also associated with increased odds of marijuana use by year 4. No sleep parameter was uniquely associated with increased odds of cigarette use (first puff or first full cigarette). Effects were evident for both males and females. Age at sleep assessment did not moderate effects.
   Conclusions: Sleep health is a prospective predictor of the onset of alcohol and marijuana use among adolescents. Increased efforts to prevent and intervene in sleep problems among adolescents are warranted. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined the longer-term implications of adolescent positive mental health for successful young adult transitions. Positive mental health in adolescence was defined by indicators roughly corresponding to Seligman's positive psychology PERMA framework (positive emotional experiences, engagement, relationships, purpose, and accomplishment), with the addition of health. Data were drawn from one of Australia's longest running studies of social and emotional development (Australian Temperament Project, est. 1983, N = 2443), which has followed a large representative community sample from infancy to 27-28 years of age. In the analyzed sample of n = 999, positive mental health at 15-16 years was associated with indicators of career progression (educational attainment and perceived competence) and taking on citizenship responsibilities (volunteering and civic activities) over a decade later at 27-28 years. Mental health problems in adolescence were more relevant to establishing romantic partnerships in young adulthood: adolescent antisocial behaviors predicted higher likelihood of being in a relationship, while depressive symptoms predicted lower quality partnerships. The results suggest that successful transitions into young adult roles and responsibilities may be facilitated by targeted mental health promotion interventions designed to both foster positive mental health and address mental health difficulties in adolescence.

AB The role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.

AB Despite extensive literature on parental monitoring, few studies have focused on father-youth solicitation in particular and none on solicitation via communication technology. To address this gap, this study explored the relationships between fathers' online and in-person solicitation of their adolescent and emerging adult children, and the youth's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. A sample of US fathers (N = 158) reported on solicitation patterns, use of technology, and their child's behaviors. The results revealed differences by demographics, and an inverse trend between online and in-person solicitation in relation to internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that online solicitation of information from the youth's friends was related to greater internalizing and externalizing, and less prosocial behavior. These findings support research suggesting that some forms of online solicitation may be interpreted by adolescents and emerging adults as intrusive and a violation of privacy.

AB We propose a taxonomy of psychopathology based on patterns of shared causal influences identified in a review of multivariate behavior genetic studies that distinguish genetic and environmental influences that are either common to multiple dimensions of psychopathology or unique to each dimension. At the phenotypic level, first-order dimensions are defined by correlations among symptoms; correlations among first-order dimensions similarly define higher-order domains (e.g., internalizing or externalizing psychopathology). We hypothesize that the robust phenotypic correlations among first-order dimensions reflect a hierarchy of increasingly specific etiologic influences. Some nonspecific etiologic factors increase risk for all first-order dimensions of psychopathology to varying degrees through a general factor of psychopathology. Other nonspecific etiologic factors increase risk only for all first-order dimensions within a more specific higher-order domain. Furthermore, each first-order dimension has its own unique causal influences. Genetic and environmental influences common to family members tend to be nonspecific, whereas environmental influences unique to each individual are more dimension-specific. We posit that these causal influences on psychopathology are moderated by sex and developmental processes. This causal taxonomy also provides a novel framework for understanding the heterogeneity of each first-order dimension: Different persons exhibiting similar symptoms may be influenced by different combinations of etiologic influences from each of the 3 levels of the etiologic hierarchy. Furthermore, we relate the proposed causal taxonomy to transdimensional psychobiological processes, which also impact the heterogeneity of each psychopathology dimension. This causal taxonomy implies the need for changes in strategies for studying the etiology, psychobiology, prevention, and treatment of psychopathology.

AB Objective: Dysregulation of autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is a putative intermediate phenotype linking childhood adversity (CA) with later psychopathology. However, associations of CAs with autonomic nervous system and HPA-axis function vary widely across studies. Here, we test a novel conceptual model discriminating between distinct forms of CA (deprivation and threat) and examine their independent associations with physiological reactivity and psychopathology.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 169; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.4] years) with a range of interpersonal violence (e.g., maltreatment, community violence) and poverty exposure participated in the Trier Social Stress test (TSST). During the TSST, electrocardiogram, impedance cardiograph, salivary cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate data were collected. We compared the associations of poverty (an indicator of deprivation) and interpersonal violence (an indicator of threat) on sympathetic, parasympathetic, and HPA-axis reactivity to the TSST, and assessed whether these differences mediated the association of adversity with internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: Exposure to poverty and interpersonal violence was associated with psychopathology. Interpersonal violence, adjusting for poverty, was associated with blunted sympathetic (b=1.44, p=.050) and HPA-axis reactivity (b=-.09; p=.021). Blunted cortisol reactivity mediated the association of interpersonal violence with externalizing, but not internalizing, psychopathology. In contrast, poverty was not associated with physiological reactivity after adjusting for interpersonal violence.
   Conclusions: We provide evidence for distinct neurobiological mechanisms through which adversity related to poverty and interpersonal violence is associated with psychopathology in adolescence. Distinguishing distinct pathways through which adversity influences mental health has implications for preventive interventions targeting youths exposed to childhood adversity.

AB Background: Cognitive-Behavioral Family-Based Treatment (CBFT) is the standard of care in young children with OCD. Developmental considerations, parent desires, and cost-effective advantages motivate research to explore the relative efficacy of parent-only interventions. The main goal in this study was to test the effectiveness and feasibility of a parent only intervention for OCD in young children, comparing, in a preliminary fashion the relative efficacy of reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms through two treatment conditions: 1) an individual CBFT for early OCD involving both parents and children, and 2) the family component of the intervention involving only individual Parent Training (PT).
   Methods: Twenty treatment-seeking families from two private outpatient clinics in Spain were alternately assigned to one of the two treatment conditions. Participants had a primary diagnosis of OCD and a mean age of 6.62 years (65% males). Interventions were conducted by the same therapist and the assessments were administered by independent clinicians who were blind to the experimental conditions of the participants. Assessment time-points were pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up (including diagnosis, symptom severity, global functioning, family accommodation, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and satisfaction measures).
   Results: The two ways of implementation, involving child and parents (CBFT) or involving only parents (PT), produced clinical improvements and were well-accepted by parents and children. The CBFT condition was superior to the PT condition in reducing externalizing problems.
   Limitations: reduced sample size and absence of randomization were the main limitations of this study.
   Conclusions: these results suggest, in a preliminary manner, that the need to have the child present at session with the clinician could be decreased for some children, as well as the overall feasibility of working only with parents for the implementation of CBT for OCD in very young children.

AB Background: Research has documented heterogeneous developmental trajectories of specific symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, in late childhood and adolescence. Few studies, however, have examined the heterogeneity of general psychopathology (GPP) trajectories considering symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility in adolescence simultaneously. Identifying antecedents for distinct trajectory groups of GPP, and their respective consequences, may provide insight into the etiological underpinnings of social antecedents of different symptoms and inform the targets and timing of intervention.
   Methods: European American target adolescents (N=444, 53% female) evaluated three domain specific symptoms (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility) as well as psychosocial risks and social consequences over 10 years (from 1990 [Wave 2] to 2001 [Wave 13]). First- and second-order growth mixture models (SOGMMs) were used to identify trajectories of GPP and specific symptoms from mid-adolescence through young adulthood, as well as their predictors and consequences.
   Results: A three-class model consisting of high and escalating (10.1%), high and decreasing (23.2%), and consistently low (66.7%) GPP emerged as the preferred solution. More predictors and outcomes were associated with membership in both the high and escalating and the high and declining classes of GPP compared to corresponding classes of the specific symptoms trajectories.
   Limitations: Self-reported information regarding three symptoms may be a source of bias within the current study.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that unified interventions and/or prevention efforts are needed to not only assess specific symptoms, but also to treat GPP in adolescence.

AB Background: Little is known about the effect of bed-sharing with the mother over the child mental health.
   Methods: Population-based birth cohort conducted in Pelotas, Brazil. Children were enrolled at birth (n=4231) and followed-up at 3 months and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 years of age. Bed-sharing was defined as "habitual sharing of the bed between the child and the mother, for sleeping, for part of the night or the whole night". Trajectories of bed sharing between 3 months and 6 years of age were calculated. Mental health was assessed at the age of 6 years using the Development and Well-Being Assessment instrument that generates psychiatric diagnosis according to ICD-10 and DSM-W criteria. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were obtained by multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: 3583 children were analyzed. Four trajectories were identified: non bed-sharers (44.4%), early-only (36.2%), late-onset (12.0%), and persistent bed-sharers (7.4%). In the adjusted analyses persistent bed-sharers were at increased odds of presenting any psychiatric disorder (OR=1.7; 1.2-2.5) and internalizing problems (OR=2.1; 1.4-3.1), as compared to non bed-sharers. Among the early-only bed-sharers OR for any psychiatric disorder was 1.4 (1.1-1.8) and for internalizing problems 1.6 (1.2-2.1).
   Limitations: Although the effect of bed-sharing was adjusted for several covariates including the family socioeconomic status, maternal mental health and excessive crying, there was no information on maternal personal reasons for bed-sharing. Mothers that bed-share intentionally and those that bed-share in reaction to a child sleep problem may have a different interpretation of their children behavior that may bias the study results.
   Conclusion: Bed-sharing is a common practice in our setting and is associated with impaired child mental health at the age of six years.

AB The latest studies and practice guidelines for the treatment of adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa agree in pointing out the key role played by parents in determining the young patients' therapeutic possibilities and outcomes. Still family functioning has usually been studied using only self-reported instruments. The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the triadic interactions within the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa using a semi-standardized observational tool based on a recorded play session, the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP). Parents and adolescent daughters, consecutively referred to adolescent neuropsychiatric services, participated in the study and underwent the observational procedure (LIP). The 20 families of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (restricting type) were compared with 20 families of patients with internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression). The results showed different interactive patterns in the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa: they had greater difficulties in respecting roles during the play, maintaining the joint attention and in sharing positive affect, especially in the three-together phase (third phase). The majority of these families (12) exhibited collusive alliances. The parental subsystem appeared frequently unable to maintain a structuring role, i.e., providing help, support and guidance to the daughters, while the girls in turn often found it hard to show independent ideas and develop personal projects. Parents experienced difficulty in carving out a couple-specific relational space, from which the ill daughter was at least temporarily excluded also when they were asked to continue to interact with each other, letting the daughter be simply present in a third-part position (fourth phase). The study of the triadic interactions in the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa may help to shift the attention from the exclusive mother daughter relation to the involvement of the father, and of the parental couple as a whole. The family functioning is in fact well established as a maintaining factor of anorexia nervosa or vice versa as a facilitating factor in the therapeutic process.

AB Childhood trauma is a key risk factor for psychopathology. However, little is known about how exposure to childhood trauma is translated into biological risk for psychopathology. Observational human studies and experimental animal models suggest that childhood exposure to stress can trigger an enduring systemic inflammatory response not unlike the bodily response to physical injury. In turn, these "hidden wounds" of childhood trauma can affect brain development, key behavioral domains (e. g., cognition, positive valence systems, negative valence systems), reactivity to subsequent stressors, and, ultimately, risk for psychopathology. Further research is needed to better characterize the inflammatory links between childhood trauma and psychopathology. Detecting and healing these hidden wounds may help prevent and treat psychopathology emerging after childhood trauma.

AB Background: Research has supported the notion that emotion dysregulation is a core feature of BPD. However, given that this feature is typical of healthy adolescents as well as adolescents with other psychiatric disorders, the specificity of emotion dysregulation to BPD in this age group has not yet been determined. The overall aim of this study was to examine emotion dysregulation in adolescent inpatients with BPD compared with non-BPD inpatient adolescents and healthy non-clinical adolescents, taking into account both global emotion dysregulation deficits and more specific impairments.
   Method: The sample included 185 adolescent inpatients with BPD (M = 15.23, SD = 1.52), 367 non-BPD psychiatric inpatient adolescents (M = 15.37, SD = 1.40), and 146 healthy adolescents (M = 15.23, SD = 1.22), all of whom were between the ages of 12 and 17. Borderline personality features were assessed, along with emotion dysregulation and psychiatric severity.
   Results: After controlling for age, gender, and psychiatric severity, results revealed that adolescents with BPD had higher overall emotional dysregulation compared with non-BPD psychiatric controls and healthy controls. These differences were apparent in only two domains of emotion dysregulation including limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective and impulse control difficulties when experiencing negative emotions.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest BPD-specific elevations on emotion dysregulation generally, and subscales related to behavioral regulation specifically.

AB Several studies have documented the high prevalence of psychopathology and behavior problems in Williams syndrome (WS). However, the links between cognitive development and such symptoms need further clarification. Our study aims to expand current knowledge on levels of behavior problems and its links to cognition in a sample of Brazilian individuals with WS. A total of 25 children and adolescents with WS and their parents participated in this study. The participants' IQs were assessed with the Wechsler Scales of Intelligence (for children or adults) and parental reports of psychopathology/behavior problems were collected using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The presence of clinically significant attention problems was a main feature in our sample of children and adolescents with WS. In the children, higher IQ scores were found to be significantly associated with less externalizing problems, while in the adolescents cognitive abilities were found to be associated with less internalizing symptoms. These results provide further insight into the links between psychopathology and behavior problems and cognitive abilities in WS, and suggest the need to take age into consideration when analyzing such relationships.

AB Dimensional models of psychopathology that posit a general psychopathology factor (i.e., p factor), in addition to specific internalizing and externalizing factors, have recently gained prominence. However, the stability of these factors and the specificity with which they are related to one another over time (e.g., homotypic or heterotypic continuity) have not been investigated. The current study addressed these questions. We estimated bifactor models, with p, internalizing-specific, and externalizing-specific factors, with youth and caretaker reports of symptoms at two time points (18 months apart), in a large community sample of adolescents. Results showed strong stability over time with highly specific links (i.e., p factor at Time 1 to Time 2; internalizing-specific at Time 1 to Time 2 and externalizing-specific at Time 1 to Time 2), suggesting strong homotypic continuity between higher order latent psychopathology factors.

AB High rates of comorbidity are found among eating disorder (ED) patients, which may negatively affect treatment outcome and prognosis. However, there is a shortage of studies in Spain using clinician administered interviews to assess rates of comorbidity among these patients, particularly in adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate Axis I psychiatric diagnoses in adolescent patients with an ED and to compare them with patients with a distinct disorder with adolescent onset, substance use disorder (SUD) patients. Considering that maternal psychological distress is another factor involved in ED prognosis, a secondary aim was to examine the relationship between patient's psychological variables and niaternal distress (depression and anxiety). The cross-sectional study included 50 ED patients, 48 SUD patients, and their mothers. More than half of the patients received a diagnosis for a comorbid disorder. Internalizing problems were more common among EDs and externalizing disorders were the most common comorbidities among SUDs, similar to findings from other Countries. Maternal distress was associated with higher levels of depression and symptom severity in patients. No differences in distress were found between mothers of patients with a comorbid diagnosis and those without. Elevated anxiety or depression in mothers did not increase the likelihood of patients having a particular primary diagnosis. In short, while both ED and SUD patients presented high rates of comorbidity, the types of comorbid diagnoses were specific to each group. Assessing for the presence of comorbid disorders and targeting maternal psychological distress may guide treatment interventions and improve patient prognosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In light of evidence suggesting that maternal adaptation may impact early child emotional development, this study investigated the interactive effects of maternal psychosocial maladjustment and maternal sensitivity on child internalizing symptoms, with the aim of investigating the potentially protective function of maternal sensitivity. Families (N = 71 to 106 across measures, with gender spread almost evenly: number of boys = 31 to 51 across measures) took part in four assessments between child ages 1 and 3 years. Mothers completed measures of parental stress, psychological distress, and marital satisfaction when their children were between 12 and 15 months. A composite score of maternal psychosocial maladjustment was derived from these measures. Maternal sensitivity was rated by trained observers at 12 months following a home visit. Child internalizing symptoms were assessed by both parents when the child was 2 and 3 years old. Hierarchical regressions revealed that increased maternal psychosocial maladjustment was related to more internalizing symptoms in children, however only among children of less sensitive mothers. In contrast, children of more sensitive mothers appeared to be protected. This was observed with maternal reports at 2 years, and both maternal and paternal reports at 3 years. These results suggest that young children may be differentially affected by their parents' emotional adjustment, while highlighting the pivotal protective role of maternal sensitivity in this process.

AB High rates of comorbidities and poor validity of disorder diagnostic criteria for mental disorders hamper advances in mental health research. Recent work has suggested the utility of continuous cross-cutting dimensions, including general psychopathology and specific factors of externalizing and internalizing (e.g., distress and fear) syndromes. The current study evaluated the reliability of competing structural models of psychopathology and examined external validity of the best fitting model on the basis of family risk and child global executive function (EF). A community sample of 8,012 families from Brazil with children ages 6-12 years completed structured interviews about the child and parental psychiatric syndromes, and a subsample of 2,395 children completed tasks assessing EF (i.e., working memory, inhibitory control, and time processing). Confirmatory factor analyses tested a series of structural models of psychopathology in both parents and children. The model with a general psychopathology factor ("P factor") with 3 specific factors (fear, distress, and externalizing) exhibited the best fit. The general P factor accounted for most of the variance in all models, with little residual variance explained by each of the 3 specific factors. In addition, associations between child and parental factors were mainly significant for the P factors and nonsignificant for the specific factors from the respective models. Likewise, the child P factor-but not the specific factors-was significantly associated with global child EF. Overall, our results provide support for a latent overarching P factor characterizing child psychopathology, supported by familial associations and child EF.
   General Scientific Summary
   An overarching general factor appears to best describe child psychopathology. This factor seems responsible for the familial aggregation of mental disorders, and it is consistently associated with global measures of executive function.

AB Our longitudinal study contributes to the body of literature on depression in childhood by examining potential protective factors. We investigated the influence of maternal depressive symptoms on child depressive symptoms at early school age and its gender-specific moderation by children's narrative representations of the maternal figure, over and above children's own depressive symptoms at preschool age. Children's narrative representations were assessed using the MacArthur Story Stem Battery in 170 preschool children (92 girls; 54.1 %) oversampled for internalizing symptoms. Children's depressive symptoms were assessed at preschool age (Time 1; 4-6 years) and at early school age (Time 2; 6-8 years) by maternal report; mothers' depressive symptoms were assessed at Time 1. The results showed that for boys, only their own depressive symptoms at Time 1 predicted their depressive symptoms at Time 2. For girls, maternal depressive symptoms were a significant risk factor for their own depressive symptoms at Time 2. Regarding this association, we also found a moderation effect: girls with more positive narrative representations of the maternal figure showed a reduced negative impact of maternal depressive symptoms on their own depressive symptoms at Time 2. This implies that clinical practice should screen a child for early depressive symptoms, especially if the mother displays depressive symptoms. Clinicians might also assess children's inner working models, which can serve as a protective factor.

TI Sleep Duration and Child Well-Being: A Nonlinear Association
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID OBESITY; METAANALYSIS; ADULTS
AB Although numerous studies among adults have shown a U-shaped association between sleep duration and health outcomes, fewer studies have investigated the theory that children also have an optimal sleep duration range, with both lower and upper limits. We evaluated whether children's sleep duration at ages 5 and 9 has a U-shaped association with both behavioral problems and physical health at age 9. We analyzed data from 1,965 participants in a longitudinal birth cohort, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. This sample of children was 52% male and approximately 22% non-Hispanic White, 52% non-Hispanic Black, 23% Hispanic, and 3% some other race/ethnicity. The child's primary caregiver reported the predictor of interest: sleep duration at age 5 and age 9. Both children and primary caregivers reported on outcomes of the child's behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing) and overall physical health. We found that the association between children's sleep duration and well-being was typically nonlinear and U-shaped. Adjusting for their sleep duration at age 5, children who sleep either too much or too little at age 9 had higher levels of behavior problems and scored lower on a global measure of physical health. These nonlinear patterns were similar whether children or primary caregivers reported child outcomes, with the exception that there was a linear and increasing association of longer sleep duration and caregiver-rated child health. This study highlights that both short and long sleep duration may be risk factors for adverse behavioral and health outcomes in school-age children.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether parenting moderated the association between maternal depressive symptoms and initial levels and growth of preadolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. This study used a community sample of preadolescent children (N=214; 8-12 years old at Time 1), measuring maternal depressive symptoms and parenting at Time 1, and preadolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms at each year for 3 years. After modeling latent growth curves of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, growth factors were conditioned on maternal depressive symptoms, positive (acceptance and consistent discipline) and negative (rejection and physical punishment) parenting, and the interactions of depression and parenting. Maternal rejection moderated the relation of maternal depression with internalizing symptoms, such that high rejection exacerbated the effects of maternal depressive symptoms on initial levels of preadolescent internalizing problems. There were no significant interactions predicting externalizing problems. The findings highlight how specific parenting behaviors may alter the way in which maternal depressive symptoms confer risk for behavior problems.

AB Objective: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit psychiatric comorbidities, which may impact illness presentation, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. Guidelines exist for dealing with these complex cases but little is known about how comorbidities are being handled in community pediatric settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how mental health comorbidities affect community physicians' ADHD care practices and patients' symptom trajectories. Method: Medical charts of 319 children presenting at primary care clinics for ADHD-related concerns were reviewed. Physician assessment and treatment behaviors were extracted and parents rated ADHD symptoms at the time of diagnosis and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Baseline ratings were used to group children, as no comorbid mental health condition, internalizing, or externalizing comorbid condition. Multilevel analyses compared community physician care behaviors and ADHD symptom trajectories across groups. Results: Approximately, 50 percent of the sample met screening criteria for a comorbid mental health condition. For children diagnosed with ADHD and treated with medication, community physician care largely did not differ across groups, but children with internalizing comorbidities made significantly smaller improvements in inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms compared with children with no comorbidities. Conclusion: Children with ADHD and mental health comorbidities, particularly internalizing disorders, exhibit less robust response to ADHD medication and may require additional testing before starting medication and/or alternative treatment approaches. Potential barriers to, conducting comprehensive assessments and to providing multi-modal treatment are discussed.

AB Distress tolerance and emotion regulation deficits are associated with many emotional and behavioral concerns and may be important deficit areas for college students especially during the transition to college. However, little is known about how distress tolerance and emotion regulation relate to each other or what typical profiles of these deficit areas might be. We took a variable-centered (i.e., exploratory factor analysis) and a person-centered approach (i.e., latent profile analysis) to identify the overlap and distinctiveness of distress tolerance and emotion regulation deficits and then evaluated how the profiles related to several emotional and behavioral concerns. Participants were undergraduates (N = 627; age M = 20.23, SD = 1.40; 60 % female; 47 % European-American) who completed an online assessment. The exploratory factor analysis of distress tolerance and emotion regulation subscales demonstrated three factors with one factor corresponding to distress tolerance and two factors defined by emotion regulation. Subscales demonstrated significant multidimensionality across the factors. The latent profile analysis with distress tolerance and emotion regulation subscales produced three profiles corresponding to "Functional", "At Risk", and "Challenged" levels of distress tolerance and emotion regulation abilities. Internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal ideation) had significantly higher symptom severity in the "At Risk", and "Challenged" profiles than in the "Functional" profile. ADHD symptoms and hostility showed a similar pattern. Conduct problems and substance use were much less related to the deficit profiles. Implications for the etiology of mental health, for prevention and treatment of college students are discussed.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether the emotion regulation difficulties mediate the relationship between childhood psychological trauma and the symptoms of post traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Method: The sample consist of 300 women whose age between 18 and 60. Participants recruited from Adana, Mersin and Diyarbakir. Individuals were asked to complete a number of questionnaires includingDemographic Information Form, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civillian Version (PCL - C) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In this study the data was analyzed with Structural Equational Model (SEM) using LISREL 8.51 Results: Correlational analyses showed that all types of child maltreatment were uniformly associated with emotion dysregulation dimensions, and dimensions of emotion dysregulation were strongly related to depression and post traumatic stress symptoms. According to findings of this study, factor loading of emotional abuse observed variable; is the highest one among the factor loadings of maltreatment types. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that there is a partialmediator role of emotion regulation difficulties in the relation between childhood traumatic experiences and the symptoms of post traumatic stress and depression. Conclusion: This study put forward that emotion regulation is a significant factor regarding depressive and post traumatic stress symptoms which related to maltreatment in childhood. Therefore results show that training emotional regulation skills could be useful in dealing with post traumatic and depressive symptoms.

AB Background. Prior studies have suggested a relationship between atopy and mental health, although methodological barriers have limited the generalizability of these findings. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between early-life atopy and vulnerability to mental health problems among youth in the community.
   Method. Data were drawn from the Raine Study (N = 2868), a population-based birth cohort study in Western Australia. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between atopy at ages 1-5 years [using parent report and objective biological confirmation (sera IgE)], and the range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems at ages 5-17 years.
   Results. Atopy appears to be associated with increased vulnerability to affective and anxiety problems, compared to youth without atopy. These associations remained significant after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. No relationship was evident between atopy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or externalizing problems.
   Conclusions. Findings are the first linking atopy (measured by both parent report and objective verification) with increased vulnerability to affective and anxiety problems. Therefore, replication is required. If replicated, future research aimed at understanding the possible biological and/or social and environmental pathways underlying these links is needed. Such information could shed light on shared pathways that could lead to more effective treatments for both atopy and internalizing mental health problems.

AB Background. Childhood adversity predicts adolescent suicidal ideation but there are few studies examining whether the risk of childhood adversity extends to suicidal ideation in midlife. We hypothesized that childhood adversity predicts midlife suicidal ideation and this is partially mediated by adolescent internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders and adult exposure to life events and interpersonal difficulties.
   Method. At 45 years, 9377 women and men from the UK 1958 British Birth Cohort Study participated in a clinical survey. Childhood adversity was prospectively assessed at the ages of 7, 11 and 16 years. Suicidal ideation at midlife was assessed by the depressive ideas subscale of the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Internalizing and externalizing disorders were measured by the Rutter scales at 16 years. Life events, periods of unemployment, partnership separations and alcohol dependence were measured through adulthood.
   Results. Illness in the household, paternal absence, institutional care, parental divorce and retrospective reports of parental physical and sexual abuse predicted suicidal ideation at 45 years. Three or more childhood adversities were associated with suicidal ideation at 45 years [odds ratio (OR) 4.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.67-6.94]. Psychological distress at 16 years partially mediated the associations of physical abuse (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.29-5.75), sexual abuse (OR 4.99, 95% CI 2.90-11.16) with suicidal ideation. Adult life events partially mediated the association of parental divorce (OR 6.34, 95% CI -7.16 to 36.75) and physical (OR 9.59, 95% CI 4.97-27.88) and sexual abuse (OR 6.59, 95% CI 2.40-38.36) with suicidal ideation at 45 years.
   Conclusions. Adversity in childhood predicts suicidal ideation in midlife, partially mediated by adolescent internalizing and externalizing disorders, adult life events and interpersonal difficulties. Understanding the pathways from adversity to suicidal ideation can inform suicide prevention and the targeting of preventive interventions.

TI Family systems approach to attachment relations, war trauma, and mental

AB Background: Trauma affects the family unit as a whole; however, most existing research uses individual or, at most, dyadic approaches to analyse families with histories of trauma.
   Objective: This study aims to identify potentially distinct family types according to attachment, parenting, and sibling relations, to analyse how these family types differ with respect to war trauma, and to explore how children's mental health and cognitive processing differ across these family types.
   Method: Participants included Palestinian mothers and fathers (N = 325) and their children (one per family; 49.4% girls; 10-13 years old; mean +/- SD age = 11.35 +/- 0.57 years) after the Gaza War of 2008-2009. Both parents reported their exposure to war trauma, secure attachment availability, and parenting practices, as well as the target child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. Children reported their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (on the Children's Revised Impact Event Scale), depression (Birleson), and SDQ, as well as their post-traumatic cognitions (Children's Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory).
   Results: A cluster analysis identified four family types. The largest type reflected secure attachment and optimal relationships (security and positive family relationships, 36.2%, n = 102), and the smallest exhibited insecurity and problematic relationships (insecurity and negative family relationships, 15.6%; n = 44). Further, families with discrepant experiences (23.0%; n = 65) and moderate security and neutral relationships (25.2%; n = 71) emerged. The insecurity and negative relationships family type showed higher levels of war trauma; internalizing, externalizing, and depressive symptoms among children; and dysfunctional post-traumatic cognitions than other family types.
   Conclusion: The family systems approach to mental health is warranted in war conditions, and therapeutic interventions for children should, thus, also involve parents and siblings. Knowledge of unique family attachment patterns is fruitful for tailoring therapeutic treatments and preventive interventions for war-affected children and families.

AB Background/Objective: About 16 % of documented cases of maltreatment take place in adolescence, a developmental period which carries unique vulnerability. Studies investigating the impact of physical abuse find negative outcomes in cognitive functioning and academic performance, both in the short and long term. The present study aims to examine the impact of documented adolescent physical abuse on adolescent and adult academic functioning.
   Methods: This longitudinal study is comprised of two waves of data following a cohort of individuals who were physically abused in adolescence and a non-abused comparison group. We assessed academic and occupational achievement of 145 young adults (67 abused, 78 non-abused) via academic records, standardized achievement test scores, parental academic achievement, IQ, and teacher ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviors at time 1 and the highest academic degree, current work status, history of job loss at time 2 (10-14 years later).
   Results: School performance of the abused participants at time 1 showed lower grades and achievement scores, more teacher-rated problems, and more special school services than the comparison group. At the second time, the abused group completed significantly fewer years of schooling and was more likely to have lost a job. Grades at the first time, gender, parents' education, and an abuse status by IQ interaction were significant predictors of the number of years of schooling at the second time.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the pervasive impact that adolescent physical abuse can have on academic functioning and documents how these difficulties can set the stage for continuing challenges in young adulthood.

AB Background: There are significant gaps in our understanding of vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in adolescents and whether it is associated with psychosocial difficulties as well as risk factors such as child maltreatment.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in adolescents and young adults.
   Method: 570 participants (ages 14-21) from the community completed an online survey. Vulnerable and grandiose narcissism were assessed with the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, while psycho-social difficulties were assessed with the Child Behaviour Checklist and maltreatment with the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire.
   Results: Gender-specific age trends were identified, with narcissism appearing to decrease with age for females, while increasing for males into early adulthood. For females, vulnerable and grandiose narcissism was associated with maltreatment and partially mediated the relationship between abuse and neglect and internalizing and externalizing difficulties.
   Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of considering the relationship between childhood maltreatment experiences and suggest that the relationship between such experiences and adolescent psychosocial difficulties may be partially accounted for by the negative impact that maltreatment has on narcissism.

AB Background: Childhood maltreatment represents a major and preventable risk factor for psychiatric difficulties. However, the majority of studies treat maltreatment experiences as if they occur alone, but evidence suggests co-occurrence of maltreatment is the norm rather than the exception. Little is known regarding consequences of particular types and combinations of childhood maltreatment in adolescence.
   Objective: To identify classes of maltreatment types and combinations using a person centered approach (Latent Class Analysis) and then to examine whether adolescents who experienced specific types and combinations of maltreatment reported more borderline personality traits, self-injury or internalizing and externalizing difficulties.
   Methods: Participants included 327 adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 recruited from schools, colleges and a university and who completed a series of online questionnaires.
   Results: Four subgroups of maltreatment were identified including sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect co-occurring with physical and sexual abuse, as well as parental antipathy co-occurring with neglect and physical abuse. With regard to personality disorder traits, adolescents who experienced sexual abuse endorsed significantly more difficulties, as did adolescents who experienced antipathy. With regard to self-injury, adolescents who experienced sexual abuse, as well as those who experienced neglect were at higher risk. With regard to internalizing and externalizing difficulties, adolescents who experienced sexual abuse reported more internalizing difficulties, whereas those who experienced antipathy and neglect reported more internalizing and externalizing difficulties.
   Conclusion: Awareness of specific types and co-occurring maltreatment as risk factors for personality difficulties and self-injury has implications for improving trauma informed treatment.

AB Objective: To analyze the overlap of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide-related behaviors (SRB) among college students with regard to demographics, mental health, and coping styles. Participants: Respondents were 572 undergraduate students at a southwestern public university. Methods: Data were collected in 2015. Respondents completed a demographic survey and assessments of NSSI, SRB, internalizing symptoms (ie, anxiety, stress, and depression), aggression, and negative coping strategies. The survey was administered via a Web-based procedure. Results: Women reported more frequent cutting behaviors than men. Endorsement of NSSI was also associated with an increased likelihood of lifetime SRB. A subgroup of students endorsing both NSSI and SRB demonstrated poorer mental health, more negative coping, and self-reported female sex. Conclusions: College healthcare providers may benefit from competency-based training in techniques for the combination treatment of NSSI and SRB, as well as culturally based models of suicide.

AB Few studies provide firsthand experiences of parental incarceration in adolescents' own voices. Fourteen young men and women retrospectively shared their experiences of parental incarceration and family reentry during adolescence. Individual interviews focused on the following qualitative research questions: (1) What is the experience of parental incarceration and reentry for adolescents? (2) How does the child-parent relationship change from pre-to postincarceration? Relationships with incarcerated parents tended toward estrangement. Negative emotions and need for emotional support were predominant in the sample. Findings have implications for improving mental health services for children and families, trauma work, and policy interventions across services.

AB Maternal depressive symptoms predict negative child behaviors, including internalizing problems. However, protective factors, such as positive emotionality and positive parenting behaviors, may play an important a role in attenuating associations between maternal depressive symptoms and child behavior problems. This article presents two studies that examined buffers of links between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing problems. Each study examined samples of primarily African American families with young children in an impoverished large city in the Midwestern United States. Families were recruited from kindergarten classes and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) centers. In both studies, indicators of mothers' positivity, as measured by text-based analysis of positive emotion word use or behavioral observation of positive parenting behaviors, attenuated links between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing problems. The results suggest that risk for internalizing problems within the context of maternal depressive symptoms is reduced when parents experience and express more positive emotions and behaviors.

AB The present meta-analysis integrates research from 1,015 studies on associations of parenting dimensions and styles with internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. Parental warmth, behavioral control, autonomy granting, and authoritative parenting showed very small to small negative concurrent and longitudinal associations with internalizing symptoms. In contrast, harsh control, psychological control, authoritarian, and, in part, neglectful parenting were associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Parental warmth, behavioral control, harsh control, psychological control, autonomy granting, and authoritative parenting predicted change in internalizing symptoms over time, with associations of internalizing symptoms with parental warmth, psychological control, and authoritative parenting being bidirectional. Moderating effects of study characteristics are identified. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB The present paper summarizes results from meta-analyses on psychological well-being of children with chronic physical illnesses and their parents. At the beginning, we discuss potential reasons for psychological effects of a chronic physical illness on children and adolescents as well as their parents. We then summarize results of meta-analyses of studies that compared aspects of mental health of children with a chronic physical illness and their parents with families of healthy children. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms in general were most elevated in children with chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic headache while externalizing symptoms were most elevated in young people with epilepsy, chronic headache, and cerebral palsy. Depression and anxiety was less elevated in the ill children than in their parents. Parents of children with HIV-infection/AIDS and cerebral palsy reported the highest levels of distress, followed by parents of children diagnosed with cancer and spina bifida. Conclusions are drawn for future research and practice.

AB The present study aimed to determine whether a parent-child gender match would influence child psychological adjustment after divorce. Participants included 69 parents (36 mothers) in active family law litigation to resolve issues related to post-dissolution of marriage or time-sharing matters. Participants provided demographic information and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991) to assess their perceptions of their child's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Results demonstrated that internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not affected by whether children spent more time with the same gender parent, opposite gender parent, or split their time equally between both. Comparisons and contradictions between the results in this study and existing research are discussed, as well as practical implications.

AB The goal of the present study was to shed light on the relation between postseparation custody arrangements and family contexts in which school-age children (8-12 years old) live so as to better understand the processes underlying their adjustment. The sample was composed of 112 dyads (parents and children) from families in joint custody (n = 37) or maternal custody (n = 75). The dyads were met with twice at a 1-year interval. Compared with those in joint custody, the respondents with sole custody had a negative opinion of the transitions between homes and had the impression that the children were more involved in interparental conflicts. This analysis showed that the difficult nature of transitions between homes was a crucial mediating variable in the relation between conflicts and the children's adjustment, but that other variables, such as the relational problems with the mother, played a role, particularly in joint custody situations.

AB There is a paucity of selective, Tier 2 interventions that educators can implement for students with internalizing problems as part of their schools' Multi-Tiered Systems of Supports. To fill this void, the authors' purpose was to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and integrity of a structured school-based mentoring program, the Courage and Confidence Mentor Program (CCMP), for elementary students. A single-case experimental multiple baseline design across participants was used to evaluate the efficacy of the CCMP with 6 students. Visual analysis of the results and single-case effect size estimates revealed that all but 1 of the participants demonstrated noticeable reductions in internalizing problems as measured by teacher-completed direct behavior ratings. Findings were confirmed by other dependent variables gathered from students and teachers. Limitations of the methods and directions for future research involving Tier 2 interventions for elementary students with internalizing problems are discussed.

AB Adolescents in residential treatment centers (RTCs) often have a severe mental illness as well as significant deficits in their social competencies. Strong Teens is a social and emotional learning (SEL) curriculum designed to decrease internalizing disorders by promoting emotional resilience and social competence. The curriculum has shown promising effects in educational settings. This study is the second to implement Strong Teens in residential treatment with high-risk adolescents. Using a quasi-experimental wait-list control design, therapists implemented Strong Teens with 36 adolescent girls in an RTC during group therapy. The researchers assessed changes in social and emotional knowledge, internalizing symptoms, and resilience using a split-plot repeated measures ANOVA, paired samples t-tests, and effect sizes. Although results indicated that Strong Teens did not affect the girls' social and emotional knowledge, the intervention did show evidence of reducing their internalizing symptoms and increasing their resilience. In a social validity survey, most group therapists agreed with the goals and procedures of the curriculum but were less certain regarding the outcomes. We recommend that future studies of this population investigate which SEL topics are most suitable, identify the most favorable lesson times for RTC implementation, and explore student perspectives and experiences with Strong Teens.

AB Objectives: This study explored the behavioral and emotional adjustment of Israeli school-age children who are exposed to political violence. Based on Bronfenbrenner's (1986) ecological model and ecological model of psychosocial trauma (Harvey, 2007), we examined the direct contribution of exposure, gender, maternal characteristics (mother's posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], maternal care and maternal control), and community type (development town vs. kibbutz), to school-age children's adjustment. In addition, we examined whether maternal characteristics and community type moderated the association between exposure and adjustment. Method: There were 121 mother-child dyads from the development town of Sderot (n = 62) and from the surrounding kibbutzim (n = 58) participated. Results: Revealed that being a boy, living in Sderot, and mothers' higher PTSS, contributed directly to children's total difficulties (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problems), and that maternal control moderated the association between personal exposure and children's total difficulties. Furthermore, being a girl and mother's higher PTSS and higher maternal control contributed directly to children's PTSS. Mother's PTSS moderated the association between personal exposure and children's PTSS. Maternal care was not associated with children's adjustment. Conclusions: Both the child's gender and the type of community in which he or she lives are associated with maternal distress and children's adjustment to political violence.

AB Bullying is a public health problem which can impact both physical and psychosocial health of the children involved. The research on school bullying and its impact on Thai children's mental health is limited. This cross sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of bullying and the association between bullying and psychosocial problems among primary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted a survey among 368 students, aged 9-14 years, in three public primary schools during August 2011, using one-step cluster sampling method. The Thai version of the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire was used to assess bullying involvement. Psychosocial problems were assessed using the Thai version of Child Behavioral Checklist (Thai Youth Checklist), parental version. A total of 253. students (68.7%) reported involvement in bullying over the preceding 2-3 months (4.3% as a bully, 34% as a victim, and 30.4% as a bully victim). A multivariate analysis revealed that being a bully was associated with having separated or divorced parents (AOR=5.0; 95% CI: 1.2-19.7), while being a bully-victim was associated with male gender (AOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.3-4.3). Being a bully was associated with externalizing problems (AOR=4.5; 95% CI: 2.7-78.1), whereas being a bully-victim was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems (AOR=2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.6; and AOR=3.8; 95% CI: 1.6-8.8, respectively). In conclusion, school bullying in Thailand is a severe problem and is significantly associated with psychosocial problems. Effective strategies for its prevention and management are urgently needed.

AB The questionnaire study examined the contribution of gender, age and reinforcement sensitivity to the common structure of child personality and problem behaviors in two samples, parent reports of 2-18-year-olds (N = 968) and self-reports of 11-18-year-olds (N = 1543), using the Inventory of Child Individual Differences - Short version (ICID-S) to measure personality, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess emotional and behavioral problems, and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). A joint factor analysis of the ICID-S and SDQ scales suggested a four-factor structure, including Organization, Positive, Behavior Problems, and Internalizing. This four-factor model was remarkably similar to previously reported models of personality and psychopathology. Congruence coefficients indicated that factors based on parent reports and adolescent self-reports were highly similar at all levels of the hierarchy. Gender, age, sensitivity to punishment, and sensitivity to reward generally made independent contributions to personality-psychopathology factors. Sensitivity to reward made a substantial contribution to Externalizing (conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention), whereas sensitivity to punishment contributed to Internalizing (shyness, fears and emotional symptoms). The link between sensitivity to punishment and Internalizing in older adolescents was stronger than in younger. The protective effect of punishment sensitivity on Externalizing was found in girls only. These findings demonstrate the role of motivational brain-behavior systems in the development of normal and abnormal patterns of behavior and emotions.

AB Youth in foster care are more likely to experience health problems such as asthma compared to youth who are not in foster care. Data from a longitudinal study of youth in out-of-home care in one Midwestern metropolitan area were used to examine the association between placement-related factors and receiving treatment for asthma. Controlling for sociodemo-graphic characteristics, youth who experienced more than one asthma spell, who were African American, or who had an internalizing mental health diagnosis were at increased risk of asthma. The finding that placement-related factors are associated with asthma in foster care youth raises implications for health service delivery.

AB Objective: A possible relationship between high pregnancy stress and the child's short duration of breastfeeding, and psychopathology have been reported in research. However, relationship of childhood psychopathology with various factors in pre and postnatal periods is under-researched in Turkish academic literature and the results are inconsistent. Besides, existing local studies have either focused on certain diagnostic groups or only used screening questionnaires in preschool age children. The aim of the present study was therefore, to examine the relationship of these factors with childhood internalizing-externalizing psychopathology in a clinical sample, where diagnoses were confirmed with semi-structured interviews and their dimensional examination was supported with a validated questionnaire.
   Methods: Subjects, aged between 6 and 18 years, who had been assessed at the Bezmialem Vakif University, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic between June and December 2016, were included to the study. A total of 100 children and adolescents diagnosed with an internalizing problem, 175 subjects with diagnosis of an externalizing problem and 59 children and adolescents with no diagnosis were examined. Diagnoses of the subjects were established with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Turkish Version (K-SADS-T) and psychiatric interview based on DSM-5 criteria for diagnoses not included in the K-SADS-T. Strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and a socio-demographic data tool about pre and postnatal factors were completed by the parents.
   Findings: Mean age of the sample was 9.6 +/- 3.0 years and 67.7% of the sample were male. Total duration of breastfeeding was significantly lower (Z=2.61 p=0.009) in subjects with an externalizing problem (12.3 +/- 8.4 months) than subjects with no diagnosis (15.7 +/- 9.0 months). Proportion of the subjects breastfed for less than 6 months were significantly higher in subjects with internalizing problems (23.0%) and externalizing problems (48.6%) than children with no diagnosis (10.2%) (chi(2)=4.10 p=0.043;chi(2)=5.53 p=0.019, respectively). Frequency of postpartum depression did not differ between groups, however postpartum anxiety was significantly more common in subjects with an externalizing problems (25.4%) as compared to subjects with no diagnosis (12.3%) (chi(2)=4.20 p=0.038).
   Conclusion: According to our literature search, the present study is the first, where relationship between pre and postnatal factors and internalizing-externalizing dichotomy in school age children were assessed using a clinical interview and screening questionnaire. Maternal postpartum anxiety and short duration of breastfeeding was shown to be related with long term negative consequences in the present study, which is in line with the existing literature.

DE Children; maternal alcohol use; mental health; multiple informants;
   problem drinking
AB Background: Offspring of individuals with alcohol use disorders have been shown to have elevated risk for mental health problems. Objectives: To examine the association between maternal problem drinking and child mental health as assessed by three informants in three European countries. Methods: Data were drawn from the School Child Mental Health in Europe study. Maternal alcohol use was assessed using the alcohol use disorders identification test. Child mental health was assessed using the mother and teacher versions of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, and the child self-reported Dominic interactive. Analyses were performed on 2,678 individuals, 6-11year olds. Results: Adjusting for variables associated with maternal drinking, among children eight years old or younger, excessive drinking was not significantly associated with mental health problems, whether reported by the mother, teacher or by the child. However, among girls eight years old and above, problem drinking was associated with conduct problems as reported by the mother (OR = 4.19), teacher reported total difficulties (OR = 4.69), and peer relationship problems (OR = 8.86). It was also associated with the presence of any child-reported disorder (OR = 3.88), externalizing (OR = 5.55) and internalizing disorders (OR = 4.42). Conclusions/Importance: Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and for psychological distress, maternal problem drinking was not significantly associated with child mental health problems in boys or in girls ages six to eight. The association was only present among girls ages 8-11. Examining relationships between mothers and their daughters in the peripubertal period may be a critical window for the development of effective intervention strategies.

AB Purpose - Previous literature demonstrated low-to-moderate rates of agreement between children and mothers regarding child anxiety. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate factors related to differences between mother-child dyads who disagreed vs agreed in their reports of child anxiety symptoms.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 87 children aged 9-12 years old and their mothers completed questionnaires regarding maternal perceptions of child behavior, maternal separation anxiety about the child's individuation, and mother-child relationship characteristics.
   Findings - The results showed that mothers in mother-child dyads who disagreed on child anxiety symptoms, compared to those in dyads who agreed on child anxiety symptoms, perceived their children as showing higher affect intensity and behavioral problems. They also expressed greater anxiety about the children's individuation process, characterized in part by children's increased autonomy and decline of reliance on them. Further, children in dyads who disagreed, compared to those in dyads who agreed, reported lower mother-child attachment security.
   Originality/value - The results extend the literature by identifying specific factors related to the discrepancy between mothers' and children's reports of childhood anxiety in early adolescence. The results highlight the need to consider both mothers' and children's views when assessing childhood anxiety. Importantly, the results also indicate that specific factors investigated in this study, including maternal perception of children's behavioral problems and their affect intensity, maternal anxiety about child individuation, and mother-child attachment security, could be used to inform clinical decisions regarding informant discrepancies.

   RESPONSES
AB Objective: Engagement in risk behaviors, including substance use, risky sex, and violence, tends to increase throughout adolescence into young adulthood. One motivational process that may underlie risk behaviors during adolescence is negative reinforcement. Moreover, gender and internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) may both convey risk for negative reinforcement-based risk taking. Along these lines, the aims of the current study were to (a) examine gender differences in negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity and (b) examine internalizing symptoms as a moderator of the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity. Method: Participants included 103 youth between the ages of 18 and 21 (50.49% female, age M(SD) = 19.41(1.06)) who were recruited from a large Mid-Atlantic university between September 2013 and November 2014. Participants completed self-report assessments of internalizing symptomatology and a computerized behavioral analog assessment of negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity. Results: Results indicated that, overall, female older adolescents were riskier under conditions of negative reinforcement than male older adolescents. In addition, internalizing symptoms significantly moderated the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity such that the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity was nonsignificant at high levels of internalizing symptoms, and female gender was significantly positively predictive of heightened negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity at low levels of internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Thus, although female youth overall were riskier, the predictive utility of gender for negative reinforcement-based risk taking may be most relevant at low levels of internalizing symptoms. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future prevention and intervention.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how different trajectories of emotional symptoms relate to alcohol use in adolescence.
   Design/methodology/approach - In all, 431 participants (majority female), aged approximately 13 years at baseline were followed over three years and reported on their emotional symptoms and alcohol use. Latent class growth analyses explored different trajectories of emotional symptoms and regression models were run to relate these trajectories to alcohol use (full standard drink, and binge drinking) at 36-month follow-up (age 16 years).
   Findings - While the majority of adolescents were best characterised by low-stable emotional symptoms, those with high-stable symptoms were more likely to be have consumed a full standard drink of alcohol and binge drunk when aged 16 years.
   Research limitations/implications - Findings highlight the importance of prevention and early intervention, particularly targeting adolescents with elevated stable emotional symptoms who were more likely to be using alcohol at 16 years of age.
   Originality/value - The present study is one of the first longitudinal investigations into the use of alcohol by community adolescents with different emotional symptom trajectories.

AB Exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) significantly impacts outcomes for children in behavioral health systems of care (SOCs). The present study built on previous research that found parenting stress influences outcomes for children exposed to PTEs. The sample included 184 young children and their families who were enrolled in an early childhood SOC. Path analyses demonstrated that parenting stress mediated the relationship between the number of PTEs a child experienced and caregiver-reported internalizing/externalizing problem behaviors at baseline. Parenting stress also mediated PTEs and internalizing problem behaviors at 6 months. In response to the culmination of these studies, we discuss ways SOCs can support parents to help alleviate parenting stress.

AB Background. Pediatric chronic pain often emerges in adolescence and cooccurs with internalizing mental health issues and sleep impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that sleep problems may precede the onset of chronic pain as well as anxiety and depression. Studies conducted in pediatric populations with pain-related chronic illnesses suggest that internalizing mental health symptoms may mediate the sleep-pain relationship; however, this has not been examined in youth with primary pain disorders. Objective. To examine whether anxiety and depressive symptoms mediated relationships between sleep quality and pain outcomes among youth with chronic pain. Methods. Participants included 147 youth (66.7% female) aged 8-18 years who were referred to a tertiary-level chronic pain program. At intake, the youth completed psychometrically sound measures of sleep quality, pain intensity, pain interference, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results. As hypothesized, poor sleep quality was associated with increased pain intensity and pain interference, and anxiety and depressive symptoms mediated these sleep-pain relationships. Discussion. For youth with chronic pain, poor sleep quality may worsen pain through alterations in mood and anxiety; however, prospective research using objective measures is needed. Future research should examine whether targeting sleep and internalizing mental health symptoms in treatments improve pain outcomes in these youth.

AB This study evaluated and compared three different factor structures of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) in a gastroenterology (GI) and a general pediatrics (GP) sample. Parents of GP (n=169) and GI (n=177) patients completed the PSC. Each structure includes internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems. Only one structure includes school problems. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed higher internalizing symptoms for GI patients across factor structures. The relationship between internalizing symptoms and age was moderated by group. The PSC seems sensitive to internalizing difficulties in GI patients regardless of factor structure. Older pediatric GI patients may be at increased risk for internalizing symptoms.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine the association of structural language and pragmatic communication with behavior problems and social competence in girls adopted internationally. Participants included girls between 6-12 years of age who were internationally adopted from China (n=32) and Eastern-Europe (n=25) and a control group of never-adopted girls (n=25). Children completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Parents completed the Child Communication Checklist- second edition, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Home and Community Social Behavior Scales. Compared to the controls, parents in the Eastern European group reported more problems with social competence, externalizing behaviors, structural language, and pragmatic communication. The Chinese group evidenced more internalizing problems. Using generalized linear regression, interaction terms were examined to determine if the associations of pragmatic communication and structural language with behavior problems and social competence varied across groups. Controlling for general intellectual functioning, poorer pragmatic communication was associated with more externalizing problems and poorer social competence. In the Chinese group, poorer pragmatic communication was associated with more internalizing problems. Post-adoption weaknesses in pragmatic communication are associated with behavior problems and social competence. Internationally adopted children may benefit from interventions that target pragmatic communication.

TI Mindfulness for adolescent chronic pain: a pilot feasibility study

AB Objective: Chronic pain is common in paediatric populations and many patients do not respond to the currently available evidence-based treatments. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have a growing evidence-base in adults, but evidence is limited in youth with chronic pain.
   Methods: We conducted an open-label pilot study to test the feasibility of an 8-week MBI for this population.
   Results: Seven adolescents (age range 14-17; median age 15; six female) completed the intervention. There were no dropouts. Median class attendance was seven of eight total sessions (SD = 0.76). Only one (14.3%) participant reported not finding it useful; five (71.4%) reported that they would recommend it to a friend; and the remaining two (28.6%) reported "maybe". There was no worsening of internalizing symptoms. Secondary outcomes included significant reduction of pain intensity, which was maintained at three-month follow-up. Somatic symptoms and functional disability were both non-significantly lower immediately following the intervention; but were significantly improved at three-month follow-up.
   Conclusion: An eight-week group MBI is a feasible intervention for adolescents with chronic pain, and warrants further investigation as a potential alternative to cognitive behavioural therapy in this population.

AB Rumination, a cognitive process that involves passively, repetitively focusing on negative feelings and their meaning, is a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. Research with adults has suggested that attentional control difficulties may underlie rumination, but questions remain about the nature of these processes. Furthermore, the relationship between attentional control and rumination in youth has received little empirical examination. In the present study, 92 youth (ages 9-14; 72% girls; 74% Caucasian) reported on their trait rumination and internalizing symptoms. They also completed a 1,500 ms emotional-faces dot-probe task while their eye movements were measured to examine overt visual attention with high temporal precision. Youth's rumination was associated with greater dwell on emotional faces but not with initial orientation. These findings suggest that rumination is associated with increased attention to emotional information during the later stages of selective attention rather than earlier orienting to emotional cues. Implications for prevention and treatment of psychopathology are discussed.

AB Research suggests that rumination places adolescents at risk for psychopathology. However, little is known about the association between parenting and rumination. Moreover, relevant theoretical models suggest that parents contribute to the development of rumination both explicitly through their suggestions about how to cope and implicitly through the context of the mother-adolescent relationship. However, prior work has not examined implicit and explicit factors within the same investigation, precluding exploration of their unique and interactive effects. To address these gaps, the present study examined links between mother-adolescent relationship quality, maternal coping suggestions, and adolescent rumination. Participants were early adolescent girls (M age = 12.41 years) and their primary female caregivers. Findings suggested that maternal disengagement suggestions and mother-adolescent relationship quality were each uniquely associated with adolescent rumination. Moreover, the effect of maternal disengagement suggestions depended on the level of maternal engagement suggestions and mother-adolescent relationship quality. Follow-up analyses revealed that these findings were specific to the maladaptive ruminative brooding component of rumination. Future directions for research were elaborated.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether it was possible to develop a reliable and valid assessment of reflective parenting implicit in interaction with school-aged children using an adaptation of the Squiggle paradigm developed by Winnicott (1968) and a manualized coding system (Normandin, Leroux, Ensink, Terradas, & Fonagy, 2015). A total of 158 mother-child dyads participated when children were age 5 to 12. Of this group, 89 children had experienced sexual abuse. Interrater reliability using the manualized coding system was excellent. The factor analysis identified a reflective parenting stance factor, in addition to an affectionate support factor and a negative parenting factor. Furthermore, there was a medium strength relationship between the mother's reflective parenting stance evident in her interactions with her child and parental reflective functioning assessed using the Parent Development Interview (Slade, Aber, Bresgi, Berger, & Kaplan, 2004), suggesting the parental reflective stance is a good indicator of parental reflective functioning in interaction. With regard to parent reports of child internalizing and externalizing behaviors, the reflective parenting stance was the only predictor of internalizing difficulties and a significant predictor of externalizing difficulties in addition to sexual abuse.

AB Background: Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk of anxiety and depression. This is important to identify in the clinical assessment to understand its impact.Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between parent- and self-reports of anxiety and depression in adolescents with ADHD or ASD, as well as the correlation with adaptive functioning and performance on an attention test.Method: A total of 65 adolescents with an ADHD diagnosis (n=24) or an ASD diagnosis (n=41) filled out Beck Youth Inventories of Emotional and Social Impairment (BYI) to assess depression and anxiety and completed a Continuous Performance Test (QbTest) measuring ADHD symptoms. Parents of the participants completed the internalizing domain in the Five to Fifteen questionnaire (FTF), measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) about the adolescent's adaptive functioning.Results: Approximately a third of the study group self-reported substantial internalizing mental symptoms not always recognized by parents, and not always obvious in adaptive function or performance at ADHD test. Correlations between BYI and FTF were low. The BYI depression inventory correlated negatively with VABS and positively with activity level in a subgroup medicated for ADHD. There was a stronger correlation between girls BYI and FTF results as compared with boys.Conclusions: The results highlight the need for identification of anxiety and depression, using both self- and parent report. Present anxiety and depression symptoms do not seem to affect the clinical assessment of ASD and ADHD.

AB The entrance of parents into substance abuse treatment provides a unique opportunity to discuss parenting with them, and to inquire about the psychological wellbeing of their children. This is important because parental substance abuse is associated with an increased risk for the development of mental health problems in children. In this study, clients from a Dutch outpatient treatment facility who had custody of or regular contact with their children completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) about their children aged 4 to 17 years (N = 99), after being referred to a parenting consultation with a specialized professional. Compared to other studies conducted in Western Europe and Australia with similar at-risk populations, the SDQ results in the present study suggested a lower percentage of children with psychosocial problem behavior. Still, 29% of the children in our sample showed psychosocial problems in the clinical range. According to logistic regression analyses, which tested associations between client and family characteristics and risk of psychosocial problems, 5 factors (client's gender, education level, presence of financial debts, child's age, and absence of siblings) were associated with a higher likelihood of one or more types of psychosocial problems. Present findings suggest that, of children whose substance-abusing parents enter outpatient treatment, almost one third may have psychosocial problems that require further assessment and treatment.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of rural energy transition in cooking options in India. Although India is aiming to achieve a double-digit economic growth, a large share of rural households still rely on firewood for cooking which not only has serious repercussions of increasing indoor pollution but also has a concomitant adverse effect on women and child morbidity and mortality. However, transition to clean energy options like improved cookstoves for these households may not be necessarily linear. It is often driven or resisted by latent factors such as caste, trust, social capital, information flow, social positioning of clusters that are deeply embedded in the social and cultural norms and values specific to local rural contexts. This has been shown in the present case study that pertains to eight villages in the remote and deprived Purnea district of Bihar and the need for internalizing them in the macro energy policymaking has been established in the paper.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a macro foundation research that is complemented by micro foundation tools of fuzzy cognitive mapping-based mental model framework to achieve the purpose of the study. Focused-group discussions and interviews are also conducted to establish the narrative of the paper.
   Findings - Caste, socio-political position, asset structure, remoteness, culture and technology access affect rural households' decision making capability that is related to shifting from using the traditionalmeans of firewood and biomass based traditional cookstoves for cooking to adopting improved clean cooking stoves which will enable the transition toward the use of clean rural energy in the eight villages in Bihar chosen for this study.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings of the paper have larger implications for the broader macro energy policymaking in the country by taking into account the non-linear, latent factors of village contexts.
   Practical implications - The research will help energy policymakers in decision-making and will guide the implementation process of national- and state-level policies on rural energy transition in India. Social implications - The findings of the paper will help the smoother implementation of national-and state-level rural energy transition policies for cooking, creating developmental dividends for rural Indian households.
   Originality/value - The research is new with regard to the application of non-deterministic fuzzy cognitive mapping-based mental model approach to contribute to the country's national-and state-level rural energy transition policies.

AB Objectives: The aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of bullying victimization among Korean adolescents by sex and age and to investigate the correlates of this phenomenon.
   Methods: Of 3,200 eligible subjects, 2,936 (91.8%) adolescents were recruited from four elementary schools (6th grade, age range: 10-12 years), five middle schools (8th grade, age range: 13-14 years), and three high schools (10th grade, age range: 15-17 years) located in the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, Republic of Korea. This study used a self-administered questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and experiences of bullying victimization and employed the Korean form of the Children's Depression Inventory to evaluate depressive symptoms.
   Results: Of the total sample of 2,936 students, 1,689 were boys (57.5%) and 1,247 were girls (42.5%). The prevalence of bullying victimization by age group was as follows: 10-12 years, 9.5%; 13-14 years, 8.3%; and 15-17 years, 6.4%. A significant difference in the prevalence of bullying victimization was observed by sex (boys: 45.0%, girls: 55.0%). Overall, the prevalence decreased with age. After adjusting for age and sex, bullying victimization was significantly associated with lower socioeconomic status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.67), lower than average academic achievement (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.25-2.50), more depressive symptoms (OR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.38-2.55), and poorer perceived relationship with parents (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.00-2.14).
   Conclusion: Our findings will provide researchers and public health practitioners with data on the prevalence of bullying victimization and help to identify the risk factors for later behavioral and emotional problems.

AB Children's and parents' attachment patterns have been linked with the presence of pediatric anxiety disorders. The present study examined the role of attachment in predicting cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) treatment outcomes. A total of 69 children aged 7-13years were assessed using a semi-structured interview, and treated with CBT. Differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to pretreatment characteristics were explored, and the predictive power of factors significantly different between groups was assessed using binominal logistic regression. Responders and nonresponders did not significantly differ with regard to child's attachment to parent. Maternal attachment anxiety was found to be the strongest predictor of treatment outcome, remaining significant after controlling for symptoms severity. Results suggest that clinicians should pay more attention to how the relationships formed between anxious children and their anxiously attached mothers may prohibit a positive treatment response, and augment treatment appropriately.

AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with numerous long-term consequences and warrants significant clinical attention. Recent theoretical models and empirical research have suggested that several factors play a role in the development of IPV perpetration, including childhood maltreatment, early maladaptive schemas, anger, and difficulties in emotion regulation. This study investigated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and IPV, specifically examining the mediation of this relationship by several variables thought to be related to this pernicious problem, including early maladaptive schemas, the experience of anger, and emotion regulation difficulties. In a young adult collegiate sample of 110 women in relationships, results of a bootstrapped multiple mediation analysis supported the hypothesis that childhood maltreatment predicted physical aggression within intimate partner relationships and found that the total indirect effect of childhood maltreatment on physical aggression through the 3 proposed mediators was significant. However, consistent with recent empirical findings, only difficulties in emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical aggression within the sample.

AB Theoretical models of learning highlight the role of engagement. The current investigation assessed the role of self-concept, locus of control, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and self-perceived interest and competence in reading in reading achievement. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K), longitudinal (third grade) predictors of eighth grade reading achievement and motivation, and concurrent predictors of eighth grade reading achievement were analyzed. Regression modeling revealed that self-perceived interest and competence in reading, behavior problems, self-concept, and locus of control were weak predictors of reading achievement, both longitudinally and concurrently. Socioeconomic status and third grade reading achievement were the strongest predictors of eighth grade reading achievement. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for reading deficits, especially for children of low socioeconomic status.

AB This study investigated the degree to which emotion regulation difficulties moderate the negative association between interparental conflict (i.e., parents' demand/withdraw patterns and symbolic aggression) and young adults' mental well-being. Participants included 171 young adults (18-28 years old) from intact families who completed an online survey. Using confirmatory factor analysis and SEM, results indicated when young adults have great difficulty in regulating emotions, perceptions of interparental conflict do not significantly predict mental health symptoms. However, fewer difficulties in regulating emotions actually magnify the negative effects of witnessing interparental conflict on young adults' mental well-being. Hence, while successful emotion management is important for everyday functioning, heightened regulation abilities may simultaneously contribute to young adults' awareness of the harmful impact of family discord.

AB Using an online survey methodology, we examined individual differences in distance communication between 75 adolescents and their deployed parents and found substantial individual differences in both the quantity and quality of their communication. We also examined the statistical associations between these features of distance communication and adolescents' functioning, including emotional reactions following communication, health-related quality of life, and externalizing and internalizing problems. The quantity of communication of deployed parents with their adolescents was not associated with adolescents' functioning, but more positive and less controlling communication was statistically associated with adolescents' higher functioning. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.

AB Rumination, a perseverative cognitive process that involves repetitively and passively focusing on negative emotions, is a transdiagnostic risk factor for the development of psychopathology. Although rumination has been linked to various forms of psychopathology including depression, anxiety, and alcohol misuse, little is known about the conditions that lead to multifinality. Here, we test putative moderators (Nolen-Hoeksema & Watkins, 2011) of the association between rumination and subsequent internalizing symptoms and frequency of alcohol use during adolescence. Participants included 388 youth (52% girls; 90% Caucasian) in a longitudinal birth cohort study who completed questionnaires in Grades 9 and 11. Brooding, a maladaptive form of rumination measured in Grade 9, was associated with greater internalizing symptoms in Grade 11 and greater perceived peer rejection in Grade 9 amplified this association. Brooding was also associated with greater frequency of alcohol use among adolescents who reported having more friends who use alcohol. Gender differences were also examined. Findings provide support for some of the predictions regarding moderators of multifinality made by Nolen-Hoeksema and Watkins. Implications of understanding divergent trajectories in the prevention of psychopathology are discussed.

AB Almost no research has examined the role of parent-school relationships in relation to child psychological functioning in adoptive families or same-sex parent families, much less same-sex adoptive families. Yet adoptive families, and particularly same-sex adoptive families, may be vulnerable to marginalization in the school setting, which could have implications for child adjustment. Using parent reports, in a sample of 106 lesbian, gay, and heterosexual adoptive parent families with young children (Mage = 3.38 years at Ti and 5.42 years at T2), this study examined T1 parent-school relationships (school involvement, parent-teacher relationship quality, parent school contact about child problems, and perceived acceptance by other parents) and adoption-specific school experiences at T1 (i.e., parent input about classroom inclusion and parent-teacher conflicts related to adoptive family status) in relation to children's later (T2) internalizing and externalizing symptoms, controlling for Ti symptoms. Follow-up analyses assessed these predictors in relation to concurrent (Ti) symptoms. Family context and demographic variables were included as controls. Parents' school involvement was negatively related to later internalizing symptoms; providing input to teachers about inclusion, and parent-teacher conflicts related to adoption, were both positively related to later internalizing symptoms. Perceived acceptance by other parents was negatively related to later internalizing and externalizing symptoms. School-initiated contact about child problems more strongly predicted higher externalizing symptoms in same-sex parent families than heterosexual parent families. Cross-sectional analyses (Ti predictors in relation to Ti child outcomes) revealed a somewhat different set of findings: most notably, parents' school involvement was negatively related to externalizing symptoms. Findings have implications for early childhood educators and school administrators who seek to improve diverse family-school partnerships to enhance children's emotional and behavioral well-being.

AB Discrimination experienced by Latino youth in school has been explored in past research although the interrelatedness of culture and educational stressthe stress due to Hispanic culture not being acknowledged in school and racial tensions in schoolhas been less studied. The current study examines the effect of this stress on internalizing symptoms among 58 low-income Latino adolescents (M-age =13.31, 53% male) and tests whether ethnic identity moderates this association. Results show that culture and educational stress is associated with worse mental health. Further, a significant ethnic identity X stress interaction was found for somatic problems showing that youth high in ethnic identity exploration reported more somatic problems in the face of high culture and educational stress. Hence, youth who are more actively exploring their identity may be more vulnerable to the damaging context of culture and educational stress. Implications for multicultural consultation are discussed.

AB Background: Many youth initiate opioid misuse with prescription opioids and transition over time to more severe substance-using behaviors, including injection. Trait mindfulness is a potentially protective factor. Objectives: This is a cross-sectional study characterizing a sample of opioid-using youth by level of mindfulness and examines the potential effect modification of emotion regulation on the relationship between mindfulness and progression to injection opioid use. Methods: A convenience sample of 112 youth (ages 14-24) was recruited during an episode of inpatient detoxification and residential treatment for opioid use disorders. We examined emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), mindfulness (Child Acceptance and Mindfulness Measure), and opioid use. We completed multivariable regressions stratified by degree of emotion regulation looking at relationship of mindfulness on time to injection use from age of first prescription opioid. Results: Youth had difficulties in emotion regulation (m = 104.2; SD = 2.41) and low mindfulness (m = 19.1;SD = 0.59). While we found overall that mindfulness was associated with time to progression to injection opioid use, there was significant effect modification. Among youth with high levels of difficulty in emotion regulation, those with high mindfulness trait had quicker progressions to injection (-1.31years; p =.003). In contrast, youth with normal emotion regulation and high mindfulness trait had a slower progression to injection (1.67years; p =.041). Conclusion/Importance: Our study showed a majority of youth presenting with opioid use disorders have impairments in emotion regulation and deficits in trait mindfulness. The relationship between mindfulness and opioid use is impacted by emotion regulation capacity. More research is needed to understand the various facets of mindfulness and how they interact with emotion regulation in youth.

AB This study examines the psychological problems of chronically ill Malaysian children. The sample consisted of 63 parents of children suffering from cancer, epilepsy and asthma. The Child behavior checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991) for ages 4-18 with its subscales of internalizing, externalizing, thought, attention and social problems was used to assess the behavioral problems of the children as perceived by their parents. The data were collected from the pediatric outpatients and wards of Kuala Lumpur General Hospital. The data were analyzed for differences between children suffering from cancer, epilepsy and asthma on the CBCL and its subscales using one-way analyses of variance. A priori comparisons were computed between one illness and a combination of other two illnesses to substantiate the findings of ANOVAs. The findings supported our hypothesis that children suffering from cancer, epilepsy and asthma differed in the degree of their psychological problems. The results demonstrated that children suffering from cancer had more internalizing problems as compared to the children suffering from epilepsy and asthma. The results also indicated the presence of more thought, attention and social problems in the case of epileptic children compared to cancer and asthmatic children. Contrary to our hypothesis, the cancer children showed more externalizing problems than the asthmatic children.

AB Introduction: Migraine is a common disorder in children and adolescents, associated with various disorders such as emotions, behavioral problems, and sleep disturbances.
   Aim of the study is to verify the relationship between psychological problems of cephalalgic patients and sleep disturbances. Materials and methods: 64 subjects (27 females), aged 8-12 years (mean 9.4 years, SD +/- 1.03) with primary headache were enrolled. CBCL 6-18 scale and the SDSC scale were used for behavioral screening and for assessing sleep habits.
   Results: According to the ICHD-III criteria, the distribution of the headache subtype was as follows: headaches without aura (71.87%), headache episodes typical of tension (7.81%) and chronic headache (7.81%) (Figure 1).
   CBCL assessment (total problem element) showed an interesting relationship with sleep disorders such as DIMS, DA and SWTD (respectively r = .37, p = 0.019; r = .39, p = 0.015; r = 37, p = 0.019).
   Discussion: MwA children revealed a specific behavioral phenotype characterized by internalization problems. Among migraine subjects, prevalent sleep disorders include difficulty falling asleep, increased night-time awakening, decreased sleep duration, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

AB Study Objectives: To examine caffeine consumption from various dietary sources in a cohort of Australian children and the relationship between caffeine consumption, sleep, and daytime behavior.
   Methods: Children aged 8 to 12 years and their parents/guardians completed a battery of questionnaires. Children completed a caffeine questionnaire while parents completed questionnaires regarding demographics, sleep, and behavior.
   Results: The final sample consisted of 309 children (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] age 10.6 +/- 1.3 years, male = 48%) and corresponding parent reports. On average a mean +/- SD 10.2 +/- 17.4 mg/day of caffeine was consumed with a range of zero to 151 mg/day. Of the children who consumed caffeine (87% of the sample), the largest contributor was coffee and tea; making up 41% of total caffeine intake, and sodas (soft drinks) contributed to 40% of caffeine intake. Total caffeine consumption was significantly associated with sleep routine (r = 0.152); morning tiredness (r = 0.129); restless sleep (r = 0.113); and internalizing behavioral problems (r = 0.128). Using path analysis, caffeine consumption was positively associated with morning tiredness (beta = 0.111, P = .050) which was positively associated with internalizing behaviors (beta = 0.432, P < .001). The addition of sleep routine and restless sleep to the model led to a complete mediation of caffeine consumption on morning tiredness, as well as a partial mediation of the association between morning tiredness and internal behaviors.
   Conclusions: In 8-to 12-year-olds the primary sources of caffeine are coffee/tea and sodas. Overall mean caffeine consumption is small by adult standards but has an effect on behavior and sleep in children. The effect on behavior is mediated by disrupted sleep, indicating that caffeine is a contributor to sleep problems and related behavior in children.

AB The present study examined associations among parent and child reports of youth's stressful life events (SLEs), perceived stress, and biological measures of stress activity (i.e. cortisol and cardiovascular activity). Examining these aspects of youth stress presents several challenges. Unlike adult studies of individual differences in which information regarding SLEs, perceptions of events, and biological activity are gathered from one individual, assessment of individual differences among children usually involves other informants (e.g. parent). However, parent and child reports of SLEs and the child's psychological response to such events are often discordant. Moreover, examinations of youth perception of stress are hampered by limitations of child cognitive processes, as well as parents' limited knowledge of their child's perception of stress. In a preliminary effort to unscramble the complex effects of youth SLEs and perceived stress in relation to biological response to acute stressors, this study examined 51 boys and girls aged 7-16, with no history of psychopathology or medical concerns. Contrary to hypotheses, findings revealed that compared to actual experiences of stress, perceived stress has greater associations with both cortisol and cardiovascular activity. That is, perceived stress is more biologically salient relative to actual stress. Results also suggest that informant differences may explain some previous inconsistent findings in studies of youth's stress reactivity. The current findings mirror the adult studies that show appraisal and perception of traumatic and stressful events may be more predictive of negative health and mental health outcomes than the severity of the events. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of youth's perceptions of stress on their biological stress reactions and later health outcomes such as clinical disorders.

AB Background: Many very preterm (i.e., < 32 weeks of gestation) newborns fail to mount an adequate adrenocortical response to stress or illness, termed relative adrenal insufficiency. Conversely, later in life these infants show features of increased glucocorticoid bioactivity, such as abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, raised blood pressure, shorter stature and internalizing problem behavior. Summary: Studies suggested that very preterm newborns have impairments along multiple levels of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Among the impairment were defects in: (1) the pituitary responsiveness to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone, (2) 11 beta-hydroxylase activity, and (3) the interconversion between cortisol and inert cortisone. There is some evidence suggesting that later in life these infants have an increased basal secretion rate of cortisol and adrenal hyperandrogenism. However, the response to acute (psychosocial) stress was blunted rather than enhanced in them. The mechanisms explaining this switch in HPA axis activity are complex and not yet fully understood. Key Messages: Very preterm newborns have several impairments along the HPA axis that could impede an adequate adrenocortical response to stress or illness. Later in life, these infants are predisposed to increased HPA axis activity, which could partially explain their phenotype. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Family violence has been associated with various negative outcomes among children and adolescents. Yet, less is known about how unique forms of physical family violence contribute to externalizing and internalizing behaviors based on a child's developmental stage. Using data from the Illinois Families Study and administrative Child Protective Services data, we explored the relation between 3 types of physical family violence victimization and externalizing and internalizing behaviors among a sample of 2,402 children and adolescents. After including parent and family level covariates in Poisson regressions, we found that a unique form of family violence victimization was associated with increased externalizing behaviors among children at each age group: exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among children ages 3-5, exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling among children ages 6-12, and child physical abuse among adolescents ages 13-18. No form of physical family violence was significantly associated with internalizing behaviors for children in any age group. Including exposure to the child maltreatment of a sibling is crucial when attempting to contextualize children's responses to family violence and providing comprehensive services in an effort to enhance the well-being of all children in a family.

AB Although many interventions for child externalizing behavior report promising outcomes for families, high attrition prior to program completion remains a problem. Many programs report dropout rates of 50% or higher. In this trial we sought to reduce attrition and improve outcomes by augmenting a well-known evidence-based intervention, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), with a 3-session individual motivational enhancement component. Participants were 192 Australian caregivers (91.7% female; M-age=34.4years) and their children (33.3% female; M-age=4.4years). Families (51% referred from child welfare or health services for risk of maltreatment) were assigned to PCIT or a supported waitlist, with families assigned to PCIT receiving either standard PCIT (S/PCIT) or motivation-enhanced PCIT (M/PCIT), depending on their time of entry to the study. Waitlist families received phone calls every week for 12weeks. Parents in M/PCIT reported more readiness to change their behavior from preassessment to after the motivation sessions. Also, parents who reported high, rather than low, motivation at preassessment did have a lower attrition rate, and there was some evidence that enhancing motivation was protective of premature attrition to the extent that caregivers achieved a high degree of change in motivation. Yet comparison of attrition rates and survival analyses revealed no difference between M/PCIT and S/PCIT in retention rate. Finally, there were greater reductions in externalizing and internalizing child behavior problems and parental stress among families in S/PCIT and M/PCIT compared with waitlist, and there was generally no significant difference between the two treatment conditions.

AB This study examined mother- and teacher-rated internalizing behaviors (i.e., anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms) among young children using longitudinal data from a community sample of 661 Mexican and Dominican families and tested a conceptual model in which parenting (mother's socialization messages and parenting practices) predicted child internalizing problems 12 months later. Children evidenced elevated levels of mother-rated anxiety at both time points. Findings also supported the validity of the proposed parenting model for both Mexican and Dominican families. Although there were different pathways to child anxiety, depression, and somatization among Mexican and Dominican children, socialization messages and authoritarian parenting were positively associated with internalizing symptoms for both groups.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating role of parenting stress (both parental distress and stress due to dysfunctional interactions in the mother-daughter relationship [PSDI]) in the link between childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) status and several important young adult outcomes. The diverse sample comprised 140 girls with ADHD and 88 age- and ethnicity-matched comparisons, evaluated at ages 6-12 years and followed prospectively for five years (M age=14.2) and 10 years (M age=19.6). The PSDI experienced by a mother during her daughter's adolescence mediated the link between her daughter's childhood ADHD status and adult externalizing and internalizing symptoms. PSDI also mediated the link between ADHD status and young adult nonsuicidal self-injury and had an indirect effect in the relation between childhood ADHD and young adult depressive symptoms. The mediating role of PSDI with respect to internalizing symptoms and depressive symptoms remained in place even when covarying adolescent internalizing/depressive symptoms. Parenting stress, particularly related to maternal perceptions of dysfunctional interactions with adolescent daughters, serves as a key mediator in the association between childhood ADHD status and important domains of young adult functioning. Minimizing parenting stress and dysfunctional mother-daughter interactions during adolescence might reduce the risk of adverse adult outcomes for girls with ADHD.

AB The purpose of this effort is to broaden the scope with which body dissatisfaction (BD) is viewed to inform the practices of MFTs. Associations between college students' BD and measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and body image were tested using mean-level comparisons, path analysis, and multi-group tests by sex, across ethnic/racial groups, and across immigration status. Data were collected from N = 10,573 youth. There was evidence of significant mean level differences, and BD predicted internalizing symptoms while multi-group tests were largely invariant suggesting a more universal impact than dominant theoretical explanations (i.e. Objectification theory) posit.

AB The Karamojong people of Uganda are marginalized and likely to have difficult lives. Research is needed to understand Karamojong children's challenges, adjustment, and resiliency to help guide interventions and policies to improve their lives. Thus, 18 Karamojong 10-16-year-olds (10 girls; M = 13.33 years; SD = 1.81) were recruited from a nongovernmental organization in Tororo District, Uganda, and interviewed about their life events, coping strategies, social support, and hope. Adolescents also were verbally administered questionnaires about their life events and adjustment problems. Participants reported many negative life events (M = 9.28 of 16). The number of negative life events was positively correlated with internalizing, but not with externalizing, problems. Participants described a variety of coping strategies. Most participants received emotional or instrumental social support, and were hopeful about their futures. Hardships were often alcohol-or poverty-related events, whereas hope was often centered on education.

AB This study examined the role of childcare process quality regarding the relation between family risks and preschoolers' social-emotional problems. The study included 24 childcare centers with 42 groups in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The 162 children in the sample were aged 3-5 years. Parents and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Deu). Eight family risk factors were subsumed into a cumulative risk index. Childcare process quality was assessed by various observation instruments, for example, the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ITERS-R) and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R). The calculated structural equation models show that high-quality teaching and interaction, and provisions for learning, can mitigate the negative effects of family risks on children's internalizing problems. High process quality can provide the chance of considerable attention, encouragement, and new learning opportunities for children at risk; these high-quality centers thereby contribute to protective processes.

AB The aim of this study is to determine the behavioural problems of children with 46XY disorders of sex development (DSD) with genital ambiguity and to identify the risk factors that may influence behaviour. The 27 participants (aged 6-18 years) consisted of 21 patients raised as boys and 6 patients raised as girls. Control data were obtained from a representative sibling of each patient who was matched for age and gender. The study tool used was the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), which is a parent-administered questionnaire. The analysis of the behavioural scores revealed that the patient group had poorer scores in the total, externalizing, and internalizing realms. This group also had poorer scores in the anxious-depressed, social, and rule-breaking realms as compared to the control group. In addition, the XY-F group had higher scores (more pathological) than the XY-M group, although the difference in the scores was not statistically significant. A comparison of the prevalence of patients with scores in the clinical range with that of the control group was not statistically significant. These findings support the current recommendations that psychological counselling should be an integral part of the professional support offered to patients with DSD.

AB Although a large number of studies offer consistent and persuasive evidence that exposure to childhood maltreatment and subsequent juvenile offending behaviours are related, relatively few studies have investigated the mechanisms by which maltreatment might increase risk in young offender populations. The aim of this pilot study was to collate data on the key areas of need from 28 young male offenders in secure care in an Australian jurisdiction, with a specific focus on the inter-relationship between scores on self-report measures of maltreatment, trauma, and mental health. The findings provide preliminary evidence that these key constructs are linked to other proximal risk factors for juvenile offending, such as poor anger regulation and antisocial thinking patterns. They offer a rationale for considering the sequelae of maltreatment in the development of service delivery frameworks for young offenders.

AB Although rates of child maltreatment are declining, more than 600,000 children in the United States are substantiated victims of abuse or neglect. The focus of this review is on the relationship between maltreatment and mental health problems in childhood and adulthood. Children and adults who are exposed to abuse or neglect in childhood are at risk for a range of poor mental health outcomes, including internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic symptoms, and personality disorders. I review three potential mechanisms by which maltreatment may increase risk for various forms of psychopathology, (a) hypervigilance to threat, (b) deficits in emotion recognition and understanding, and (c) low responsivity to reward. I also review genetic and psychosocial factors that moderate the relationship between maltreatment and risk for psychopathology. Finally, I discuss methodological limitations of the literature on maltreatment, with an emphasis on the challenges associated with establishing a causal role for maltreatment (and moderators or mediators of maltreatment) in the development of mental health problems and the reliance of many studies on retrospective self-reports.

AB Background Emotion regulation difficulties have been associated with depression and anxiety in typically developing individuals. However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists.
   Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted.
   Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences.
   Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.

AB Background and objective: We explore whether perceived stress among Kenyan mothers is predicted by childhood exposure to emotional abuse - both witnessed among parents and experienced directly. Further, we explore whether this association is mediated by social support, family functioning and polygynous marriage.Design: We used cross-sectional data from a systematic random sample (n=1974) of mothers in semi-rural Kenya.Methods: Data were collected using validated scales and trained interviewers. Analyses were conducted using bootstrapped structural equation models and fixed-effects linear regression models, controlling for age and household wealth.Results: Reported experience of emotional abuse - both directly experienced and observed among household adults - was high in the present population (72.5% and 69%, respectively). Perceived stress among women was significantly higher if they were exposed to more emotional abuse during childhood (p<.001). Lower social support, worse family functioning and higher rates of polygynous marriage mediated pathways between emotional abuse exposure during childhood and adult perceived stress.Conclusion: Future research should investigate whether social integration, identity formation and self-esteem underlie observed dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to promote social integration and support should target children currently experiencing emotional abuse, and may include child-targeted high quality television programing and adult-targeted media and celebrity campaigns.

AB Research on sexual violence victims and perpetrators indicates that victims in general are found to report higher levels of psychopathological symptoms, especially internalizing behavior, whereas perpetrators often show externalizing behavior. Little is known, however, about the psychopathology of perpetrators of sexual violence who have also experienced sexual victimization (victim-perpetrators). Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine this group within a sample of adolescents living in residential care or federal boarding schools. Participants reported their lifetime experience with sexual violence (both as victim and perpetrator) and completed the Youth Self Report. Results indicate that all three groups of adolescents with sexual violence experience report higher total problem scores than adolescents without this experience. Victim-perpetrators show results more similar to those of perpetrators only than those of victims only. The discussion deals with the implications of our findings for the treatment of victims of sexual violence.

AB Demand for treatment for problems related to the use of video games have increased significantly in adolescents. Most cases have a comorbid mental disorder that jeopardises both pathologies. The aim of this study is to describe profiles of adolescents with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) according to comorbidity and analyze treatment response at 3 and 6 months. A sample of 86 patients which consulted in the Addictive Behavior Unit of a hospital was assessed with diagnostic criteria for IGD, the interview K-SADS-PL for mental disorders and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) to treatment progress. Of the initial sample, 68,6% (n = 59) met diagnostic criteria for IGD. Of these, the 45,76% matched an internalizing profile, presenting comorbidity with Mood Disorders (44,4%), Anxiety Disorders (44,4%) and Personality Disorders (11,1%). The externalizing profile would comprise 52,54% of the sample presenting Disruptive Behavior Disorder (48,4%=, ADHD (29%) and Disruptive Behavior Disorders not otherwise specified (22,6%). Unlike externalizing, the internalizing patients had a family history of psychiatric problems (63%), difficulties in social relationships (77,8%) and seemed to use video games preferably to escape discomfort (66,7%). After 3 months the externalizing profile showed improvements. Comorbid disorders allow the discrimination of two IGD profiles in adolescents and these could influence treatment response. Therefore, it is important to assess comorbidities to design a more accurate intervention focused on the specificities of each profile.

AB Risk factors during preschool years, such as poverty and unattended social/emotional problems, are known to have a strong negative influence on children's later functioning. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an on-site integrated school-based mental health services and consultation program for preschool children and their families. The sample consisted of 47 children and parents in 3 childcare centers who came from low-socioeconomic, urban backgrounds. Parents provided questionnaire data on children's social-emotional functioning at 2 assessment times. Children's ages ranged between 2 and 4 years at Time 1. Approximately half of the sample consisted of children who were selected for and received twice-weekly peer play psychotherapy (PPP) and, at-times, other mental health services from clinicians (playgroup [PG] children). The other half of the sample consisted of better functioning non-playgroup (NPG) children from the same centers. When PG and NPG were compared at Time1, the PG children were significantly behind the NPG children justifying their assignment to PG. However, at Time 2, the difference between PG and NPG was no longer significant on vital measures of adaptation, revealing the ways in which Relationships for Growth & Learning (RfGL) Program arguably led to 'catch up'. PG children's behavioral problems and total symptomatology decreased significantly from Time 1 to Time 2. Higher dosage of PPP was linked with higher social competence and decreased behavioral problems. Areas of gain differed between internalizing and externalizing children, indicating that intervention was helpful to different types of children. Clinical and research implications were discussed.

AB Research has neglected the potential role of perceived parental control as a moderator between stressful life events (SLEs) and child-internalizing symptoms. Using secondary data from the Early Risers "Skills for Success" Program (August, Realmuto, Hektner, & Bloomquist, 2001), this study examined the impact of perceived parental control on the association between SLEs and child internalizing symptoms in formerly homeless families. The sample consisted of 137 families with 223 children between 4 and 12 years of age (M = 8.1, SD = 2.3) living in supportive housing sites in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Participants completed measures assessing the number of SLEs experienced (e.g., unemployment of parent, death of loved one, serious illness, homelessness), perceived parental control, and child-internalizing symptoms. In this sample, 65% of children (n = 144) experienced at least 1 SLE with an average experience of 2 SLEs (M = 2.0, SD =Z 1.9, range = 0-7). A regression analysis found that experiencing more SLEs and a perceived absence of parental control over child behavior were positively associated with child-internalizing symptoms. A significant interaction between SLEs and perceived absence of parental control over child behavior in predicting child internalizing symptoms was also found. These findings suggest that children of parents who model appropriate control are more likely to experience fewer internalizing symptoms in response to SLEs.

AB Nonverbal learning disability is a childhood disorder with basic neuropsychological deficits in visuospatial processing and psychomotor coordination, and secondary impairments in academic and social-emotional functioning. This study examines emotion recognition, understanding, and regulation in a clinic-referred group of young children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD). These processes have been shown to be related to social competence and psychological adjustment in typically developing (TD) children. Psychosocial adjustment and social skills are also examined for this young group, and for a clinic-referred group of older children with NLD. The young children with NLD scored lower than the TD comparison group on tasks assessing recognition of happy and sad facial expressions and tasks assessing understanding of how emotions work. Children with NLD were also rated as having less adaptive regulation of their emotions. For both young and older children with NLD, internalizing and externalizing problem scales were rated higher than for the TD comparison groups, and the means of the internalizing, attention, and social problem scales were found to fall within clinically concerning ranges. Measures of attention and nonverbal intelligence did not account for the relationship between NLD and Social Problems. Social skills and NLD membership share mostly overlapping variance in accounting for internalizing problems across the sample. The results are discussed within a framework wherein social cognitive deficits, including emotion processes, have a negative impact on social competence, leading to clinically concerning levels of depression and withdrawal in this population.

DT Article
DE Bakhtin; ideological becoming (IB); multimodal forms; kindergarten;
   authoritative discourse
AB This study explores Mikhail Bakhtin's notion of ideological becoming (IB) in a bilingual (Korean and English) kindergarten classroom. For Bakhtin, IB is the process of appropriating authoritative discourse as one's own dialogic interactions. In our study, we view the literacy and language discourses of schooling as one type of authoritative discourse that students appropriate as their own in the process of IB. Additionally, Bakhtin's focus on language is extended in our study to include other modes of communication, such sounds, symbols, gestures, drawings, and artifacts that children use to make meaning with each other. The study found that students' appropriation of the authoritative discourse of schooling relied on multimodal forms of communication as part and parcel to the process of IB. Thus, this study illuminates how oral languages (in this case, Korean or English or the informal patois combining the two) provide only one mode in the complex process of internalizing authoritative discourse; the multiple modes of IB surpass a language-centric view. Students' creative adaptations of other's voices as their own through multimodal channels of communication may not always include oral or written language.

AB Much attention has been focused recently on the deepening crisis in the education system. Researchers have attributed these problems to the school environment. One method for examining this claim is to compare specific emotional and behavior problems among children who attend schools and children who do not. This study examined three aspects of children's emotional worldemotional and behavioral problems, depression, and attachment securityin a group of children attending school and a group of homeschooled children, matched for socioeconomic background and research procedure. The findings indicated a lower level of depression among the homeschooled children; no difference was found between the groups in attachment security. With respect to emotional and behavioral problems, no difference was found in internalizing problems, but more externalizing problems were found among the school-going than the homeschooled children, in 9-10-year-olds and 11-12-year-olds, but not in 6-8-year-olds.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the relations among perceived parental psychological control (PPC), autonomy and relatedness, and negative outcomes during emerging adulthood in two cultural contexts: Italy and the USA. More specifically, we explored the mechanisms through which dependency-oriented PPC (DPPC) and achievement-oriented PPC (APPC) are associated with both internalizing and externalizing difficulties, focusing on the mediating role of autonomy and relatedness. Participants were 418 European-American and 359 Italian college students. Results indicated that the expressions of PPC with regard to dependency and achievement were related to emerging adults' negative outcomes through different pathways, and these effects were moderated by the cultural group. The implications of the findings for future related empirical investigations and clinical interventions were discussed.

AB The objective of this case study was to describe the neuropsychological rehabilitation of a 16-year-old patient who presented a Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS) following a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhage. The patient presented severe and diffuse cognitive deficits, massive behavioral disorders, and emotion regulation difficulties. The cognitive rehabilitation was performed in the chronic phase (one year after the onset of the hemorrhage) using a transdisciplinary neurobehavioral approach based on the patient's favorite interest (soccer). A significant behavioral and cognitive improvement was observed. The patient became progressively independent in all activities of daily living and was discharged home. The Functional Independence Measure at discharge was 124/126 (vs. 37/126 at entry). The patient was able to complete his schooling despite the mild cognitive and behavioral sequelae. This first description of the use of neurobehavioral therapy in a case of chronic CCAS suggests that (a) major clinical improvement can occur more than one year after the onset of the CCAS, showing the importance of long-term and intensive neurorehabilitation; and (b) when the cerebellum cannot properly play its regulator role in cognition, neuropsychological intervention through a behavioral and cognitive approach can be of great help by acting as an external modulator to help the patient regain control over himself.

AB Child sexual abuse has the potential to cause distress for the victim across the lifespan. Romantic relationships may be particularly difficult for victims of child sexual abuse. This retrospective study examined differences in adult romantic attachment, sexually compulsive behaviors, and emotion regulation by history of child sexual abuse in a large, nonclinical sample. Those with a history of child sexual abuse reported more attachment anxiety in romantic relationships and engaged in more sexually compulsive behaviors. Overall, males displayed more sexually compulsive behaviors than females regardless of history of sexual abuse. Males with a history of sexual abuse displayed the greatest number of sexually compulsive behaviors. Surprisingly, no differences were observed in emotion regulation or attachment avoidant behaviors by history of child sexual abuse. Future research should seek to replicate current findings and examine emotion regulation difficulties experienced as a result of trauma.

AB The transition to adulthood is a critical juncture in the course of psychopathology. This study examined the ways in which earlier capacity to deal with relationship stress during adolescence contributed to an adaptive outcome in emerging adulthood. In a prospective study of 145 individuals, relationship stress, individual coping capacities, and perceived support from fathers, mothers, and peers were analyzed, when the participants were 13 and 17 years old. The effects of these earlier capacities to deal with relationship stress on health outcomes were examined in young adulthood (age 23). Gendered pathways to young adults' symptomatology emerged. Females experiencing earlier relationship stress, but also support by mothers, fathers, and friends, showed less symptomatology at age 23. In addition, females' withdrawal coping mediated the impact of stressful encounters on later internalizing symptomatology. In contrast, earlier coping with relationship stress was not found to be predictive for males. Earlier support from parents or friends was associated with later externalizing symptomatology in young men. Reasons for the gender-specific pathways to symptomatology are discussed.

AB The aim of the current study was to identify predictors of recurrent headache and back pain in young adults (aged 18-27 years) from data assessed in childhood or adolescence, i.e., 9 years before the final survey. Our interest was whether psychological characteristics contribute to the risk of pain prevalence in adult age when controlling for already empirically supported risk factors such as parental pain, pediatric pain and sex. The study was part of a five-wave epidemiological investigation of >5000 families with children aged between 7 and 14 years when addressed first. In a multiple hierarchical regression analysis, the abovementioned three variables (Block-I variables) were entered first followed by five psychological trait variables (Block-II variables: internalizing, anxiety sensitivity, somatosensory amplification, catastrophizing and dysfunctional stress coping) to find out the extent of model improvement. The multivariable hierarchical regression analysis confirmed the hypothesis that the Block-I variables significantly enhance the risk of future pain at young adult age. None of the psychological variables did so. Thus, the hypothesis of a significant surplus predictive effect was not confirmed. The amount of total explained variance differed strongly between headache and back pain. In particular, a valid prediction of back pain was not possible. When analyzed separately in simple regression analysis, psychological variables turned out to be significant predictors, however, of very low effect size. The inclusion of Block-I variables in the model clearly reduced the impact of the psychological variables. This risk profile is discussed in the context of the different trajectories of headache and back pain from childhood to adult age, which were proposed by various studies. We propose that a biopsychological characteristic denoted as emotional negativity, especially regarding self-reference, might be a common factor behind all selected variables. Risk research in recurrent pain is a field where much more multidisciplinary research is needed before progress can be expected.

AB Research has garnered support for a systemic view of factors affecting child dental caries that accounts for the influence of social factors such as the family environment. Our previous work has demonstrated the association between mother-to-father emotional aggression and child caries. The present study builds on these results by evaluating pathways that might explain this relation. Families (n = 135) completed a multimethod assessment of mother-to-father emotional aggression, child caries, and several hypothesized mediators (i.e., child cariogenic snack and drink intake, child internalizing behaviors, child salivary cortisol and a-amylase reactivity, parental laxness, child oral hygiene maintenance, and parental socialization of child oral hygiene maintenance). Mediation analyses partially supported the role of the child's diet as a mechanism linking mother-to-father emotional aggression and child caries. However, children's neglect of oral hygiene, parental laxness, and child emotional and biological disturbances failed to stand as conduits for this association. Future investigations should expand upon these results to better establish the causal links that could only be suggested by the present cross-sectional findings. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Although the conceptual interplay among the biological and clinical features of sleep, arousal, and emotion regulation has been noted, little is understood about how indices of sleep duration and parasympathetic reactivity operate jointly to predict adjustment in early childhood. Using a sample of 123 toddlers, the present study examined sleep duration and RSA reactivity as predictors of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Parents reported on children's sleep duration and adjustment. RSA reactivity was assessed via children's responses to fear-eliciting stimuli and an inhibitory control challenge. Findings demonstrated that greater RSA suppression to both types of tasks in combination with longer sleep duration was concurrently associated with less internalizing. In contrast, greater RSA augmentation to an inhibitory control task in the context of shorter sleep duration predicted more externalizing 1 year later. The significance of duration of toddlers' sleep as well as the context in which physiological regulatory difficulties occurs is discussed.

AB Adolescents' temperamental frustration is a developmental precursor of adult neuroticism and psychopathology. Because the mechanisms that underlie the prospective association between adolescents' high frustration and psychopathology (internalizing/externalizing) have not been studied extensively, we quantified three pathways: stress generation [mediation via selection/evocation of stressful life events (SLEs)], cross-sectional frustration-psychopathology overlap ('carry-over'/common causes), and a direct (non-mediated) vulnerability effect of frustration, including moderation of SLE impact. Frustration and psychopathology were assessed at age 16 with the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire and the Youth Self-Report. No gender differences in frustration were observed. At age 19, psychopathology was reassessed by using the Adult Self-Report, while occurrence of endogenous (self-generated) and exogenous (not self-generated) SLEs during the interval (ages 16-19) were ascertained with the Life Stress Interview, an investigator-based contextual-stressfulness rating procedure (N=957). Half of the prospective effect of frustration on psychopathology was explained by baseline overlap, including effects of 'carry-over' and common causes, about 5% reflected stress generation (a 'vicious' cycle with the environment adolescents navigate and shape), and 45% reflected unmediated association: a direct vulnerability effect including stress sensitivity or moderation of SLE impact. After adjustment for their overlap, frustration predicted the development of externalizing but not internalizing symptoms. Copyright (C) 2016 European Association of Personality Psychology

AB Purpose: Depressive symptoms during adolescence are positively associated with peer-related beliefs, perceptions, and experiences that are known risk factors for substance misuse. These same risk factors are targeted by many universal substance misuse prevention programs. This study examined whether a multicomponent universal substance misuse intervention for middle schoolers reduced the associations between depressive symptoms, these risk factors, and substance misuse.
   Methods: The study used data from a place-randomized trial of the Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience model for delivery of evidence-based substance misuse programs for middle schoolers. Three-level within-person regression models were applied to four waves of survey, and social network data from 636 adolescents followed from sixth through ninth grades.
   Results: When adolescents in control school districts had more symptoms of depression, they believed more strongly that substance use had social benefits, perceived higher levels of substance misuse among their peers and friends, and had more friends who misused substances, although they were not more likely to use substances themselves. Many of the positive associations of depressive symptoms with peer-related risk factors were significantly weaker or not present among adolescents in intervention school districts.
   Conclusions: The Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience interventions reduced the positive associations of adolescent symptoms of depression with peer-related risk factors for substance misuse.

AB Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the longitudinal relation between internalizing problem behaviors (measured with the anxious/depressed and somatic complaints subscales of the Achenbach Teacher's Report Form) and self-reported cigarette smoking behavior and intentions during early adolescence. In addition, a possible mediating role of perceived harm was investigated. Methods: Sixth graders and their teachers were surveyed in the sixth grade and students were surveyed again in the seventh grade. Smoking behavior and intentions were assessed with five items including lifetime use, 30-day use, tobacco user status (nonsmoker to heavy smoker), and two intentions/behavioral expectations items. In addition to perceived harm from smoking, reasons for smoking and reasons for not smoking were included on the survey. Results: As hypothesized, teacher reports of sixth-grade internalizing problem behaviors were negatively related to seventh-grade smoking behavior and intentions. Moreover, perceived harm from smoking was negatively related to smoking and intentions. The hypothesized mediating role of perceived harm in the internalizing to smoking relationship was not supported. Conclusions: Potential differences in the relation between internalizing and smoking across adolescence are discussed. Specifically, the results of the present study and an examination of prior literature suggest that in early adolescence internalizing problems are negatively related to cigarette smoking, whereas in middle and late adolescence the opposite is true.

AB Objective The present study examined the role of maternal posttraumatic growth in changes in behavioral problems among the siblings of children with complex chronic health conditions. Methods Data were collected from a sample of 70 siblings from 58 families with at least one child diagnosed with a life-threatening genetic, metabolic, or neurological condition. Every 6 months for up to 4 years, sibling behavior problems were assessed through both parentreports and youth self-reports. At each visit, mothers also completed self-reports of posttraumatic growth. Results Time-lagged multilevel regression analyses revealed that higher levels of maternal posttraumatic growth predicted subsequent declines in parent-reported internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems among healthy siblings. These findings were partially replicated using youth self-reports of their own behavior problems. Conclusion The findings suggest that the benefits of posttraumatic growth may extend beyond the self to other family members, particularly to children in the family.

AB The current study examined risk and protective factors across microsystems that impact the development of internalizing symptoms and aggression over 4 years in a sample of culturally diverse, rural adolescents. We explored whether risk and protective factors across microsystems were associated with changes in rates of internalizing symptoms and aggressive behavior. Data came from the Rural Adaptation Project (RAP), a 5-year longitudinal panel study of more than 4,000 students from 26 public middle schools and 12 public high schools. Three level HLM models were estimated to predict internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and aggression. Compared with other students, risk for internalizing symptoms and aggression was elevated for youth exposed to risk factors in the form of school hassles, parent-child conflict, peer rejection, and delinquent friends. Microsystem protective factors in the form of ethnic identity, religious orientation, and school satisfaction decreased risk for aggression, but were not associated with internalizing symptoms, whereas future orientation and parent support decreased risk for internalizing symptoms, but not aggression. Results indicate that risks for internalizing symptoms and aggression are similar, but that unique protective factors are related to these adolescent behavioral health outcomes. Implications and limitations were discussed.

AB Military deployment of a parent is a risk factor for children's internalizing and externalizing problems. This risk may be heightened in National Guard and Reserve (NG/R) families who tend to be isolated from other NG/R families and do not benefit from the centralized support system available to active duty families living on military bases. Isolation and trauma-related disorders may complicate the adjustment of military families during reintegration. An evidence-based parent training intervention was modified to meet the unique needs of recently deployed NG/R parents and their spouses, and the modified program was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The current study examines engagement and satisfaction with the program. Modifications such as employment of military-connected facilitators sought to maximize engagement in and satisfaction with the program. Engagement and satisfaction were examined between mothers and fathers, as well as between groups led by a military-connected facilitator and those led by civilian facilitators. Significantly greater engagement was noted for groups that were led by a military-connected facilitator (p =.01). There were no differences between genders in attendance rates, though greater positive group experiences were reported by mothers versus fathers (p =.01). Results are discussed in the context of engagement and satisfaction reported for similar programs. Implications for working with military families are also considered.

AB Objective: To examine caregiver ratings of children's internalizing symptoms as a potential mediator between sleep disordered breathing and pain symptoms. Caregiver depression/anxiety symptoms were further examined as a potential moderator of the mediation model. Methods: Participants were 96 caregivers (82% mothers) of children with cancer, sickle cell disease, or other hematological conditions (M age=10.45years; 46.9% female, 78.1% African American). Caregivers completed questionnaires on child patient symptoms during regular clinic visits. Results: As hypothesized, the effect of sleep on pain (=0.31) was reduced (=0.15) after accounting for child internalizing symptoms (=0.17, 95% confidence interval=0.03 to 0.42). The indirect effect accounted for 54.8% of the total effect. However, caregiver depression/anxiety symptoms were not a significant moderator of this mediation model. Conclusions: Sleep may play an important role in the experience of pain in children with hematology/oncology conditions. A child's mood may mediate this relationship.

AB Barth syndrome is a rare, x-linked genetic disorder. Few studies have examined psychosocial functioning in this population. The current study examined the psychosocial adjustment in individuals with Barth syndrome, as well as their parents. A secondary aim was to examine demographic as well as psychological correlates and predictors of poorer adjustment in order to identify relevant areas for intervention. Individuals with Barth syndrome completed measures of psychosocial functioning, health-related quality of life, and attitudes toward their illness. Parents completed measures relating to their child's psychosocial functioning and reported on their own psychological functioning and coping. Results indicated that the majority of individuals and parents reported normative levels of psychological functioning. Younger age was associated with poorer health-related quality of life in some domains. Increased levels of internalizing symptoms were associated with poorer psychosocial functioning in individuals with Barth syndrome. Having a child with externalizing symptoms was associated with increased emotional symptoms for parents, as were certain maladaptive coping strategies. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objective: Working memory is a fundamental cognitive function and is predictive of outcomes and achievement in a wide range of domains from an early age. The focus of this study was to develop a computerized Brazilian version of the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT) for preschoolers and to provide initial normative and validation data for this task. Methods: The sample of the present study was composed of 248 children aged 3 (n=41), 4 (n=88) and 5 (n=119) years from 13 private and public schools in Belo Horizonte. Children were evaluated with the SOPT and the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS), a measure of intelligence, and their parents completed the Brazilian Criterion of Economic Classification (CCEB) to assess their SES. A subsample of parents of 184 children also filled the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 11/2-5years (CBCL 11/2-5), a measure of psychopathology. Results: A multiple regression analysis found chronological age, intelligence, and SES to be predictive of performanceon the SOPT. Furthermore, five-year olds performed better than three- and four-year olds in the task. A difference between children in private and public kindergartens also emerged. Additionally, SOPT performance was negatively correlated with Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total psychopathological problems, as well as to several other psychopathological measures as accessed by the CBCL, although the correlations were small. Conclusion: Taken together, this study provides initial normative and validation data for the SOPT, but further validation studies are needed.

AB Specific treatments targeting adolescents with substance use disorders (SUDs) have been developed over the last couple of decades. Despite these developmentally tailored treatments, long-term abstinence rates remain relatively low among adolescents receiving care. Research over the last decade has increasingly focused on adolescents with comorbid substance use and psychiatric disorders, in recognition of the barriers caused by inadequate treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Treatments targeting dually diagnosed youth are now regarded as essential to improving SUD treatment outcomes, but remain underutilized. A variety of treatment modalities such as behavioral therapy, family therapy, 12-step groups, motivational interviewing, contingency management, and combinations of these interventions have been modified for adolescents. In this article, we review the research on these treatments, as they apply to dually diagnosed youth. Furthermore, we explore the evidence for various treatments targeting comorbid SUD, specific to the presence of externalizing or internalizing disorders. The current evidence base supports the importance of integrated treatment targeting both SUD and psychiatric disorders simultaneously. High-quality treatment programs offering combinations of behavioral and family therapy, particularly with motivational interviewing and contingency management, are particularly well supported. In addition, we review various psychotropic medication treatments that have also been studied in conjunction with adolescent SUD treatment. Finally, we review research on post-treatment, supportive care that has been shown to improve long-term SUD outcomes. Recently conceptualized modular treatments, which offer personalized combinations of evidence-based treatments for specific disorders, have been proposed as a means of improving outcomes. Future research on modular programs must test the efficacy of individualized treatments when applied to combinations of psychiatric and SUDs in adolescents.

AB This study aims to investigate to what extent the variables of social support, internalizing behaviours and academic achievement predict adolescent risk behaviours. The sample population consists of 491 high school students in grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 who were randomly selected out of 6 different high schools in Ankara. Our data collection instruments include the Risk Behaviours Scale (Gengtamrim & Ergene, 2014), the Youth Self Report for 11-18 Year Old Adolescents (Erol & Simsek, 1998), the Perceived Social Support Scale (Yildirim, 2004), and a personal information form. We employed a structural equation model (SEM) to determine the strength of independent variables to predict the risk behaviours in question. Results indicated the significance of the model developed to predict adolescent risk behaviours. Accordingly, adolescent risk behaviours were significantly predicted by social support, rather than academic achievement and internalizing behaviours.

AB Unintended pregnancy is prevalent in the United States and has been linked to challenges for both mothers and their children over time. However, studies have not yet identified mechanisms through which pregnancy intention is associated with children's outcomes. Identification of mechanisms among families at risk for negative outcomes will inform early clinical intervention. This current study examined the association between mothers' pregnancy plans reported during pregnancy and children's externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and social-emotional competence outcomes at 3years old among an at-risk sample of 682 first-time mothers from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study. Further, this study identified mechanisms in the association that can be targeted in clinical intervention. Mediation analyses revealed that mothers' parenting stress when children were 24months old served as a mechanism in the association between unplanned pregnancy and children's low social-emotional competence at 36months. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed. Specifically, early intervention with mothers experiencing unplanned pregnancies may help to promote healthy outcomes among their children over time. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Using a risk-resilience framework, this study examined how varying levels of exposure to a natural disaster (EF-4 tornado) and children's characteristics (sex; anxiety) influenced the behavioral and psychological adjustment of children who shared a common risk factor predisaster (elevated aggression) prior to exposure through 1-year postdisaster. Participants included 360 children in Grades 4-6 (65% male; 78% African American) and their parents from predominantly low-income households who were already participating in a longitudinal study of indicated prevention effects for externalizing outcomes when the tornado occurred in 2011. Fourth-grade children who were screened for overt aggressive behavior were recruited in 3 annual cohorts (120 per year, beginning in 2009). Parent-rated aggression and internalizing problems were assessed prior to the tornado (Wave 1), within a half-year after the tornado (Wave 2), and at a 1-year follow-up (Wave 3). Children and parents rated their exposure to aspects of tornado-related traumatic experiences at Wave 3. Children displayed less reduction on aggression and internalizing problems if the children had experienced distress after the tornado or fears for their life, in combination with their pre-tornado level of anxiety. Higher levels of children's and parents' exposure to the tornado interacted with children's lower baseline child anxiety to predict less reduction in aggression and internalizing problems 1 year after the tornado. Higher levels of disaster exposure negatively affected at-risk children's level of improvement in aggression and internalizing problems, when life threat (parent- and child-reported) and child-reported distress after the tornado were moderated by baseline anxiety.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships among variables related to sleep patterns and both social-emotional problems (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and dysregulation) and healthy social development (i.e., social competence). Assessments were completed at 6, 12, and 18 months across 5 cohorts of children for a total of 117 mother-child dyads. Mothers completed the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire at 6, 12, and 18 months, as well as the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment at 12 and 18 months. Later bedtimes and less total sleep across the 24-hr period predicted higher internalizing problem scores, which includes indices of depression/withdrawal, general anxiety, separation distress, and inhibition. In contrast, sleep fragmentation was minimally associated with decreased social competence but not with any negative social-emotional outcomes. These results indicate that sleep patterns, primarily later bedtimes and less total sleep, appear to be associated with and predictive of social-emotional problem areas, namely, internalizing issues, in infants and toddlers. These findings add to the growing literature on the role of sleep in early social-emotional development and suggest that sleep schedule and duration should be addressed in clinical assessment and interventions for infant sleep.

AB School moves are common during elementary school in the United States. The authors address whether changing schools and residences affects the academic and behavioral development of young students. Utilizing data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the regression analyses show that, after controlling for prior achievement and behavior, students who experience nonroutine school changes, especially coupled with residential changes, are more likely to develop internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, are less engaged in classroom activities, and have slower reading growth compared to stable students.

AB One's proper reaction to difficulties is seen as an important factor of parental abilities. This research study verifies whether parents of either "badly-behaved" or "well-behaved" children vary in their reactions to difficult parenting situations connected with their relationship with their child. The group of "badly-behaved" children had externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. The "well-behaved" children's group consisted of extraordinarily mature and properly behaved children according to their kindergarten teachers. The research sample consisted of 204 parents of "badly-behaved" and "well-behaved" children. The research was conducted in Poland. The DAiS scale was used to assess the level and type of parental directiveness, and the PAiNK scale was used to assess obedience enforcement and teaching the rules of proper behavior. Multiple regression, the Sobel test and partial correlation were used to identify mediation effects. The results show that the two groups differ in their reactions to difficulties: a) the parents of "well-behaved" children emphasize the teaching of rules, and this effect is stronger in older children, b) the parents of "badly-behaved" children use aggressive directiveness. This effect is stronger when the children approach school age.

AB Background: Alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms are consistently found to be associated but how they relate to each other is unclear. Objective: The present study aimed to address limitations in the literature of comorbidity of alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms by investigating the direction of effect between the phenotypes and possible gender differences in college students. Method: We utilized data from a large longitudinal study of college students fromthe United States (N = 2607). Threewaves of questionnaire-based datawere collected over the first two years of college (in 2011-2013). Cross-lagged models were applied to examine the possible direction of effect of internalizing symptoms and alcohol problems. Possible effects of gender were investigated using multigroup modeling. Results: There were significant correlations between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms. A direction of effect was found between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms but differed between genders. A unidirectional relationship varying with age was identified for males where alcohol problems initially predicted internalizing symptoms followed by internalizing symptoms predicting alcohol problems. For females, a unidirectional relationship existed wherein alcohol problems predicted internalizing symptoms. Conclusions/Importance: We conclude that the relationship between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms is complex and differ between genders. In males, both phenotypes are predictive of each other, while in females the relationship is driven by alcohol problems. Importantly, our study examines a population-based sample, revealing that the observed relationships between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms are not limited to individuals with clinically diagnosed mental health or substance use problems.

AB Background: Noncompletion of preoperative bariatric programs is a significant problem among adolescents. Adult studies suggest that psychological factors contribute to noncompletion of preoperative bariatric programs.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between adolescent psychological functioning and completion of the preoperative phase of a bariatric program.
   Setting: The study was conducted at a tertiary care children's hospital affiliated with a university medical center.
   Methods: Seventy-four adolescents and their parents completed an assessment measure of psychological functioning with the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. We compared these scores between adolescents who completed the preoperative phase of the bariatric program and proceeded to surgery (completers) to those who did not (noncompleters) using multivariate analysis of covariance and logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics and baseline body mass index.
   Results: The mean age was 16.0 (1.1) years, most were female (79.8%), and the group was diverse (48.6%, Caucasian; 33.8%, black; 17.6%, other, including Hispanic, Asian, and biracial). Average body mass index was 50.5 (7.6) kg/m(2). Forty-two percent of participants were noncompleters. Noncompleters were reported by parents to have more clinically significant externalizing and internalizing behaviors and fewer adaptive behaviors. Noncompleters self-reported more clinically significant internalizing symptoms, emotional problems, and poor personal adjustment.
   Conclusion: Adolescents who did not complete the preoperative phase of a bariatric surgery program had more clinically significant psychological symptoms across multiple domains compared with those who successfully proceeded to bariatric surgery. Early identification and treatment of psychological symptoms may be important in helping adolescents successfully proceed to surgery. (C) 2017 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

AB Trauma exposure is associated with various parenting difficulties, but few studies have examined relationships between trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and parenting stress. Parenting stress is an important facet of parenting and mediates the relationship between parental trauma exposure and negative child outcomes (Owen, Thompson, & Kaslow, 2006). We examined trauma type (child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, community violence, and non-interpersonal traumas) and PTSD symptoms as predictors of parenting stress in a sample of 52 trauma-exposed mothers. Community violence exposure and PTSD symptom severity accounted for significant variance in parenting stress. Further analyses revealed that emotional numbing was the only PTSD symptom cluster accounting for variance in parenting stress scores. Results highlight the importance of addressing community violence exposure and emotion regulation difficulties with trauma-exposed mothers.

AB Objective: Early victimization elevates children's risk for developing psychopathology. Recent findings suggest that disruptions in developmental processes related to symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) may partially account for the association between early victimization and subsequent psychopathology. The present study prospectively tested the temporal sequencing of these associations using, multiinformant measurements in a large, diverse sample of children at high risk for victimization. Method: This study measured victimization (i.e., direct, indirect, familial, and nonfamilial violence), PTS, externalizing, and internalizing problems among 1154 children (561 girls and 593 boys) who participated in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Results: Structural equation modeling revealed that, in addition to directly impacting psychopathology, childhood victimization contributed to escalations in internalizing and externalizing problems as children transitioned from middle to late childhood indirectly through PTS. The mediational role of PTS was largely similar for girls and boys and for those who were investigated for early reports of maltreatment and those identified early as at-risk for victimization. Conclusions: This study delineated the role of PTS in the development of psychopathology following early victimization. These findings highlight the importance of carefully assessing for underlying trauma symptoms when considering diverse presentations of psychopathology among youth who have been victimized.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Although prior research has established a link between exposure to peer victimization and depressive symptoms, relatively little is known about the processes underlying this association. This study examined whether maladaptive responses to a novel social stressor - specifically, lower levels of problem solving or higher levels of rumination - mediate this association. Data were gathered from 130 children (64 boys, 66 girls; M age = 9.46, SD = 033) who participated in a laboratory social stressor task with an unfamiliar peer. Results indicated that prior exposure to peer victimization in the school context was associated with ruminative responses to the novel stressor, which mediated the association between victimization and depressive symptoms. These results indicate that ruminative responses to social stress outside of the victimization context may serve as one process explaining the association between victimization and heightened depressive symptoms.

AB Recent work has identified links between mothers' self-regulation and emotion regulation (ER) and children's social-emotional outcomes. However, associations between maternal ER strategies (e.g., reappraisal, suppression), known to influence internalizing problems in adults, and children's negative affect (NA) have not been considered. In the current study, the direct and indirect relationships, through maternal internalizing problems, between maternal use of ER strategies and infant NA are examined. The potential effects of infant NA on maternal internalizing difficulties are also considered. Ninety-nine mothers and their infants participated across three time points during the first year postpartum. Higher maternal suppression was indirectly related to higher infant NA, through maternal internalizing problems; lower maternal reappraisal also was indirectly related to higher infant NA through maternal internalizing problems. Infant NA at four months postpartum was related to mothers' internalizing problems 6 months postpartum. The implications of these findings for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB A majority of social skills research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and interventions target school age males and no published studies target adolescent females with ASD or related disabilities. Females with ASD are at risk for internalizing symptoms, and experience greater challenges in socialization and communication as social demands become increasingly complex in adolescence. This paper provides a thorough description of a social skills and self-care program designed to address the specific needs of adolescent females with ASD. The approach is peer mediated and occurs within natural or community settings to facilitate generalization. Findings from program evaluation data collected across 4 years illustrate significant improvements in perceived social competence, self-perception, and quality of life and suggests the approach is feasible and social valid.

AB The development of reading disorders is complicated by frequently occurring comorbid behavioral disorders. Studies have shown this relation between behavior problems and learning disabilities but the causal relation is unclear so far. The present study investigates whether and in what way parents' judgment (CBCL) of behavioral problems of children change from kindergarten to the end of second grade depending on children's reading performance. Reading performance of 241 children was assessed every year from kindergarten to second grade. Parents judged children's behavioral problems on CBCL. Variance analyses showed that poor readers are judged higher on the CBCL problem score and on externalizing behavior in first grade in comparison to kindergarten. In kindergarten, those children who were later classified as poor readers did not differ in externalizing and internalizing symptoms from good readers, but they had more attention problems. In first and second grade poor readers showed overall more behavior problems than good readers. Also the proportion of children with clinical relevant behavior disorders increased in the group of weak readers during first and second grade. The results indicate that the confrontation with performance requirements in school put a high burden on the children.

AB The authors identified trajectories of teacher-child relationship conflict and closeness from Grades 1 to 6, and associations between these trajectories and externalizing and internalizing behaviors at 11 years old among low-income, urban boys (N = 262). There were three main findings. Nagin cluster analyses indicated five trajectories for conflict with all children evidencing increases in conflict, and four trajectories for closeness with all children demonstrating decreases in closeness. Trajectories with higher levels of conflict and lower levels of closeness were associated with higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at 11 years old. Moreover, conflictual teacher-child relationships exacerbated the effects of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in early childhood; children with conflictual teacher-child relationships had higher levels of behavior problems in middle childhood relative to children with low conflictual teacher-child relationships. Implications of targeting teacher-child relationships as interventions to help prevent behavior problems are discussed.

AB SYNOPSISObjective. To examine the aspects of parenting stressparental distress and parental stress due to dysfunctional interactionsreported by mothers of girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in both childhood and adolescence and to understand their associations with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescence. Design. The diverse sample comprised 120 girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 81 age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls, evaluated at ages 6-12years and followed prospectively for 5years. Basic demographics, oppositionality, childhood behavioral outcomes and symptoms, and key parenting practice were covaried in the analyses. Results. Longitudinally, parental distress during the participants' childhood was positively associated with adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors, even when statistically controlling for parallel childhood behaviors. Parental stress due to dysfunctional interactions during adolescence was associated with contemporaneous adolescent depressive symptoms and externalizing behaviors, but parental distress was associated with only internalizing behaviors. With respect to moderation by diagnostic group, parental stress due to dysfunctional interactions (in childhood) was associated with adolescent internalizing symptoms only in girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, associations between parental distress in childhood and internalizing behaviors were stronger in the comparison than the ADHD sample. Conclusions. Minimizing early dysfunctional interactions might reduce internalizing behaviors in girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Interventions targeting parental distress may be beneficial for girls, regardless of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder status.

AB Children raised in institutions experience psychosocial deprivation that has detrimental influences on attention and mental health. The current study examined patterns of attention biases in children from institutions who were randomized at approximately 21.6 months to receive either a high-quality foster care intervention or care-as-usual. At age 12, children performed a dot-probe task and indices of attention bias were calculated. Additionally, children completed a social stress paradigm and cortisol reactivity was computed. Children randomized into foster care (N = 40) exhibited an attention bias toward positive stimuli but not threat, whereas children who received care-as-usual (N = 40) and a never-institutionalized comparison group (N = 47) showed no bias. Stability of foster care placement was related to positive bias, while instability of foster care placement was related to threat bias. The magnitude of the positive bias was associated with fewer internalizing problems and better coping mechanisms. Within the foster care group, positive attention bias was related to less blunted cortisol reactivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study was designed to examine whether proactive and reactive aggression are meaningful distinctions at the variable- and person-based level, and to determine their associated behavioral profiles. Data from 587 adolescents (mean age 15.6; 71.6 % male) from clinical samples of four different sites with differing levels of aggression problems were analyzed. A multi-level Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify classes of individuals (person-based) with similar aggression profiles based on factor scores (variable-based) of the Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) scored by self-report. Associations were examined between aggression factors and classes, and externalizing and internalizing problem behavior scales by parent report (CBCL) and self-report (YSR). Factor-analyses yielded a three factor solution: 1) proactive aggression, 2) reactive aggression due to internal frustration, and 3) reactive aggression due to external provocation. All three factors showed moderate to high correlations. Four classes were detected that mainly differed quantitatively (no 'proactive-only' class present), yet also qualitatively when age was taken into account, with reactive aggression becoming more severe with age in the highest affected class yet diminishing with age in the other classes. Findings were robust across the four samples. Multiple regression analyses showed that 'reactive aggression due to internal frustration' was the strongest predictor of YSR and CBCL internalizing problems. However, results showed moderate to high overlap between all three factors. Aggressive behavior can be distinguished psychometrically into three factors in a clinical sample, with some differential associations. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is challenged by the person-based analysis showing proactive and reactive aggression are mainly driven by aggression severity.

AB The present study aimed to utilize a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) approach in order to improve clinical decision-making for adolescents at risk for the development of psychopathology in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Specifically we assessed theoretically-driven individual, interpersonal, and event-related vulnerability factors to determine which indices were most accurate in forecasting PTSD. Furthermore, we aimed to translate these etiological findings by identifying clinical cut-off recommendations for relevant vulnerability factors. Our study consisted of structured phone-based clinical interviews with 2000 adolescent-parent dyads living within a 5-mile radius of tornados that devastated Joplin, MO, and northern Alabama in Spring 2011. Demographics, tornado incident characteristics, prior trauma, mental health, and family support and conflict were assessed. A subset of youth completed two behavioral assessment tasks online to assess distress tolerance and risk-taking behavior. ROC analyses indicated four variables that significantly improved PTSD diagnostic efficiency: Lifetime depression (AUC = .90), trauma history (AUC = .76), social support (AUC = .70), and family conflict (AUC = .72). Youth were 2-3 times more likely to have PTSD if they had elevated scores on any of these variables. Of note, event-related characteristics (e.g., property damage) were not related to PTSD diagnostic status. The present study adds to the literature by making specific recommendations for empirically-based, efficient disaster-related PTSD assessment for adolescents following a natural disaster. Implications for practice and future trauma-related developmental psychopathology research are discussed.

AB Negative parenting practices are thought to be essential for the development of adolescents' internalizing problems. However, mechanisms linking parental practices to adolescents' internalizing problems remain poorly understood. A potential pathway connecting parental behaviors to internalizing problems could be through adolescent expressive suppression-the tendency to inhibit the observable expression of emotions.This study examined the indirect effects of three individual parenting practices-poor monitoring, inconsistent discipline and use of corporal punishment-on adolescents' internalizing problems through adolescents'regular use of expressive suppression in a sample of 1132 adolescents (10-14 years). Structural Equation Modeling indicated that parenting practices were related both directly and indirectly to adolescents' internalizing problems through their relationship with suppression. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB The present study investigated the relative contribution of style of peer attachment (secure, anxious, avoidant) and quality of attachment to parents on behavior problems in Korean adolescents. In addition, we examined the role of paternal and maternal attachment separately as a potential moderator in the relationship between style of peer attachment and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Middle school students (245 males, 209 females) completed the Korean version of the Adolescent Friendship Attachment Scale, Inventory of Parental and Peer Attachment-Revised, and Youth Self-Report. Attachment to peers and parents as predictors of behavior problems were tested via hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results revealed that anxious peer attachment remained the strongest predictor of behavior problems among adolescents (internalizing behavior problems beta = .18, p < .01; externalizing behavior problems beta = .21, p < .001), indicating the relative importance of peer relationship compared to attachment to parents. Paternal attachment significantly moderated the relationship between avoidant peer attachment and externalizing behavior problems (beta = .15, p < .05), even when the main effect of avoidant peer attachment on externalizing behavior problems was not significant. Results highlight the role of both attachments to peers and parents on adolescents' psychological adjustment.

AB Stakeholders have increased the focus on accountability for community mental health agencies, leading to the need for an efficient method of measuring mental health outcomes for youth. The Ohio Scales were developed specifically to address the drawbacks of existing measures of child and adolescent mental health such as length, cost, and ease of scoring. The current study examined the factor structure of the Ohio Scales Problem Severity scale and explored the concurrent validity of those factors by comparing them to similar factors on the Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report, two well-established measures of childhood mental health. Using archival data from a community mental health agency serving youth and families, a randomly split sample was used to conduct an exploratory factor analysis on one subsample followed by a confirmatory factor analysis on a second subsample. The results of these analyses indicated that a four-factor model provided the best fit to the data for both youth and parent report on the Ohio Scales. The four factors included: Aggression, Delinquency, Depression, and Anxiety. Comparing the Ohio Scale factors to the factors on the Child Behavior Checklist and YSR revealed that theoretically similar factors (e.g., Anxiety and Internalizing) were more highly correlated than dissimilar factors (e.g., Anxiety and Externalizing). These results provide concurrent validity of the four-factor model of the Ohio Scales. These factors may provide more specific information regarding the types of emotional and behavioral problems youth and parents are reporting to clinicians.

AB Attachment, affect, and sex shape responsivity to psychosocial stress. Concurrent social contexts influence cortisol secretion, a stress hormone and biological marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Patterns of attachment, emotion status, and sex were hypothesized to relate to bifurcated, that is, accentuated and attenuated, cortisol reactivity. The theoretical framework for this study posits that multiple individual differences mediate a cortisol stress response. The effects of two psychosocial stress interventions, a modified Trier Social Stress Test for Teens and the Frustration Social Stressor for Adolescents were developed and investigated with early adolescents. Both of these protocols induced a significant stress reaction and evoked predicted bifurcation in cortisol responses; an increase or decrease from baseline to reactivity. In Study I, 120 predominantly middle-class, Euro-Canadian early adolescents with a mean age of 13.43 years were studied. The girls' attenuated cortisol reactivity to the public performance stressor related significantly to their self-reported lower maternal-attachment and higher trait-anger. In Study II, a community sample of 146 predominantly Euro-Canadian middle-class youth, with an average age of 14.5 years participated. Their self-reports of higher trait-anger and trait-anxiety, and lower parental attachment by both sexes related differentially to accentuated and attenuated cortisol reactivity to the frustration stressor. Thus, attachment, affect, sex, and the stressor contextual factors were associated with the adrenal-cortical responses of these adolescents through complex interactions. Further studies of individual differences in physiological responses to stress are called for in order to clarify the identities of concurrent protective and risk factors in the psychosocial stress and physiological stress responses of early adolescents.

AB In light of its associations with child and adolescent health and well-being, there remains a need to better understand the etiological underpinnings and developmental course of internalizing symptomatology in children and adolescents. This study leveraged intensive longitudinal data (N = 959; 49.6 % females) to test the hypothesis that internalizing symptoms in childhood may be driven more strongly by family experiences whereas internalizing symptoms in adolescence may derive more uniquely from familial loading for affective disorders (i.e., maternal depression). We evaluated the relative contributions of (a) family experiences (b) maternal depression, and (c) peer influences in testing this hypothesis. The results indicated that family predictors were more strongly correlated with childhood (relative to adolescent) internalizing symptoms. In contrast to previous findings, maternal depression also exhibited stronger associations with childhood internalizing symptoms. Although often overlooked in theories concerning potential differential origins of childhood vs. adolescent internalizing symptomatology, peer experiences explained unique variation in both childhood and adolescent internalizing problems.

AB Anxiety, the most common and impairing psychological problem experienced by youth, is associated with numerous individual and environmental factors. Two such factors include childhood emotional abuse (CEA) and low distress tolerance (DT). The current study aimed to understand how CEA and low DT impacted anxiety symptoms measured annually across 5 years among a community sample of youth. We hypothesized DT would moderate the relationship between CEA and anxiety, such that youth with higher levels of CEA and lower levels of DT would have elevated anxiety over time. Community youth (N = 244) were annually assessed across 5 years using the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress. Higher CEA at baseline was associated with higher anxiety at baseline, higher anxiety at each annual assessment, and with greater overall decreases in anxiety over time. Lower DT was associated with higher anxiety at baseline, but did not predict changes in anxiety over time. Baseline DT significantly moderated the relationship between baseline CEA and anxiety, such that youth with both higher CEA and lower DT had the highest anxiety at each annual assessment. Youth with lower DT and higher CEA scores had the highest level of anxiety symptoms across time.

AB It is unclear whether maltreatment types exert common or specific effects on mental health. In the current study, we aimed to systematically characterize the unique, shared and cumulative effects of maltreatment types on psychiatric symptoms, using data drawn from a community sample of high-risk youth (n = 204, M = 18.85). Analyses controlled for a range of potentially confounding variables, including socio-demographic variables, neighbourhood deprivation and levels of community violence exposure. Outcome measures included multi-informant reports of internalizing difficulties, as well as data on externalizing problems and trauma-related symptoms. We found that (i) consistent with previous studies, maltreatment types were highly interrelated and frequently co-occurred; (ii) symptom severity linearly increased with the number of maltreatment types experienced (more so for self-report vs informant ratings); and (iii) while most forms of maltreatment were significantly associated with mental health outcomes when examined individually, few unique effects were observed when modelling maltreatment types simultaneously, pointing to an important role of shared variance in driving maltreatment effects on mental health. Emotional abuse emerged as the main independent predictor of psychiatric symptomatology - over and above other maltreatment types - and this effect was comparable for males and females (i.e. no significant interaction with sex). Findings contribute to a better understanding of heterogeneity in individual responses to maltreatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite being the most prevalent form of child maltreatment, the correlates and consequences of neglect are poorly understood, particularly during early adulthood. The present multi-wave, longitudinal study sought to address this gap in this literature by examining physical and emotional neglect in emerging adults in a diverse community sample. 580 adolescents (Age(Mean) = 18.25; Age(SD) = 0.59; 58.3% female; 31% Hispanic, 28.9% Caucasian: 26.2% African-American; 13.9% other) completed self-report measures for child maltreatment at baseline, and measures for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance use every year for three years. For our analyses, we used both variable-centered (mixed-level modeling) and person-centered (latent profile analysis) analyses to best understand a) how physical and emotional neglect relate to other forms of maltreatment and b) to determine physical and emotional neglect's unique impact on prospective mental health functioning. Our person-centered analyses revealed that a three profile model provided the best solution for our data ("No Trauma," "Abuse", and "Neglect"). In longitudinal analyses, the "the neglect" group had significantly elevated scores compared to the "no trauma" group on all outcomes except alcohol use (p<0.01). Results from our variable-centered analyses showed comparable findings between physical and emotional neglect, with higher scores corresponding to elevated symptoms of depression, PTSD, illicit substance use, and cigarette use over time (p<0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that early neglect-exposure poses a risk for the subsequent development of internalizing symptoms and substance use behaviors among emerging adults.

AB Objective: This article explored whether preschoolers' physical (body mass index [BMI] and salivary cortisol levels) and psychological (internalizing/externalizing behaviors) well-being were predicted by economic hardship, as has been previously documented, and further, whether parental immigration-related stress and/or acculturation level moderated this relationship in low-income Latino families. Method: The sample for the current study included 71 children of Latino immigrants (M = 4.46 years, SD = .62). Parents completed questionnaires assessing immigration-related stress, acculturation level, economic hardship, and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Child's BMI was also calculated from height and weight. Salivary cortisol samples were collected midmorning and midafternoon at home on non-child-care days. Salivary cortisol values were averaged and log transformed. Results: Children's salivary cortisol was predicted by an interaction between economic hardship and acculturation, with lower cortisol values except when children were protected by both lower acculturation and lower economic hardship. Both internalizing and externalizing behaviors were predicted by an interaction between economic hardship and immigration-related stress, with highest behaviors among children whose parents reported high levels of both economic hardship and immigration-related stress. Conclusions: The effects of economic hardship on the well-being of young children of Latino immigrants may depend on concurrent experiences of sociocultural stress, with detrimental effects emerging for these outcomes only when economic hardship and sociocultural stressors are high.

AB Objective: There is a dearth of empirical studies aimed at examining the impact of differential cultural adaptation of evidence-based clinical and prevention interventions. This prevention study consisted of a randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing the impact of 2 differentially culturally adapted versions of the evidence-based parenting intervention known as Parent Management Training, the Oregon Model (PMTOR). Method: The sample consisted of 103 Latina/o immigrant families (190 individual parents). Each family was allocated to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a culturally adapted PMTO (CA), (b) culturally adapted and enhanced PMTO (CE), and (c) a wait-list control. Measurements were implemented at baseline (T1), treatment completion (T2) and 6-month follow up (T3). Results: Multilevel growth modeling analyses indicated statistically significant improvements on parenting skills for fathers and mothers (main effect) at 6-month follow-up in both adapted interventions, when compared with the control condition. With regard to parent-reported child behaviors, child internalizing behaviors were significantly lower for both parents in the CE intervention (main effect), compared with control at 6-month follow-up. No main effect was found for child externalizing behaviors. However, a Parent x Condition effect was found indicating a significant reduction of child externalizing behaviors for CE fathers compared with CA and control fathers at posttest and 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: Present findings indicate the value of differential cultural adaptation research designs and the importance of examining effects for both mothers and fathers, particularly when culturally focused and gender variables are considered for intervention design and implementation.

AB Previous research has shown that stressful experiences increase across childhood and adolescence, and has provided evidence for an age-dependent impaired health status. Thereby, the impairment was not restricted to objective health parameters but also for subjective measures, showing an age-related decline in self-reported health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Coping has been found to moderate the stress-strain relationship. In more detail, maladaptive coping was associated with the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Moreover, results regarding gender effects on coping and HrQoL were rather inconsistent. However, there is evidence supporting increased employment of support seeking combined with more frequent application of maladaptive internalizing coping behavior among females. Finally, research has demonstrated decreased HrQoL among girls. The present study was mainly aimed at investigating gender and age effects on coping, self-reported HrQoL, and physical strain. Furthermore, the effects of different coping styles on HrQoL and physical strain were examined. In total, n = 577 German children and adolescents aged from 9 to 16 years were included into this cross-sectional study. Pupils were asked to complete the German Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents in a classroom setting, which measures three coping styles by nine coping strategies. There are two adaptive styles represented by emotion-focused coping (minimization and distraction/recreation) and problem-focused coping (situation control, positive self-instructions, and social support), and a maladaptive coping style consisting of the following strategies: passive avoidance, rumination, resignation, and aggression. In addition, self-reported HrQoL was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-27, and physical strain was measured by three single items. To create different coping styles, types of coping were classified by normative scores as follows: (a) adaptive copers were represented by high adaptive and low maladaptive coping, (b) high-intense copers had high scores in adaptive and maladaptive coping, (c) less-intense copers were characterized by low adaptive and maladaptive coping, and (d) maladaptive copers were represented by low adaptive and high maladaptive coping, respectively. An impaired coping pattern, lower HrQoL, and enhanced physical strain among older age groups and girls was found via twofold multivariate analyses of variances with the between-subject factors gender and grade level. Additionally, explorative analyses of variances yielded higher HrQoL and decreased physical strain among adaptive copers compared with the groups of maladaptive and high-intense copers. Results support that coping and HrQoL should be assessed among children and adolescents to identify risk groups at an early stage. Moreover, application of health-promoting interventions among children tailored to gender and age is suggested. Thus, the development of psychosocial maladjustment could be prevented at an early stage.

AB Research Findings: This study examined how child negative emotionality interacted with mothers' self-reported parenting in predicting different aspects of social functioning among very young Chinese children. A total of 109 Chinese nursery children in Hong Kong participated with their parents. Maternal supportive and aversive parenting practices were reported by mothers, and child negative emotionality and social functioning were reported by both mothers and fathers. The results revealed interaction effects between child negative emotionality and mothers' self-reported parenting on children's internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social-emotional skill deficiency. Specifically, children with high negative emotionality were more susceptible to the negative effects of aversive parenting (i.e., showing more internalizing and externalizing problems when exposed to aversive parenting) than their peers with low negative emotionality. Negative emotionality also placed young children at risk for social-emotional skill deficiency, especially when they received less support from their mothers compared to their peers. Practice or Policy: Special attention should be paid to the social functioning of Chinese children with higher levels of negative emotionality, because these children are more vulnerable to poor-quality parenting at a very young age.

AB Although the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal has been associated with adaptive outcomes, there is a growing evidence that it may not be adaptive in all contexts. In the present study, adolescents reported their use of habitual reappraisal and their experiences with peer victimisation, a chronic stressor that is associated with reduced well-being in this population. We examined how these variables predicted physiological reactivity (vagal withdrawal and changes in pre-ejection period) during a social stressor (i.e., Trier Social Stress Task). In line with previous research, at high levels of victimisation, habitual reappraisal predicted adaptive physiological reactivity (i.e., greater vagal withdrawal). Conversely, at low levels of victimisation, habitual reappraisal predicted maladaptive physiological reactivity (i.e., blunted vagal withdrawal). These findings were specific to parasympathetic reactivity. They suggest that habitual reappraisal may exert different effects on parasympathetic reactivity depending on the presence of stressors, and highlight the importance of examining the role of contextual factors in determining the adaptiveness of emotion regulation strategies.

AB Risk for internalizing problems and social skills deficits likely emerges in early childhood when emotion processing and social competencies are developing. Positively biased processing of social information is typical during early childhood and may be protective against poorer psychosocial outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that young children with relatively less positively biased attention to, interpretations of, and attributions for their mother's emotions would exhibit poorer prosocial skills and more internalizing problems. A sample of 4- to 6-year-old children (N=82) observed their mothers express happiness, sadness and anger during a simulated emotional phone conversation. Children's attention to their mother when she expressed each emotion was rated from video. Immediately following the phone conversation, children were asked questions about the conversation to assess their interpretations of the intensity of mother's emotions and misattributions of personal responsibility for her emotions. Children's prosocial skills and internalizing problems were assessed using mother-report rating scales. Interpretations of mother's positive emotions as relatively less intense than her negative emotions, misattributions of personal responsibility for her negative emotions, and lack of misattributions of personal responsibility for her positive emotions were associated with poorer prosocial skills. Children who attended relatively less to mother's positive than her negative emotions had higher levels of internalizing problems. These findings suggest that children's attention to, interpretations of, and attributions for their mother's emotions may be important targets of early interventions for preventing prosocial skills deficits and internalizing problems.

AB The current study examined the moderating influence that different aspects of narcissism have on the relation between callous-unemotional (CU) traits and aggression in a sample of 720 adolescents (500 males), ages 16-19 enrolled in a 22-week residential program. Findings from the two studies revealed that psychopathy-linked narcissism as assessed by the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; Frick & Hare, 2001; Antisocial process screening device. Toronto: Multi-Health Systems.) and vulnerable narcissism as assessed using the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI; Pincus et al., 2009; Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory. Psychological Assessment, 21, 365-379) significantly moderated the relation between CU traits and aggression in adolescents. Conversely, non-pathological narcissism assessed by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory for Children (NPIC; Barry, Frick, & Killian, 2003; The relation of narcissism and self-esteem to conduct problems in children. Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 32, 139-152) and PNI grandiose narcissism did not significantly impact this relation. These results suggest that forms of narcissism most closely connected to internalizing problems combined with CU traits are associated with relatively heightened aggression in youth. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: This study aimed to test the validity of using the Hypomania Checklist-16 [HCL-16] to measure hypomania in a British adolescent community sample. Limited research is available concerning the characterization of hypomania among community adolescent samples, particularly in the UK, despite it,: potential importance for early intervention policy development.
   Method: To explore the structure and characterization of hypomania in a British adolescent nonclinical cohort. over 1400 17 year olds (Mean=17.05 years; SD=0.88) completed the HCL-16 along with measures of different psychological and psychopathological dimensions.
   Results: Principal components analysis revealed a 2-component solution for the HCL-16, described as active elated and irritable/risk-taking. Hypomanic symptoms were significantly correlated with many psychopathological dimensions. There were distinct correlation patterns for the two HCL-16 subscales, with the irritability/ risk-taking subscale showing significantly stronger associations with psychotic-like experiences, internalizing and externalizing problems, and reduced life satisfaction relative to the active-elated dimension. Adolescents at `high-risk' for bipolar disorder reported more psychopathology relative to the comparison group.
   Limitations: Absence of the clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder in the sample means that the classification of the 'high-risk' group cannot be confirmed.
   Conclusions: The structure of the HCL-16 in this UK adolescent sample mirrored that observed in adult and clinical cohorts. The observed links between the HCL-16 and psychopathological dimensions that have been previously associated with both hypomania and bipolar disorder lend support to the HCL-16's validity as a hypomania instrument for adolescents. Better understanding of hypomania prior to adulthood has considerable potential for informing early intervention approaches.

AB Objective: Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of psychiatric problems in children. A more precise understanding of the timing of the symptoms during pregnancy and their independence of other prenatal and postnatal factors in predicting child psychopathology risk is needed. We examined whether maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy predict child psychiatric problems, whether these associations are trimester- or gestational-week-specific and/or independent of pregnancy disorders, and whether maternal depressive symptoms after pregnancy mediate or add to the prenatal effects.
   Method: The study sample comprised 2,296 women and their children born in Finland between 2006-2010, participating in the prospective pregnancy cohort study Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) and followed up from 1.9 to 5.9 years of age. The women completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale biweekly between gestational weeks+days 12+0/13+6 and 38+0/39+6 or delivery. In the follow-up, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II and Child Behavior Checklist 11/2-5.
   Results: Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy predicted significantly higher internalizing (0.28 SD unit per SD unit increase [95% CI = 0.24-0.32]), externalizing (0.26 [0.23-0.30]), and total problems (0.31 [0.27-0.35]) in children. These associations were nonspecific to gestational week and hence pregnancy trimester, independent of pregnancy disorders, and independent of, although partially mediated by, maternal depressive symptoms after pregnancy. Psychiatric problems were greatest in children whose mothers reported clinically significant depressive symptoms across pregnancy trimesters and during and after pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy predict increased psychiatric problems in young children. Preventive interventions from early pregnancy onward may benefit offspring mental health.

AB We examined cross-cultural differences in (1) sibling power balance and (2) the associations between sibling power balance and internalizing and externalizing problems in three separate cross-cultural studies (early childhood, late childhood, and adolescence). The early childhood samples consisted of 123 Turkish and 128 Dutch mothers (mean age for children was 4.9 years). In the late childhood samples, self-report data were collected from 124 Indian and 129 Dutch children (mean age 10.9 years). In the adolescent samples self-report data were collected from 165 ethnic Moroccan and 165 ethnic Dutch adolescents (mean age 15.2 years). In all studies, questionnaire data on sibling power imbalance and internalizing and externalizing problems were collected. Results showed only one significant cross-cultural difference in sibling power imbalance: The Indian sample reported more sibling power imbalance than the Dutch. Links between sibling power imbalance and problem behavior were highly similar between the different cultural samples. The only significant difference was a stronger impact of sibling power imbalance on externalizing problems for the Dutch compared to the Turkish sample. Concluding, few cross-cultural differences were found in sibling power imbalance. Across cultures and age groups, more sibling power imbalance was linked to more internalizing and externalizing problems. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background. Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress.
   Method. We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3-5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI >= 40 kg/m(2), obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5-25 kg/m(2)). The mothers completed the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.
   Results. Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood.

ID UNDERSTANDING ALEXITHYMIA; TAS-20; MODEL; SCALE
AB The concept of alexithymia refers to impairments in the ability to identify and communicate feelings. Alexithymia has repeatedly been linked to attachment impairments and different types of symptomatology, in particular, depression and somatic complaints. Very few studies have focused on children or adolescents when addressing this construct. Additionally, to date, there is no self-report questionnaire of alexithymia for such groups in the Spanish language. The main objectives of this study were therefore, (a) to translate and adapt the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children to Spanish; (b) to assess the factor structure of the adapted questionnaire; and (c) to describe its reliability and validity, in a sample of N = 265 Peruvian adolescents aged 11-18 years. Internal consistency was acceptable for the DIF subscale (alpha = .74), and low for the DDF and EOT subscales (alpha = .55, and alpha = .47 respectively). A composite scale based on previous studies that merges DIF and DDF into one scale had an alpha = .75. Regarding the factor structure, a two- factor solution showed to have the best fit with the data (RMSEA = .05, SMRM = .04, CFI = .94). Convergent validity analyses indicated significant associations between alexithymia and attachment measurements (that ranged from r = -.15, p < .05, to r = .31, p < .05), somatic complaints (r = .38, p < .05, to r = .41, p < .05), and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms (r = .37, p < .05, to r = .46, p < .05). Future assessment and modifications are recommended for the EOT scale. Keywords: alexithymia, mentalizing, adolescents, attachment, symptoms

AB The main purpose of the study was to examine the cluster composition of the analysis on the effect of gender and age of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a large school-based sample of high school adolescents ranging from 14 to 18 years old (N = 1474). In order to do this, a K-means iterative cluster analysis was performed. A five-cluster solution turned out to be the most parsimonious in the differentiation of emotional and behavioural patterns. A five-cluster solution yielded the following patterns: "No difficulties and high prosocial scores" (n = 418; 28.36%), "high difficulties and low prosocial scores" (n = 239; 16.21%), "high on hyperactivity, low on the rest of the difficulties sub scales, and high in prosocial capabilities" (n = 302; 20.49%), "high on emotional and peer problems, relatively low on conduct and hyperactivity, and high in prosocial capabilities" (n = 275; 18.66%), and finally "hyperactivity problems and average in the others difficulties subscales, and in pro social capabilities" (a = 239; 16.21%). This cluster solution was replicated attending to the same gender and age groups. Nevertheless, differences in the distribution of the cluster composition suggest that difficulties differ by gender and age. The results allow for the conclusion that men reveal a greater number of problems of an externalizing nature whereas women indicate a greater degree of internalizing difficulties and prosocial skills.

AB Childhood disadvantage has repeatedly been linked to adult physical morbidity and mortality. We show in a prospective, longitudinal design that childhood poverty predicts multimethodological indices of adult (24 y of age) psychological well-being while holding constant similar childhood outcomes assessed at age 9. Adults from low-income families manifest more allostatic load, an index of chronic physiological stress, higher levels of externalizing symptoms (e. g., aggression) but not internalizing symptoms (e. g., depression), and more helplessness behaviors. In addition, childhood poverty predicts deficits in adult short-term spatial memory.

AB The Aussie Optimism Program: Feelings and Friends (AOP-FF) is a 10 week, universal mental health promotion program based on social/emotional and cognitive and behavioral strategies. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of a universal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy based program in preventing and reducing internalizing problems in 6-8 year olds (Years 1-3 in Australia). Year 1-3 students from a low SES primary school (N = 206) were randomly assigned in classes to either an intervention or a control group and assessed at baseline and post-test. Results showed a significant (p = 0.009) and small to moderate (partial eta-squared = 0.034) pre-post decrease in parent-reported anxiety symptoms for the intervention group, in conjunction with a non-significant (p = 0.708) and negligible (partial eta-squared = 0.001) pre-post increase for the control group. A larger randomized controlled trial assessing longer term effects is needed. In addition the program needs to be simplified for year 1-2 students with a separate more developmentally appropriate program for year 3 students.

AB The aim of this paper was to contribute to the elaboration of the Environmental Stress Hypothesis framework by testing eight hypotheses addressing the direct impact of gross motor coordination problems in elementary-school on selected physical, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes in adolescence. Results are based on a longitudinal sample of 940 participants who were (i) recruited as part of a population-based representative survey on health, physical fitness and physical activity in childhood and adolescence, (ii) assessed twice within 6 years, between the ages of 6 and 10 years old as well as between the ages of 12 and 16 years old (Response Rate: 55.9%) and (iii) classified as having gross motor coordination problems (N = 115) or having no gross motor coordination problems (N = 825) at baseline. Motor tests from the Korperkoordinationstest, measures of weight and height, a validated physical activity questionnaire as well as the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire were conducted. Data were analyzed by use of binary logistic regressions. Results indicated that elementary-school children with gross motor coordination problems show a higher risk of persistent gross motor coordination problems (OR = 7.99, p < 0.001), avoiding organized physical activities (OR = 1.53, p < 0.05), an elevated body mass (OR = 1.78, p < 0.05), bonding with sedentary peers (OR = 1.84, p < 0.01) as well as emotional (OR = 1.73, p < 0.05) and conduct (OR = 1.79, p < 0.05) problems in adolescence in comparison to elementary-school children without gross motor coordination problems. However, elementary-school children with gross motor coordination problems did not show a significantly higher risk of peer problems (OR = 1.35, p = 0.164) or diminished prosocial behavior (OR = 1.90, p = 0.168) in adolescence, respectively in comparison to elementary-school children without gross motor coordination problems. This study is the first to provide population-based longitudinal data ranging from childhood to adolescence in the context of the Environmental Stress Hypothesis which can be considered a substantial methodological progress. In summary, gross motor coordination problems represent a serious issue for a healthy transition from childhood to adolescence which substantiates respective early movement interventions.

AB The influence of internalizing and externalizing problems on children's understanding of others' emotions has mainly been investigated on basic levels of emotion comprehension. So far, studies assessing more sophisticated levels of emotion comprehension reported deficits in the ability to understand others' emotions in children with severe internalizing or externalizing symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between emotion comprehension and interindividual differences, with a focus on internalizing and externalizing behavior in children aged 7-10 years from the general population. A sample of 135 children was tested for emotion understanding using the Test of Emotion Comprehension. Information on internalizing and externalizing behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist 4/18. Age, bilingual upbringing, and amount of paternal working hours were significant control variables for emotion comprehension. In contrast to prior research, overall level of emotion understanding was not related to externalizing symptoms and correlated positively with elevated levels of somatic complaints and anxious/depressed symptoms. In addition, and in line with previous work, higher levels of social withdrawal were associated with worse performance in understanding emotions elicited by reminders. The present results implicate not only an altered understanding of emotions among more specific internalizing symptoms, but also that these alterations occur already on a low symptom level in a community based sample.

AB Postpartum parental depression, even of mild intensity and short duration, has negative consequences on child development, including increased externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Studies revealed that the links between parental depression and child development are mediated by parenting difficulties. On the other hand, the mediating role of problematic family-level relationships, such as low coparenting support and high conflict between the parents, has rarely been considered, although coparenting difficulties have been linked with both increased depressive symptoms in parents and increased symptoms in toddlers. In the present study, we proposed testing a comprehensive mediation model linking parental depression, coparenting, and child symptoms. At 3 months postpartum, a convenience sample of 69 parental couples completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. In addition, we assessed levels of coparenting support and conflict during a mother-father-infant play situation, the Lausanne Trilogue Play. At 18 months postpartum, both parents assessed child symptoms with the Symptom Checklist Questionnaire. The results showed that coparenting support mediated the links between parental depressive symptoms and child symptoms, but only for mothers: Maternal depressive symptoms were linked with lower coparenting support, which in turn predicted increased psychofunctional symptoms and behavior problems assessed by mothers. Although coparenting conflict behaviors were not predicted by parents depressive symptoms, higher conflict was unexpectedly linked with fewer behavior problems assessed by both parents. The present study allowed us to unveil complex pathways between mild parental mood disturbances, family-level relationships, and child development in the first months of the childs life.

TI Usefulness of CBCL/6-18 to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems in

AB Background: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has been widely utilized to estimate emotional and behavioral problems in children in the USA and Europe. Although the Indonesian version of the CBCL/6-18 was proven to have good validity and internal consistency in children with typical development (TD) in Indonesia, it has not been utilized for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the usefulness of CBCL/6-18 for detecting emotional and behavioral problems in Indonesian ASD children.
   Methods: One hundred and eight mothers of children with ASD and with TD were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of ASD in Indonesia was made by expert child neurologists based on DSM-IV-TR. Mothers of children aged 6-18 years completed the Indonesian version of the CBCL.
   Results: The scores of total problems, internalizing, and externalizing were significantly higher in the ASD group than the TD group. Children with ASD scored significantly higher in seven of the eight CBCL subscales (except somatic complaints) compared with TD children.
   Conclusions: The CBCL/ 6-18 Indonesian version could be considered as a useful tool for detecting emotional and behavioral problems in children with ASD in Indonesia in Muslim populations.

AB .Increasingly, schools are implementing school-based screening for risk of behavioral and emotional problems; hence, foundational evidence supporting the predictive validity of screening instruments is important to assess. This study examined the predictive validity of the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System Student Form (BESS Student) in the authentic context of an urban high school that conducted universal screening over 3 years. Multivariate regression, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to examine the BESS Student scores' prediction of internalizing symptoms. BESS Student scores were able to explain a significant proportion of the variance in internalizing symptoms concurrently, but predictive validity estimates decreased over time. Significant gender differences were present; BESS Student scores were better able to predict internalizing symptoms for females. Implications for research and practice involving screening for behavioral and emotional problems are discussed.

AB The mental health of children of immigrant background compared to their majority peers is an important indicator of integration. We analyse internalizing and externalizing problems in 14-15-year-olds from England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (n = 18,716), using new comparative data (Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries). Studying more than 30 different origin countries, we find that despite potential problems with acculturation and social stress, children of immigrants-particularly from geographically and culturally distant countries-report systematically fewer internalizing and externalizing problems than the majority population, thus supporting the 'immigrant health paradox' found in some studies. However, surprisingly, we do not find that this minority advantage changes with time in the destination country. Externalizing problems are most prevalent in our English sample, and overall Swedish adolescents show the least mental health problems. A plausible account of our results is that there is a positive selection of immigrants on some persistent and intergenerationally transferable characteristic that invokes resilience in children.

AB The present study evaluated secondary emotional and behavioral outcomes among adolescents who received prolonged exposure (PE-A) or client-centered therapy (CCT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were 61 adolescent girls (age: M = 15.33, SD = 1.50 years) with sexual abuse related PTSD seeking treatment at a community mental health clinic. Multilevel modeling was employed to evaluate group differences on the Youth Self-Report (YSR) over acute treatment and 12-month follow-up. Both treatment groups showed significant improvements on all YSR scales from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Adolescents who received PE-A showed significantly greater reductions than those receiving CCT on the Externalizing subscale (d = 0.70), rule-breaking behavior (d = 0.63), aggressive behavior (d = 0.62), and conduct problems (d = 0.78). No treatment differences were found on the Internalizing subscale or among other YSR problem areas. Both PE-A and CCT effectively reduced many co-occurring problems among adolescents with PTSD. Although PE-A focuses on PTSD and not on disruptive behaviors, PE-A was associated with greater sustained changes in externalizing symptoms, supporting broad effects of trauma-focused treatment on associated problem areas.

AB The purpose of the multi-measure, multi-wave, longitudinal study was to examine the interactive relation between behavioral distress tolerance (DT) and perceived social support (PSS) in 352 tornado-exposed adolescents aged 12-17 years (M = 14.44; SD = 1.74). At baseline, adolescents completed a computer-based task for DT, and self-report measures of PSS, depressed mood, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use, and interpersonal conflict. Symptoms also were assessed 4 and 12 months after baseline. Findings showed that lower levels of DT together with lower levels of PSS conferred risk for elevated symptoms of prospective depression (t(262) = -2.04, p = .04; r(effect size) = 0.13) and PTSD (t(195) = -2.08, p = .04; r(effect size) = 0.15) following a tornado. However, only PSS was significant in substance use t(139) = 2.20, p = .03; r(effect size=)0.18) and conflict (t(138) = -4.05, p < .0001; r(effect size=)0.33) in our sample. Implications regarding adolescent DT, the transdiagnostic nature of PSS, and the clinical applications of our findings in the aftermath of a natural disaster are discussed.

AB Based on previous studies on the role of objective sleep duration in predicting morbidity in individuals with insomnia, we examined the role of objective sleep duration in differentiating behavioral profiles in adolescents with insomnia symptoms. Adolescents from the Penn State Child Cohort (n = 397, ages 12-23, 54.7% male) underwent a nine-hour polysomnography (PSG), clinical history, physical examination and psychometric testing, including the Child or Adult Behavior Checklist and Pediatric Behavior Scale. Insomnia symptoms were defined as a self-report of difficulty falling and/or staying asleep and objective "short" sleep duration as a PSG total sleep time <= 7 h. A significant interaction showed that objective short sleep duration modified the association of insomnia symptoms with internalizing problems. Consistently, adolescents with insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration were characterized by depression, rumination, mood dysregulation and social isolation, while adolescents with insomnia symptoms and normal sleep duration were characterized by rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors and, to a lesser extent, rumination. These findings indicate that objective sleep duration is useful in differentiating behavioral profiles among adolescents with insomnia symptoms. The insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype is associated with an increased risk of depression earlier in the lifespan than previously believed.

AB The objectives of this study were to test the replicability of the Youth Self-Report structure in Mexican adolescents living in poverty; to determine gender and rurality differences in internalizing and externalizing problems; and to identify predictors of internalizing and externalizing problems. Data were collected from a probabilistic sample of households that are beneficiaries of the Oportunidades program, including the heads of those households, their spouses and their adolescent children. The self-reports of parents and children were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed the Youth Self-Report structure in Mexican adolescents, and indicated higher levels of emotional disorders in females, higher levels of behavioral disorders in males, and higher levels in all the Youth Self-Report scales in rural adolescents. Internalizing and externalizing problems were mediated by the presence of loneliness, oppositional behavior and stress, through which the model's other latent variables exerted indirect influence on the determination of youth psychopathology.

AB Higher negative (or lower positive) mood is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among some, but not all youth, suggesting that contextual factors may influence these temperament-symptom relations. Family conflict also is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, although it is unclear whether family conflict influences the relation between negative mood and symptoms. To address this gap, we examined whether family conflict moderates the relations between temperamental negative mood and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Participants were 775 youth (69% male, 76% Caucasian). Mothers and youth completed questionnaires when youth were ages 10-12 (time 1) and 12-14 (time 2). When exposed to higher family conflict at time 1, children higher in negative mood experienced higher time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems than children lower in negative mood. When exposed to lower family conflict, children's internalizing and externalizing symptom levels were similar regardless of their levels of negative mood. Findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing youth's risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms should address conflictual interactions within the larger family system, particularly among youth with higher negative mood.

AB Effectively coordinating school and community services has remained an elusive goal for children's mental health service providers. Researchers speculate that when community and school-based providers collaborate, supports for youth with serious emotional and behavioral disorders improve. An understudied corresponding hypothesis is that such improvement will be associated with successful school outcomes. Aims of this study included: (1) investigating outcomes of students referred by their schools to systems of care; (2) examining socio-demographic correlates of outcomes; and (3) comparing youth referred by schools to youth referred by mental health agencies. Using data from an ongoing examination of more than 170 federally-funded system of care communities, findings suggest that students referred to systems of care by schools improved on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, absence rates, and rates of school failure. Youth referred from schools also had significantly greater improvement in absence rates than those referred by mental health agencies. These findings suggest the importance of considering referral source in understanding treatment outcomes. In particular, results indicate that school staff might play an especially important role in referral to community systems of care, as their involvement in referral might facilitate improved school functioning outcomes.

AB Aim: The complex interplay of externalizing and internalizing problems in substance use risk is not well understood. This study tested whether the relationship of conduct problems and several internalizing disorders with future substance use is redundant, incremental, or interactive in adolescents.
   Methods: Two semiannual waves of data from the Happiness and Health Study were used, which included 3383 adolescents (M age = 14.1 years old; 53% females) in Los Angeles who were beginning high school at baseline. Logistic regression models tested the likelihood of past six-month alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and any substance use at follow-up conditional on baseline conduct problems, symptoms of one of several internalizing disorders (i.e., Social Phobia and Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, Panic, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and their interaction adjusting for baseline use and other covariates.
   Findings: Conduct problems were a robust and consistent risk factor of each substance use outcome at follow-up. When adjusting for the internalizing-conduct comorbidity, depressive symptoms were the only internalizing problem whose risk for alcohol, tobacco, and any substance use was incremental to conduct problems. With the exception of social phobia, antagonistic interactive relationships between each internalizing disorder and conduct problems were found when predicting any substance use; internalizing symptoms was a more robust risk factor for substance use in teens with low (vs. high) conduct problems.
   Conclusions: Although internalizing and externalizing problems both generally increase risk of substance use, a closer look reveals important nuances in these risk pathways, particularly among teens with comorbid externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB Background: Data on long-term consequences of preterm birth on pain coping later in life are limited. Aim: To assess whether gestational age, birth weight and neonatal disease severity have effect on pain coping style in adolescents born preterm or with low birth weight.
   Study design: Observational, longitudinal study (Project On Preterm and SGA-infants, POPS-19).
   Subjects: We analyzed data of 537 adolescents at the age of 19 years, who were born at a gestational age < 32 weeks or with a birth weight < 1500 g.
   Outcome measures: Participants completed the pain coping questionnaire (PCQ) that assesses pain coping strategies in three higher-order factors: approach ("to deal with pain"), problem-focused avoidance ("to disengage from pain") and emotion-focused avoidance ("expression of pain"). Furthermore, their pain coping effectiveness, pain controllability and emotional reactions to pain were assessed. All participants completed an IQ test
   Results: Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation between length of stay, sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis and any of the higher-order factors. Approach was only correlated with IQ Problem-focused avoidance was, in the multiple regression analysis (including gestational age, IVH and IQ), only correlated with IQ For emotion-focused avoidance (including birth weight, SGA, NH, respiratory support and IQ) three independent predictors remained: NH was positively correlated, while respiratory support and IQ were negatively correlated with emotion-focused avoidance.
   Conclusions: Early neonatal characteristics and neonatal disease severity have limited effect on pain coping style in adolescence. Higher IQ was associated with the use of adaptive coping strategies, while maladaptive strategies were used less. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Children born preterm are at risk for later developmental disorders. The present study examined the predictive effects of neonatal, sociodemographic, and temperament characteristics on behavioral outcomes at toddlerhood, in children born preterm. The sample included 100 toddlers born preterm and with very-low-birth-weight, and their mothers. Neonatal characteristics were evaluated using medical records. The mothers were interviewed using the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire for temperament assessment, and the Child Behavior Checklist for behavioral assessment. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. Predictors of 39% of the variability of the total behavioral problems in toddlers born prematurely were: temperament with more Negative Affectivity and less Effortful Control, lower family socioeconomic status, and younger mothers at childbirth. Temperament with more Negative Affectivity and less Effortful Control and lower family socioeconomic status were predictors of 23% of the variability of internalizing behavioral problems. Additionally, 37% of the variability of externalizing behavioral problems was explained by temperament with more Negative Affectivity and less Effortful Control, and younger mothers at childbirth. The neonatal characteristics and stressful events in the neonatal intensive care unit did not predict behavioral problems at toddlerhood. However, temperament was a consistent predictor of behavioral problems in toddlers born preterm. Preventive follow-up programs could assess dispositional traits of temperament to provide early identification of preterm infants at high-risk for behavioral problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Stressors have been identified as significant vulnerability factors in the development of adolescents' depression. The present study focused on the relationship between depressive symptoms and two types of interpersonal stressors in the schoolyard, namely teacher-student interaction stressors (TSIS) and peer interaction stressors (PIS). More importantly, rumination and co-rumination were examined as two possible mechanisms to account for these relationships. A convenience sample of 570 Chinese adolescents aged from 12- to 19-years-old participated in this research. Results indicated that TSIS and PIS were significantly related to participants' depressive symptoms. Furthermore, rumination partially mediated the relationship between PIS and depressive symptoms. Co-rumination was a partial mediator between both types of interpersonal stressors and depressive symptoms. Hence, rumination and co-rumination might serve as two mechanisms linking interpersonal stressors in the schoolyard and depressive mood in adolescence. The findings are discussed in the light of related literature and potential implications for school practitioners.

AB Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a highly prevalent, yet frequently undetected and untreated, psychological disorder. In adolescents, when untreated, SAD often follows a chronic course and is associated with social impairment, poor educational attainment, diminished quality of life, and high rates of comorbidity. Barriers to treatment include low socioeconomic status, minority status, difficulty in detecting internalizing symptomatology, and poor public awareness of the nature and signs of SAD. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of treatment utilization for SAD adolescents among a nationally representative sample of adolescents. A hierarchical logistic regression was performed with demographic variables entered in the first block, comorbid mood, anxiety, eating, and substance use disorders entered in the second block, and comorbid externalizing disorders entered in the final block. Results of this study indicate that lower rates of receiving treatment were predicted by Hispanic ethnicity and extreme poverty, while higher rates of receiving treatment were significantly predicted by the presence of comorbid diagnoses, including depression, another anxiety disorder, and an eating disorder in adolescents with SAD. The presence of comorbid ADHD was a significant predictor of service receipt over and above other comorbid disorders and sociodemographic variables. The results highlight priorities for expanded healthcare policy to improve recognition of and service use for SAD and identify key aspects of research to be further developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent theories suggest that relationships between cognitive factors and symptoms of anxiety and depression are reciprocal and recursive. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the recursive relationships among two types of maladaptive cognitions (negative automatic thoughts and social looming cognitive style) and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. The second aim of the study was to test whether these reciprocal relationships help to explain sex differences in emotional problems and maladaptive cognitions. A total of 640 adolescents and young adults (52.65% women) participated in this study and filled in questionnaires at two waves, spaced 6 months apart. Participants were between 16 and 25 years old (M-age = 18.27, SDage = 2.21). The path analyses indicated that social looming at T1 predicted social anxiety at T2 and negative self-concept thoughts at T1 predicted social anxiety and depressive symptoms at T2. In addition, social anxiety at T1 predicted social looming at T2 and social anxiety and depressive symptoms at T1 predicted automatic thoughts about negative evaluation by others. Furthermore, women scored higher in all the study variables and the mediational analyses showed that sex differences in internalizing symptoms were explained by maladaptive cognitions and that sex differences in maladaptive cognitions were explained by differences in internalizing symptoms. The findings generally supported a recursive model where maladaptive cognitions contribute to the increase of social anxiety and depressive symptoms and vice versa. The present findings suggest it may be fruitful to consider a recursive model for better understanding etiological and maintenance processes in these emotional disorders.

AB In this article, we review theory and evidence on stigma and minority stress as social/structural determinants of health among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. We discuss different forms of stigma at individual (eg, identity concealment), interpersonal (eg, victimization), and structural (eg, laws and social norms) levels, as well as the mechanisms linking stigma to adverse health outcomes among LGBT youth. Finally, we discuss clinical (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) and public health (eg, antibullying policies) interventions that effectively target stigma-inducing mechanisms to improve the health of LGBT youth.

AB Over the past 3 decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in students identified as eligible for special education as a result of students meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The increasing number of students with ASD in the schools presents significant challenges to teachers, school psychologists, and other school professionals working with this population. Although there is considerable research addressing assessment, identification, and support services for children with ASD, there is a need for further research focused on these topics within the school context. Employing a diverse array of methodologies, the articles in this special topic section address several gaps in the literature, including (a) the application of evidence-based programs within the school context, (b) the social validity of well-established evidence-based practices with both parents and educators, (c) the assessment of social communication, (d) intervention and assessment of spatial and body awareness for children with ASD, (e) the use of peer-mediated discreet trial training, and (f) discrepancies across informants for both externalizing and internalizing symptoms associated with ASD. The results of these studies provide school psychologists and other education professionals with specific directions for advocacy and service delivery that aim to enhance school outcomes for students with ASD.

AB Assessment of clinical symptoms requires information from multiple informants. Discrepancies between informants' ratings can have significant implications in school settings (e.g., access to services, treatment planning, progress monitoring). This study examined parent-teacher discrepancies for ratings of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and adaptive skills of high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder. A total of 236 Behavior Assessment System for Children-2nd Edition ratings of children with high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder from 2 informant groups (parents and teachers) were analyzed. Each informant pair (n = 118 parents/caregivers and n = 118 teachers) rated the same child. Scores on the Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, and Adaptive Skills Composites were examined for mean differences, level of agreement, linear relationship, and moderators of discrepancies. There were no significant mean differences between raters for the Internalizing and Externalizing Composites or their constituent scales (except Hyperactivity). Parent-teacher ratings on these composites and scales were significantly correlated (generally moderate), and the discrepancies were not moderated by the included child or parent variables. In contrast, teacher ratings were significantly higher than parents for the Adaptive Skills Composite and several of its constituent scales. Correlations between informants on the Adaptive Skills Composite were significant (low-to-moderate), with notable variability in the correlations among its constituent scales. The degree of parent-teacher discrepancy differed significantly across the Adaptive Skills Composite score range, but it was not moderated by the included child or parent variables. This study suggests a reduced likelihood of informant discrepancies for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, with larger discrepancies expected when assessing adaptive skills.

AB Using latent class analyses (LCA), the present study aimed to test whether meaningful subtypes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors could be found among Chinese community-based adolescents. A total of 5244 adolescents, ages 11-18 years (M = 15.11, SD = 1.79) recruited from 16 Chinese middle schools completed the Chinese version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-C). We examined the data using Latent Class Analysis to identify subtypes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors among the adolescents. Multivariate Logistic regression was subsequently implemented to ascertain the relationships between latent classes and demographic covariates. Three distinct subtypes were uncovered: a high-risk group, a middle-risk group and a low-risk group; the three subtypes accounted for 19.8, 31.1, and 49.1 % of the total sample variance respectively. Youth with elevations in one behavior type were likely to have elevations in the other behavior type. Further analyses revealed that compared to the low-risk group, the adolescents from the high-risk group and middle-risk groups were female and older. Significant heterogeneity in internalizing and externalizing behaviors was revealed in this Chinese adolescent's sample. Profiling behavior problems patterns is potentially useful as a first step in developing tailored prevention and intervention programs. Suggestions for future research, including cross-national studies, and implications for mental health professionals were discussed.

AB Efforts to reduce youth mental health problems have advanced greatly but have not lowered overall rates of youth mental illness. Thus, a need exists for disseminable, mechanism-targeted approaches to reducing risk of youth psychopathology. Accordingly, we conducted a randomized-controlled trial testing whether a single-session intervention teaching growth personality mindsets (the belief that personality is malleable) reduced known risk factors for anxiety and depression in adolescents experiencing or at risk for internalizing problems (N = 96, ages 12-15). Compared to a supportive-therapy control, a 30-min computer-guided mindset intervention strengthened adolescents' perceived control; this improvement was associated with increases in growth mindsets. Further, electrodermal activity recovery slopes showed that youths receiving the mindset intervention recovered from a lab-based social stressor over three times as fast as control group youths. Improvements in growth mindsets and perceived control were linked with faster stress recovery. Results suggest a disseminable strategy for reducing internalizing problem risk among adolescents.

AB Background: Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are suspected endocrine disruptors that are highly persistent and neurotoxic in animals. Human epidemiological studies of exposure-related deviations of children's behaviors are sparse. We assessed the associations between prenatal, 5-and 7-year PFAS exposures and behavioral problem scores in 7-year Faroese children.
   Methods: Concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were measured in maternal serumand in serum from children at ages 5 and 7 years (n= 539, 508, and 491, respectively). We used multivariable regressions and structural equationsmodels to estimate the covariate-adjusted associations between serum-PFAS concentrations and behavioral difficulties, as assessed by the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) at age 7.
   Results: Serum-PFOS and PFHxS concentrations declined over time, whereas PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA tended to increase. No associations were observed between prenatal PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores. However, a twofold increase in 5-year serum-PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA concentrations was associated with increases in total SDQ scores by 1.03 (95% CI: 0.11, 1.95), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.07, 1.38) and 0.78 points (95% CI: 0.01, 1.55), respectively. For SDQ subscales, significant associations were found in regard to hyperactivity, peer relationship, and conduct problems, aswell as internalizing and externalizing problems and autismscreening composite scores. Cross-sectional analyses at age 7 years showed possible sex-dimorphic associations between PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores, where girls had consistently positive associations with SDQ scores whereas boys exhibited a pattern of negative or null associations.
   Conclusions: Higher serum PFAS concentrations at ages 5-and 7-years, but not prenatally, were associated with parent-reported behavioral problems at age 7. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Legal decision-makers have discretion at every stage of processing in the juvenile justice system, and individual youth characteristics (e.g., a particular psychiatric diagnosis) influence how a youth progresses through the system. As a result, changes in diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) may affect the rates of diagnoses among justice-involved youths and subsequently influence youths' experiences within the justice system. In this article, we identify the diagnoses most likely to exert such influences and review the prevalence of diagnosis and psychiatric disorder symptomatology in justice-involved youths. We highlight the DSM-5 changes in diagnostic criteria for internalizing and externalizing disorders that commonly occur among justice-involved youths and the potential impact of these changes on the rates of diagnoses within this population. Finally, we address the limitations of using psychiatric diagnoses in juvenile justice decision making, including the potential for biasing legal decision-makers and the importance of considering context as part of diagnosis.

AB Childhood poverty is associated with stress dysregulation which contributes to psychological illness in later ages. The adverse effects of childhood poverty on stress regulation may be mediated in part by the use of disengaging strategies to cope with stress. However, the relations among childhood poverty, coping strategies and psychopathology throughout childhood to adolescence have not been explored. This prospective, longitudinal study included 185 low- and middle-income adolescents at age 17. Chronic exposure to poverty from birth to early adolescence (age 13) was prospectively associated with increases in the use of disengagement versus engagement coping four years later. Increased use of disengagement coping between the ages of 13 and 17 explained the indirect link between poverty exposure since birth and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 17. The findings provide evidence for a coping pathway underlying the link between prolonged exposure to childhood poverty and mental health sequelae. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The present study investigated the mediating effects of emotion dysregulation on the relationship between child maltreatment and psychopathology. An adult sample (N = 701) from diverse backgrounds of psychopathology completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the negative affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) in a cross-sectional online survey. Correlational analyses showed that all types of child maltreatment were uniformly associated with emotion dysregulation, and dimensions of emotion dysregulation were strongly related to psychopathology. Limited access to strategies for emotion regulation emerged as the most powerful predictor. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that emotion dysregulation partially mediated the relationship between child maltreatment and psychopathology, even after controlling for shared variance with negative affect. These findings emphasize the importance of emotion dysregulation as a possible mediating mechanism in the association between child maltreatment and later psychopathology. Additionally, interventions targeting specific emotion regulation strategies may be effective to reduce psychopathology in victims of child maltreatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mounting evidence indicates that emotional maltreatment is at least as harmful as physical and sexual abuse. Notwithstanding their high occurrence among detained adolescents, the link between emotional maltreatment and mental health problems in these youths is not well researched. This study, therefore, was designed to examine the unique link between emotional maltreatment and mental health problems, with particular attention to gender differences. Well validated self-report measures of maltreatment experiences (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and mental health problems (Youth Self Report) were completed by 341 detained adolescents (156 boys, 185 girls) aged 12 to 18 years. As expected, girls reported higher levels of maltreatment experiences and internalizing and externalizing mental health problems than boys. Blockwise multiple linear regression analyses indicated that in both genders emotional abuse was uniquely and positively associated with internalizing and externalizing mental health problems, over and above the influence of other types of maltreatment. Furthermore, sexual abuse was uniquely related with internalizing problems in girls only, whereas only in boys this type of abuse was uniquely related with externalizing problems. Detained adolescents who have been the victim of emotional abuse in combination with another type of maltreatment may be the worst subgroup in terms of mental health problems. Therefore, emotional maltreatment experiences in adolescents who offend should receive more research and clinical attention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) is the standard of care for early onset (3 to 8 years old) disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs). Preliminary evidence suggests that BPT may also produce cascading treatment effects for comorbid and interrelated symptomatology in children, primarily internalizing problems, as well as symptomatology in multiple systems of the family, including caregiver depressive symptomatology. What is less well understood, however, is why and how BPT functions to impact these multiple symptom dusters within and between family members. Accordingly, this manuscript aims to serve as a conceptual and theoretical consideration of the mechanisms through which BPT may produce generalized treatment effects among children with early onset DBDs and internalizing problems, as well as the psychosocial difficulties among their caregivers. It is our intention that the hypothesized mechanisms highlighted in this review may guide advances in clinical research, as well as assessment and practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Involving caregivers in trauma-focused treatments for youth has been shown to result in better outcomes, but it is not clear which in-session caregiver behaviors enhance or inhibit this effect. The current study examined the associations between caregiver behaviors during Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and youth cognitive processes and symptoms.
   Method: Participants were a racially diverse sample of Medicaid-eligible youth (ages 7-17) and their nonoffending caregivers (N = 71 pairs) who received TF-CBT through an effectiveness study in a community setting. Caregiver and youth processes were coded from audio-recorded sessions, and outcomes were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; UPID) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postintake.
   Results: Piecewise linear growth curve modeling revealed that during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT, caregivers' cognitive-emotional processing of their own and their child's trauma-related reactions predicted decreases in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms over treatment. Caregiver support predicted lower internalizing symptoms over follow-up. In contrast, caregiver avoidance and blame of the child predicted worsening of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms over follow-up. Caregiver avoidance early in treatment also predicted worsening of externalizing symptoms over follow-up. During the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were correlated with more child overgeneralization of trauma beliefs, and blame was also associated with less child accommodation of balanced beliefs.
   Conclusions: The association between in-session caregiver behaviors and youth symptomatology during and after TF-CBT highlights the importance of assessing and targeting these behaviors to improve clinical outcomes.

AB The present study sought to examine the symptomatology of children and adolescents with a history of trauma experience of using the German versions of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR). We pursue the question to what extent symptoms differ among adolescents with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A further objective is comparing self-assessment of the children and adolescents with the rating of their parents or caregivers.
   Overall N = 41 patients, aged 11-18 years, and one caregiver of each patient were surveyed. All patients were referred to the forensic ambulance of the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in consequence of acute burden or violent trauma.
   Concerning the two global Scales ("Internalizing" and "Externalizing" symptoms), adolescents with PTSD reported significantly more problems than adolescents without PTSD diagnosis. Further, results on Externalizing Scale showed a systematic higher problem estimation of children and adolescents when compared to their parents.
   The present findings reveal a divergence between child and parent ratings on clinically relevant behavioral problems. Symptoms experienced by the children and youth are often not being recognized by parents. Therefore, it is essential to include the perceptions of the parents at the beginning of diagnostic assessment and counteract possible parental misunderstanding.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the association between different levels of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and sex differences in psychosocial outcomes during adolescence.
   MethodSwedish children (n = 4635) were screened for neuropsychiatric symptoms at age 9 or 12. ADHD symptoms were divided into three levels: screen-negative, screen-intermediate, and screen-positive. At follow-up (age 15), parents and teenagers filled out questionnaires regarding (i) hyperactivity/inattention, (ii) peer problems, (iii) school problems, (iv) internalizing problems, (v) antisocial behaviour, (vi) alcohol misuse, and (vii) drug misuse. All outcomes were controlled for symptoms of diagnostic categories other than ADHD.
   ResultsIncreasing levels of ADHD symptoms in childhood were associated with higher proportions of adolescents who displayed negative psychosocial outcomes. More girls than boys reported internalizing problems (all levels) and risky drug use (screen-intermediate and screen-positive only). More boys reported antisocial behaviour at the screen-negative and screen-intermediate levels, but at the screen-positive level, similar proportions of girls and boys displayed antisocial behaviour.
   ConclusionThe findings support the view that ADHD symptoms, as well as their negative outcomes, are dimensionally distributed in the population and that adolescent girls and boys display different risk profiles. The findings confirm that ADHD symptoms are associated with higher risk of drug misuse in girls.

AB This study used longitudinal survey and social network data covering sixth through ninth grades to test whether internalizing symptoms make early adolescents more prone to (1) exposure to and (2) influence by substance-using peers. Random effects regressions revealed that increases in symptoms were significantly associated with increases in the proportion of friends who used cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana; some associations weakened across grades. Event history models revealed that the effect of friends' smoking on smoking initiation decreased as internalizing symptoms increased; symptoms did not moderate the effects of friends' alcohol and marijuana use on alcohol and marijuana use initiation. These findings counter the influence hypothesis of the co-occurrence of internalizing symptoms with substance use and partly support the exposure hypothesis.

AB Growth mixture modeling was used to identify different trajectories of body mass index (BMI) among adolescents ages 10-15 from a national sample. Three distinct classes were found for both boys and girls: "normative" (90.9% and 89.7%), "high increasing" (6.3% and 7.4%), and "decreasing" (2.8% and 2.9%). Multinomial logistic regression identified family income as predictive of class membership for boys and pubertal status and being rural as predictive for girls. Parent-reported health was a common predictor across gender. Growth curves of internalizing symptoms and physical activity were modeled to explore trends across classes. Findings highlight complexities in the relations between BMI, internalizing symptoms, and physical activity in this developmental period.

AB Introduction:Children born very preterm display altered pain thresholds. Little is known about the neonatal clinical and psychosocial factors associated with their later pain perception.Objective:We aimed to examine whether the number of neonatal invasive procedures, adjusted for other clinical and psychosocial factors, was associated with self-ratings of pain during a blood collection procedure at school age in children born very preterm.Materials and Methods:56 children born very preterm (24 to 32 weeks gestational age), followed longitudinally from birth, and free of major neurodevelopmental impairments underwent a blood collection by venipuncture at age 7.5 years. The children's pain was self-reported using the Coloured Analog Scale and the Facial Affective Scale. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Pain exposure (the number of invasive procedures) and clinical factors from birth to term-equivalent age were obtained prospectively. Multiple linear regression was used to predict children's pain self-ratings from neonatal pain exposure after adjusting for neonatal clinical and concurrent psychosocial factors.Results:A greater number of neonatal invasive procedures and higher parent trait-anxiety were associated with higher pain intensity ratings during venipuncture at age 7.5 years. Fewer surgeries and lower concurrent child externalizing behaviors were associated with a higher pain intensity.Conclusions:In very preterm children, exposure to neonatal pain was related to altered pain self-ratings at school age, independent of other neonatal factors. Neonatal surgeries and concurrent psychosocial factors were also associated with pain ratings.

AB Purpose Few studies have addressed the psychological characteristics of adolescents with binge eating disorder (BED). No research has focused on the psychological functioning of these adolescents' parents or on the prevalence of traumatic experiences among them.
   Methods In this study, 202 adolescents aged 11-13 and their parents were recruited from mental health clinics to complete the youth self-report (YSR), the response evaluation measure for youth (REM-71), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Symptom Check-List (SCL-90-R), and the traumatic experience checklist (TEC).
   Results Female adolescents scored higher than males on withdrawal, internalizing problems, dissociation, and somatization subscales. Boys scored higher than girls on externalizing problems and acting out subscales. Maternal depression predicted withdrawal and dissociation in female adolescents. Maternal sexual abuse predicted social problems in males and self-destructive behaviors in females. Paternal physical abuse predicted delinquent behavior and acting out in males.
   Conclusions Our data suggest that parental traumatic experiences play a role in their offspring's mental health; the data also showed different psychopathological configurations in male and female adolescents with BED and their parents, suggesting the development of prevention and treatment polices specific to gender.

AB Lower family cohesion is associated with adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. However, there are likely individual differences in youth's responses to family processes. For example, adolescents higher in negative emotional reactivity, who often exhibit elevated physiological responsivity to context, may be differentially affected by family cohesion. We explored whether youth's negative emotional reactivity moderated the relation between family cohesion and youth's symptoms and tested whether findings were consistent with the diathesis-stress model or differential susceptibility hypothesis. Participants were 651 adolescents (M = 12.99.95 years old; 72% male) assessed at two time points (Time 1, ages 12-14; Time 2, age 16) in Pittsburgh, PA. At Time 1, mothers reported on family cohesion and youth reported on their negative emotional reactivity. At Time 2, youth reported on their symptoms. Among youth higher in negative emotional reactivity, lower family cohesion predicted higher symptoms than higher family cohesion, consistent with the diathesis-stress model.

AB This study aimed to shed further light on what is measured by self-, peer-, and daily diary reports of victimization in adolescence. First, the concordance between self-, peer-, and daily diary-reports of victimization was assessed. Participants were 188 Dutch adolescents (43% male, M-age = 16.07 years, SD =.84) who participated in a classroom assessment and daily diary assessment (5 consecutive school days). Peer-reports (15%) and self-reports (13%) yielded higher prevalence rates than diary-reports (3%). Second, associations of self- and peer-reported victimization with self-, peer-, and daily diary-reported internalizing problems were examined. Due to its low prevalence, diary-reported victimization could not be related to internalizing. The association of self- and peer-reported victimization with internalizing problems varied by informant (self- vs. peer-reported internalizing) and problem type (interpersonal vs. intrapersonal). Self- and peer-reported victimization were positively associated with daily internalizing affect. Results indicate that self-, peer-, and daily diary-reports tap into different aspects of victimization. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Background: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2) is a diagnostic instrument which forms part of the recommended "gold standard" for the assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), however raw scores are affected by age, development and language level. Standardized calibrated severity scores (CSS), unlike raw scores, provide a relative metric of the severity of autism-specific symptoms. A CSS has recently been developed for the ADOS-2 Toddler Module, which can be used in children aged 12-30 months. The utility of this new algorithm has yet to be examined in an independent sample, and few studies have examined the ADOS-2 as used by community practitioners, rather than in a research environment.
   Method: Total and domain standardized CSS for the ADOS-2 Toddler Module and Module 1 were examined in an independent, community based sample of 125 young children aged 20-47 months with a diagnosis of ASD, and in a comparison sample of children with nonspectrum diagnoses.
   Results: The CSS was more uniformly distributed when compared to raw scores across age and language groups, and less influenced by participant characteristics, including verbal DQ. Younger non-verbal participants returned higher CSS, suggestive of overlap with developmental and language level. Increased CSS in younger, nonverbal children may also reflect greater severity, thereby leading to earlier referral. The Child Behavior Checklist externalizing score emerged as an independent predictor of ASD symptom severity.
   Conclusions: These results offer tentative support for the introduction of the Toddler Module CSS into community practice; however caution in the interpretation of the score in younger, nonverbal children is urged. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Offspring of parents with chronic pain are at increased risk for pain and adverse mental and physical health outcomes (Higgins et al, 2015). Although the association between chronic pain in parents and offspring has been established, few studies have addressed why or how this relation occurs. Identifying mechanisms for the transmission of risk that leads to the development of chronic pain in offspring is important for developing preventive interventions targeted to decrease risk for chronic pain and related outcomes (eg, disability and internalizing symptoms). This review presents a conceptual model for the intergenerational transmission of chronic pain from parents to offspring with the goal of setting an agenda for future research and the development of preventive interventions. Our proposed model highlights 5 potential mechanisms for the relation between parental chronic pain and pediatric chronic pain and related adverse outcomes: (1) genetics, (2) alterations in early neurobiological development, (3) pain-specific social learning, (4), general parenting and family health, and (5) exposure to stressful environment. In addition, the model presents 3 potential moderators for the relation between parent and child chronic pain: (1) the presence of chronic pain in a second parent, (2) timing, course, and location of parental chronic pain, and (3) offspring's characteristics (ie, sex, developmental stage, race or ethnicity, and temperament). Such a framework highlights chronic pain as inherently familial and intergenerational, opening up avenues for new models of intervention and prevention that can be family centered and include at-risk children.

AB Exposure to violence is a widespread problem that affects the mental health of children and adolescents particularly in at-risk populations such as juvenile justice involved youth. While a number of studies have examined the cumulative impact of violence exposure, few studies have examined the importance of social context. The present study examined classifications of youth exposed to violence by contextual location (home, school, and neighborhood) in a sample of 2,124 juvenile justice involved youth. Latent class analysis revealed three classes of youth exposed to violence: (a) low violence exposure, (b) moderate and high home/school violence exposure, and (c) violence exposure in all three social contexts. Furthermore, distal outcomes analysis showed differences in internalizing and externalizing problems based on class membership. Findings from the current study underline the importance of understanding the role of social context in assessing violence exposure in juvenile justice involved youth.

AB Deficits in behavioral and cognitive regulation are prevalent in children reared in poverty relative to more affluent children due to the effects of adverse conditions on the developmental underpinnings of these skills. Despite evidence to suggest that these emergent processes are susceptible to environmental inputs, research documenting short-term intervention program influences on these regulatory domains in young impoverished children is limited. We sought to determine the proximal effects of a universal school-based intervention (the PATHS Curriculum) on social, emotional, relational, and cognitive outcomes in urban poor kindergarten children. Four schools in high-poverty neighborhoods with similar demographic characteristics were randomly assigned to either PATHS or an attentional control. Teacher-reported measures of behavior (e.g., attention, concentration, aggression), peer nominations (e.g., likability, aggression, acceptance), and tasks gauging inhibitory control were administered in the fall of kindergarten and again in the spring after one academic year (about 6 months) of PATHS. Children who received PATHS exhibited significantly greater improvements than control students across all teacher-rated behavioral measures of social competence (i.e., emotion regulation, prosocial behavior, peer relations) and behavioral problems (i.e., aggression, internalizing behaviors, impulsivity and hyperactivity) at post-test as well as improvements in motor inhibition. This line of research constitutes an important frontier for prevention research given the implications for improving ultimate outcomes for otherwise disadvantaged children.

DE Peer victimization; Mediation; Internalizing; Externalizing; Academic;
   Systematic review
AB Being accepted by peers is central to health and wellbeing among adolescents whereas being the subject of peer/bullying-victimization can be perceived as significant interpersonal stress, resulting in compromised adjustment concurrently and long-term. Unfortunately, little is known about mechanisms that explain why peer victimization goes "under the skin''. This systematic review aims to summarize the research on mediating pathways. A total of 65 articles were selected that explicitly examined mediation of associations between peer victimization in adolescence and concurrent and later outcomes. Most studies were based on North American and European samples and focused on internalizing or school-related outcomes. Mediation appears to be more stable by emotional states and symptoms than self-perceptions and attributions but results vary by outcome. Limitations concern the crosssectional design of most studies, geographic restriction, and widespread use of self-reports for assessments of exposure, mediator, and outcome.

AB Background: Recent findings has shown that late preterm births (gestational weeks 34-36) and early term births (gestational weeks 37-38) is associated with an increased risk of several psychological and developmental morbidities. In this article we investigate whether late preterm and early term births is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems at 36 months of age and whether there are gender differences in risk of these outcomes.
   Methods: Forty-three thousand, two hundred ninety-seven children and their mothers participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). One thousand, eight hundred fifty-three (4.3%) of the children in the sample were born late preterm and 7,835 (18.1%) were born early term. Information on gestational age and on prenatal and postnatal risk factors was retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Information on emotional and behavioral problems was assessed by standardized questionnaires (CBCL/ITSEA) filled out by the mothers. Gender-stratified logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between late preterm/early term and emotional and behavioral problems at 36 months of age.
   Results: We found a gender-specific increased risk of emotional problems in girls born late preterm (OR 1.47 95% CI 1.11-1.95) and in girls born early term (OR 1.21 95% CI 1.04-1.42). We did not find an increased risk of emotional problems in boys born late preterm (OR 1.09 95% CI 0.82-1.45) or early term (OR 0.93 95% CI 0.79-1.10). Behavioral problems were not increased in children born late preterm or early term.
   Conclusion: Girls born late preterm and early term show an increased risk of emotional problems at 36 months of age. This finding suggests that gender should be taken into account when evaluating children born at these gestational ages.

AB The longitudinal pathways connecting physical abuse and substance use in child welfare-involved adolescents, a population with multiple risk factors for substance use problems, remain unclear. This study examined the relation between self-reported physical abuse among adolescents investigated by Child Protective Services (CPS) and later substance use, with a particular focus on exposure to physical abuse after CPS investigation as a potential contributing factor to this relation. Using data from the first National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW-I), a path analysis was conducted on a sample of 1079 adolescents aged 11-15 years who had recently been investigated by CPS. At baseline and 18-month follow-up, youths self-reported past-year physical abuse using the Parent-Child Conflicts Tactic Scale and past 30-day substance use frequency. At baseline, youths self-reported current internalizing and externalizing problems to the Youth Self Report. Path analysis revealed no significant relation between physical abuse at baseline and substance use at 18 months. Physical abuse at baseline was associated with higher levels of concurrent substance use and externalizing problems, which in turn predicted higher substance use at 18 months. Furthermore, physical abuse and externalizing problems at baseline predicted physical abuse at 18 months, which in turn was related to higher substance use at 18 months. The findings suggest that physical abuse after CPS investigation contributes to the development of adolescent substance use behaviors. Results indicate a need for innovative efforts to prevent physical abuse after CPS investigation, as well as assessment and treatment of substance use and externalizing problems at the point of investigation, to reduce future substance use in child welfare-involved adolescents.

AB Background: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), particularly n-3 LCPUFA, play a central role in neuronal growth and the development of the human brain. Fish is the main dietary source of n-3 LCPUFA. To assess the relation between fish consumption, estimated dietary n-3 LCPUFA intake and cognition and behaviour in childhood in a multi-centre European sample.
   Methods: Children from 2 European studies, CHOP and NUHEAL, were assessed at 8 and 7.5 years of age, respectively. Different outcomes of neuropsychological development (assessed with the standardized NUTRIMENTHE Neuropsychological Battery (NNB) consisting of 15 subtests) were related with outcomes from a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) focussing on the consumption of fish.
   Results: A total of 584 children completed the FFQ and the neuropsychological tests. We found no associations with calculated DHA or EPA intakes for any of the neuropsychological domains. Children who consumed 2 fish meals per week including one of fatty fish, showed no substantive differences in the cognitive domains from the children who did not. However negative associations with fatty fish consumption were found for social problems (p = 0.019), attention problems (p = 0.012), rule-breaking problems (p = 0.019) and aggressive behaviour problems (p = 0.032). No association was observed with internalizing problems. Higher levels of externalizing problems (p = 0.018) and total problems (p = 0.018) were associated with eating less fatty fish.
   Conclusions: Children who consumed 2 fish meals per week including one of fatty fish were less likely to show emotional and behavioural problems than those who did not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.

AB Heart rate variability has received growing attention in the depression literature, with several recent meta-analyses indicating that lower resting heart rate variability is associated with depression. However, the role of fluctuations in heart rate variability (or reactivity) in response to stress in depression remains less clear. The present review provides a systematic examination of the literature on heart rate variability reactivity to a laboratory-induced stressor task and depression, including 26 studies of reactivity in heart rate variability and clinical depression, remitted (or history of) depression, and subthreshold depression (or symptom-level depression) among adults, adolescents, and children. In addition to reviewing the findings of these studies, methodological considerations and conceptual gaps in the literature are addressed. We conclude by highlighting the importance of investigating the potential transactional relationship between heart rate variability reactivity and depression and possible mechanisms underlying this relationship.

AB Purpose of the research: Burgeoning evidence that modifiable parental factors can influence children's and adolescents' risk for depression and anxiety indicates that parents can play a crucial role in prevention of these disorders in their children. However, it remains unclear whether preventive interventions that are directed primarily at the parent (Le. where the parent receives more than half of the intervention) are effective in reducing child internalizing (including both depression and anxiety) problems in the longer term.
   Principal results: Compared to a range of comparison conditions, parenting interventions reduced child internalizing problems, at a minimum of 6 months after the intervention was delivered. Mean effects were very small for measures of internalizing and depressive symptoms, and small for measures of anxiety symptoms. Pooled effects for anxiety diagnoses were significant and indicated a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. Pooled effects for depression diagnoses approached significance but suggested a NNT of 11. These results were based on effects reported at the longest follow-up interval for each included study, which ranged from 6 months up to 15 years for internalizing measures, 5.5 years for depressive measures, and 11 years for anxiety measures.
   Major conclusions: Our findings underscore the likely benefits of increasing parental involvement in preventing internalizing problems, particularly anxiety problems, in young people. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parental belief systems can strongly influence children's affect, behavior, and mental health. However, associations between specific kinds of parental beliefs and children's mental health have not been thoroughly explored. One relevant belief system is parental intelligence mindset: beliefs about the malleability of intelligence. Children of parents who view intelligence as static (known as a fixed intelligence mindset), rather than malleable through effort (known as a growth intelligence mindset), experience more academic, self-regulatory, and motivational difficulty. However, associations between parental intelligence mindset and child mental health problems are unclear. Accordingly, we tested whether parents' intelligence mindsets related to internalizing problems in their children (N = 131, ages 5-8). Overall, parents with stronger fixed intelligence mindsets had children with greater internalizing problems, particularly social anxiety (characterized by fear of negative evaluation). Results further revealed that parents' fixed intelligence mindsets were associated with overall internalizing problems and depressive symptoms in boys, but not girls. Results are the first to suggest and parse direct links between parents' intelligence mindsets and youth internalizing problems.

AB Finding fit between work and family responsibilities is challenging for parents, especially when raising a child with mental health difficulties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of children's problematic behaviors to maternal employment and difficulty combining work and family obligations. Data were analyzed from 174 mothers parenting a child with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who completed child problem behavior (child behavior checklist), family functioning, and employment measures at baseline and 12 months later. Results from logistic regression analysis indicated that children's problematic behaviors predicted maternal employment. Structural equation modeling showed that children's higher baseline scores on the child behavior checklist internalizing scale were related to difficulty combining work and family at 12 months, even after controlling for difficulty of combining work and family at baseline. Children's externalizing scores were not found to predict difficulty combining work and family responsibilities. Further analysis did not confirm mediation between children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors, family conflict, and difficulty combining work and family. Given these results, service providers need to more comprehensively address the intersection of children's mental health difficulties and work-family fit in order to better support caregivers as parents and employees.

AB Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a complex developmental disorder with serious medical, cognitive and emotional symptoms across the lifespan. This genetic deletion also imparts a lifetime risk for developing schizophrenia that is 25-30 times that of the general population. The origin of this risk is multifactorial and may include dysregulation of the stress response and immunological systems in relation to brain development. Vitamin D is involved in brain development and neuroprotection, gene transcription, immunological regulation and influences neuronal signal transduction. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with schizophrenia, depression and anxiety in the general population. Yet, little is known about how vitamin D levels in children with 22q11.2DS could mediate risk of psychosis in adulthood. Blood plasma levels of vitamin D were measured in children aged 7-16 years with (n=11) and without (n=16) 22q11.2DS in relation to parent reports of children's anxiety and atypicality. Anxiety and atypicality in childhood are risk indicators for the development of schizophrenia in those with 22q11.2DS and the general population. Children with 22q11.2DS had lower vitamin D levels, as well as elevated anxiety and atypicality compared with typical peers. Higher levels of anxiety, depression and internalizing problems but not atypicality were associated with lower levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D insufficiency may relate to higher levels of anxiety and depression, in turn contributing to the elevated risk of psychosis in this population. Further study is required to determine casual linkages between anxiety, stress, mood and vitamin D in children with 22q11.2DS.

AB Two studies with two independent samples aimed to investigate whether repetitive thinking about negative affect (RTna) and repetitive thinking about mother (RTm) can be mechanisms in the association between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms in middle childhood. In Study 1 (N = 381) and Study 2 (N = 157) 9- to 12-year-olds completed self-report questionnaires measuring attachment, RTna and depressive symptoms. In Study 2, additionally, a questionnaire was developed to measure RTm, and a compound score for self- and mother-reported depressive symptoms was calculated. Results showed positive associations between attachment anxiety, RTna and RTm, and self-reported depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms agreed upon by mother and child. RTna and RTm mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and these depressive symptoms. RTm mediated this relationship even beyond RTna for the multi-informant compound score. Thus, RTna and RTm seem to be independent mechanisms explaining the association between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms in middle childhood.

AB This study aimed to examine the long-term prediction of well-being and internalizing symptoms from trajectories of externalizing behavior problems in 921 children from a population-based sample. We found that a high stable trajectory of externalizing behavior from infancy (age 1.5) to mid-adolescence (age 14.5) predicted lower scores on life satisfaction and flourishing for both girls and boys (age 18.5). The high stable trajectory also predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in boys and anxiety symptoms in girls (age 18.5). The findings are noteworthy as they document how a person-oriented study of externalizing behavior problems starting in infancy can predict well-being and internalizing in late adolescence. The findings underline the importance of early health promotion and problem intervention efforts.

AB Objective: Co-occurrence of mental disorders is commonly observed, but the etiology underlying this observation is poorly understood. Studies in adolescents and adults have identified a general psychopathology factor associated with a high risk for different psychiatric disorders. We defined a multi-informant general psychopathology factor in school-aged children and estimated its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability. The goal was to test the hypothesis that child behavioral and emotional problems are under the influence of highly pleiotropic common autosomal genetic variants that nonspecifically increase the risk for different dimensions of psychopathology.
   Method: Children from the Generation R cohort were repeatedly assessed between ages 6 to 8 years. Child behavior problems were reported by parents, teachers, and children. Confirmatory factor analysis estimated a general psychopathology factor across informants using various psychiatric problem scales. Validation of the general psychopathology factor was based on IQ and temperamental measures. Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate the SNP heritability (N = 2,115).
   Results: The general psychopathology factor was associated with lower IQ, higher negative affectivity, and lower effortful control, but not with surgency. Importantly, the general psychopathology factor showed a significant SNP heritability of 38% (SE = 0.16, p = .008).
   Conclusion: Common autosomal SNPs are pleiotropically associated with internalizing, externalizing, and other child behavior problems, and underlie a general psychopathology factor in childhood.

AB Within the expectancy-value framework, much work has been done linking expectancies and task values to academic outcomes such as performance, persistence, and choice. Research on the associations between student motivation ( including efficacy and task values) and behavioral and emotional problems, however, is nascent. The present study examined a structural equation model using efficacy, utility value, attainment value, and cost to predict internalizing risk and hyperactivity-distractibility risk within a sample of 5,126 high school students (76.5% African American) in a high-needs school district. The results indicated that efficacy negatively predicted both domains of risk, attainment value negatively predicted hyperactivity-distractibility risk only, and cost positively predicted both domains of risk. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed, including the relative importance of cost in the prediction of behavioral and emotional risk.

AB Negative life events (NLE) contribute to anxiety and depression disorders, but their relationship with brain functioning in adolescence has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that neural response to social threat would relate to NLE in the frontal-limbic emotional regions. Participants (N = 685) were drawn from the Imagen database of 14-year-old community adolescents recruited in schools. They underwent functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the 'distress', 'family' and 'accident' subscales from a life event dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with anxiety or depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also investigated. Lifetime 'distress' positively correlated with ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex activations during angry face processing. 'Distress' scores correlated with the probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime 'family' and 'accident' scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs differentially predicted neural responses to threat during adolescence, and differentially predicted a de novo internalizing condition 2 years later. The deleterious effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested.

AB Offspring from families with multiple cases of alcohol dependence have a greater likelihood of developing alcohol dependence and related substance use disorders. Greater susceptibility for these disorders may be related to cerebellar morphology. Because posterior regions of the cerebellum are associated with cognitive abilities, we investigated whether high-risk offspring would display regionally specific differences in cerebellar morphology and whether these would be related to working memory performance. The relationship to externalizing and internalizing psychopathology was of interest because cerebellar morphology has previously been associated with a cognitive affective syndrome. A total of 131 participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with volumes of the cerebellar lobes obtained with manual tracing. These individuals were from high-risk (HR) for alcohol dependence families (N = 72) or from low-risk (LR) control families (N = 59). All were enrolled in a longitudinal follow-up that included repeated clinical assessments during childhood and young-adulthood prior to the scan that provided information on Axis I psychopathology. The Working Memory Index of the Wechsler Memory Scale was given at the time of the scan. Larger volumes of the corpus medullare and inferior posterior lobes and poorer working memory performance were found for the HR offspring relative to LR controls. Across all subjects, a significant positive association between working memory and total volume of corpus of the cerebellum was seen, controlling for familial risk. Presence of an internalizing or externalizing disorder interacting with familial risk was also associated with volume of the corpus medullare.

AB Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) provides effective evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with emotional and behaviour problems. Also consistent across meta-analyses is the observation that CBT treatment effects are often medium in size. This observation has instigated a search for factors that could help explain the limited treatment effects and that could be focused upon to enhance CBT treatment outcomes. The current qualitative review focuses on the parent-child attachment relationship as one factor that could be relevant to enhance CBT treatment effects. This review first acknowledges reasons why CBT has historically not been attracted to attachment theory and its postulates. Second, recent evidence is examined to evaluate whether attachment can be approached from a cognitive schema perspective. Subsequently, research is described showing how restoring attachment relationships could result in large treatment effects. Finally, this evidence is integrated in a model of attachment assessment and intervention that might be compatible with CBT. In sum, this review suggests that restoring trust in insecure parent-child attachment relationships can be integrated within CBT and could contribute to its treatment outcomes.

AB Background: There is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from panic disorder (PD).
   Goal: This study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental loss/separation, psychological disorders, and maternal and paternal attachment.
   Method: Twenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 20 with adult panic disorder (PD), 11 with adult comorbid GAD and PD, and 21 adult non-anxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood. Participants also reported on parental attachment, loss and separation.
   Results: Childhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as well as from each other, suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity. Compared to controls, specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups, and childhood depression, social phobia, and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD. Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls. However, higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment (e.g., no memory of early childhood experiences and balancing/forgiving current state of mind) emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD. There were no group differences in parental loss or separation.
   Conclusions: These results support differentiation of GAD and PD based on developmental risk factors. Recommendations for future research and implications of the findings for understanding the etiology and symptomatology of GAD and PD are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the relation between family functioning and classroom problem behavior of children with emotional and behavioral disorders receiving special educational support. To this end, the Teachers' Report Form and the Family Questionnaire were completed for 84 children (M age of 9.8 years) 2 times with a time lag of 11 months. Cross-lagged path analyses showed that internalizing and externalizing problem behavior in the classroom were stable over time, just as poor family functioning. Continuity of (a) poor communication, (b) discordant partner relationship, and (c) lack of social support were strongly associated with future total problem behavior in the classroom. Furthermore, parental responsiveness to a child's needs was associated with lower future total problem behavior. A direct association was also found between externalizing behavior in the classroom and future poor family functioning. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

Sixty children (9-12 years old) completed questionnaires on attachment and depressive symptoms. Skin conductance level (SCL) was measured across three conditions: an emotionally neutral baseline condition, a negative mood induction condition, and a positive mood induction condition. SCL variability (SCLV) was calculated as the intraindividual variation across these conditions expressing the extent to which children are biologically sensitive to positive and negative emotional information. Results showed that SCLV moderated the association between depressive symptoms and attachment anxiety. Attachment anxiety was only linked with depressive symptoms when children showed more SCLV, suggesting that attachment anxiety is only a risk factor for children who are biologically sensitive to respond to emotional information. SCLV did not moderate the association between depressive symptoms and attachment avoidance. Instead, a significant correlation was found between attachment avoidance and SCLV, which replicated previous research and might be caused by more avoidantly attached children's unsuccessful attempts to suppress emotional reactions.

AB Impaired empathy is associated with a variety of psychiatric conditions; however, little is known about the differential relations between certain forms of psychopathology and cognitive and affective empathy in adolescent girls and boys. The aim of this study was to examine the relations between externalizing and internalizing disorders and cognitive and affective empathy, respectively, while controlling for covariance among different forms of psychopathology, separately in girls and boys. A total of 507 inpatient adolescents (319 girls and 188 boys) in the age range of 12-17 years completed the Basic Empathy Scale that measures affective and cognitive empathy. The Youth Self-Report Form and Child Behavior Checklist were used to assess the severity of psychopathological symptoms. Results demonstrated that affective and cognitive empathy were negatively associated with conduct problems only in girls, but not in boys. Affective empathy was positively related to internalizing problems observed by parents and youths and self-reported ADHD symptoms in girls and boys. The clinical implications of these differential relationships for externalizing versus internalizing symptoms and empathy are discussed.

AB Youth placed in out-of-home care are at significant risk of low academic achievement and poor mental health. Few studies have considered the potential effects of school-related factors, such as school placement stability and school engagement, on youth outcomes.
   The current study examined the potential main effects of school placement stability and engagement on academic achievement and mental health. Furthermore, we examined whether school-related factors moderated the association between home placement stability and youth outcomes.
   Participants included 420 youth (age 6-14 at baseline) placed in out-of-home care participating in a national longitudinal study of youth in contact with the child welfare system. Youth, caregivers, and caseworkers provided relevant information at baseline, 18, and 36 months. Hierarchical regression models were constructed to test potential main and moderating effects of school engagement and school placement stability on youth mental health and academic achievement prospectively, while accounting for relevant covariates.
   School placement stability was an independent predictor of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but was not significantly associated with academic outcomes. Furthermore, there were no main effects of school engagement or home placement stability on youth outcomes and school-related factors did not moderate the relationship between home placement stability and youth outcomes.
   For children and adolescents who do not have the benefit of a stable, safe, or caring home environment, school stability may be contribute to an environment that can foster healthy development.

AB The current study investigated gender differences in the main components of antisocial behavior in an at-risk versus an offender group of adolescents. One-hundred and forty-three adolescents divided into two different risk groups [at risk (n = 54) and offenders (n = 89)] were compared according to gender (111 boys and 32 girls). Externalizing symptoms were assessed with the Delinquent and Aggressive subscales of the Youth Self-report Questionnaire, internalizing problems with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depressive Inventory and personality traits with the Barratt-Impulsiveness Scale as well as the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. Results revealed a consistent interaction pattern, with girls presenting higher levels of externalizing symptoms, more motor impulsivity and a more arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style than boys in the at-risk group. In contrast, in the offenders' group, psychopathic traits were more present in boys than in girls. Regarding internalizing problems, girls showed more depression than boys, independently of the risk group. Among offending youths, girls present equally severe externalizing problems, and problematic personality traits as boys. At-risk girls have the highest rates of difficulties across the tested domains and should therefore be specifically targeted for prevention and intervention.

AB Introduction: Motor stereotypies represent a typical example of the difficulty in distinguishing non-clinical behaviors (physiological and transient) from symptoms or among different disorders [primary stereotypies, associated with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities, genetic syndromes, and sensory impairment]. The aim of this study was to obtain an accurate assessment on the relationship between stereotypies and neurodevelopmental disorders.
   Methods: We studied 23 children (3 girls), aged 36-95 months, who requested a consultation due to the persistence or increased severity of motor stereotypies. None of the patients had a previous diagnosis of ASD. The assessment included the Motor Severity Stereotypy Scale (MSSS), the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), the Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices, the Child Behavior CheckList for ages 1-5 or 4-18 (CBCL), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-second edition (ADOS 2).
   Results: All patients were showing motor stereotypies for periods of time varying from 6 to 77 months. The MSSS showed that each child had a limited number of stereotypies; their frequency and intensity were mild. The interference of stereotypies was variable; the impairment in daily life was mild. The RBS-R scores were positive for the subscale of stereotypic behaviors in all children. Moreover, several children presented other repetitive behaviors, mainly ritualistic behavior and sameness behavior. All patients showed a normal cognitive level. The CBCL evidenced behavioral problems in 22% of the children: internalizing problems, attention, and withdrawn were the main complaints. On the SRS, all but one of the tested patients obtained clinical scores in the clinical range for at least one area. On the ADOS 2, 4 patients obtained scores indicating a moderate level of ASD symptoms, 4 had a mild level, and 15 showed no or minimal signs of ASD.
   Discussion: Motor stereotypies in children with normal cognitive level represent a challenging diagnostic issue for which a finely tailored assessment is mandatory in order to define a precise developmental profile. Thus, careful and cautious use of standardized tests is warranted to avoid misdiagnosis. Furthermore, it is hard to consider motor stereotypies, even the primary ones, exclusively as a movement disorder.

AB Background: Although some studies examined the moderating role of gender in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and mental disorders later in life, a number of them examined the effects of only one or two types of maltreatment on an individual mental disorder, for instance, depression, substance use. It is of considerable clinical and theoretical importance to have in-depth understanding what roles of different types of childhood abuse play out in a wide range of mental disorders among women and men using well accepted instruments measuring abuse and mental disorders. The present study aimed to examine this issue using a large nationally representative population sample to explore the gender effect of different types of childhood abuse in mental disorders, and assess the moderating role of gender in the abuse-mental disorder relationship.
   Methods: Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012: Mental Health we sought to answer this question. Respondents with information on childhood maltreatment prior to age 16 were selected (N = 23, 395).
   Results: We found: i) strong associations between childhood abuse frequency and gender; ii) significant differences between men and women in terms of mental disorders; iii) strong associations between childhood abuse and mental disorders; and, iv) gender moderated the role of childhood abuse history on adulthood mental disorders. Females with a history of sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence were at a greater risk of alcohol abuse or dependence later in life.
   Conclusions: Intervention should occur as early as possible, and should help female victims of childhood sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence, and their families to build more constructive ways to effectively reduce the negative affects of these experiences. Recognition of the moderating role of gender on the relationship between childhood abuse history and mental disorders later in life may aid clinicians and researchers in providing optimal health services.

AB Background: Paternal depression has been associated with suboptimal developmental outcomes in offspring. We sought to systematically review the research evidence from prospective studies for an association between paternal depression and child adolescent emotional and behavioral outcomes. We also reviewed potential mediators of this association and sources of methodological bias.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Psy-cINFO and Google Scholar. Reference lists of the included papers were also searched.
   Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the review. Findings suggested that paternal depression does negatively impact upon offspring development. This impact is observable when paternal depression is present in the antenatal and postnatal stages and during offspring adolescence. The strength of this association is strongly reliant upon a number of contextual mediators, namely; paternal negative expressiveness, hostility and involvement and marital conflict. A quality assessment rating showed the studies were relatively strong methodologically.
   Limitations: Heterogeneity regarding method of assessment and the magnitude and timing of exposure hinder attempts to make strong conclusions regarding the trajectory of paternal depression and its effects on child and adolescent outcomes.
   Conclusions: Paternal mental health screening during pregnancy is necessary in order to identify and prevent depression negatively impacting offspring functioning. Including both parents in this process should encourage the alleviation of the environmental mediators which dominate the negative association outlined within the review. Research examining gene-environment interaction is necessary to uncover more accurate details regarding paternal depression and subsequent offspring vulnerability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is extensive scientific evidence of the serious psychological and social effects that peer victimization may have on students, among them internalizing problems such as anxiety or negative self-esteem, difficulties related to low self-efficacy and lower levels of social adjustment. Although a direct relationship has been observed between victimization and these effects, it has not yet been analyzed whether there is a relationship of interdependence between all these measures of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between victimization and difficulties related to social adjustment among high school students. To do so, various explanatory models were tested to determine whether psychological adjustment (negative self-esteem, social anxiety and social self-efficacy) could play a mediating role in this relationship, as suggested by other studies on academic adjustment. The sample comprised 2060 Spanish high school students (47.9% girls; mean age = 14.34). The instruments used were the scale of victimization from European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, the negative scale from Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents and a general item about social self-efficacy, all of them self-reports. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results confirmed the partial mediating role of negative self-esteem, social anxiety and social self-efficacy between peer victimization and social adjustment and highlight the importance of empowering victimized students to improve their self-esteem and self efficacy and prevent social anxiety. Such problems lead to the avoidance of social interactions and social reinforcement, thus making it difficult for these students to achieve adequate social adjustment.

AB Connections between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are considered critical for the expression and regulation of emotional behavior. Abnormalities in frontoamygdala circuitry are reported across several internalizing conditions and associated risk factors (for example, childhood trauma), which may underlie the strong phenotypic overlap and co-occurrence of internalizing conditions. However, it is unclear if these findings converge on the same localized areas of mPFC or adjacent anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Examining 46 resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies of internalizing conditions or risk factors (for example, early adversity and family history), we conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of frontoamygdala circuitry. We included all reported amygdala to frontal coordinate locations that fell within a liberal anatomically defined frontal mask. Peak effects across studies were centered in two focal subareas of the ACC: pregenual (pgACC) and subgenual (sgACC). Using publicly available maps and databases of healthy individuals, we found that observed subareas have unique connectivity profiles, patterns of neural co-activation across a range of neuropsychological tasks, and distribution of tasks spanning various behavioral domains within peak regions, also known as 'functional fingerprints'. These results suggest disruptions in unique amygdala-ACC subcircuits across internalizing, genetic and environmental risk studies. Based on functional characterizations and the studies contributing to each peak, observed amygdala-ACC subcircuits may reflect separate transdiagnostic neural signatures. In particular, they may reflect common neurobiological substrates involved in developmental risk (sgACC), or the broad expression of emotional psychopathology (pgACC) across disease boundaries.

AB Poor cognitive control is associated with nearly every mental disorder and has been proposed as a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, including depression and anxiety. What specific mechanisms might cause individuals with poor cognitive control to experience higher levels of psychopathology? The current research tests a new process model linking poor cognitive control to depression and anxiety symptoms via increased dependent stress (i.e., self-generated stressors) and subsequent rumination. This model was supported across two studies in youth during the key period for emergence of internalizing psychopathology. Study 1 provides longitudinal evidence for prospective prediction of change in symptoms. Study 2 confirms this model using well-established executive function tasks in a cross-sectional study. These findings have potential implications for understanding why cognitive control impairments may be broadly associated with psychopathology and suggest that interventions to prevent stress generation might be effective in preventing negative consequences of poor cognitive control.

AB Objective Many studies that document child outcomes in the context of parental HIV - which has been established as a risk factor for child development - focus on older children/adolescents. Studies also concentrate on the status of the primary caregiver, not other household members who might be infected.
   Design This study examined the effects of caregiver and household HIV on child development (413 years) in South Africa and Malawi (2011-2014).
   Methods Data were gathered from 989 children and their primary caregivers at baseline and repeated at 12-15 months follow-up (86.5% follow-up rate). Only caregivers of a single child and caregiver/child dyads without missing data were included, providing a sample of 808 dyads for analysis. Children were divided into three groups according to caregiver-reported HIV burden: having an HIV-positive primary caregiver (19.8%), having HIV in the household (14.2%) or no HIV (66%).
   Results The HIV burden was positively associated with an array of negative child outcomes, often mediated by caregiver depression levels. Family HIV burden at baseline affected child behavioural problems at follow-up indirectly through carer depression (B = 0.02; CI = 0.003, 0.06). Internalizing (B = 0.02; CI = 0.002, 0.05) and externalizing problems at follow-up (B = 0.01; CI = 0.0002, 0.03) were also indirectly affected by family HIV burden through caregiver depression.
   Conclusions The data suggest that family HIV can affect child development, emphasizing the important role of depression in the pathway to such an effect. Community-based interventions directed at alleviating parental depression in the presence of HIV may help to interrupt the cycle of family HIV and adverse child outcomes.

AB This study examined whether prenatal reflective functioning (RF) was related to mothers' interactive style across contexts with their 6-month-old infants (M age = 6.02 months, SD = 0.41, 54% boys), and to what extent quality of prenatal RF could account for the influence of accumulated risk on maternal interactive behavior. Accumulated risk was defined as the sum-score of a selection of risk factors that have been associated with suboptimal infant development. Mother-infant dyads (N = 133) were observed during free play, two teaching tasks, and the Still-Face Paradigm (SFP). Better prenatal RF was associated with more positive maternal behavior in all settings and less negative behavior during teaching and SFP reengagement. Accumulated risk and prenatal RF predicted shared variance in maternal interactive behavior (with unique predictive effects observed only for RF on sensitivity during teaching and SFP play, and for accumulated risk on sensitivity and positive engagement during SFP play, and internalizing-helplessness during SFP reengagement). Accumulated risk had an indirect effect on maternal sensitivity during teaching and SFP play through prenatal RF. These findings suggest not only that RF may be targeted prenatally to improve mother-infant interactions, but also that enhancing RF skills may ameliorate some of the negative consequences from more stable perinatal risk factors that influence parent-child interactions.

AB The association between exposure to maltreatment during childhood or adolescence and subsequent delinquent or offending behaviors has been repeatedly documented in the scientific literature. Despite this, the nature of this relationship remains unclear and, in particular, whether problematic behavior arises directly as a result of the maltreatment, other co-existing risk factors or an interaction between maltreatment and these risk factors. This systematic review aims to organize evidence on this topic in relation to an ecological perspective that encompasses the multi-faceted nature of the maltreatment-offending association. A final pool of 62 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Results and discussion are organized according to four main sections: taxonomic categories-of maltreatment (e.g., the type or timing of abuse, as well as how welfare involvement or placement in out-of-home care influences outcomes), individual risk factors (e.g., emotional and behavioral problems), social risk factors (e.g., characteristics of the family, parents and peers), and contextual risk factors (e.g., neighborhood characteristics). As consistent with ecological theory, a multitude of factors contribute to the maltreatment offending association. The application of a conceptual framework to guide future research and treatment is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bullying perpetration and peer victimization has long been considered an important social and clinical problem. Children and adolescents who are bullied are at increased risk for mental health problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-esteem and bullying behavior (i.e. perpetration and peer victimization) using meta-analytic procedures. Online databases up to June 2014 were searched, and bibliographies of retrieved studies were examined, for studies that examined the association between self-esteem and bullying perpetration/peer victimization in children and adolescents. From an original pool of 936 studies, 121 non duplicated studies were identified that met criteria for inclusion. Possible moderators (e.g. age, source of bullying assessment, year of publication, etc.) were also examined. In the analyses, using a random-effects model, it was found that peer victimization is negatively associated with self-esteem, with a mean effect size of r = -0.27. A negative but trivial association was also found (r = -0.07) between bullying behavior and self-esteem. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias. The implications of the meta-analytic findings for future research on bullying perpetration and peer victimization prevention are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the associations among gestational factors including prenatal marijuana exposure (PME), child behavior at age 3, early age of onset of marijuana use (EAOM, <15 years), and adult roles at 22 years. Participants were drawn from the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development (MHPCD) Project, a longitudinal study of prenatal substance exposure in offspring who have been studied for over 22 years since the prenatal phase. Data from the prenatal, birth, 3-, and 22-year phases (N = 608) were used in the present study. Age of onset of offspring substance use was determined based on data from the 14-, 16-, and 22-year phases. The subjects were of lower socioeconomic status, 43% were Caucasian and the remaining were African-American, and 48% were males. Early childhood behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) related to EAOM after controlling for PME, birth and childhood environmental risk factors, and Conduct Disorder. EAOM was significantly associated with negative adult roles including increased risk of being arrested (p < 0.001), lower educational attainment (p < 0.001), having a child without being married (p < 0.05), and unemployment at 22 years (p < 0.001). The correlations between PME and negative adult roles and between early childhood behavior and negative adult roles were also statistically significant. Pathway analysis demonstrated that EAOM significantly mediated the associations between PME and fulfillment of adult roles and between early childhood behavior and adult roles. There are a number of intervention points that could be targeted that would have a long-term impact on lowering the probability of EAOM and less success in adult roles.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between a history of childhood abuse and mental health problems in juveniles who sexually offended (JSOs) over and above general offending behavior.
   Methods: A sample of 44 JSOs incarcerated in two juvenile detention centers in the Netherlands between May 2008 and March 2014 were examined for childhood abuse history (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form) and mental health problems (Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2). Furthermore, the connection between childhood abuse and mental health problems in JSOs was compared to a sample of 44 propensity score matched juveniles who offended non-sexually (non-JSOs).
   Results: In JSOs, sexual abuse was related to anger problems, suicidal ideation, and thought disturbance. These associations were significantly stronger in JSOs than in non-JSOs.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the relationship between childhood abuse and both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems is of more salience for understanding sexual offending than non-sexual offending, and should, therefore, be an important focus in the assessment and treatment of JSOs.

AB This study examined risk factors for behavioral and emotional problems in 1973 siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Results revealed six correlates of sibling internalizing and externalizing problems: male gender, smaller family size, older age of the child with ASD, lower family income, child with ASD behavior problems, and sibling Broader Autism Phenotype. Siblings with few risk factors were at low risk for behavioral and emotional problems. However, siblings with many risk factors were at increased risk for both internalizing and externalizing problems. These results highlight the need to assess risk for individual siblings to best identify a sub-population of siblings who may be in need of additional support.

AB Objectives: Prior research on the relationship between early adversity and adult chronic disease has often relied on retrospective reports of a limited range of exposures and has not considered childhood psychological distress as a mediator. We investigate whether distress in childhood is one pathway by which early social disadvantage leads to greater cardiometabolic risk in middle adulthood.
   Methods: Data are from the 1958 British Birth Cohort study (sample n = 6027). We created an early social disadvantage index based on 16 exposures related to family and socioeconomic hardship from birth to age 7. Childhood psychological distress was ascertained from internalizing and externalizing symptoms at ages 7, 11, and 16 years. Cardiometabolic risk was assessed with a Z-standardized score derived from 9 immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic biomarkers measured at age 45. We used linear regression models and formal tests of mediation to assess relationships between disadvantage, distress, and subsequent cardiometabolic risk.
   Results: Higher social disadvantage predicted increased adult cardiometabolic risk (beta = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.03-0.07). Mediation analyses revealed a significant direct (path c'; beta = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.01-0.05) and indirect (path ab; beta = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.01-0.02) effect of social disadvantage on cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for potential confounders. Child psychological distress accounted for 37% (95% CI = 34-46%) of the observed association.
   Conclusions: Results suggest childhood distress may be one factor on the pathway linking early disadvantage to higher risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. Such results may point to the importance of blocking the translation of psychosocial to biological risk during a potentially sensitive developmental window.

AB Purpose: The primary objective was to use isotemporal substitution models to estimate whether replacing time spent in sedentary video games (SVGs) and active outdoor play (AOP) with active video games (AVGs) would be associated with changes in youth's mental health.
   Methods: A representative sample of 20,122 Canadian youth in Grades 6-10 was studied. The exposure variables were average hours/day spent playing AVGs, SVGs, and AOP. The outcomes consisted of a negative and internalizing mental health indicator (emotional problems), a positive and internalizing mental health indicator (life satisfaction), and a positive and externalizing mental health indicator (prosocial behavior). Isotemporal substitution models estimated the extent to which replacing time spent in SVGs and AOP with an equivalent amount of time in AVGs had on the mental health indicators.
   Results: Replacing 1 hour/day of SVGs with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval: 3%-9%) reduced probability of high emotional problems, a 4% (2%-7%) increased probability of high life satisfaction, and a 13% (9%-16%) increased probability of high prosocial behavior. Replacing 1 hour/day of AOP with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 7% (3%-11%) increased probability of high emotional problems, a 3% (1%-5%) reduced probability of high life satisfaction, and a 6% (2%-9%) reduced probability of high prosocial behavior.
   Conclusions: Replacing SVGs with AVGs was associated with more preferable mental health indicators. Conversely, replacing AOP with AVGs was associated with more deleterious mental health indicators. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB We report findings of a convergent validity study examining the internalizing subscale (SRSS-I6) of the Student Risk Screening Scale for Internalizing and Externalizing (SRSS-IE) with the internalizing subscale of the Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991). Participants included 227 sixth-through 12th-grade students from nine schools across two states. Results of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves suggest the following cut scores for the SRSS-I6 for middle and high school students: 0-3 (low risk), 4-5 (moderate risk), and 6-18 (high risk) for internalizing behavior patterns, relative to the internalizing subscale of the TRF subscale. We conclude with a discussion of the findings and illustrations of how to use screening scale scores for decision making in a tiered system of supports, offering limitations and future directions for consideration.

AB Child-centered recruitment via Family Finding has gained national attention as an approach to search, discover, and engage kin and fictive kin to support the attachment and permanency needs of children in foster care. However, despite its promise it has received scant attention in the empirical literature. The current study compared the outcomes of a front-end Family Finding intervention (n = 196) and a comparison group (n = 262) among children in foster care in Cook County Illinois between the ages of 6 and 13. Results showed that there were no differences between the intervention and comparison group on reunification rates, placement stability, or on longitudinal externalizing behavior and internalizing symptoms. However, the intervention found close to 75% more relatives than the control group, and many of these relatives were significant figures in the children's lives. The intervention was also associated with a higher proportion of relative placements to total placements for a subgroup of children with five or more placements. Further, the effect of the intervention on this proportion (relative placements to total placements) was mediated by the greater number of relatives found in the intervention. Finally, the intervention was associated with relatively better Concurrent Planning. These results suggest that Family Finding has the potential to impact proximal outcomes related to discovery, engagement and planning but is currently not impacting more distal outcomes such as permanency and well-being. Family Finding approaches should continue to innovate, possibly through integration with psychosocial interventions, to affect more distal variables such as well-being outcomes.

AB Using multilevel modeling on a sample of 2472 families in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this study explored the simultaneous role of neighborhood collective efficacy and maternal spanking on externalizing and internalizing problems in early childhood. Mediation analyses tested whether maternal spanking mediates the effect of neighborhood collective efficacy on behavior problems. Results indicated the direct influences of neighborhood collective efficacy and maternal spanking on externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, even after controlling for earlier behavior problem scores and a comprehensive set of child, family, and neighborhood level covariates. The indirect associations between neighborhood collective efficacy and behavior problems through maternal spanking were not significant, after considering the covariates. These findings demonstrate the importance of a multilevel framework that concurrently promotes positive neighborhood and parenting processes for desirable child outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The measure was designed to be short and easy to use, relevant to youth treated in community-based mental health settings, useful for both treatment planning and program evaluation, and psychometrically valid. Factor analyses of the chosen items revealed two mental health factors and four functioning factors. The mental health factors included internalization and externalization, and the functioning factors included family, social, caregiver, and educational functioning. In support of validity, internalization and externalization subscales distinguished between clients diagnosed with internalizing and externalizing disorders and correlated with caregiver and self-report scores on the Youth Outcome Questionnaire.

AB Pharmacotherapeutic interventions are available for most psychiatric disorders in children. Evidence for these interventions varies, depending on the targeted disorders. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, a sound database on efficacy and safety of medication exists. For other common disorders or psychopathological phenomena like disruptive behavior, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or autism, data on efficacy and safety are much scarcer. This selective review aims to provide an overview about current psychopharmacological interventions in child and adolescent psychiatry. The literature indicates either a lower efficacy than other interventions or less beneficial effects compared to possible adverse events in these cases. Most guidelines recommend psychopharmacotherapy in children to be embedded in a psychosocial or therapeutic intervention plan. Decision for medication depends on the severity of symptoms, chronicity, and, most important, impairment of the child in academic performance, family relationships, and everyday life. The high rates of off-label use in the age group of children are often due to a lack of market authorization studies less indicative of low efficacy. As adverse events need to be monitored closely, pharmacotherapy should mainly be restricted to experienced mental health care providers.

AB AimsTo test the hypothesis that young people with perceived parental alcohol problems have poorer parent-child relationships and more emotional symptoms, low self-esteem, loneliness and depression than young people without perceived parental alcohol problems.
   DesignCross-sectional analysis using data from the Danish National Youth Study 2014, a web-based national survey.
   SettingDenmark.
   ParticipantsA total of 71.988 high school and vocational school students (aged 12-25, nested in 119 schools and 3.186 school classes) recruited throughout 2014.
   MeasurementsOutcome variables included internalizing problems such as emotional symptoms, depression, self-esteem, loneliness and aspects of the parent-child relationship. The main predictor variable was perceived parental alcohol problems, including the severity of the perceived problems and living with a parent with alcohol problems. Control variables included age, sex, education, ethnicity, parents' separation and economic problems in the family.
   FindingsBoys and girls with perceived parental alcohol problems had statistically significant higher odds of reporting internalizing problems (e.g. frequent emotional symptoms: odds ratio (OR)= 1.58 for boys; 1.49 for girls) and poor parent-child relationships (e.g.lack of parental interest: OR=1.92 for boys; 2.33 for girls) compared with young people without perceived parental alcohol problems. The associations were not significantly stronger for mother's alcohol problems or if the young person lived with the parent with perceived alcohol problems.
   ConclusionBoys and girls in secondary education in Denmark who report perceived parental alcohol problems have significantly higher odds of internalizing problems and poorer parent-child relationships compared with young people without perceived parental alcohol problems.

AB This study examined the contribution of reinforcement sensitivity to the hierarchical structure of child personality and common psychopathology in community samples of parent reports of children aged 2-18 (N = 968) and self-reports of adolescents aged 10-18 (N = 1,543) using the Inventory of Child Individual Differences-Short version (ICID-S), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). A joint higher-order factor analysis of the ICID-S and SDQ scales suggested a 4-factor solution; congruence coefficients indicated replicability of the factors across the 2 samples at all levels of the personality-psychopathology hierarchy. The canonical correlation analyses indicated that reinforcement sensitivity and personality-psychopathology dimensions shared much of their variance. The main contribution of reinforcement sensitivity was through opposing effects of reward and punishment sensitivities. The superordinate factors Beta and Internalizing were best predicted by reinforcement sensitivity, followed by the Externalizing and Positive personality factors. These findings provide evidence for consistency of the hierarchical structure of personality and common psychopathology across informants and highlight the role of reinforcement systems in the development of normal and abnormal patterns of behavior and affect.
