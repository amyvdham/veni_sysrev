AB Individual differences in behavioral regulation system (BRS) and stress response system (SRS) functioning may reflect greater biological sensitivity to context. The current study tested whether children's cortisol, a measure of the SRS, was related to observed dysregulated behavior, an indicator of the BRS, in a sample of children admitted for acute psychiatric inpatient care. In addition, cortisol and dysregulated behavior were tested as unique predictors of length of hospitalization over and above demographic factors, prior treatment history, and caretaker-reported psychiatric symptoms. The latter variables were tested as potential moderators of the relations of BRS and SRS functioning to length of hospitalization. Plasma cortisol was collected on the morning following hospital admission for 544 children (ages 6-12; 73% boys; 61% ethnic minority). Dysregulated behavior was operationalized as the mean number of timeouts administered by staff for noncompliant behavior per day of hospitalization. Caretakers reported on youth internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Higher cortisol was modestly associated with greater dysregulated behavior. In a model including both cortisol and dysregulated behavior, each predicted longer hospitalization. Cortisol was positively related to length of stay only for children previously hospitalized, and the relation of dysregulated behavior to length of stay was stronger for older children. Dysregulated behavior and cortisol are related but independent predictors of acute psychiatric hospitalization duration. Direct measures of the SRS can add to the clinical picture regarding hospitalization in ways that observed behavior and caretaker report alone cannot.

AB Children and adolescents with externalizing behavior disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD) often present with symptoms of comorbid internalizing psychopathology. However, few studies have examined central nervous system correlates of such comorbidity. We evaluated interactions between externalizing and internalizing symptoms in predicting mesolimbic, septo-hippocampal, and anterior cingulate volumes among 12- to 16-year-old boys with either ADHD, ADHD and CD, or no psychiatric condition (n = 35). These regions were chosen given established links to trait impulsivity, trait anxiety, and behavior regulation, respectively. Collapsed across groups, Externalizing x Internalizing symptom interactions accounted for individual differences in gray matter densities in each region. Externalizing youth with comorbid internalizing symptoms showed smaller reductions in gray matter than individuals with externalizing psychopathology alone. These results suggest that internalizing symptoms are associated with less severe structural compromises in brain regions subserving motivation and behavior regulation among externalizing boys.

AB Research Findings: The current study's main aim was to implement a multifocused, community-based intervention for preventing conduct problems in preschool children. Our assumption was that the same intervention program could be delivered concomitantly as a universal prevention program for all children as well as an indicated prevention program for high-risk children selected after screening for social and emotional competencies development. We used a quasi-experimental design with a between-subjects variable (intervention vs. comparison) and a within-subjects variable (preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up). The efficacy of the intervention was assessed for high-risk children targeted by the indicated intervention as well as for moderate-and low-risk children, who received the universal intervention. Practice or Policy: First, our results demonstrate the capacity of classroom-based interventions, without added pull-out sessions, to generate significant changes in high-risk children's competencies as well as externalizing and internalizing problems. Second, similar results were found for the moderate-risk, but not the low-risk, group, and these data suggest that marginally at-risk children are the most likely to benefit from participating in universal interventions. And third, comparing data from social and emotional competence risk groups indicates that underdeveloped emotional competencies might have a prolonged negative effect on children's social skills, which increases as a function of higher risk status.

AB In this study, based on Family Interactional Theory (FIT), the authors tested a longitudinal model of the intergenerational effects of the grandmothers' parent-child relationships and the grandparents' smoking on the grandchildren's externalizing behavior via parents' psychological symptoms, tobacco use, and child rearing. Using Mplus, the authors obtained a structural equation model that demonstrated generational associations from grandmothers (G1) to parents (G2) to their oldest children (G3) and thus was in accord with FIT. They identified a pathway from the grandmothers' parenting to the grandchildren's externalizing behavior via the parents' psychological symptoms, their smoking, and their child rearing. Parents' psychological symptoms in adolescence were associated with their tobacco use in their late twenties, controlling for the continuity of their psychological symptoms and their tobacco use. This 3-generational model adds to the literature on parent-child relationships (G1), smoking from adolescence to early adulthood (G2), and externalizing behavior in the G3 child.

AB The purposes of the current study were: (1) to examine the roles of early maternal attachment relationships and teacher-child relationships during childhood for externalizing and internalizing behaviors in late childhood, and (2) to investigate teacher-child relationships, as well as externalizing and internalizing behaviors in early childhood as possible mechanisms linking early maternal attachment relationships to behavior problems in late childhood. Longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1140 mothers and children) were used in this investigation. There were three main findings. First, insecure/other maternal attachment relationships in early childhood (i.e., 36 months) were associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors in late childhood (Grade 5). Second, elevated levels of teacher-child conflict during childhood were associated with externalizing behaviors in late childhood whereas low levels of teacher-child closeness were associated with internalizing behaviors. Third, the effects of insecure/other attachment on externalizing and internalizing behaviors in late childhood were mediated through teacher-child relationships during childhood and early externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Implications for attachment theory are discussed.

AB Objective: Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves a variety of personality disturbances presumed to result from repeated interpersonal trauma such as child abuse. As Complex PTSD patients are a heterogeneous population, we searched for clinically relevant personality-based subtypes. Method: This study used a cluster analysis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Axis II features within a sample of 71 female outpatients with systematically assessed child abuse-related Complex PTSD. Results: Two main subtypes were found: adaptive and nonadaptive. The latter was further differentiated into withdrawn, alienated, suffering, and aggressive subtypes, characterized by different levels of introversion and disinhibition. Among the nonadaptive subtypes, the severity of Complex PTSD symptoms was lowest in the withdrawn (introverted only) subtype. The subtypes differed in their level of dissociation and depression but did not differ regarding PTSD symptoms, trauma history, or parental bonding characteristics. Conclusion: Confirming earlier findings, our study found personality-based Complex PTSD subtypes, which could implicate differential treatment needs and results.

AB The present study aimed to explore the psychosocial implications of asthma among Belgian French-speaking children. Ninety-nine parents of children having asthma (Mage = 11.40, SD = 2.35) and 102 parents of children without asthma (Mage = 11.25, SD = .81) participated in the study. Parents filled in the Child Behaviour Checklist and a demographic questionnaire. Results showed that children having asthma were assessed by their parents as having more internalizing, social and attention problems and as having less competence in doing activities (e.g., sports, hobbies, jobs ) than their healthy peers. Significant differences also appeared between genders for attention problems, anxiety/depression, activities, social and school competences, indicating that boys were more vulnerable to psychological and social difficulties than girls but they had better school competences than girls. Finally, results showed no difference for psychological, social, and school adjustment between children who controlled and partly controlled their asthma. These findings emphasize the importance of screening children who would be at risk for having psychosocial problems and developing multidisciplinary interventions for children with asthma and for their families.

AB Behavioral inhibition (BI) discourages children from interacting, predisposing them to isolation, social anxiety, and depression. We have created the Behavioral Inhibition Scale for Children Aged 3 to 6 (BIS 3-6) to detect this trait early. Parents and teachers of 365 preschoolers completed different versions of the BIS 3-6 and provided measures of psychopathology. Both versions are structured into 1 factor that explains over 40% of total variability and displays excellent internal consistency (alpha = .95). The moderate correlations with measures of internalizing symptoms (r = .50) and nonexistent correlations with externalizing measures suggest adequate convergent and discriminant validity. A new scoring system is proposed.

AB There are inconsistent findings regarding whether a mother's diagnosis of cancer affects her child's psychological health. The aim of this study was to compare maternally perceived symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children of women with and without breast cancer. Forty mothers with breast cancer (assessed within 8 weeks of diagnosis) and 39 mothers without breast cancer were administered the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18), UCLA Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Index, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive discriminant analysis revealed that mothers with cancer perceived their children to have significantly greater symptoms of PTSD and internalizing distress than the mothers without cancer. No significant difference was found in maternal perception of externalizing symptoms in their children. Results revealed the importance of the assessment of PTSD in children whose mothers have cancer and the discussion includes implications for future research and clinical interventions.

AB The current study examined the main effects of hostile attributional bias (HAB) and negative emotional responding on a variety of aggressive behaviors in adults, including general aggression, physical aggression, relational aggression, and verbal aggression. Effects of both externalizing (anger) and internalizing (embarrassment/upset) negative emotions were considered. In addition, the moderating roles of gender and impulsivity on the effects of HAB and negative emotional responding were explored. Multilevel models were fitted to data from 2,749 adult twins aged 20-55 from the PennTwins cohort. HAB was positively associated with all four forms of aggression. There was also a significant interaction between impulsivity and HAB for general aggression. Specifically, the relationship between HAB and general aggression was only significant for individuals with average or above-average levels of impulsivity. Negative emotional responding was also found to predict all measures of aggression, although in different ways. Anger was positively associated with all forms of aggression, whereas embarrassment/upset predicted decreased levels of general, physical, and verbal aggression but increased levels of relational aggression. The associations between negative emotional responding and aggression were generally stronger for males than females. The current study provides evidence for the utility of HAB and negative emotional responding as predictors of adult aggression and further suggests that gender and impulsivity may moderate their links with aggression.

AB The study employed a developmental, ecological, and resiliency framework to examine whether interactive peer play competencies mediated associations between teacher reported problem behavior and learning outcomes for a representative sample of urban low-income children (N = 507 across 46 Head Start classrooms). Structural equation models provided evidence for full mediation, whereby associations between internalizing and externalizing problem behavior and learning outcomes were fully explained through their effects on interactive peer play skills. An alternate model was also tested (whether problem behavior mediated the effects of interactive peer play on spring learning outcomes); however, this alternate model was not supported in these data. A third model testing whether mediation was conditional on child sex was also not supported. Implications for developmental theory, research, and practice are discussed as they relate to opportunities to build on children's strengths and promote learning within early childhood educational programs serving children living in urban poverty.

AB Witnessed community violence has been linked to a number of internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. Guided by Cicchetti and Lynch's (1993) ecological-transactional model, this study aimed to examine the impact that family-level factors had on negative outcomes associated with witnessed community violence. Using a nationally representative sample, we explored the moderational role of family cohesion in the relationship between witnessing community violence and delinquent behavior while taking demographic variables into account. Results from the investigation suggested that low levels of family cohesion were predictive of delinquency after controlling for race, gender, past delinquency, and direct trauma. In addition, the findings suggested that family cohesion moderated the impact of witnessed community violence on future delinquent behavior. Future directions for research and implications for practice were also discussed.

AB The relation between history of violence exposure and the development of academic and mental health problems is explored. Violence exposed children have an increased risk of developing school-related problems including: mental health problems, learning disabilities, language impairments, and other neurocognitive problems. These problems interact to create a complex web of deficits and disabilities where intervention access points are difficult to assess. Often mental health problems and academic problems develop in parallel. Timing of violence exposure and the developmental stage of the child during exposure complicate our understanding of the underlying mechanism. A model is presented that explores pathways linking violence exposure to aspects of school-related functioning, both academically and behaviorally. Early life stress, in the form of violence exposure, is related to neurocognitive deficits, including executive functioning and problems in self-regulation. Deficits in self-regulation at the level of behavior, and cognitive control and executive functioning, at the level of brain processing, are related to both academic and mental health problems, suggesting a possible psychological mechanism. Biological mechanisms are also included in the model to illustrate the contribution of the stress response, neuroendocrine system response, and neuroanatomical structural and functional impairments associated with violence exposure.

AB Family accommodation of symptoms is counter to the primary goals of cognitive-behavioral therapy for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and can pose an obstacle to positive treatment outcomes. Although increased attention has been given to family accommodation in pediatric OCD, relatively little is known about associated child and parent characteristics, and their mediating/moderating effects. This study examined a structural equation model of parent and child variables related to parent reports of family accommodation. Sixty-one children with OCD (ages 6-17 years, 39% female) and their parents were recruited from a university-based clinic. They were administered clinician- and parent-rated measures of child OCD symptom severity, OCD-specific impairment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems as well as parent anxiety, depression, empathy, consideration of future consequences, and accommodation. Results generally supported the hypothesized model. Family accommodation mediated the relationship between OCD symptom severity and parent-rated functional impairment; child internalizing problems mediated the relationship between parent anxiety and family accommodation; and parent empathy and consideration of future consequences interacted to predict family accommodation. Child externalizing problems were significantly associated with family accommodation but neither of these two variables was associated with parent depression. Findings suggest that reductions in family accommodation might be maximized by routinely screening for comorbid psychopathology in children with OCD and their parents, and using prescriptive or modular approaches to intervention. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB Witnessing community violence has been linked with several adverse outcomes for adolescents, including emotional and behavioral problems. Among youth who have witnessed community violence, proximity to the victim of community violence is one factor that may determine, in part, the nature of adolescents responses to community violence exposure. The present study examines whether relationship proximity to the victim of community violence is associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors among a sample of urban and predominantly African American adolescents (N = 501) who have witnessed community violence. In 10th grade, participants reported whether they had witnessed 10 community violence events during the past year, and, if so, whether the victim of the violence was a family member, close friend, acquaintance, or stranger. Witnessed community violence against a family member or close friend was associated with depressive symptoms, and witnessed community violence against known individuals was associated with anxiety symptoms. Witnessing community violence against familiar persons and strangers was linked with aggressive behavior. Gender differences in these associations and implications for assessment and intervention with community violence-exposed youth are discussed.

AB Drawing on developmental and policy research, this study examined whether 3 dimensions of caseworkerrecipient interaction in welfare offices functioned as critical ecological contexts for recipient families. The sample consisted of 1,098 families from 10 welfare offices in National Evaluation of Welfare to Work Strategies (NEWWS). In multilevel analyses, caseworker support, caseload size, and emphasis on employment predicted 5-year quarterly trajectories of earnings, income, and welfare receipt. Recipients in offices characterized by high support had steeper increases in earnings and income; those in offices with high caseload size had steeper decreases in income and welfare receipt; and those in offices with high emphasis on employment had steeper decreases in welfare receipt. These economic trajectories were associated with childrens reading and math achievement and internalizing behavior at ages 810.

AB The purpose of the present study was to determine the relations among negative life events, social support, coping and anxiety symptoms in 709 Caucasian and African-American youth between 11 and 14 years of age. Results indicated that more negative life events, less social support, more coping efforts, and African-American status were related to more anxiety symptoms. Additionally, although active coping moderated the relationship between negative life events and anxiety, these relations were qualified in separate analyses for the African-American and Caucasian youth. Negative life events were related to anxiety symptoms only for the African-American participants. When these findings were explored further for males and females of each racial group, negative life events remained significant for African-American males but not African-American females. Implications of these findings are examined and future directions for research to understand the processes underlying these relations with both Caucasian and African-American youth are addressed.

AB The degree to which young children's anxiety symptoms differentiate according to diagnostic groupings is under-studied, especially in children below the age of 4 years. Theoretical (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA) and statistical (exploratory factor analysis, EFA) analytical methods were employed to test the hypothesis that anxiety symptoms among 2-3-year-old children from a non-clinical, representative sample would differentiate in a manner consistent with current diagnostic nosology. Anxiety symptom items were selected from two norm-referenced parent-report scales of child behavior. CFA and EFA results suggested that anxiety symptoms aggregate in a manner consistent with generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, separation anxiety, and social phobia. Multi-dimensional models achieved good model fit and fit the data significantly better than undifferentiated models. Results from EFA and CFA methods were predominantly consistent and supported the grouping of early childhood anxiety symptoms into differentiated, diagnostic-specific categories.

AB Objective To prospectively examine pathways from early childhood violence exposure and trauma-related symptoms to school-age emotional health. Methods A longitudinal, birth cohort (N = 437) was assessed with parent reports of lifetime violence exposure and trauma-related symptoms at 3 years of age and later, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and social competence at school age. Results Early family and neighborhood violence correlated significantly with early trauma-related symptoms and also significantly predicted school-age internalizing and externalizing symptoms and poorer competence, independent of sociodemographic risk and past-year violence exposure. Longitudinal pathways were significantly mediated by arousal and avoidance symptoms at 3 years of age, which increased risk for clinically significant emotional problems and lower competence at school age (adjusted odds ratios = 3.1-6.1, p < 0.01). Conclusions Trauma-related symptoms may mediate developmental pathways from early violence exposure to later emotional health. Interventions that prevent or reduce early trauma-related symptoms may ameliorate the long-term deleterious impact of violence exposure.

ID CLASSROOM-BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; INTERVENTION; PERFORMANCE
AB The self-modeling intervention has been studied for more than 40 years, most often through single-subject research design. This article evaluates the use of the intervention with behaviors associated with both externalizing and internalizing disorders. It compares and summarizes the use of the self-modeling intervention with behaviors such as: disruptive classroom and social-setting behaviors. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder-associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, fear, and self-efficacy. Behaviors associated with disorders such as stuttering, selective mutism, and autism are not included in this review as they are covered more in-depth in other articles contained within this special issue. In general, the self-modeling intervention is supported for use in a variety of behaviors associated with both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Practitioners are advised to use the methods outlined in this article as support for incorporating the self-modeling intervention for school-aged children with both internalizing and externalizing disorders.

AB Objectives: Hypochondriasis, now often designated as health anxiety, is important in terms of prevalence, levels of suffering, and health services cost in adults. Whereas the DSM-IV-TR suggests that the condition primarily begins in adulthood, retrospective reports point to a possible origin in childhood with onset as early as preschool age. However, little research has addressed health anxiety in children. In the present study we explored parental-reported health anxiety symptoms (HAS) and their association with physical and mental health in a population-based sample of 5- to 7-year-old children. Methods: Parents of 1323 children (49.7% boys), recruited from the birth cohort: Copenhagen Child Cohort CCC 2000, completed questionnaires regarding their child's HAS, and physical and mental health. Associations were examined using multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for concurrent chronic physical disease. Results: HAS were present in 17.6% and present 'a lot' (categorized as considerable HAS) in 2.4% of the children. Children with considerable HAS demonstrated more physical health problems and internalizing disorders than children with no or non-considerable HAS, but in the majority (71.9%) no associated chronic physical disease or other mental disorder was reported. In a subsample of children with functional somatic symptoms (FSS), impairing FSS were more likely among children who reported HAS. Conclusions: The findings suggest that HAS present as primary complaints early in life and are associated with impairing child health problems in the area of FSS and internalizing disorders. These aspects may be important to understand and also to prevent the development of severe health anxiety. (Psychosomatics 2012; 53:58-67)

AB Research on exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) among children and adolescents has rarely examined whether the gender of the perpetrator (e. g., mother-perpetrated vs. father-perpetrated IPV) elicits differential effects on male and female adolescents' mental health outcomes. This study examined whether exposure to severe IPV affected male and female youths' mental health internalizing (i.e., withdrawn, somatic, and depressed or anxiety problems) and externalizing (i.e., aggression) outcomes differently, as well as whether the effects of IPV exposure depended on the gender of the perpetrator of violence. Results indicated that female-only-perpetrated IPV had a detrimental impact on some of girls' internalizing mental health problems more so than on the internalizing mental health problems of males. Male-only-perpetrated IPV did not yield similar results, perhaps because the measure did not capture the larger context of violence between partners. Potential policy implications for law enforcement, school counselors, and other mental health service providers are discussed.

AB Findings regarding phenotypic differences between boys and girls with ASD are mixed. We compared autism and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 8-18 year-old girls (n = 20) and boys (n = 20) with ASD and typically developing (TYP) girls (n = 19) and boys (n = 17). Girls with ASD were more impaired than TYP girls but did not differ from boys with ASD in autism symptoms. In adolescence, girls with ASD had higher internalizing symptoms than boys with ASD and TYP girls, and higher symptoms of depression than TYP girls. Girls ages 8-18 with ASD resemble boys with ASD and not TYP girls, and appear to be at increased risk for affective symptoms in the teen years.

AB The present study examines the quality of peer relations as a mediator between exposure to IPV (intimate partner violence) and internalizing behaviors in a sample of 129 preadolescents and adolescents (ages 10-18), who were interviewed via telephone as part of a multigenerational, prospective, longitudinal study. Relational victimization is also examined as a moderator of IPV exposure on internalizing behaviors. Results demonstrate a significant association of exposure to severe IPV and internalizing behaviors. Relational victimization is found to moderate the effects of exposure to severe IPV on internalizing behaviors. The present findings suggest that the effects of exposure to IPV had a particularly important effect on the risk for internalizing problems if the adolescent also experienced relational victimization. Conversely, the receipt of prosocial behaviors buffer against the effects of IPV exposure on internalizing symptoms in teen girls.

AB Both theory and empirical evidence support possible associations between two candidate genetic polymorphisms (SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR l/s and COMT Val(158)Met -rs4680 variants) and emotion-regulation difficulties. One particular form of emotion-regulation difficulty, distress intolerance, has been measured using a behavioral assessment in youth; data indicate a relationship with poor psychological functioning. No prior study has investigated genetic influences on emotion-regulation difficulties in youth. As part of a larger longitudinal study on adolescent risk behaviors, 218 10-14 year-old youths from the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area completed a measure of distress intolerance, the Behavioral Indicator of Resilience to Distress (BIRD), and provided saliva samples for DNA extraction and geno-typing. Results indicate that those with one or two copies of the s allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were more likely to perform poorly on the task (i.e., choose to quit) than were those homozygous for the I allele. Participants who were Val allele carriers of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism were also more likely to quit the task compared to Met homozygotes. A summative risk allele score was created to combine the two polymorphisms, and each risk allele was associated with a 1.75 fold increased likelihood of quitting the task. Exploratory analyses revealed that emotional abuse moderated the relationship between the 5-HTTLPR and BIRD performance, as well as the genetic risk allele and the BIRD. This is the first investigation of genetic predictors of a behavioral measure of tolerance to distress. Results suggest that distress tolerance is at least partially regulated by specific genetic variants. Implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A callous-unemotional (CU) subtype of conduct disorder (CD) has been proposed as an addition to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This study tested the hypothesis that young girls with the CU subtype of CD would exhibit more severe antisocial behavior and less severe internalizing problems over time relative to girls with CD alone. Second, the developmental outcomes of girls with CU traits in the absence of CD was examined because these girls would be overlooked by the proposed CU subtyping scheme. Method: Theses issues were examined in a community sample of 1,862 girls 6 to 8 years of age at study onset. Outcomes included internalizing and externalizing problems, academic achievement, and global impairment assessed concurrently and at a 6-year follow-up. Results: Girls with the CU subtype of CD had higher levels of externalizing disorder symptoms, bullying, relational aggression, and global impairment than girls with CD alone. Girls with CD alone tended to have more anxiety problems than girls with the CU subtype of CD. Girls with high CU traits without CD exhibited higher ODD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and lower academic achievement at the 6-year follow-up relative to girls without CU traits and CD. Group differences at the 6-year follow-up were primarily accounted for by baseline differences on the outcomes. Conclusions: The proposed DSM-5 CU subtype of CD identifies young girls who exhibit lower anxiety problems and more severe aggression, CD symptoms, academic problems and global impairment across time than girls with CD alone.

AB Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often present with co-occurring emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). The Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL: Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) is an EBD measure that contains several norm-referenced scales derived through factor analysis of data from the general pediatric population. The psychometric properties of this widely used and well-researched measure have not been evaluated in samples of youth with ASD. This study evaluated the CBCL's internal structure, scale reliability, criterion-related validity, and diagnostic accuracy using archival data from a well-characterized sample of youth with ASD (N = 122). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the CBCL's syndrome scales and its internalizing-externalizing factor structure. Significance tests indicated that many scales discriminated between two subgroups: a group of individuals with ASD + EBD and a group with ASD alone. Diagnostic accuracy analyses indicated that the CBCL had good sensitivity but low specificity for detecting co-occurring disorders. Results supported the use of the CBCL in conjunction with other clinical data when assessing for EBD in youth with ASD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Existing literature regarding the adjustment of siblings of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains inconclusive, with some studies showing positive adjustment, others showing negative adjustment, and others showing no difference when compared to siblings of typically-developing children. For the current study, 42 parents of a child with an ASD and a typically-developing sibling (ASD group) and 42 parents of two typically-developing siblings (control group) provided data via online questionnaires. Both diagnostic category and autism symptom severity were tested as possible moderators, but neither produced significant interactions with either externalizing behaviors or internalizing symptoms in the target child when predicting externalizing behaviors, internalizing symptoms, or social problems in the sibling. However, across the overall sample (ASD and control groups), maladjustment - particularly internalizing symptoms - in the target children significantly related to maladjustment in their siblings. Thus, these findings suggest that having a sibling with an ASD is neither a risk nor protective factor for maladjustment among typically-developing siblings above and beyond the relation between maladjustment among siblings in general. Given some of the mixed findings in the literature, other possible moderators that may put siblings of a child with an ASD at specific risk should be considered in future research.

SO APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-CHILD

DT Article
DE assessment/diagnosis; child/clinical/pediatric; school; tests; trauma
AB Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with behavioral disturbances that can interfere with adjustment in the classroom. As such, standardized assessments of behavioral disturbances following TBI are useful in treatment planning and rehabilitation, although few studies have examined the sensitivity of standardized behavior assessments to behavioral abnormalities in this population. The present study compared the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition Teacher Rating Scale (BASC-2 TRS) profiles of 25 children who sustained TBI to those of 25 matched controls and to the BASC-2 standardization sample. Results indicated that teachers endorsed externalizing and school-related problems more severely and frequently than internalizing problems, with the greatest elevations on the Hyperactivity, Attention Problems, and Learning Problems subscales. In addition, BASC-2 scores appeared unrelated to IQ but were influenced by achievement functioning. Findings are consistent with previous studies of behavioral abnormalities in children with TBI and provide support for the usefulness of the BASC-2 TRS in evaluating behavioral disturbances in children that result from TBI.

AB A brief overview of the prevention part of the long-term Erlangen-Nuremberg Development and Prevention Study, which combines a prospective longitudinal and experimental design. Findings up to five years after intervention are reported. From a sample of 609 families with kindergarten children, subgroups participated in the universal prevention program EFFEKT (child social skills training, a parent training and a combination of both) or were assigned to equivalent control groups. The short-term evaluation showed significant effects in mediating constructs (social problem solving and parenting behavior) and in educators' ratings of children's social behavior. In a follow-up after two to three years, school report cards showed fewer children with multiple behavior problems. In a further follow up after four to five years program children reported fewer externalizing and internalizing problems than the control group. There were no significant effects in the mothers' reports on their children's behavior. Most significant effect sizes ranged between d = 0.20 and d = 0.40. The findings suggest various positive long-term effects of the intervention. However, one need to be cautious with regard to over-generalizing the positive findings, because effect sizes vary over time and the positive findings could not be replicated in all investigated variables.

   PROBLEMS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; FOLLOW-UP; DEPRIVATION
AB Background: Children reared in institutions experience elevated rates of psychiatric disorders. Inability to form a secure attachment relationship to a primary caregiver is posited to be a central mechanism in this association. We determined whether the ameliorative effect of a foster care (FC) intervention on internalizing disorders in previously institutionalized children was explained by the development of secure attachment among children placed in FC. Second we evaluated the role of lack of attachment in an institutionalized sample on the etiology of internalizing disorders within the context of a randomized trial. Methods: A sample of 136 children (aged 6-30 months) residing in institutions was recruited in Bucharest, Romania. Children were randomized to FC (n = 68) or to care as usual (CAU; n = 68). Foster parents were recruited, trained, and overseen by the investigative team. Attachment security at 42 months was assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, and internalizing disorders at 54 months were assessed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment. Results: Girls in FC had fewer internalizing disorders than girls in CAU (OR = 0.17, p = .006). The intervention had no effect on internalizing disorders in boys (OR = 0.47, p = .150). At 42 months, girls in FC were more likely to have secure attachment than girls in CAU (OR = 12.5, p < .001), but no difference was observed in boys (OR = 2.0, p = .205). Greater attachment security predicted lower rates of internalizing disorders in both sexes. Development of attachment security fully mediated intervention effects on internalizing disorders in girls. Conclusion: Placement into FC facilitated the development of secure attachment and prevented the onset of internalizing disorders in institutionalized girls. The differential effects of FC on attachment security in boys and girls explained gender differences in the intervention effects on psychopathology. Findings provide evidence for the critical role of disrupted attachment in the etiology of internalizing disorders in children exposed to institutionalization.

AB This study examined whether the New Beginnings Program for divorced families led to improvements in youth's educational goals and job aspirations 6 years following participation and tested whether several parenting and youth variables mediated the program effects. Participants were 240 youth aged 9 to 12 years at the initial assessment, and data were part of a randomized, experimental trial of a parenting skills preventive intervention targeting children's postdivorce adjustment. The results revealed positive effects of the program on youth's educational goals and job aspirations 6 years after participation for those who were at high risk for developing later problems at program entry. Further, intervention-induced changes in mother-child relationship quality and youth externalizing problems, internalizing problems, self-esteem, and academic competence at the 6-year follow-up mediated the effects of the program on the educational expectations of high-risk youth. Intervention-induced changes in youth externalizing problems and academic competence at the 6-year follow-up mediated the effects of the program on the job aspirations of high-risk youth.

AB This article examines associations between biological father's incarceration and internalizing and externalizing outcomes of depression and serious delinquency, across White, Black, and Hispanic subsamples of youth in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Among respondents whose father was first incarcerated during childhood or adolescence, father's incarceration is found to be associated with increased depression and delinquency. On the whole, results indicate that associations between father's incarceration and depression and delinquency do not vary by race and ethnicity or gender. One exception is among Hispanic respondents, for whom having a biological father incarcerated is associated with an even higher propensity of delinquency than among White and Black respondents with incarcerated fathers.

AB Objective: Mental illness in parents affects the mental health of their children. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of interventions to prevent mental disorders or psychological symptoms in the offspring were performed. Method: The Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of interventions in parents with mental disorders. Outcomes in the child included incident mental disorders of the same nature and internalizing (negative emotions, depressive symptoms, anxiety) or externalizing (hyperactivity, aggressiveness, behavioral problems) symptoms. Relative risks and standardized mean differences in symptom scores were combined in random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen trials including 1,490 children were analyzed. Interventions included cognitive, behavioral, or psychoeducational components. Seven trials assessed the incidence of mental disorders and seven trials assessed symptoms. In total 161 new diagnoses of mental illness were recorded, with interventions decreasing the risk by 40% (combined relative risk 0.60, 95% Cl 0.45-0.79). Symptom scores were lower in the intervention groups: standardized mean differences were -0.22 (95% CI -0.37 to -0.08) for internalizing symptoms (p = .003) and -0.16 (95% confidence interval -0.36 to 0.04) for externalizing symptoms (p = .12). Conclusions: Interventions to prevent mental disorders and psychological symptoms in the offspring of parents with mental disorders appear to be effective. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

AB Objective: No previous longitudinal study has examined the impact of comorbid maternal personality disorder (PD) and depression on child development. We set out to examine whether maternal PD and depression assessed at 2 months post partum would be independently associated with adverse developmental outcomes at 18 months of age. Method: Women were recruited into the study shortly after delivery and screened for depression and PD. Those meeting criteria for depression, PD, or both conditions, were selected for assessment at 2 months post partum, together with a comparison group with neither condition (total sample, N = 200). Assessments of cognitive, social and emotional development were conducted with their children at 18 months of age. Results: Maternal postpartum depression and PD were both associated with higher levels of dysregulated infant behavior. There was a significant interaction between depression and PD in the model of dysregulated behavior and the detrimental effects of maternal depression and PD were evident only among mothers with both conditions. Maternal depression was independently associated with impaired infant cognitive scores and higher levels of internalizing behavior. Conclusions: Future studies of the effects of maternal depression should also take into account the effects of comorbid maternal PD. Health professionals need to be aware of the possible co-occurrence of PD among mothers presenting with postnatal depression and that mothers with these co-occurring disorders are likely to require greater support.

TI Do Asian-American Women Who Were Maltreated as Children Have a Higher

AB Objectives: This study is the first to systematically investigate whether multiple child maltreatment is associated with HIV risk behaviors and adverse mental health outcomes among Asian-American women.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of unmarried Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese women (n = 400), aged 18 to 35, who are identified as children of immigrants, using computer-assisted survey interviews.
   Results: Approximately 7 in 10 women reported having been maltreated as a child and 6.8% reported any type of sexual abuse. Only 15% of our sample reported having sex at age 16 or before, yet almost 60% had ever engaged with potentially risky sexual partners. Contrary to the findings from previous studies of White and Black women, sexual abuse plus other maltreatment was not associated with HIV risk behaviors among Asian-American women. However, it was associated with a marked increase in depression, lifetime suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. A higher education level was associated with increased odds of HIV risk behaviors, including ever having had anal sex and ever having potentially risky sexual partners.
   Conclusion: There was no evidence indicating that multiple child maltreatment was linked with HIV risk behaviors, but it exhibited a robust association with poor mental health outcomes. These empirical patterns of internalizing trauma, suffering alone, and staying silent are in accord with Asian-cultural norms of saving face and maintaining family harmony. The prevention of multiple child maltreatment may reduce high levels of depression and suicidal behaviors in this population. It is urgent to identify victims of multiple child maltreatment and provide culturally appropriate interventions. Copyright (C) 2012 by the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

AB Impulsivity has often been related to externalizing disorders, but little is known about how it is related to symptoms of internalizing disorders. This study aims to examine the relationship between impulsivity and depression and anxiety symptoms of depression and anxiety in childhood, and compare it with its relationship with a measure of aggressive behavior, which is present in many externalizing disorders. We administered the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 for children, the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Children's Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders to a case-control sample of 562 children aged between 9 and 13 who were selected from an epidemiological study of anxiety and depression and whose teachers provided information about their proactive and reactive aggression. Impulsivity was related to measures of anxiety, depression and aggressive behavior, and showed higher relationships with measures of internalizing symptoms than with aggression. Motor impulsivity, a component of impulsivity related to inhibition deficits, was the component most related to anxiety and depression. Cognitive impulsivity, on the other hand, was negatively related to anxiety and depression. The relationships between impulsivity and symptoms of internalizing disorders seem to indicate that impulsivity should be taken into account not only in externalizing problems, but also in depression and anxiety in children and adolescents.

AB Background. There are few studies assessing long-term adult outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in former pediatric high-risk kidney transplant (TX) recipients.
   Methods. Twenty-one patients were assessed at mean age of 21.1 years. Mean age at first TX was 2.4 years. Brain arterial border zone infarcts had been documented in 54% of the children. HRQOL was assessed with the general 15-dimensional (15D) instrument generating an index on a 0 and 1 scale (1 for best). The results were compared with the corresponding childhood 17-dimensional instrument and an adult control group from the general population. Psychosocial adjustment was assessed with the ASEBA Adult Self Report (ASR) and compared with the childhood Child Behavior Checklist assessments.
   Results. Half of the patients (52%) had a secondary level general or vocational education. The educational outcome was evenly distributed (compulsory vs. secondary) regardless of previous childhood brain ischemia. The ASR Total Problems score was in the normal range for all patients. Four patients had scores in the pathological range for Externalizing or Internalizing Problems. There was a correlation between the childhood Child Behavior Checklist problem scores and the adult ASR scores for Internalizing and Total Problems but not for Externalizing Problems. Their mean 15D HRQOL index was 0.94 and lower than for the control group (0.97, P=0.04). There was a strong correlation between the childhood 17-dimensional and the adult 15D HRQOL index (r=0.63, P=0.003).
   Conclusion. The long-term outcome is fair in former high-risk pediatric TX patients with neurological comorbidity. Childhood psychosocial adjustment and HRQOL may predict the outcome in adults.

AB This article considers the application of selected components of self-regulated learning (SRL; Zimmerman 2000) to student-content interaction in online learning and distance education (DE). In particular we discuss how, when interacting with electronically enhanced text, students must carefully employ self-regulated learning strategies that include planning, goal setting, self-monitoring processes, and calibration judgments. Because the student is often learning independently in DE courses, and because of the potential for non-linear navigation through online learning materials, we argue that the careful deployment of SRL skills is especially critical for successful outcomes. Consequently we discuss examples of how the demands of student-content interactions put students with self-regulation difficulties at risk of failure. We highlight research on learners who have poor SRL skills, inadequate calibration capabilities, and low executive functions in order to highlight areas of particular difficulty and areas in which support might be most beneficial. We conclude with the recognition that while support strategies can be derived from the research literature, there is a great need for research that addresses questions about student-content interaction in DE course settings specifically, and pertains to the increasingly diverse group of learners who take these courses.

AB Objectives: This study examined personality characteristics and identified personality subtypes of adults with childhood histories of traumatic separations from a parent. Previous work from attachment theory and developmental psychopathology suggests that distinct developmental trajectories might lead to different styles of personality adaptation after an attachment disruption. Design: Randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists provided data on 203 adults with histories of traumatic separations using a personality pathology instrument designed for use by clinically experienced observers, the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure (SWAP-II). Results: Using a Q-factor analysis, 5 distinct personality subtypes were identified: internalizing/avoidant, psychopathic, emotionally dysregulated, hostile/paranoid, and resilient. Initial support for the validity of the subtypes was established, based on Axis I and Axis II pathology, adaptive functioning, developmental history, and family history variables. Conclusions: Both therapeutic interventions and case formulation might be strengthened by considering an individual's personality features and match to one of the identified subtypes.

AB This article describes the training and consultation procedures implemented to adapt and pilot modular psychotherapy for use by therapists treating youth with depression and anxiety in school-based health centers (SBHCs). Module selection and adaptation decisions were data driven and intended to increase compatibility with the school context. Seven SBHC therapists in the district participated in the yearlong training and consultation program. Findings indicated that participating therapists were able to successfully select appropriate students for treatment, systematically track their use of treatment modules, and administer standardized measures to monitor symptom change in 94% of their sessions. In the context of these findings, we discuss practitioner engagement barriers and solutions, school-based therapist use of standardized assessment tools, and the utility of a brief SBHC intervention model.

AB This paper presents the results of a study that describes the sleep routines in a sample of 2400 Andalusian adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years and its relation to three indicators of psychological adjustment such as substance use, and internalizing and externalizing problems, both assessed by the Youth Self Report (YSR; Achenbach, 1991). The results indicate that, particularly among older teens, there is a significant sleep deprivation during school days, and a delay in bedtime hours during weekends. These sleep routines were significantly related to psychological adjustment, since those boys and girls who reported sleeping fewer hours and going to bed later on weekends had a worse emotional and behavioral adjustment. The article suggests the importance of developing some measures to allow teens healthier sleep routines.

Applying criteria from an earlier systematic review (Rones & Hoagwood, 2000) of such programs for all populations indicated substantially fewer effective programs for low-income, urban youth. The meta-analysis similarly failed to indicate effects of the typical program on primary outcomes. Effectiveness was evident, however, for programs that targeted internalizing problems or had a broader socio-emotional focus and those delivered to all youth (i.e., universal). In contrast, negative effects were apparent for programs that targeted externalizing problems and were delivered selectively to youth with existing problems. Distinctive characteristics of low-income, urban schools and nonschool environments are emphasized as potential explanations for the findings.

AB Background: Prior studies have shown that children with congenital hearing loss have increased rates of behavior disorders. Child hearing loss has also been reported to be associated with increased maternal stress. Little is known about the behavior or the predictors of behavioral outcomes of children with hearing loss identified early and receiving Early Intervention services.
   Aim: The objective of this study was to identify the behavioral outcomes in early identified children with hearing loss and control hearing children at 18-24 months of age and to examine the impact of stress on early behavior development. It was hypothesized that children with hearing loss will have more behavior problems, and maternal stress will be associated with child behavior problems.
   Study design: Prospective observational.
   Subjects: Children with and without congenital hearing loss and their mothers.
   Outcome measures: The Parenting Stress Index and the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Children with hearing loss had increased scores for withdrawn and internalizing behavior. In multivariate analyses after adjusting for hearing loss, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay, and socioeconomic status, maternal stress independently contributed to higher scores for internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and total behavior problems.
   Conclusion: Maternal stress is an important correlate of behavior problems for children with hearing loss and should be considered by Early Intervention providers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine changes in behavioral and emotional problems among opioid-dependent adolescents during a 4-week combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment.
   Methods: We examined scales of behavioral and emotional problems in youth using the Youth Self-Report measure at the time of substance abuse treatment intake and changes in scale scores during treatment participants were 36 adolescents (aged 13-18 years, eligible) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for opioid dependence. Participants received a 28-day outpatient, medication-assisted withdrawal with either buprenorphine, or clonidine, as part of a double-blind, double dummy comparison of these medications. All participants received a common behavioral intervention, composed of 3 individual counseling sessions per week, and incentives contingent on opioid-negative urine samples (collected 3 times/week) attendance and completion of weekly assessments.
   Results: Although a markedly greater number of youth who received buprenorphine remained in treatment relative to those who received clonidine, youth who remained in treatment showed significant reductions during treatment on 2 Youth Self-Report grouping scales (internalizing problems and total problems) and 4 of the empirically based syndrome scales (somatic, social, attention, and thought). On Youth Self-Report competence and adaptive scales, no significant changes were observed. There was no evidence that changes in any scales differed across medication condition.
   Conclusions: Youth who were retained demonstrated substantive improvements in a number of clinically meaningful behavioral and emotional problems, irrespective of pharmacotherapy provided to them.

AB Fatigue, a subjective state that has been defined as a decreased capacity for physical or mental activity, has many behavioral similarities to depression (e.g., weariness, difficulty concentrating, diminished motivation). We hypothesized that fatigue might mediate the relationship between depression and poor child outcomes. A sample of mothers (14 well women, 57 with multiple sclerosis, and 36 with rheumatoid arthritis) completed an online survey where they reported on their fatigue (using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), depression (using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (using the Child Behavior Checklist), and child prosocial behaviors (using a 10-item abbreviated Positive Behavior Scale). Maternal fatigue mediated the relationship between maternal depression and the total problems T-score on the Child Behavior Checklist but a mediated relationship was not found for the Positive Behavior Scale. Findings are discussed in light of the need to elucidate the relationship between maternal fatigue, depression, and child outcomes.

AB In this study we examined the relations between insecure attachment styles, commitment and behavioral problems, focusing on the unique and common contribution that avoidant and anxious styles and commitment made to internalizing and externalizing problems. 535 adolescents, 267 boys and 268 girls, aged from 16 to 18 years, completed self-report measures of attachment, identity and problem behaviors. The data showed that both internalizing and externalizing problems were positively related to insecure attachment styles and negatively to commitment. Results supported a unique contribution of both insecure styles to the prediction of internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas commitment negatively predicted only internalizing behaviors. The data supported a joint effect of avoidant attachment and commitment such that commitment contributed to moderate the display of internalizing and externalizing problems among avoidant adolescents.

   CONTROL; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDREN; ANXIETY
AB Childhood internalizing problems may occur as early as preschool, tend to be stable over time, and undermine social and academic functioning. Parent emotion regulatory behaviors may contribute to child internalizing problems and may be especially important during the preschool years when parents model emotion coping and regulation for their children. Parents who feel out of control of their preschoolers' behavior and emotional states may adopt avoidant emotion regulatory strategies. We proposed that parent depression, perceived locus of control, and experiential avoidance would be linked with internalizing symptoms in a high-risk sample of preschool-aged children. We also expected that locus of control would mediate the relationship between maternal depression, experiential avoidance, and child internalizing problems. Seventy-four urban, low-income, diverse mothers of Head Start preschool children completed rating scales measuring their own depression, locus of control, experiential avoidance, and their children's internalizing behaviors. Correlational analyses revealed that mothers reporting higher levels of depression were more likely to report experiential avoidance, feeling out of control in their parenting role, and internalizing symptoms in their children. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that locus of control explained additional unique variance in child internalizing problems over and above that explained by maternal depression. Locus of control mediated the relationship between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms. The importance of considering parent locus of control and its relation to children's internalizing symptoms is discussed as a potential target for early childhood prevention programs.

AB Objective: The present study evaluated the efficacy of the Middle School Success intervention (MSS) for reducing substance use and delinquency among girls in foster care, using a randomized controlled trial design. The program was designed to fill a service gap during the summer prior to the middle school transition and to prevent delinquency, substance use, and related problems. Method: One hundred girls in foster care and their caregivers were randomly assigned either to the intervention (n = 48) or to a regular foster care control (n = 52) condition. The girls completed a baseline (T1) assessment and follow-up assessments at 6 months (T2), 12 months (T3), 24 months (T4), and 36 months (T5) postbaseline. Caregivers participated in assessments from T1 through T4. This study is a follow-up to Smith, Leve, and Chamberlain's (2011) study, which examined immediate outcomes at T2. Results: Girls in the intervention condition showed significantly lower levels of substance use than did girls in the control condition at 36 months postbaseline. The group difference was only marginally significant for delinquency. Further analyses indicated significant indirect effects of the intervention through increased prosocial behaviors that led to decreased internalizing and externalizing symptoms and then to lower levels of substance use. The direct effect of the intervention on substance use remained significant in the presence of the indirect effects. For delinquency, the intervention had positive effects mainly through increased prosocial skills. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of providing preventive intervention services for early adolescent girls in foster care.

DT Article
DE anxiety; children; adolescents; treatment; remission
ID TRIAL; YOUTH
AB Objective: To report on remission rates in anxious youth who participated in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). The CAMS, a multisite clinical trial, randomized 488 children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years; 79% Caucasian; 50% female) with separation, social, and/or generalized anxiety disorder to a 12-week treatment of sertraline (SRT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO). Method: The primary definition of remission was loss of all study-entry anxiety disorder diagnoses; additional definitions of remission were used. All outcomes were rated by independent evaluators blind to treatment assignment. Predictors of remission were also examined. Results: Remission rates after 12 weeks of treatment ranged from 46% to 68% for COMB, 34% to 46% for SRT, 20% to 46% for CBT, and 15% to 27% for PBO. Rates of remission (i.e., achieving a nearly symptom-free state) were significantly lower than rates of response (i.e., achieving a clinically meaningful improvement relative to baseline) for the entire sample. Youth who received COMB had significantly higher rates of remission compared to all other treatment groups. Both monotherapies had higher remission rates compared to PBO, but rates were not different from each other. Predictors of remission were younger age, nonminority status, lower baseline anxiety severity, absence of other internalizing disorders (e. g., anxiety, depression), and absence of social phobia. Conclusions: For the majority of children, some symptoms of anxiety persisted, even among those showing improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, suggesting a need to augment or extend current treatments for some children.

AB Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, this study examined mothers' socialization of child emotion in suburban middle-class families in Gujarat, India. In particular, a community sample of 602 children, 6 to 8 years, was screened for emotional/behavioral problems using a parent-report measure standardized with this population. Based on the screening, four groups of children were formed: those with internalizing problems (n = 31), externalizing problems (n = 32), and somatic complaints (n = 25), and an asymptomatic control group (n = 32). Mothers of children across groups completed a previously pilot-tested, forced-choice, self-report questionnaire of their emotions and behaviors in response to their children's anger, sadness, and physical pain, and an individual open-ended interview further exploring their socialization behaviors, immediate goals, and expectations from their children. Quantitative data revealed that mothers of children in internalizing, externalizing, and somatic complaints groups reported more negative emotions (anger, disappointment, embarrassment, restlessness) and punitive/ minimizing behaviors than the control group, with the somatic-complaints group also reporting less sympathy and emotion-/ problem-focused behaviors than the control group. Qualitative data provided a culturally grounded overarching framework to understand emotion socialization in this sample, and suggested variation across groups with respect to the type of mothers' behaviors, along with expectations for appropriate behavior.

AB Children with persistent asthma are at increased risk for mental health problems. Although mechanisms of effect are not yet known, it may be that children are less trusting of the family as a source of support and security when they have more severe asthma. This study tested whether asthma severity is related to children's perceptions of insecurity in the family, and whether insecurity is in turn associated with child adjustment. Children (N = 168; mean age = 8 years) completed story stems pertaining to routine family events (e.g., mealtimes) and ambiguous but potentially threatening asthma events such as tightness in the chest. Responses were evaluated for the extent to which appraisals portrayed the family as responding in cohesive, security-provoking ways. Asthma severity was assessed by both objective lung function testing and primary caregiver report. Caregivers reported child symptomatology. Beyond medication adherence, caregiver education, and child age and gender, greater asthma severity predicted more internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Greater asthma severity, assessed using spirometry (but not parent report), was related to less secure child narratives of the family, which in turn related to more child internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that asthma can take a considerable toll on children's feelings of security and mental health. Furthermore, given the difficulty in assessing young children's perceptions, this study helps demonstrate the potential of story stem techniques in assessing children's appraisals of illness threat and management in the family.

AB This longitudinal population-based study examined pathways to nonsuicidal self-harm (NSSH) in relation to childhood sexual abuse (CSA), assault victimization in early adulthood, posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology (PTSD), and other mental disorders. At age 21, 476 men and 455 women completed interviews on assault victimization, PTSD, and other mental disorders. At age 26, they completed independent interviews on self-harm and childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors for NSSH at age 26. For men, anxiety and depressive disorders at age 21 were the only significant predictors of NSSH at age 26. For women, victimization, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders at age 21 all significantly predicted NSSH. CSA predicted later NSSH only indirectly, by increasing the risk of anxiety disorders among men and of assault victimization among women. In conclusion, pathways to nonsuicidal self-harm differed by sex. For women there were direct links with assault victimization and PTSD in early adulthood, whereas for men only internalizing disorders predicted future NSSH.

AB This study aims to understand if greater severity of maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), related to maternal report of interpersonal violence, mediates the effects of such violence on (a) child PTSS as well as on (b) child externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Study participants were mothers (N = 77) and children 18 to 48 months recruited from community pediatric clinics. Data were analyzed continuously via bivariate correlations and then multiple linear regression. Post hoc Sobel tests were performed to confirm mediation. Paternal violence accounted for 15% of the variance of child PTSS on the PCIP-OR (beta = .39, p <= .001). While the child's father being violent significantly predicts child PTSS related to domestic violence, as mentioned, when maternal PTSS is included in the multiple regression model, father's being violent becomes less significant, while maternal PTSS remains strongly predictive. Sobel tests confirmed that maternal PTSS severity mediated effects of paternal violence on clinician-assessed child PTSS as well as on maternal report of child externalizing and internalizing symptoms. When presented with a preschool-aged child who is brought to consultation for behavioral difficulties, dysregulated aggression, and/or unexplained fears, clinicians should evaluate maternal psychological functioning as well as assess and treat the effects of interpersonal violence, which otherwise may be avoided during the consultation.

AB The concept of 'internalizing behaviour' reflects a child's emotional or psychological state and typically includes depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatic complaints and teenage suicide. Genetic and environmental causes have been largely implicated, although research continues to explore social etiological factors. Some research suggests females may be especially vulnerable to internalizing disorders, while data across ethnicities are somewhat variable. Regarding treatment, cognitive-behavioural therapies and use of pharmacological approaches (i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have both shown great promise in reducing symptoms of internalizing disorders. However, given the role of the social environment, prevention programmes aimed at reducing exposure to drugs, violence/abuse and environmental toxins are highly important. Internalizing disorders are associated with a host of deleterious outcomes ( e. g. school drop-out, substance use and potentially suicide) as well as psychopathological outcomes ( e. g. co-morbid anxiety or depression, externalizing disorders - including suicide). Children with mental health problems suffer educationally and are more likely to become entangled in the justice and welfare systems. Clearly, early treatment and prevention programmes for internalizing disorders need to be a priority from a public health perspective as well as from a family and community perspective.

AB Objective: To establish the diagnostic validity of sensory overresponsivity (SOR), there is a need to document rates of SOR and the co-occurrence of SOR with other psychiatric disorders. Although this was not a diagnostic study of SOR, this study was designed to investigate rates of elevated SOR symptoms and associations between elevated SOR symptoms, psychiatric disorder status, and family impairment. Method: From a larger birth cohort followed from infancy to school age, 338 children aged 7 to 10 years (51% boys, 49% girls) and their parents participated in an intensive assessment. Parents were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) and completed the SensOR inventory and the Family Life Impairment Scale. Results: Approximately one-fifth (21.2%) of children had elevated SOR symptoms. One-fourth (24.3%) of those with an elevated SOR score met criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis, and 25.4% of children with a DSM-IV diagnosis had an elevated SOR score. Parents of children with elevated SOR alone reported a similar number of restrictions in family life as parents of those with an internalizing and/or externalizing diagnosis. SOR predicted concurrent family impairment above and beyond DSM diagnostic status and socio-demo-graphic risk. Conclusions: Elevated SOR occurs in the absence of other psychiatric conditions and is associated with impairment in family life. Services for children with comorbid elevated SOR and an externalizing disorder are needed to address the extremely high level of family impairment reported. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(12): 1210-1219.

AB Child maltreatment is strongly associated with adolescent psychopathology and substance abuse and dependence. However, developmental processes unfolding from childhood into adolescence that delineate this trajectory are not well understood. The current study used path analysis in a structural equation modeling framework to examine multiple mediator models, including ego control, ego resiliency, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms to investigate this developmental process. Participants were 415 children, assessed across 3 waves of data, (i.e., at ages 7 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 to 15). The sample included maltreated (n = 259) and nonmaltreated (n = 156) children; groups were comparable in sociodemographic characteristics. Findings support an transactional ecological model by revealing a developmental sequence in which severity of early childhood maltreatment potentiates less adaptive childhood personality functioning, followed by externalizing problems in preadolescence, and ultimately adolescent cannabis abuse and dependence symptoms. A developmental pathway from child maltreatment to adolescent cannabis abuse and dependence symptoms via personality and preadolescent internalizing problems was not supported. Understanding developmental pathways by which maltreatment experiences increase risk for substance abuse and dependence symptoms in youth has far-reaching implications for the treatment and prevention of substance use disorders.

AB Of 1,409 eligible children aged 6-13 years in grades 1 to 7 who were randomly selected from a national sample of Norwegian schools, 858 participated in the present study (60.9%). The sample was stratified by school centrality, region and size of grade cohort. The teachers assessed their children's academic performance, adaptive school functioning, and levels of emotional/behavioral problems using the 2001 version of the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Only one child was randomly selected from each grade cohort. Girls had significantly higher scores than boys in the Working Hard, Appropriate Behavior, Learning, and Total Adaptive Functioning domains. For girls, only the Working Hard domain was of medium effect size. While boys had significantly higher scores than girls on Attention, Thought Problems, Rule-Breaking, Aggression, Externalizing Problems and Total problems, only Attention Problems showed a medium effect size. Significant sex by age interaction effects were also found for Rule-Breaking, Externalizing, Internalizing, Anxious-Depressed and Total Problems. In all these comparisons, 10-13-year-old boys had significantly higher scores than 6-9-year olds, while girls had similar problem levels across age groups. Our mean Total Problems score (17.2) was lower than the grand mean (21.6) reported in a multi-country comparison but higher than in another Norwegian large-scale survey. Overall, our findings indicate that teachers in Scandinavia report, just as do parents, relatively low levels of emotional/behavioral problems among school-aged children.

AB The heterogeneity of peer rejection was examined as a function of social prominence in fifth grade classrooms. From an overall sample of 3,891 (1,931 girls) students, 721 youth (424 boys) were identified with rejected status. Social prominence was determined from the aggregation of peer nominations for leader, athletic, cool, and popular. Students with rejected sociometric status were classified into one of three prominence subtypes: high, medium, and low. Prominence subtypes were differentially linked to social behavior and peer affiliations. Although relatively few rejected students had high prominence, those who did tended to have higher levels of peer-assessed aggression, were more likely to be identified as bullies, had lower levels of internalizing behavior, and were less likely to be socially isolated and more likely to associate with socially prominent peers as compared to youth in other rejected status social prominence subtypes.

AB Using longitudinal data on fragile families, this study examines the relationships between parents' religiosity, religious homogamy, and young children's well-being, and whether these relationships vary by family structure. Results suggest that weekly service attendance by both parents is associated with lower externalizing problem behavior among young children. Results also suggest that being raised by a mother who believes that religion is important to family life is associated with higher well-being among young children raised by married parents. In contrast, having only one parent who believes religion is important to family life is associated with lower well-being among children raised in cohabiting or single-parent families. Moreover, having parents with strict religious beliefs is associated with increased internalizing problem behavior, but is also associated with a decrease in externalizing problem behavior for children raised by cohabiting parents. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of religion within fragile families, as well as the role that religion may play in early child development.

AB Object. Brain tumors are associated with behavioral and neuropsychological effects. Most available data are focused on the posttreatment neurological and cognitive deficits of these patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pretreatment neuropsychological and behavioral impairment in children with posterior fossa tumors.
   Methods. The authors studied 24 children with posterior fossa tumors who were between 4 and 15 years of age, and who were surgically treated at the authors' institute. During the period prior to the tumor excision, neuropsychological and behavioral assessments were performed. A control group of age-matched children was also studied. The children's executive functions were assessed using the short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). For the assessment of visuospatial functions, spatial memory, and visuomotor integration skills, the Bender-Gestalt Test (BGT) was used. For assessment of the visual perception and visual memory, the authors used the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT). Furthermore, parents or caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results. The WISC revealed no significant difference between patients and the control group. The CBCL revealed significant somatic concerns compared with the measure's norms. Furthermore, the patients differed in aggressiveness, somatic concerns, anxiety symptoms, internalizing of problems, and total problems. In the BGT and the BVRT results, no significant difference was observed between patients and the control group. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between neuropsychological scores and sex, age at diagnosis, histological diagnosis, presence of hydrocephalus, degree of hydrocephalus, tumor size, and tumor location.
   Conclusions. Children with posterior fossa tumors suffer more frequently from somatic concerns, aggressiveness, anxiety, and internalizing disorders compared with controls. No difference was found with respect to intelligence scores. (DOI: 10.3171/2011.8.PEDS11223)

AB Aims: To analyze mental health associations between youth's exposure to physical violence outside the home and at home, including witnessing domestic violence, and to describe gender differences in the associations. Methods: A multimedia computer-based survey among a nationally representative sample of 6,200 9th grade pupils included data on violence victimization, symptoms of anxiety and depression, psychosocial and health behaviour factors. Analyses included gender stratified cross-tabulations and logistic regressions. Results: Direct associations were found for both sexes between anxiety and depression and exposure to mild and severe physical violence both outside the home and at home. Adjusted for possible confounding factors, associations for severe violence exposure both at home and outside the home were found only among girls; odds ratio (OR): 2.4 [1.3-4.7]) and OR: 3.0 [1.1-8.6], respectively. Exposure to severe violence at home remained a strong risk factor for internalizing symptoms for boys, OR: 3.6 [1.4-9.2]. In the adjusted model, a stronger association was found between bad relationships with peers and poor mental health for boys than for girls; OR: 2.0 [1.6-2.3] and OR: 1.4 [1.3-1.6], respectively. For both sexes, witnessing physical violence against mother at home was associated with mental health problems, but did not remain a risk factor when adjusted for confounders. Conclusions: Gender differences exist in harmful mental health associations with regard to exposure to violence. For girls, violence outside the home is a stronger risk factor than violence at home, compared with boys.

AB Background. Preterm (PT) birth and low birth weight (LBW) are high-prevalence events that are associated with adverse outcomes in the longer term, with vulnerability increasing as maturity at birth decreases. Psychiatric symptomatology appears heightened in PT/LBW survivors, though there are some discordant findings from studies using questionnaire measures, particularly with respect to anxiety and depressive symptoms.
   Method. This article synthesises findings from research using clinical psychiatric diagnostic criteria in PT/LBW individuals aged 10-25 years compared with term-born peers. Key outcomes of interest were the rates of individuals receiving any psychiatric diagnosis and the number of diagnoses of anxiety or depressive disorders.
   Results. A literature search for studies reporting prevalence of 'any diagnosis' yielded five studies that met inclusion criteria, with a total of 565 PT/LBW and 533 control individuals. Also, five studies were found that reported rates of anxiety/depression (692 PT/LBW and 605 control individuals). The risk of these outcomes was increased for PT/LBW individuals compared with controls [any diagnosis : odds ratio (OR) 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-5.21; anxiety or depressive disorder : OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.73-4.73].
   Conclusions. The studies reviewed here indicate that, in addition to monitoring and management of medical and cognitive sequelae, the psychological well-being of PT/LBW individuals should be a key part of ongoing care.

AB This study examined how perceived social support from parents, classmates, and teachers jointly and uniquely predicted psychopathology (i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and wellness (i.e., life satisfaction) in a sample of 390 middle-school students. This study also explored the protective nature of high student academic achievement in the relationship between social support and mental health. Social support was a significant predictor of all mental health outcomes, particularly life satisfaction. Although classmate and teacher support were significant unique predictors of students' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively, parent support emerged as the strongest predictor of all indicators of mental health. Academic achievement moderated the direction and strength of the relationships between externalizing behavior and (a) classmate support, and (b) parent support, respectively. Specifically, classmate support emerged as adaptive for average-and high-achieving students only, whereas academic achievement functioned as a protective factor against the manifestation of externalizing psychopathology among students with low parental support. Implications for school psychologists and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Hierarchical regression analyses were used to study four types of negative emotions (rage, resentment, perceived threat, and self-blame) as possible mediators of the effect of parentchild conflict on internalizing (psychosomatic symptoms and social withdrawal) and externalizing (violent aggression and deviance) behavior in 724 adolescents. After controlling for demographic variables, the results showed that for both parents conflict had a positive main effect on internalizing and externalizing behavior. Of the four types of negative emotions, rage was the strongest mediator to mediate the effect of conflict on violent aggression, and resentment was the strongest mediator to mediate the effect of conflict on psychosomatic symptoms, social withdrawal, and deviant behavior. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered.

AB Models of social anxiety and depression in youth have been developed separately, and they contain similar etiological influences. Given the high comorbidity of social anxiety and depression, we examine whether the posited etiological constructs are a correlate of, or a risk factor for, social anxiety and/or depression at the symptom level and the diagnostic level. We find core risk factors of temperament, genetics, and parent psychopathology (i.e., depression and anxiety) are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of social anxiety and/or depression. Instead, aspects of children's relationships with parents and/or peers either mediates (i.e., explains) or moderates (i.e., interacts with) these core risks being related to social anxiety and/or depression. We then examine various parent- and peer-related constructs contained in the separate models of social anxiety and depression (i.e., parent-child attachment, parenting, social skill deficits, peer acceptance and rejection, peer victimization, friendships, and loneliness). Throughout our review, we report evidence for a Cumulative Interpersonal Risk model that incorporates both core risk factors and specific interpersonal risk factors. Most studies fail to consider comorbidity, thus little is known about the specificity of these various constructs to depression and/or social anxiety. However, we identify shared, differential, and cumulative risks, correlates, consequences, and protective factors. We then put forth demonstrated pathways for the development of depression, social anxiety, and their comorbidity. Implications for understanding comorbidity are highlighted throughout, as are theoretical and research directions for developing and refining models of social anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. Prevention and treatment implications are also noted.

AB There is evidence of gender differences in psychopathology during adolescence, but little research has investigated gender differences in trauma-related symptoms. Exposure to violence is a commonly experienced potentially traumatic event among urban adolescents, and the few studies examining gender differences in its mental health impact have produced inconsistent findings. The present study examines the moderating effects of gender on the longitudinal association between exposure to violence and a variety of mental health symptoms (externalizing, internalizing, PTSD, dissociation) in a racially diverse urban adolescent sample (N = 615; 50.6% female; Time 1 mean age = 14.15; Time 2 mean age = 16.70). For both genders, exposure to violence prospectively predicted increases in all types of symptoms. Although boys reported more exposure to violence on average, girls experiencing violence were more likely to experience dissociative (but not PTSD, internalizing, or externalizing) symptoms. The results suggest that adolescent girls exposed to potentially traumatic events may be especially vulnerable to experiencing certain trauma-related symptoms and imply gender-specific pathways to trauma-related psychopathology.

AB Adolescents with chronic pain are at risk for impairment in their friendships. They miss out on leisure activities, have increased school absence, may have fewer friends, are at an increased risk for victimization, and may be perceived by peers as less likeable. To help determine the source of these problems, the Social Information Processing Model (SIP) was adapted using narrative vignettes to determine if adolescents with chronic pain interpret friendship interactions differently in terms of supportive and nonsupportive behaviors compared to healthy peers. One hundred seven adolescents, 45 with chronic pain, completed the vignette questionnaire and a battery of measures. The vignette questionnaire included 12 vignettes to capture 3 steps in SIP processing: interpretation of cues, response construction, and response decision. Participants with chronic pain rated nonsupportive vignettes more negatively than healthy controls and indicated they would enact supportive behaviors towards the chronic pain character more often if they had been the healthy character. Age, sex, and internalizing measures did not significantly contribute to the findings. Chronic pain explained 6.5% of variance in the ratings of nonsupportive vignettes and 10.1% of the variance in supportive behavior selection. Adolescents with chronic pain may interpret nonsupportive social situations with close friends as more distressing. The endorsement of more supportive behaviors may indicate a need for, and expectation of, supportive behaviors from friends. When adolescents with chronic pain do not perceive friends as providing support, they may avoid these social situations. (C) 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB Background. Very few longitudinal studies have evaluated prospective neurodevelopmental and psychosocial risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Furthermore, despite the heterogeneous nature of OCD, no research has examined risk factors for its primary symptom dimensions, such as contamination/washing.
   Method. Potential risk factors for symptoms or diagnosis of OCD in adulthood and for specific adult obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions were examined in the Dunedin Study birth cohort. The presence of obsessions and compulsions and psychological disorders was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) at ages 26 and 32 years. Individuals with a diagnosis of OCD at either age (n=36) were compared to both a healthy control group (n=613) and an anxious control group (n=310) to determine whether associations between a risk factor and an OCD diagnosis were specific.
   Results. Childhood neurodevelopmental, behavioral, personality and environmental risk factors were associated with a diagnosis of OCD and with OC symptoms at ages 26 and 32. Social isolation, retrospectively reported physical abuse and negative emotionality were specific predictors of an adult OCD diagnosis. Of note, most risk factors were associated with OC symptoms in adulthood and several risk factors predicted specific OCD dimensions. Perinatal insults were linked to increased risk for symmetry/ordering and shameful thoughts dimensions, whereas poor childhood motor skills predicted the harm/checking dimension. Difficult temperament, internalizing symptoms and conduct problems in childhood also predicted specific symptom dimensions and lower IQ non-specifically predicted increased risk for most dimensions.
   Conclusions. The current findings underscore the need for a dimensional approach in evaluating childhood risk factors for obsessions and compulsions.

AB Investigating risk factors for anti-social behavior (ASB) is particularly relevant in a poor urban and violent community of a developing country where homicide is the primary cause of death among 15-24-year olds.
   To identify individual and environmental factors associated with ASB in adolescents from an urban poor community in the outskirts of So Paulo City, Brazil.
   This cross-sectional study was based on a probabilistic sample of clusters that included all eligible households (women aged 15-49 years with a son or daughter < 18 years of age). One mother-child pair was randomly selected per household (n = 813; response rate: 82.4%). This study is focused on the age group 11-17 years (n = 248). ASB was identified by externalizing scores in the clinical range on the Child Behavior Checklist and/or the Youth Self Report. Potential correlates included individual, maternal, paternal, and familial characteristics. Backward logistic regression analysis identified independent correlates and significant interactions.
   Youths with high ASB scores were more likely to be victims of severe physical punishment and have an absent father/substitute. Maternal anxiety/depression was a risk factor only among older adolescents (15-17 years), while the presence of internalizing problems was a risk factor only among younger adolescents (11-14 years). Having a non-working mother increased the risk for ASB only among low-income adolescents.
   The recognition that certain environmental factors may have harmful effects on adolescents' mental health, and the identification of more vulnerable groups can contribute to the development of effective strategies for prevention and treatment of ASB.

AB The current study examined relations between relational aggression, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in a child clinical population. Participants included 276 children (M (age) = 9.55 years; 69% Male) who were admitted to a child psychiatric inpatient facility. Findings suggested that relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms, which in turn was associated with suicidal ideation. The test of indirect effects suggested that depressive symptoms fully accounted for the link between relational aggression and suicidal ideation. Moreover, these relations were found when also controlling for the variance associated with overt aggression, history of abuse, and social problems. Current findings appear to suggest that relational aggression is linked to depressive symptoms, which is linked to suicidal ideation within a clinical population, and as such there may be clinical utility in assessing relational aggression.

AB The tripartite model (in Clark and Watson, J Abnorm Psychol 100:316-336, 1991) comprises Negative Affect (NA), Positive Affect (PA), and Physiological Hyperarousal (PH), three temperamental-based dimensions. The current study examined the tripartite model's assumptions that (a) NA interacts with PA to predict subsequent depressive (but not anxiety) symptom developments and (b) NA interacts with PH to predict subsequent anxiety (but not depressive) symptom developments in a sample of 243 community and referred children and adolescents (42.8% boys; M age = 10.87 years, SD = 1.83). Results confirmed that individuals with a combined high NA/low PA profile display the least favorable course of depressive -but not anxiety- symptoms. In contrast with the model, the combination of NA and PH influenced the development of depression, but not anxiety. Relations were not moderated by sex or sample. Results revealed that the assessment of the tripartite components is warranted as it can help to identify children at risk for an unfavorable depressive symptom course.

AB This study examines adolescent hope as a mediator between connectedness to mother and father, and positive and negative child outcomes. Participants included 489 adolescents aged 9 to 14 years (M = 11.29; SD = 1.01) and their parents from the Flourishing Families Project, and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results suggested that hope mediated the relation between child-reported parent-child connectedness and adolescents' prosocial behavior, school engagement, and internalizing behavior. Mother-and father-reported connectedness were not related to adolescent hope but were directly related to behavioral outcomes. This study highlights the importance of adolescents' cognitive-motivational processes for both positive and negative outcomes and has important implications for prevention and intervention programs.

AB Background: Children raised in institutional settings experience marked deprivation in social and environmental stimulation. This deprivation may disrupt brain development in ways that increase risk for psychopathology. Differential hemispheric activation of the frontal cortex is an established biological substrate of affective style that is associated with internalizing psychopathology. Previous research has never characterized the development of frontal electroencephalogram asymmetry in children or evaluated whether adverse rearing environments alter developmental trajectories.
   Methods: A sample of 136 children (mean age = 23 months) residing in institutions in Bucharest, Romania, and a sample of community control subjects (n = 72) participated. Half of institutionalized children were randomized to a foster care intervention. Electroencephalogram data were acquired at study entry and at ages 30, 42, and 96 months. A structured diagnostic interview of psychiatric disorders was completed at 54 months.
   Results: Children exhibited increases in right relative to left hemisphere frontal activation between the second and fourth years of life, followed by an increase in left relative to right hemisphere activation. Children reared in institutions experienced a prolonged period of increased right hemisphere activation and a blunted rebound in left frontal activation. Foster care placement was associated with improved developmental trajectories but onlyamongchildren placed before 24 months. The development trajectory of frontal electroencephalogram asymmetry in early childhood predicted internalizing symptoms at 54 months.
   Conclusions: Exposure to adverse rearing environments can alter brain development, culminating in heightened risk for psychopathology. Interventions delivered early in life have the greatest potential to mitigate the long-term effects of these environments.

AB This study compared adult women with childhood ADHD to adult women without childhood ADHD and to adult men with childhood ADHD. The participants, all from a larger longitudinal study, included 30 women and 30 men (approximately age 23 to 24) with childhood ADHD, and 27 women without ADHD. Women with childhood ADHD were matched to comparison women on age, ethnicity, and parental education, and to men with childhood ADHD on age, ethnicity, and IQ. Self- and parent-reports of internalizing, interpersonal, academic, and job impairment, as well as substance use and delinquency indicated group differences on measures of self-esteem, interpersonal and vocational functioning, as well as substance use. Follow-up planned comparison tests revealed that almost all of these differences emerged by diagnostic status, and not by gender. This study adds to research on the negative adult outcomes of ADHD and demonstrates that the outcomes of men and women with childhood ADHD are relatively similar.

AB Although the acculturation gap generally has been associated with poor mental health outcomes among Asian American children, some studies have failed to find a significant relationship between the gap and distress. Using two different methods of operationalizing the gap between mothers and their children, the current study addressed this tension in the literature by testing the following hypotheses in a sample of Korean American families. It was hypothesized that mother-adolescent discrepancies in acculturation and enculturation levels would be associated with youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms and that parent-adolescent communication would moderate the gap-distress relationship. Multi-informant questionnaires were administered to 77 Korean American mother-adolescent dyads from the Midwest. Surprisingly, results indicated that consonance in low levels of mother-adolescent enculturation was associated with the highest levels of externalizing symptoms (interaction term method). Adolescents' perception of communication with their fathers significantly moderated the relationship between the enculturation gap and internalizing symptoms, such that in dyads with a greater enculturation gap, less perceived open communication with fathers was associated with more internalizing symptoms (difference score method). Clinically, the findings indicate a potential target (i.e., parent-adolescent communication) for treatment programs that aim to improve family relations and youth adjustment in immigrant families.

AB The current study examined associations between maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and infant emotional reactivity and emotion regulation during the first year of life in a primarily low-income, urban, ethnic/racial minority sample of 52 mother-infant dyads. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their own trauma exposure history and current PTSD and depressive symptoms and their infants' temperament when the infants were 6 months old. Dyads participated in the repeated Still-Face Paradigm (SFP-R) when the infants were 6 months old, and infant affective states were coded for each SFP-R episode. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing infant trauma exposure history and infant current emotional and behavioral symptoms when the infants were 13 months old. Maternal PTSD symptoms predicted infants' emotion regulation at 6 months as assessed by (a) infant ability to recover from distress during the SFP-R and (b) maternal report of infant rate of recovery from distress/arousal in daily life. Maternal PTSD symptoms also predicted maternal report of infant externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation symptoms at 13 months. Maternal PTSD was not associated with measures of infant emotional reactivity. Neither maternal depressive symptoms nor infant direct exposure to trauma accounted for the associations between maternal PTSD symptoms and infant outcomes. These findings suggest that maternal PTSD is associated with offspring emotion regulation difficulties as early as infancy. Such difficulties may contribute to increased risk of mental health problems among children of mothers with PTSD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Relatively little is known about the significance of normal variation in objectively assessed sleep duration and its regularity in children's psychological well-being.
   Purpose We explored the associations between sleep duration and regularity and behavioral and emotional problems in 8-year-old children.
   Methods A correlational design was applied among an epidemiological sample of children born in 1998. Sleep was registered with an actigraph for seven nights (range 3 to 14) in 2006. Mothers (n=280) and fathers (n=190) rated their child's behavioral problems with the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results Children with short sleep duration had an increased risk for behavioral problems, thought problems, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition-based attention-deficit hyperactivity problems according to maternal ratings. Based on paternal ratings, short sleep duration was associated with more rule-breaking and externalizing symptoms. Irregularity in sleep duration from weekdays to weekends was associated with an increased risk for specifically internalizing symptoms in paternal ratings.
   Conclusions The results highlight the importance of sufficient sleep duration and regular sleep patterns from weekdays to weekends. Short sleep duration was associated specifically with problems related to attentional control and externalizing behaviors, whereas irregularity in sleep duration was, in particular, associated with internalizing problems.

   IMPACT; SKILLS
AB Background: Malaria is a leading cause of ill health and neuro-disability in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Impaired cognition is a common outcome of malaria with neurological involvement. There is also a possibility that academic achievement may be affected by malaria with neurological involvement given the association between cognitive ability and academic achievement. This study investigated the effect of malaria with neurological involvement on cognitive ability, behaviour and academic achievement.
   Methods: This prospective case-control study was carried out in Kampala City, Uganda between February 2008 and October 2010. Sixty-two children with a history of malaria with neurological involvement were followed up and given assessments for cognitive ability (working memory, reasoning, learning, visual spatial skills and attention), behaviour (internalizing and externalizing problems) and academic achievement (arithmetic, spelling and reading) three months after the illness. Sixty-one community controls recruited from the homes or neighbouring families of the cases were also given the same assessments. Tests scores of the two groups were compared using analysis of covariance with age, sex, level of education, nutritional status and quality of the home environment as covariates. This study was approved by the relevant ethical bodies and informed consent sought from the caregivers.
   Results: Children in the malaria group had more behavioural problems than the community controls for internalizing problems (estimated mean difference = -3.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), = -6.34 to -1.08, p = 0.007). There was marginal evidence of lower attention scores (0.40, CI = -0.05 to 0.86, p = 0.09). However, excluding one child from the analyses who was unable to perform the tests affected the attention scores to borderline significance (0.32, CI, = 0.01 to 0.62, p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other cognitive abilities or in academic achievement scores.
   Conclusion: Malaria with neurological involvement affects behaviour, with a minimal effect on attention but no detectable effect on academic achievement at three months post discharge. This study provides evidence that development of cognitive deficits after malaria with neurological involvement could be gradual with less effect observed in the short term compared to the long term.

AB Background. Child psychopathology can be understood as normal development gone awry Attention to psychosocial and behavioural problems has long been recommended as a critical component of well-child care. Likewise, screening for emotional and behavioural problems has been recommended as a routine part of health supervision visits. Different screening instruments have been developed and are widely used. Most of them include a dimensional measurement for internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems, but there is also the need to develop screening algorithms for specific psychiatric syndromes. Objective. To present the concurrent validity and efficiency indicators of the Brief Screening and Diagnostic Questionnaire, CBTD, in a primary care health center (PCHC) at Mexico City, as a tool for the surveillance of mental health on children and adolescents. Materials and method. A sample of 667 consecutive patients (4-16 years old) whose parents responded the CBTD. All patients who obtained a score of five or more symptoms were clinically interviewed using the MINI-KID, together with one of every ten subjects with a lower score. Results. Efficiency showed a sensitivity of 68%, specificity of 82%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 57%. When two or more CBTD syndromes are present the PPV is almost 100%. Concurrent validity showed a fair agreement for most of the CBTD syndromes as compared to DSM-IV diagnoses. Syndromes suggesting brain abnormalities, not included in scales of other widely used screening instruments, showed a PPV of 92% and NPV of 96.4%. Conclusions. The screening results from the CBTD can be used either categorically or dimensionally facilitating the surveillance of mental health on children and adolescents as different syndromatic profiles can be identified and followed for evaluation, along with complementary familial and psychosocial information.

AB Temperament was examined as a moderator of maternal parenting behaviors, including warmth, negativity, autonomy granting, and guidance. Observations of parenting and questionnaire measures of temperament and adjustment were obtained from a community sample (N=214; ages 8-12). Trajectories of depression and anxiety were assessed across 3 years. The pattern of parenting as a predictor of internalizing symptoms depended on temperament. Maternal negativity predicted increases in depression for children low in fear. Effortful control moderated sensitivity to maternal negativity, autonomy granting, and guidance. Children low in effortful control reported more symptoms in the presence of negative or poor-fitting parenting. The results support differential responding, but also suggest that temperament may render children vulnerable for the development of problems regardless of parenting.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the unique contribution of two aspects of emotion regulation (awareness and coping) to the development of internalizing problems in 11-year-old high-functioning children with an autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) and a control group, and the moderating effect of group membership on this. The results revealed overlap between the two groups, but also significant differences, suggesting a more fragmented emotion regulation pattern in children with HFASD, especially related to worry and rumination. Moreover, in children with HFASD, symptoms of depression were unrelated to positive mental coping strategies and the conviction that the emotion experience helps in dealing with the problem, suggesting that a positive approach to the problem and its subsequent emotion experience are less effective in the HFASD group.

AB The current study examined concurrent and longitudinal relations between maternal negative affective behaviour and child negative emotional expression in preschool age children with (n=96) or without (n=126) an early developmental risk, as well as the predictions of later behaviour problems. Maternal negative affective behaviour, child externalizing emotional expression, and child internalizing emotional expression were observed during a number of lab tasks at child ages 4 and 5, and child externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems were assessed via maternal questionnaire at age 6. Path analyses using structural equation modeling were utilized to test the relations among the variables at ages 4, 5, and 6. A parent-driven model of emotion socialization emerged, wherein stronger relations were found among maternal negative affect and child externalizing emotions and behaviours than among maternal negative affect and child internalizing emotions and behaviours. Early child risk did not appear to alter the overall emotion socialization process, although higher levels of maternal and child negativity were observed for the children with a developmental risk.

AB Objectives: To compare the dimensional psychopathology in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BP) with offspring of community control parents as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Methods: Offspring of parents with BP, who were healthy or had non-BP disorders (any psychiatric disorder other than BP; n = 319) or who had bipolar spectrum disorders (n = 35), and offspring of community controls (n = 235) ages 6-18 years were compared using the CBCL, the CBCL-Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP), and a sum of the CBCL items associated with mood lability. The results were adjusted for multiple comparisons and for any significant between-group demographic and clinical differences in both biological parents and offspring.
   Results: With few exceptions, several CBCL (e. g., Total, Internalizing, and Aggression Problems), CBCL-DP, and mood lability scores in non-BP offspring of parents with BP were significantly higher than in offspring of control parents. In addition, both groups of offspring showed significantly lower scores in most scales when compared with offspring of parents with BP who had already developed BP. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the rates of subjects with CBCL T-scores that were two standard deviations or higher above the mean.
   Conclusions: Even before developing BP, offspring of parents with BP had more severe and higher rates of dimensional psychopathology than offspring of control parents. Prospective follow-up studies in non-BP offspring of parents with BP are warranted to evaluate whether these dimensional profiles are prodromal manifestations of mood or other disorders, and can predict those who are at higher risk to develop BP.

AB Recent findings from Western developed countries have linked home chaos to children's cognitive performance and behavioral problems. In the present paper we test whether the same pattern of associations can be replicated in a non-Western developing country. Our sample was 203 Pakistani primary school children. To assess home chaos the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) was translated into Urdu and administered to mothers. Children were assessed using the parent and teachers rating forms of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Home chaos was not related to children's cognitive performance. However, replicating previous findings from Western developed countries, greater home chaos uniquely predicted higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems as well as lower levels of adaptive behavior in Pakistani children, as rated by both mothers and teachers.

AB This study examined the prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDS) among psychiatric patients aged 2-17 years in an electronic health records database (N = 11,457) and determined patterns of comorbid diagnoses among patients with a SUD to inform emerging comparative effectiveness research (CER) efforts. DSM-IV diagnoses of all inpatients and outpatients at a large university-based hospital and its associated psychiatric clinics were systematically captured between 2000 and 2010: SUD, anxiety (AD), mood (MD), conduct (CD), attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), personality (PD), adjustment, eating, impulse-control, psychotic, learning, mental retardation, and relational disorders. The prevalence of SUD in the 2-12-year age group (n = 6210) was 1.6% and increased to 25% in the 13-17-year age group (n = 5247). Cannabis diagnosis was the most prevalent SUD, accounting for more than 80% of all SUD cases. Among patients with a SUD (n = 1423), children aged 2-12 years (95%) and females (75-100%) showed high rates of comorbidities; blacks were more likely than whites to be diagnosed with CD, impulse-control, and psychotic diagnoses, while whites had elevated odds of having AD, ADHD, MD, PD, relational, and eating diagnoses. Patients with a SUD used more inpatient treatment than patients without a SUD (43% vs. 21%); children, females, and blacks had elevated odds of inpatient psychiatric treatment. Collectively, results add clinical evidence on treatment needs and diagnostic patterns for understudied diagnoses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research on conduct disorder has historically used primarily male samples. More recently, researchers have made an effort to include female participants. This article examines research published between the years of 2000 and 2011, providing a review of similarities and differences in development and expression of conduct disorder across gender. Many contextual variables, such as negative parenting and impoverished environment, appear to serve as risk factors for both males and females. Girls with conduct disorder differ from boys in associations with internalizing disorders and temperamental variables. Implications for theory and treatment are discussed. Methodological issues and potential ways to improve upon the current body of literature are addressed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little research exists on how young children cope with traumatic events, including exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). Available research reveals that many young children who witness IPV suffer greater adjustment problems than non-exposed children, while others appear to fare well despite violence exposure. Taking a developmental psychopathology perspective, this review seeks to consolidate current research on the impact of IPV exposure, focusing on relevant developmental domains of the preschool years. Specifically, it addresses the psychological functioning of preschool children following IPV exposure, including problematic internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as posttraumatic stress. This review also explores cognitive and physical functioning following exposure to interpersonal violence, as well as the socio-emotional consequences of witnessing violence. Following an examination of the impact of IPV exposure on preschool children, this review evaluates resilient coping and those children who seem to function well despite witnessing violence in the home. Finally, potential future research directions, as well as clinical implications, are suggested to provide a complete picture of the role IPV exposure plays in young children's development.

AB This study used data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, a multilevel, longitudinal study of children sampled from 80 diverse neighborhoods, to explore associations among changes in neighborhood poverty from 1990 to 2000 and changes in youth's internalizing problems and property and violent offenses over 6 years (N = 3,324; mean age across waves = 12.6 years). After accounting for a host of background characteristics and weighting for the propensity to stay in the original sampled neighborhood, results indicated that neighborhood poverty dynamics were unfavorably linked to boys' problem behaviors. In high-poverty (>30% in 1990) neighborhoods, decreasing poverty was associated with boys' greater internalizing problems and higher probability of increasing in violent behavior than stable neighborhood poverty. In moderate-poverty (20%-30% in 1990) neighborhoods, boys in neighborhoods that got poorer had more internalizing problems than boys in stably poor neighborhoods. Likewise, in low-poverty (<20% in 1990) neighborhoods, increasing poverty was associated with boys' higher probability of increasing in violent behavior than stable neighborhood poverty. Effect sizes were larger in high-and moderate-poverty neighborhoods than in low-poverty neighborhoods. This study complements the neighborhood mobility literature and has implications for interventions aimed at community revitalization.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fetal growth predicts childhood behavioral problems associated with brain serotonergic systems. We hypothesized that allelic variations in genes involved in serotonergic function would moderate associations between birth weight (BW) and internalizing traits in childhood.
   METHODS: The Child Behavior Checklist was administered to 545 healthy Singaporean children at 8 to 12 years. BW, corrected for gestational age, and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TPH2, HTR2A, and SCL6A4 genes were investigated.
   RESULTS: There was no significant main effect of BW on internalizing T scores (F = 1.08; P = .36). After multiple corrections, significant main effects on internalizing T scores were found for HTR2A rs2296972 (adjusted: F = 2.85; P = .019) and HTR2A rs6313 (adjusted: F = 5.91; P = .0002). Significant interactions were found between BW and SNPs for the TPH2 gene (rs2171363: P = .008; rs7305115: P = .007) and the HTR2A gene (rs2770304: P = .001; rs6313: P = .026) for internalizing T scores. The CC genotype of TPH2 rs2171363, GG genotype of TPH2 rs7305115, CC genotype of HTR2A rs2770304, and CC genotype of HTR2A rs6313 were associated with reduced internalizing scores for children born in the quartile above the midpoint. No significant main effects or interactions were found for SCL6A4 SNPs.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sequence variations in genes involved in serotonergic functions modulate relationships between BW and internalizing traits and might be candidates for plasticity mechanisms that determine individual differences in responses to environmental influences over the course of development.

AB The authors examined the utility of a modified version of the Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders for use at the high school level to address issues of comorbidity. Results suggested that the modified version was able to discriminate among students with varying degrees of risk in terms of academic performance as measured by GPA. In terms of convergent validity, teachers were able to differentiate between the social skills of students rated with typical behaviors and those at risk for externalizing or comorbid behaviors in terms of cooperation, self-control, school adjustment, and empathy skills. Furthermore, teachers were better able to discriminate externalizing behaviors relative to internalizing behaviors. Overall, solely relying on teacher nominations may be sufficient for discriminating between the presence versus absence of risk. However, it may not be sufficient to discriminate among the presence of different types of risk, particularly internalizing behaviors. Limitations and educational implications are discussed.

AB The present study examined the relationships between caregivers' self-reported positive and negative emotional expressiveness, observer assessments of children's emotion regulation, and teachers' reports of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a sample of 97 primarily African American and Hispanic Head Start families. Results indicated that higher caregiver negativity and lower child emotion regulation independently predicted more internalizing behavior problems in children. Additionally, children's externalizing behavior problems were negatively predicted by caregivers' self-reports of positive emotional expressiveness. Importantly, results also suggested that caregivers' emotional expressiveness and children's behavioral problems may be non-linearly related, and that child gender may play an important moderating role. These results emphasize the importance of family emotional climate and child emotion regulation in the behavioral development of preschool-age children, and highlight the need for improved theoretical and practical understanding of socioemotional development in diverse populations.

AB Over the past few decades there has been a dramatic increase in children being raised by grandparents due to a variety of factors including child maltreatment, parental abandonment, substance abuse, and incarceration. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of behavior problems in children being raised by grandmothers and to determine factors in their current environment that are related to child behavior problems. The study draws on McCubbin's resiliency model of family stress, adjustment and adaptation.
   The sample comprised of 230 children ages 2 to 16 years who were being raised by grandmothers in parent-absent homes. The families were predominantly low income and African American. The grandmothers ranged in age from 37 to 80 years. Grandmothers responded to several self-report measures pertaining to child behavior problems, family resources, social support, and caregiver psychological distress. Trained research assistants completed a standardized observational measure of the home environment.
   Results indicated that 31.3% of child participants scored in the clinically elevated range for total behavior problems, with 21.3% and 32.6% scoring in the elevated range for internalizing and externalizing behaviors, respectively. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that of the variables examined, increased psychological distress in grandmothers was most predictive of child behavior problems, followed by less supportive home environments and fewer family resources.
   Results of the present study underscore the need for interventions that focus on reducing child behavior problems, as well as enhancing the parenting skills of grandmothers raising grandchildren. Findings also support the need for strategies to reduce stress in grandmother caregivers and to improve access to resources needed to provide supportive home environments for their grandchildren.

AB Youth in foster care often undergo multiple transitions before reaching adulthood, and these transitions often create significant stress and can exacerbate emotional and behavioral problems. A measurement instrument (the Youth Experience of Transitions, or YET) was designed to assess foster care youths' understanding of transitions, and this instrument was tested on a group of youth undergoing an intervention program designed to assist them in coping with the stress of these transitions while in foster care. The intervention was based on the Transitions Framework by William Bridges and was implemented in multiple community agencies with funding from the Andrus Family Fund. Using factor analysis, we found that the YET contained two factors representing (1) openness and (2) determination. For youth in the participating foster care programs, growth in openness from baseline to 6 months was linked to a significant decrease in internalizing symptoms; no significant links were found for externalizing symptoms. Implications for foster care intervention programs are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current analysis was designed to critically examine the tendency to focus on child maltreatment as a unique risk factor and test the resulting assumption of a direct causal relationship between early maltreatment and later behavioral problems. The variation seen in behavioral outcomes among children reported for maltreatment early in life led us to hypothesize that the cumulative level of risk facing children and their families can, at least in part, account for that variation in outcome. Participants were 242 mothers of predominantly at-risk newborn infants who were interviewed shortly after giving birth. The State Central Registry of Maltreatment was then reviewed over each child's first four years of life to assess for early maltreatment. Following the neonatal interviews, mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist when their children were 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 years-of-age. Although early maltreatment report does appear to be important to early child functioning, the cumulative level of risk more strongly predicts long-term clinical behavioral difficulty. High-risk children who were not reported for maltreatment by age 4 demonstrate greater behavioral problem trajectories than did low-risk children with a maltreatment report. Maltreatment itself may be best conceptualized as an important, but not singularly so, risk factor for later behavioral problems. In focusing directly on reported maltreatment, our child protective systems may be paying too little attention to what else is going wrong in the lives of children and targeting intervention efforts in the wrong direction. When it comes to early maltreatment our child protective policy and practice need to broaden their lenses to include greater emphasis on overall family functioning, stress and well-being. Early maltreatment, it seems, may be a symptom of more profound problems in the early environments of our most vulnerable children, rather than the problem itself. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Children of substance abusers are at risk for behavioral/emotional problems. To improve outcomes for these children, we developed and tested an intervention that integrated a novel contingency management (CM) program designed to enhance compliance with an empirically-validated parent training curriculum. CM provided incentives for daily monitoring of parenting and child behavior, completion of home practice assignments, and session attendance.
   Methods: Forty-seven mothers with substance abuse or dependence were randomly assigned to parent training + incentives (PTI) or parent training without incentives (PT). Children were 55% male, ages 2-7 years.
   Results: Homework completion and session attendance did not differ between PTI and PT mothers, but PTI mothers had higher rates of daily monitoring. PTI children had larger reductions in child externalizing problems in all models. Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) analyses showed additional significant effects of PTI on child internalizing problems, parent problems and parenting. These effects were not significant in standard Intent-to-Treat analyses.
   Conclusion: Results suggest our incentive program may offer a method for boosting outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychobiological models of allostatic load have delineated the effects of multiple processes that contribute to risk for psychopathology. This approach has been fruitful, but the interactive contributions of allostatic and environmental load remain understudied in early childhood. Because this developmental period encompasses the emergence of internalizing problems and biological sensitivity to early experiences, this is an important time to examine this process. In two studies, we examined allostatic and environmental load and links to subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems. Study 1 examined relations between load indices and maladjustment, concurrently and at multiple times between age 2 and kindergarten; Study 2 added more comprehensive risk indices in a sample following a group of highly fearful toddlers from 2 to 3 years of age. Results from both studies showed that increased allostatic load related to internalizing problems as environmental risk also increased. Study 2, in addition, showed that fearfulness interacted with allostatic and environmental load indices to predict greater anxiety among the fearful children who had high levels of allostatic and environmental load. Taken together, the findings support a model of risk for internalizing characterized by the interaction of biological and environmental stressors, and demonstrate the importance of considering individual differences and environmental context in applying models of allostatic load to developmental change in early childhood.

AB Children living with perinatal HIV illness (PHIV+) disproportionately reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods and contend with persistent mental health challenges. This study examined the influences of disadvantaged residential neighborhood on anxiety and depression, and potential resources that buffer against internalizing problems when youths were exposed to neighborhood stressors. Multilevel analysis of 196 PHIV+ and 129 perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected youth (PHIV-) in New York City found that higher exposure to neighborhood disorder was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety for PHIV+ and PHIV- youths. Stressful events unrelated to residential neighborhoods significantly mediated the relationship between neighborhood disorder and anxiety and depression. Social problem solving and religiosity did not moderate the relationship between neighborhood disorder and internalizing problems. Our findings highlighted that interventions that attenuate the negative effects of stressful life events were equally critical in addressing the broader impact of disadvantaged neighborhoods on the mental health of youth affected by HIV.

AB Previous research has provided inconsistent evidence for the relations between young children's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning and their temperament, parenting, and adjustment. Building biopsychosocial models of adjustment, we examined how temperamental inhibition and maternal punishment contributed to preschoolers' adrenocortical activity while interacting with adult strangers. We also examined whether HPA functioning moderated relations between dispositional and familial factors and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. A total of 402 preschool-aged children from three independent samples with parallel and overlapping measures were studied. Salivary cortisol levels were measured twice while interacting with adult strangers during testing protocols. Mothers reported on temperamental inhibition, maternal punishment and children's problems. Maternal punishment predicted higher cortisol levels 20 and 65 min after meeting adult strangers. Prolonged cortisol elevation was associated with having fewer externalizing problems. Boys who experienced more maternal punishment and had higher cortisol 20 min after meeting strangers manifested more externalizing problems. Girls who were more inhibited and had prolonged cortisol elevations had more internalizing problems. In accord with biopsychosocial models of psychopathology, HPA functioning in preschoolers was sensitive to variations in socialization experiences, and moderated children's risk for emotional and behavioral problems.

AB Background: In previous studies, maternal expressed emotion (EE) has been found to be a good predictor of the course of adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, these studies have been cross-section as opposed to longitudinal. The goal of this study is to examine longitudinal data of perceived maternal EE and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms to determine if maternal EE affected the course of adolescent symptoms (a parent effect model), or if the course of adolescent symptoms affected maternal EE (a child effect model), or if maternal EE and adolescent symptoms affected one another bidirectionally. Methods: Dutch adolescents (N = 497; 57% boys; M = 13 years) from the general community and their mothers were prospectively studied annually for three years. At all waves the mothers completed the Level of Expressed Emotion (LEE) questionnaire and the adolescents completed self-rated measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Results: The results of the SEM analyses clearly demonstrate that a child effect model best describes the relationship between maternal EE and the course of adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Conclusions: This longitudinal study of the mothers' EE perceptions suggests that it is the course of the internalizing and externalizing symptoms of adolescents from the general community that affects maternal EE, and not the mothers' perceived EE influencing the course of the adolescents' symptoms. Since this study was based on adolescents from the general community, it is suggested that these findings should also be replicated in clinical samples of adolescents.

AB Background: Prior studies of common disorders in community-dwelling adults identified internalizing and externalizing spectra of mental illness. We investigated the placement of schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder in this framework and tested the validity of the resulting organization in a clinical population. Methods: The data came from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project cohort (N = 628), which consists of first-admission patients with psychosis recruited from inpatient units throughout Suffolk County, NY (72% response rate). The sample was reassessed multiple times over the following 10 years. Complete diagnostic data were available for 469 participants. Mental health professionals diagnosed 11 target conditions based on semistructured clinical interviews, review of medical records, and reports of significant others. Two validators were included: family history of schizophrenia and 10-year illness course. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV grouping of conditions fit the data poorly. The best alternative classification consisted of three clusters: internalizing, externalizing, and schizophrenic. Both validators supported the coherence and distinctiveness of the schizophrenic cluster. Conclusions: We replicated internalizing and externalizing spectra in a clinical population, identified a schizophrenic spectrum, and provided initial evidence of its validity. These findings suggest that schizotypal personality disorder may be better placed with schizophrenia, antisocial conditions with substance use disorders, and major depression with anxiety disorders.

AB Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to classify 394 adolescents undergoing substance use treatment, based on past year psychiatric symptoms. Relations between profile membership and (a) self-reported childhood maltreatment experiences and (b) current sexual risk behavior were examined. LPA generated three psychiatric symptom profiles: Low-, High- Alcohol-, and High- Internalizing Symptoms profiles. Analyses identified significant associations between profile membership and childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect ratings, as well as co-occurring sex with substance use and unprotected intercourse. Profiles with elevated psychiatric symptom scores (e.g., internalizing problems, alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms) and more severe maltreatment histories reported higher scores for behavioral risk factors for HIV/STI exposure. Heterogeneity in psychiatric symptom patterns among youth receiving substance use treatment services, and prior histories of childhood maltreatment, have significant implications for the design and delivery of HIV/STI prevention programs to this population.

AB This study examined the influences of problem behaviors on kindergarten reading outcomes and investigated the extent to which explicit, code-based reading instruction moderated those relations among 206 children identified as being at risk of reading difficulty. Children from the classrooms of 57 kindergarten teachers in 12 schools were randomly assigned to an early reading intervention program or school-determined comparison intervention. In both conditions, children received 30 minutes of small-group supplementary reading instruction for 21 weeks. Findings from multilevel modeling revealed many associations between problem behaviors and reading outcomes for children in both conditions. Interaction analyses indicated that explicit, code-based reading intervention moderated the negative impact of externalizing problem behavior on end-of-kindergarten measures of alphabet knowledge, phonemic blending, and word reading. This type of intensive systematic reading instruction also moderated the influence of hyperactivity on children's alphabet knowledge and phonemic blending. There were no moderator effects for internalizing problem behavior.

AB Despite the widely reported link between early pubertal timing and internalizing symptoms among girls, less is known about the peer reputation of earlier maturing girls. The current study assesses whether early maturation is associated with perceived popularity and/or rumors, and whether these reputational factors help account for earlier maturing girls' vulnerability to emotional distress. Drawing on three waves of data collected from an ethnically diverse sample of middle school girls (n = 912), hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that more advanced development at the start of middle school predicted peer- and teacher-reported popularity as well as increased risk of being targeted for rumors. Mediation analyses suggested that popularity among boys can put earlier developing girls at risk for rumors. Finally, rumors acted as a partial mechanism through which early maturation was associated with subsequent internalizing symptoms. Knowledge of the peer mechanisms putting earlier developing girls at risk for psychosocial maladjustment can inform intervention and prevention efforts aimed at improving adolescent well-being.

AB Parenting practices and internalizing and externalizing problems in Spanish adolescents. The goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between parenting practices and internalizing and externalizing problems presented by a group of adolescents according to their gender. Four hundred and sixty-nine secondary school students (aged between 12 and 18) participated in this study. The adolescents presented differences in perception of the educational practices of both parents as a function of their gender. Negative parenting practices were positively related to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas positive practices were negatively related to externalizing problems. Moreover, differences between boys and girls were found in predictor variables of problems, and the predictive power of the variables was higher for externalizing problems.

AB The goal was to analyze the sex differences in symptoms, comorbidity and functional impairment in outpatient children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). A sample of 343 children, aged 8 to 17 years and diagnosed with ODD, were assessed with a semi-structured diagnostic interview and dimensional measures of psychopathology and functional impairment. Boys with ODD more frequently displayed the symptoms deliberately annoys and blames others, presented comorbid ADHD, and had greater functional impairment in school and community contexts; girls presented higher comorbidity with internalizing symptomatology (anxiety, depression and somatic complaints). Given that some clinical differences are apparent in ODD between boys and girls, it is necessary to consider the sex of the patient in order to identify and treat this disorder efficiently and effectively in boys and in girls.

AB We examined latent change score (LCS) modeling as an approach to the analysis of children's skin conductance level (SCL) throughout a stressful task-a simulated interadult argument-as it relates to externalizing and internalizing symptoms. LCS is an extension of traditional multilevel modeling (MLM), which allows estimation of proportional growth terms. Children (age 6-12 years; N = 150) were from two-parent families. Mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results indicated that the LCS models outperformed the traditional MLM. The use of LCS yielded important novel information regarding profile and pattern of responding for various children and is likely to advance understanding of relations between children's physiological responses and psychopathology symptoms.

AB Youths (N = 57; mean age = 13.83 years) residing near Tororo, Uganda, were interviewed to obtain quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to negative life events, adjustment problems, coping, social support, self-worth, and hope. On average, they experienced nearly half of the 22 negative life events assessed. The experience of negative life events related positively to internalizing problems and negatively to social support and self-worth. Coping strategies (problem-focused, positive reframing, avoidance, and support-seeking) were positively associated with hope. Problem-focused coping was negatively related to externalizing problems. Furthermore, social support was positively associated with coping strategies, self-worth, and hope and was negatively related to adjustment problems. The qualitative data shed light on the difficult events the youths endured and what types of coping strategies they used. Ultimately, interviews suggested that youths experienced many negative events, but they remained optimistic.

AB In a clinical sample of child psychiatry outpatients, chart review data were collected for 114 consecutive admissions over a 1-year period at a Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic. Data included history of documented maltreatment, potentially traumatic domestic or community violence, neglect or emotional abuse, and noninterpersonal stressors as well as demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and parent-rated child emotional and disruptive behavior problems. On a bivariate and multivariate basis, any past exposure to interpersonal violence-but not to noninterpersonal traumas-was related to more severe disruptive behavior problems, independent of the effects of demographics and psychiatric diagnoses. Noninterpersonal trauma and psychiatric diagnoses were associated with emotional problems; exposure to interpersonal violence appeared to partially account for this relationship despite not being independently associated with emotional problem severity. History of exposure to interpersonal violence warrants clinical and research attention as a severity marker and potential treatment focus in psychiatric outpatient services for children, particularly those with disruptive behavior problems.

AB Aim: To examine risk and protective factors associated with behavioural problems of children and adolescents following prenatal alcohol exposure.
   Methods: A total of 73 children and adolescents with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were assessed for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems using the Child Behavior Checklist. Linear regression models were used to determine the effects of diagnostic and environmental risk and protective factors on behaviour, while controlling for age, sex and IQ.
   Results: Length of time spent in residential care was the most pervasive risk factor associated with internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems. A low dysmorphology score was related to more internalizing and total problems.
   Conclusions: Children and adolescents prenatally exposed to alcohol faced greater risk of substantive behavioural problems (i) if they were less visibly alcohol affected and (ii) the longer time they had spent in residential care. The results underscore the clinical importance of appropriate services and care for less visibly affected children with FASD and highlight the need to attend to children with FASD being raised in institutions.

AB Although past research has found higher rates of violence, crime, and abuse among children with disabilities, most studies combine diverse forms of disability into one measure and assess exposure to only one particular type of victimization. Based on a representative national sample of 4,046 children aged 2-17 from the 2008 National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, the present study examines the associations between several different types of disability and past-year exposure to multiple forms of child victimization. Results suggest that attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit with hyperactivity disorder elevates the risk for peer victimization and property crime, internalizing psychological disorders increase risk for both child maltreatment and sexual victimization, and developmental/learning disorders heighten risk only for property crime. In contrast, physical disability did not increase the risk for any type of victimization once confounding factors and co-occurring disabilities were controlled. It appears that disabilities associated with interpersonal and behavioral difficulties are most strongly associated with victimization risks.

AB Within an allostatic load framework, the effect of Gene x Environment (G x E) interactions on diurnal cortisol regulation and internalizing symptomatology were investigated. Variation in the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) TAT haplotype and serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) was determined in a sample of maltreated (n = 238, 21.4% with early physical and sexual abuse) and nonmaltreated (n = 255) children (M age = 10.08) participating in a summer research camp. Internalizing and depressive symptoms were assessed by other and self-report. G x E effects for CRHR1 and maltreatment and early abuse on diurnal cortisol regulation were observed; CRHR1 variation was related to cortisol dysregulation only among maltreated children. Early abuse and high internalizing symptoms also interacted to predict atypical diurnal cortisol regulation. The interaction of CRHR1, 5-HTTLPR, and child maltreatment (G x G x E) identified a subgroup of maltreated children with high internalizing symptoms who shared the same combination of the two genes. The findings support an allostatic load perspective on the effects of the chronic stress associated with child maltreatment on cortisol regulation and internalizing symptomatology as moderated by genetic variation.

AB Allostasis, or the maintenance of stability through physiological change, refers to the process by which individuals adjust to the continually changing demands that are put upon somatic activity by salient events. Bauer and colleagues proposed that allostasis could be detected through patterns of the joint reactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis system under stressful conditions. We examined the associations between ANS and HPA reactivity and the development of externalizing and internalizing problems over 2 years in a sample of 215 adolescents. The interactions of ANS and HPA reactivity were contemporaneously associated with, and longitudinally predictive of, adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. Adolescents with symmetrical high reactivity across systems had more internalizing and fewer externalizing problems initially. Over time, both symmetrical and asymmetrical reactivity predicted increasing internalizing problems in girls, depending on the measure of ANS activity that was examined, heart rate, or blood pressure reactivity. Implications for the understanding of allostasis and the dynamic nature of the relations between multiple physiological regulatory systems and adolescents' developing psychopathology are discussed.

AB The current research considered the costs of caring in youths' friendships. The development of a new construct, empathetic distress, allowed for a direct test of the commonly held belief that females suffer greater vicarious distress in response to close others' stressors and problems than do males. Empathetic distress refers to one's strongly sharing a relationship partner's distress over problems to the point of taking on the partner's distress and experiencing it as one's own. This new construct was examined in an ethnically diverse sample of early adolescents who responded to a series of questionnaires in their classrooms. Results indicated that girls did experience greater empathetic distress in friendships than did boys. In addition, the current research revealed that social perspective taking in friendships (i.e., the social-cognitive ability to infer and understand the friend's perspective) had adjustment trade-offs in that it predicted greater positive friendship quality but also greater empathetic distress in the friendship. Interestingly, the associations of social perspective taking with both positive friendship quality and empathetic distress were partially mediated by co-rumination or excessive discussion of problems. Applied implications of the findings that girls' greater social perspective taking and associated co-rumination contributed both to their greater positive friendship quality but also to greater costs of caring in the form of empathetic distress are discussed.

AB Pregnancy and early motherhood involve uncertainty and change, which can evoke mental health problems. We identified maternal mental health trajectories in pre- and postnatal period, and examined their association with later child mental health and development. Finnish mothers reported psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-36]) and depressive (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-13]) symptoms in pregnancy (T1; N = 788) and two months (T2; N = 657) and 12 months (T3; N = 545) postpartum. Both parents accounted their child's mental health (Behavior Assessment System for Children [BASC]) and social (Social Skills Rating System [SSRS], Child Behavior Scale [CBS]) and cognitive development (Five to Fifteen [FTF]) when the child was 7-8 years old (T4; N = 485). We identified five trajectories depicting unique timing and course of maternal mental health from pregnancy into 1 year of mothering: Stable low levels of mental health symptoms (75%) and prenatal (6%), early postpartum (9%) and late postpartum (6%) mental health problems. The fifth trajectory, heterogeneous high levels of mental health problems (4%) was an unclassified post hoc class, combining mothers with chronic high or highly variable mental health profiles. Results show some trajectory-related timing effects on children's mental health and cognitive development. The trajectories of early postpartum and heterogeneous high levels of mental health problems predicted higher level of internalizing symptoms as compared to stable low-levels trajectory. The heterogeneous high-levels trajectory predicted higher levels of problems in executive functions than the stable low and late postpartum trajectories, and in memory tasks than children in other trajectories. We discuss the timing and course of maternal mental health from the viewpoint of infant and child development.

AB Objective: To provide a conceptual review of the literature on children of depressed parents over the past 12 years. Method: This selective review focused on published studies that delineate the diagnosis of depression in parents, have large samples, describe children 6 to 17 years old, and are methodologically rigorous. The review emphasized conceptual advances and major progress since 1998. Recent efforts in prevention research were discussed, gaps in the existing literature were noted, and directions for targeted research on children of depressed parents were highlighted. Results: Over the past 12 years there has been considerable progress in delineating the gene-by-environment interplay in determining the range of outcomes in children. In addition, progress has been made in identifying risk mechanisms and moderators that underlie the transmission of disorder and in developing effective prevention programs. Conclusions: This review highlights directions for further research, including different areas affected by parental depression in parents and children, and in understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of depression, so that preventive and treatment efforts can be tailored effectively.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationships of insulin resistance to positive as well as negative dimensions of the child's emotions, behavior and personality (hereafter referred to as "psychobehavioral characteristics") in a convenience sample of inner-city, overweight and obese, African American children.
   Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on a sample of 127 children ages 9-12 yr old who were participating in a community-based, Type 2 diabetes prevention program. Psychobehavioral characteristics of children were assessed using both child and parent ratings derived from the Behavioral Assessment for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2). Body fatness was evaluated using anthropometric techniques, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were employed with BASC scales as dependent variables and HOMA-IR as the independent variable of interest.
   Results: After adjusting for child age, pubertal stage, gender, family socioeconomic index, and intervention group assignment, child HOMA-IR was related at p<0.05 to less favorable scores for parent-report of behavioral symptoms and externalizing problems composites, and to content scales for bullying and negative emotionality. Additionally, child HOMA-IR was related at p<0.01 to less favorable scores for child-report inattention/hyperactivity composite. Body fatness suppressed the unfavorable relationship between HOMA-IR and these and other psychobehavioral characteristics as the degree of significance was higher following adjustment for body fatness in this cohort.
   Conclusion: More than one psychobehavioral characteristic were associated with body fatness and insulin resistance in the overweight children of this study. Whether the associations are due to several, or only one, of these psychobehavioral characteristics could not be determined. A much larger and future study will be needed to determine which, if any, of these psychobehavioral characteristics are independently associated with insulin resistance in overweight children.

AB Adolescent developments in limbic structures and the endogenous cannabinoid system suggest that teenagers may be more vulnerable to the negative consequences of marijuana use. This study examined the relationships between amygdala volume and internalizing symptoms in teenaged chronic marijuana users. Participants were 35 marijuana users and 47 controls ages 16-19 years. Exclusions included psychiatric (e.g., mood and anxiety) or neurologic disorders. Substance use, internalizing (anxiety/depression) symptoms and brain scans were collected after 28 days of monitored abstinence. Reliable raters manually traced amygdala and intracranial volumes on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Female marijuana users had larger right amygdala volumes and more internalizing symptoms than female controls, after covarying head size, alcohol, nicotine and other substance use (p < 0.05), while male users had similar volumes as male controls. For female controls and males, worse mood/anxiety was linked to smaller right amygdala volume (p < 0.05), whereas more internalizing problems was associated with bigger right amygdala in female marijuana users. Gender interactions may reflect marijuana-related interruptions to sex-specific neuromaturational processes and staging. Subtle amygdala development abnormalities may underlie particular vulnerabilities to sub-diagnostic depression and anxiety in teenage female marijuana users. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Chronic conditions like epilepsy in a child can affect his/her entire family. The failure of the family members to adapt adequately to the unique demands of this childhood chronic illness can be considered as an important risk factor for development of psychopathology. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to study the profile of parenting stress in parents of children with epilepsy and its correlates; and, to examine the correlates of psychopathology in these children. Material and Methods: Twenty three epileptic children and their families were subjected to Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Scores for indices such as The Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI), Benton Visual Retention test, Spence anxiety scale for children, The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children were calculated. Results: Mean verbal and performance IQ score was 94, while the mean total IQ score was 95. Mean scores for all Wechsler IQ Scores as well as Benton Visual retention test were within the average range. Means for total internalizing CBCL t scores (M, Mean=70; Standard Deviation, SD=4.4), total externalizing CBCL t scores (M=60, SD=9.6), and total behavior problems CBCL t scores (M=67, SD=5.2) were above the standard cut off levels of 65 for clinical behavioral problems. Mean score on CDI was 42 2. Scores of the PSI equal to or higher than 85 (th) percentile were considered pathologically high. Conclusion: The results of our study indicated that pediatric patients with epilepsy, specifically with intractable cases, are correlated with high levels of parental stress.

AB Co-rumination, defined as repetitive, problem-focused talk explains higher levels of friendship quality in youth (Rose, 2002) and increased levels of anxiety/depression in females. Middle adolescents (N = 146) participated in a study of co-rumination, individual coping, externalizing/internalizing problems, and peer functioning. Consistent with past research, girls reported higher levels of co-rumination and internalizing symptoms. Co-rumination was also positively correlated with self-reports, but not teacher reports, of anxiety/depression and aggressive behavior. Both self-reported number of friends and teacher-rated social acceptance were negatively associated with co-rumination. Co-rumination partially accounted for the significant indirect effect of gender on internalizing symptoms. Additionally, co-rumination was associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms but not individual coping efforts. Finally, co-rumination accounted for a unique amount of variance in internalizing symptoms, controlling for externalizing problems and secondary control coping. Theoretical implications and the importance of including broad domains of adjustment and peer functioning in future investigations of co-rumination are discussed.

AB Adolescent gang members are at higher risk for internalizing problems as well as exposure to community violence and delinquency. This study examined whether gang membership in early adolescence is associated with internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior) and whether these associations are mediated by delinquency and witnessing community violence. In a sample of 589 ethnically diverse early adolescents, gang membership was related to suicidal behavior but not depression or anxiety. Both delinquency and witnessing community violence mediated this association. Professionals working with gang members should assess these youth for suicidal behavior and provide interventions as needed. (C) 2010 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Objective: This study examines diagnoses that occur in an outpatient sample when both parent and teacher endorse significant manic symptoms and when only a parent observes them. We hypothesized that the diagnosis of mania/bipolar (BP) disorder would occur when there is parent/teacher concordance on high mania symptom scores.
   Methods: Subjects were 911 5-18-year-old psychiatrically diagnosed youths with caregiver and teacher completed Child Mania Rating Scales (CMRSs) and Achenbach parent and teacher forms. Parent-teacher concordance on the CMRS was defined as both informants >= 75 percentile on the CMRS; discordance on the CMRS was defined as parent >= 75 percentile and teacher <= 25 percentile. Logistic regression examined factors associated with a child's parent and teacher ratings concordant for high CMRS total scores.
   Results: Correlation between parent CMRS (CMRS-P) and teacher CMRS (CMRS-T) scores was r = 0.27 (p < 0.000). Correlation between the CMRS-P and the Child Behavior Checklist "bipolar/dysregulation" phenotype was r = 0.757 and between the CMRS-T and Teacher Report Form "bipolar/dysregulation" phenotype was r = 0.786. A total of 66 (7.3%) of the 911 children were diagnosed with BP I (n = 20) or II (n = 3) or BP disorder not otherwise specified (BPNOS, n = 43). If the CMRS-P score was >= 15, 14.7% (vs. 4.4%) had any BP (odds ratio: 3.6; 95% confidence interval: 2.1, 6.2). Teacher agreement or disagreement did not add to diagnostic accuracy for students with BP I or II. BPNOS was more common in children with concordant high CMRS-P and CMRS-T ratings (10.5% vs. 4.8%) but the difference was not statistically significant. However, logistic regression indicated 10-fold greater odds of both parents and teachers, providing high CMRS ratings among children who were diagnosed with externalizing disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or any combination of these). Children with internalizing disorders (anxiety and depressive disorders) were 3.7 times more likely to have discordant CMRS-P/CMRS-T ratings.
   Conclusion: Parent and teacher concordance on high mania rating scale scores was most associated with externalizing disorders, and discordance was most associated with internalizing disorders.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to examine the underlying factor structure of the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) in a large cohort of parents of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A secondary goal was to examine relationships between PSI-SF factors and autism severity, child behavior problems, and parental mental health variables that have been shown to be related to parental stress in previous research. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the three-factor structure described in the PSI-SF manual [Abidin, 1995]: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child. Results of the CFA indicated that the three-factor structure was unacceptable when applied to the study sample. Thus, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted and suggested a six-factor model as the best alternative for the PSI-SF index. Spearman's correlations revealed significant positive correlations with moderate to large effect sizes between the revised PSI-SF factors and autism severity, externalizing and internalizing child behaviors, and an index of parent mental health. The revised factors represent more narrowly defined aspects of the three original subscales of the PSI-SF and might prove to be advantageous in both research and clinical applications.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine the treatment progress of both adolescent's and their families' functioning in a new compulsory residential treatment program. The sample consisted of 339 admitted adolescents (56.3% boys). The mean age at time of entry was 15.69 (SD = 1.30). Adolescents stayed on average 9.42 months (SD = 4.66) in a new residential treatment program. Data on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed using self-reports, parent reports, and group care worker reports. In addition, adolescents reported their substance use and delinquency and parents also reported family functioning and level of perceived parental stress. The findings revealed a significant decrease in adolescents' self-reported internalizing and externalizing problems, delinquency, and substance use. According to parent ratings, a significant improvement was found concerning adolescents' problem behaviors during treatment. However, according care worker ratings, adolescents showed no improvement on internalizing problems and showed an increase in externalizing problems. Concerning families, although there was no improvement in family functioning, parental stress significantly improved over time. Further research should examine whether improvements experienced during treatment are maintained after treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sibling warmth has been identified as a protective factor from life events, but stressor-support match-mismatch and social domains perspectives suggest that sibling warmth may not efficiently protect youths from all types of life events. We tested whether sibling warmth moderated the association between each of family-wide, youths' personal, and siblings' personal life events and both depressive symptoms and risk-taking behaviors. Participants were 187 youths aged 9-18 (M = 11.80 years old, SD = 2.05). Multiple regression models revealed that sibling warmth was a protective factor from depressive symptoms for family-wide events, but not for youths' personal and siblings' personal life events. Findings highlight the importance of contextualizing protective functions of sibling warmth by taking into account the domains of stressors and adjustment.

AB In order to estimate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on 'crying without a cause' and 'being easily upset' in 2-year-old children, a large twin study was carried out. Prospective data were available for similar to 18,000 2-year-old twin pairs from the Netherlands Twin Register. A bivariate genetic analysis was performed using structural equation modeling in the Mx software package. The influence of maternal personality characteristics and demographic and lifestyle factors was tested to identify specific risk factors that may underlie the shared environment of twins. Furthermore, it was tested whether crying without a cause and being easily upset were predictive of later internalizing, externalizing and attention problems. Crying without a cause yielded a heritability estimate of 60% in boys and girls. For easily upset, the heritability was estimated at 43% in boys and 31% in girls. The variance explained by shared environment varied between 35% and 63%. The correlation between crying without a cause and easily upset (r = .36) was explained both by genetic and shared environmental factors. Birth cohort, gestational age, socioeconomic status, parental age, parental smoking behavior and alcohol use during pregnancy did not explain the shared environmental component. Neuroticism of the mother explained a small proportion of the additive genetic, but not of the shared environmental effects for easily upset. Crying without a cause and being easily upset at age 2 were predictive of internalizing, externalizing and attention problems at age 7, with effect sizes of .28-.42. A large influence of shared environmental factors on crying without a cause and easily upset was detected. Although these effects could be specific to these items, we could not explain them by personality characteristics of the mother or by demographic and lifestyle factors, and we recognize that these effects may reflect other maternal characteristics. A substantial influence of genetic factors was found for the two items, which are predictive of later behavioral problems.

TI New Dimensions in the Quantitative Classification of Mental Illness

   RISK-FACTORS; GENERALIZED SOCIAL PHOBIA; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; COMMON
   DSM-IV; ANXIETY DISORDERS; EXTERNALIZING DISORDERS; ADOLESCENT
   PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; BIPOLAR DISORDER
AB Context: Patterns of comorbidity among mental disorders are thought to reflect the natural organization of mental illness. Factor analysis can be used to investigate this structure and construct a quantitative classification system. Prior studies identified 3 dimensions of psychopathology: internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder. However, research has largely relied on common disorders and community samples. Consequently, it is unclear how well the identified organization applies to patients and how other major disorders fit into it.
   Objective: To analyze comorbidity among a wide range of Axis I disorders and personality disorders (PDs) in the general outpatient population.
   Design: Clinical cohort study.
   Setting: A general outpatient practice, the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project.
   Participants: Outpatients (N=2900) seeking psychiatric treatment.
   Main Outcome Measures: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality.
   Results: We tested several alternative groupings of the 25 target disorders. The DSM-IV organization fit the data poorly. The best-fitting model consisted of 5 factors: internalizing (anxiety and eating disorders, major depressive episode, and cluster C, borderline, and paranoid PDs), externalizing (substance use disorders and antisocial PD), thought disorder (psychosis, mania, and cluster A PDs), somatoform (somatoform disorders), and antagonism (cluster B and paranoid PDs).
   Conclusions: We confirmed the validity of the 3 previously found spectra in an outpatient population. We also found novel somatoform and antagonism dimensions, which this investigation was able to detect because, to our knowledge, this is the first study to include a variety of somatoform and personality disorders. The findings suggest that many PDs can be placed in Axis I with related clinical disorders. They also suggest that unipolar depression may be better placed with anxiety disorders than with bipolar disorders. The emerging quantitative nosology promises to provide a more useful guide to clinicians and researchers.

AB Purpose: To examine separate mediational models linking (a) menarcheal status or (b) pubertal timing to internalizing and externalizing problems through competence.
   Method: This study involved cross-sectional analyses of 262 adolescent girls (age: 11-17 years; mean = 14.93, standard deviation = 2.17) enrolled in a longitudinal study examining the association of psychological functioning and smoking with reproductive and bone health. Measures of menarcheal status (pre/post), pubertal timing (early, on-time, or late), internalizing and externalizing behavior, and perceived competence (parent and adolescent report) were obtained. Structural equation modeling was used for analyses.
   Results: Perceived competence was found to fully mediate the association between menarcheal status and parent report of internalizing and externalizing problems. For adolescent report, there was a full mediation effect for internalizing problems but a partial mediation effect for externalizing problems. Being menarcheal was related to lower competence, which was in turn related to higher internalizing and externalizing problems. Models including pubertal timing were not significant.
   Conclusions: Perceived competence is important in understanding the associations between menarcheal status and internalizing and externalizing problems. Interventions targeting competence, particularly in postmenarcheal girls, may reduce or prevent problem behaviors. (C) 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Internalizing symptoms have been associated with both higher and blunted cortisol responses in adolescents. Little attention has been paid to subjective experiences of distress in conjunction with internalizing symptoms in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to laboratory stressors. The present study examines whether adolescents' internalizing symptoms moderate the association between cortisol responses and distress in response to a common stressor in adolescence: family conflict. Differences are also examined between adolescents with current, past only, and no history of internalizing symptoms.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 70) discussed areas of conflict with their parents and subsequently reported on distress experienced during the discussion. Baseline and five poststressor saliva samples were collected. Adolescents' internalizing symptoms were assessed concurrently with the discussion and at three previous time-points.
   Results: Internalizing symptoms moderated the association between distress reported by the adolescents and cortisol reactivity in response to family conflict. Adolescents with current and past internalizing symptoms had a blunted cortisol response, whereas adolescents with no history of internalizing symptoms showed greater cortisol reactivity when reporting greater distress.
   Conclusions: This study expands the understanding of how current and remitted internalizing symptoms are related to adolescents' responses to everyday family conflicts. Adolescents with current and past internalizing symptoms demonstrated a lack of correspondence between psychological and physiological stress, whereas adolescents with no history of internalizing symptoms showed the anticipated correspondence. This study has important implications for understanding the link between internalizing symptoms and adolescents' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal functioning in response to common social stressors.

AB Although considerable research has investigated parenting stress and children's externalizing behavior problems, comparatively less has considered parenting stress in relation to children's internalizing difficulties. Even less research on parenting stress has incorporated children's report of their internalizing symptoms or the potential mediating role of children's attributional style. The current study hypothesized that children's independent reports of internalizing symptoms would be associated with mothers' reports of parenting stress through children's attributional style. A community sample of 92 mother-child dyads participated. Results suggest maternal parenting stress from both child and parent sources were significantly associated with children's anxious and depressive symptoms. Parenting stress was associated with children's internalizing symptoms partially mediated by children's maladaptive attributional style, primarily negative attributions for positive outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of future directions to tease apart specific areas of parenting stress that may be most pertinent as well as to explore other cognitive mechanisms in children that may relate to parenting stress and children's adjustment.

AB Research suggests that personality pathology is shared among a considerable portion of adolescents presenting suicidal behavior. Furthermore, heterogeneity of personality within this population suggests a need to tease apart different types of attempters. The goal of this study was to identify the personality subtypes of adolescents who attempt suicide. We analyzed data on 266 adolescents, ages 13 to 18 years, with a history of at least one suicide attempt who were selected by treating clinicians for having at least some degree of personality problems. We used a Q-factor analysis to identify subtypes based on the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-II for Adolescents (a 200-item measure of personality pathology used by clinically experienced observers). We derived six subtypes: Externalizing, Internalizing, Emotionally dysregulated, High functioning, Narcissistic, and Immature. The subtypes differed on measures of adaptive functioning, axis I and II pathology, and etiology. Adolescents who attempt suicide constitute a heterogeneous group, and they vary meaningfully on a measure of personality pathology. Interventions targeting suicidal behaviors in adolescents should consider individual differences.

AB This study examined the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology symptoms with 7-12 year-old children (N = 97; 44 boys, 53 girls, M age = 9.14, SD = 1.38) and their mothers (M age = 38.46, SD = 6.86). Child emotion regulation mediated the links between maternal psychopathology and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In turn, the indirect effect was dependent on the level of maternal support in response to youth's expressions of negative emotions when considering particular constellations of maternal reactions and type of psychopathology symptoms. The findings indicate that the relations between maternal and child psychopathology symptoms and child emotion regulation are complex and vary by context. Regardless of the complexity, however, for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youth, the results suggest that building adaptive emotion regulation skills is an important target for prevention among children who are at risk for problems due to exposure to maternal psychopathology.

AB Extensive research demonstrates the negative impact of maternal depression on their offspring. Unfortunately, few studies have been explored in African American families. This study examined emotional and behavioral functioning among children of African American mothers with depression. African American mothers (n = 63), with a past year diagnosis of a depressive disorder, and one of their children (ages 7-14) completed behavioral rating scales in a cross-sectional design. Results showed that 6.5 and 15% scored within the clinical range for depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Approximately a third of the offspring reported suicidal ideation. Based on mothers' report, 25.4 and 20.6% of the offspring exhibited internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the clinical range, respectively. Offspring whose mothers were in treatment exhibited higher levels of self-reported anxiety symptoms. Offspring of African American mothers with depression were exhibiting socioemotional problems in ways that are similar to offspring of European American mothers with depression.

AB Adolescence is a key period for the emergence of psychopathology, with many psychiatric disorders having their modal age-of-onset during this period. Relative to other periods of the lifespan, susceptibility to a number of psychiatric disorders is greatest during adolescence, particularly in females. In addition, disorders which emerge during adolescence appear to be more enduring and serious than those with a later onset. Although these psychiatric conditions may appear different from each other in terms of their associated behavioral signs or symptoms, this review will argue that they involve common alterations in motivational processes or disturbances in reward processing, although the direction of such changes (hypersensitivity vs. hyposensitivity to reward) and the stage of processing affected (reward anticipation vs. receipt) may differ across broader groupings of disorder. Recent behavioral, neuropsychological and neuroimaging research on reward processing in children, adolescents, and adults with these conditions will be described and evaluated. In addition, this article will consider what these studies tell us about their etiology and highlight gaps in our knowledge base. The review will also attempt to explain why adolescence is a period of elevated risk for the development of psychopathology, by discussing normative changes in reward processing in humans and animals.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence of neurological, cognitive, and neuropsychological effects of manganese (Mn) exposure from drinking water (WMn) in children has generated widespread public health concern. At elevated exposures, Mn has been associated with increased levels of externalizing behaviors, including irritability, aggression, and impulsivity. Little is known about potential effects at lower exposures, especially in children. Moreover, little is known regarding potential interactions between exposure to Mn and other metals, especially arsenic (As).
   OBJECTIVES: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 201 children to investigate associations of Mn and As in tube well water with classroom behavior among elementary school children, 8-11 years of age, in Araihazar, Bangladesh.
   METHODS: Data on exposures and behavioral outcomes were collected from the participants at the baseline of an ongoing longitudinal study of child intelligence. Study children were rated by their school teachers on externalizing and internalizing items of classroom behavior using the standardized Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (CBCL-TRF).
   RESULTS: Log-transformed WMn was positively and significantly associated with TRF internalizing [estimated beta = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-1.56; p = 0.03], TRF externalizing (estimated beta = 2.59; 95% CI, 0.81-4.37; p = 0.004), and TRF total scores (estimated beta = 3.35; 95% CI, 0.86-5.83; p = 0.008) in models that adjusted for log-transformed water arsenic (WAs) and sociodemographic covariates. We also observed a positive monotonic dose-response relationship between WMn and TRF externalizing and TRF total scores among the participants of the study. We did not find any significant associations between WAs and various scales of TRF scores.
   CONCLUSION: These observations reinforce the growing concern regarding the neurotoxicologic effects of WMn in children.

AB Child maltreatment-related outcomes range from no symptom expression to suicide. Increasingly, the diverse presentations have been conceptualized as core system dysregulation, including emotion dysregulation. Self-compassion has been advanced as a self-regulation strategy for countering negative self-directed emotions. This study explored whether individual differences in self-compassion would play a role in loosening the associations among childhood maltreatment severity and later emotion regulation difficulties. The sample consisted of transition-age youth (N = 81) seeking treatment for problem substance use. Self-compassion was negatively associated with emotion regulation difficulties and childhood maltreatment, and predicted emotion dysregulation above and beyond maltreatment history, current severity of psychological distress, and problem substance use. In addition, self-compassion mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment severity and later emotion dysregulation. These findings provide an impetus for further research into the relevance of self-compassion for maltreatment-related impairment.

AB Objectives: A commonly encountered situation for evaluating clinicians is a history of significant problems in one setting with little or no difficulties in another. This study aims to describe this phenomenon and to examine its relations with other child and family characteristics.
   Method: A total of 1,730 children (mean age 11.05 years) was studied from the first wave of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a large population-based study of Dutch youth. Parent and teacher ratings of aggression, rule breaking, inattention, and hyperactivity were obtained. Children were assigned to groups according to the presence of clinically relevant problems at home only, at school only, or in both settings. The rate of setting specific problems was calculated and comparisons between groups were made.
   Results: Setting specific, especially home-specific, problems were quite common. Among children whom parents rated as having at least borderline-clinical problems, teachers reported clear or very clear behaviors at school at the following rates: aggression (22%), rule breaking (12.5%), inattention (55%), and hyperactivity/impulsivity (33%). Compared with the school-specific group, the home-specific group contained a significantly higher percentage of girls with regard to inattention or hyperactivity and a significantly lower percentage of girls with regards to rule breaking. Logistic regression analyses revealed that home-versus school-specific problems were related to sex, child effortful control, and parental stress.
   Conclusion: Externalizing problems are frequently encountered only in one setting between home and school and are related to sex, child effortful control, and parental stress.

AB This study examined maternal and child interpretive bias to threat (IBT) during dyadic conversation, child physiological reactivity and regulation during dyadic conversation, and maternal report of child anxiety in a community sample of 35 mothers and their 8- to 10-year-old children. Mothers and children discussed one neutral and six ambiguous scenarios, which were subsequently coded for frequency of maternal and child initiation, minimization, and expansion of threat-related themes. Child electrocardiogram data were collected during these conversations and maternal reports of child anxiety and internalizing problems were obtained. Across the sample, children initiated threat-related discussion more often than mothers. Maternal threat expansions were significantly positively correlated with child anxiety and internalizing behaviors. Maternal minimizations of threat were significantly associated with augmented child vagal tone throughout the IBT paradigm. Implications for prevention of child anxiety and directions for extending IBT research within the context of the mother-child dyad are discussed.

AB Using longitudinal data from a sample of 456 focal children in the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), this study examined two research questions: (a) Does corporal punishment of young children (ages 2-4 at baseline) predict increases in levels of externalizing and internalizing problems over a 5-year study period? (b) Does the religion of the mother-specifically, her conservative Protestant affiliation and conservative beliefs about the Bible-moderate the estimated net effects of corporal punishment? Results revealed that early spanking alone was not associated with adjustment difficulties, but spanking that persisted into or began in middle childhood was associated with difficulties. In contrast to their counterparts from other (or no) religious backgrounds, children whose mothers belonged to conservative Protestant groups exhibited minimal adverse effects of corporal punishment. Several conclusions, limitations, and promising directions for future research are identified.

AB Background. High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems.
   Aims. This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues.
   Method. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD.
   Results. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood.
   Conclusions. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population.

AB Objective To examine the risk of emotional and behavioral problems among children with a chronic physical illness. Methods Random-effects meta-analysis was computed to integrate the results of 569 studies that used the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report, and the Teacher Report Form. Results Young people with a chronic physical illness have higher levels of internalizing (g = .47 standard mean difference), externalizing (g = .22) and total behavior problems (g = .42) than healthy peers. The largest differences were found in parental ratings and the weakest differences in adolescent self-ratings. Strongest elevations of internalizing problems were found for chronic fatigue syndrome and strongest elevations of externalizing problems were observed for epilepsy and migraine/tension-type headache. Effects also varied by country and, in part, by age, gender, year of publication, and study design. Conclusions The results call for regular screens for psychological distress and referrals for mental health services, when needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of child externalizing (behavioral) and internalizing (emotional) symptoms in a national population sample.
   METHODS: Data were collected in 3 biennial waves (2004, 2006, and 2008) from 2 cohorts in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, initially including 5107 children 0 to 1 year of age and 4983 children 4 to 5 years of age. The primary outcomes were child externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Relationships between potential risk factors and child mental health outcomes were described by using linear regression.
   RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, children's mental health symptoms were predicted by a large number of risk factors. In multivariate models, early childhood factors (birth through 5 years) explained 30% and 18% of variations in externalizing and internalizing symptoms, respectively, at 4 to 5 years of age. Middle childhood (5-9 years of age) factors explained 20% and 23% of variations in externalizing and internalizing symptoms, respectively, at 8 to 9 years of age. Harsh discipline was a strong consistent predictor of externalizing symptoms in both age groups, whereas poorer child physical health, maternal emotional distress, harsh discipline, and overinvolved/protective parenting (younger cohort only) predicted internalizing symptoms consistently.
   CONCLUSIONS: National data on predictors of child mental health symptoms highlighted a small number of significant risk factors, situated in the family context and present from a very young age. This knowledge is informing population-level, randomized, prevention trials of family support programs. Pediatrics 2011;128:e865-e879

AB PURPOSE: To report the results of a randomized clinical trial of teen online problem-solving (TOPS) meant to improve behavioral outcomes of adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy of TOPS with access to Internet resources in teenagers with TBI in improving parent and self-reported behavior problems and parentteen conflicts. Participants included 41 adolescents aged 11 to 18 years (range: 11.47-17.90 years) who had sustained a moderate-to-severe TBI between 3 and 19 months earlier. Teens in the TOPS group received 10 to 14 online sessions that provided training in problem-solving, communication skills, and self-regulation. Outcomes were assessed before treatment and at a follow-up assessment an average of 8 months later. Groups were compared on follow-up scores after we controlled for pretreatment levels. Injury severity and socioeconomic status were examined as potential moderators of treatment efficacy.
   RESULTS: Forty-one participants provided consent and completed baseline assessments, and follow-up assessments were completed for 35 participants (16 TOPS, 19 Internet resource comparison). The TOPS group reported significantly less parent-teen conflict at follow-up than did the Internet-resource-comparison group. Improvements in teen behavior after TOPS were moderated by injury severity; there were greater improvements in the teens' internalizing symptoms after TOPS among adolescents with severe TBI. Family socioeconomic status also moderated the efficacy of TOPS in improving behavior problems reported by both parents and teens, although the nature of the moderation effects varied.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that TOPS contributes to improvements in parent-teen conflict generally and parent and self-reported teen behavior problems for certain subsets of participants. Pediatrics 2011; 128: e947-e953

AB Background: The objectives of the present study were to explore whether maternal psychosocial factors, mental health and work stress around delivery, are related to the behavior of 2-year-old children.
   Methods: In a prospective cohort study design, pregnant women attending the National Taiwan University Hospital for delivery and post-partum care from April 2004 to January 2005 were recruited and their children were observed at 24 months. A total of 186 mother-term-born child dyads completed the measurement. The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) self-report data of maternal psychosocial factors were selected from the Taiwanese version of the short form 36 (SF-36). The Child Behavior Checklist for age 11/2-5 (CBCL/11/2-5) was completed by the parents when the child was 2 years old.
   Results: The mean score of mental health around delivery was 68.11. The proportion of mothers with work stress seldom and always was 61.8% and 24.7%, respectively. The mean of the total CBCL score, and internalizing, externalizing behavior and sleep problems scores was 45.95, 11.89, 15.59 and 4.23, respectively. After adjusting for the potential confounders, maternal work stress around delivery was found to have a significant effect on the total CBCL and externalizing, attention and aggressive, behavioral problems of 2-year old children. Maternal mental health around delivery, however, did not show significant effects on child behavior.
   Conclusions: Work stress around delivery seems to aggravate children's externalizing behavior problems at 2 years old. It is therefore important to improve the psychosocial health and reduce the stress of pregnant women.

AB This study aimed to investigate the sensory processing (SP) dysfunction and emotional and behavioral problems in preschool children with autism and then examine the relationship between the SP dysfunction and emotional and behavioral problems. The parents of 112 children aged 48-84 months (67 with autism; 45 age-matched typically developing) completed a demographic questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist-Chinese version (CBCL-C), and the Sensory Profile-Chinese version (SP-C). We found that 95.8% of children with autism who showed significant internalizing problems had at least one SP quadrant in the definite difference range, while 81.8% with significant externalizing problems had at least one SP quadrant in the definite difference range. Typically developing children showed lower percentages of 66.7% and 40.0%. Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that in children with autism, avoiding and male gender were significant predictors of internalizing problems and sensitivity was a significant predictor of externalizing problems. In contrast, in typically developing children, avoiding was a significant predictor of internalizing problems and seeking was a significant predictor of externalizing problems. This study provided further understanding of the factors influencing emotional and behavioral problems in autism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Substantial evidence from cross-sectional and short time-span longitudinal studies exists about negative associations between early pubertal maturation on a number of psychological outcomes. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between early maturation and developmental trajectories of social skills and internalizing and externalizing problems in girls from grades 1 through 9, including pre- and post-pubertal periods. The sample came from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development and included 398 Caucasian and 60 African American girls. Multilevel modeling revealed early maturing Caucasian girls were at risk for higher internalizing and externalizing problems and experiencing higher levels of problems pre-pubertally. African American youth had lower social skills and internalizing problems with no group differences due to early pubertal development. Findings are discussed in light of literature on continuity of girls' psychosocial development before and during the pubertal transition.

AB Stress is known to amplify the link between pubertal timing and psychopathology. However, few studies have examined the role of peer stress as a context for this link. The present study examined the interaction between perceived pubertal timing and peer stress on symptoms of psychopathology in early adolescence. The sample consisted of 264 students (63% female; M (age) = 12.40, SD = 1.00; 55% Caucasian, 23% African American, 7% Latino, 11% biracial and 4% other). Higher peer stress was associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression; this effect did not vary by timing or gender. However, early-maturing girls with high peer stress demonstrated higher rates of relational and overt aggression compared to other girls. Findings also suggested that late-maturing boys with high stress are at risk for aggression problems; however, due to the small number of boys, analyses were exploratory. Overall, results suggest that developmentally salient contexts as indicated by stressful peer experiences may pose unique threats to early maturing girls and possibly late-maturing boys.

AB The present study examined the associations between internalizing disorders and substance use disorders using structural equation models to examine the relative contributions of common fixed confounding factors and direct causal pathways, and to determine the direction of causality.
   Data were gathered during the course of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of New Zealand children (n = 953). Measures included DSM-IV symptom criteria for major depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, and illicit drug abuse/dependence, ages 18, 21, and 25.
   Structural equation modeling showed that for depression and substance use disorder, the best-fitting model was the one in which the associations were explained by a combination of common fixed factors and direct causal pathways from substance use to depression. A similar pattern emerged for anxiety disorders and (1) nicotine dependence, and (2) illicit drug abuse/dependence. The comorbidity of anxiety disorder and alcohol abuse/dependence was best explained by a model that included common fixed factors and a reciprocal pathway between these disorders. Decomposition of the correlations between internalizing disorders and substance use disorders showed that most of the correlation arose from direct causal pathways between disorders.
   The findings suggest that the comorbidity between internalizing disorders and substance use disorders can be attributed to both common fixed factors and direct causal pathways between substance use disorder and internalizing disorder. The evidence suggests that, in most cases, the most plausible explanation of causality is the one in which substance use disorder increases the risk of internalizing disorder.

AB Although recent studies have demonstrated the utility of assessing psychopathic traits in adolescent males, there is substantially less evidence on the utility of assessing psychopathic traits in adolescent females. This study investigated the reliability and construct validity of the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PLC:YV) among a sample of 80 incarcerated adolescent females. Reliability analyses indicated high interrater agreement and internal consistency for PCL:YV scores. Consistent with research on adults and adolescent male offenders, psychopathic traits were associated with a greater number of conduct disorder and alcohol dependence symptoms, earlier onset of criminal behavior, a propensity toward institutional violence, and interpersonal behaviors associated with psychopathy. Consistent with some prior studies of youth, there were no negative relationships between PCL: YV scores and internalizing disorder diagnoses and some positive associations between psychopathy ratings and negative affectivity. Results suggest that assessing psychopathic traits in adolescent females provides meaningful information regarding criminal behavior, patterns, and personality traits in youth.

AB The goal of this study was to examine the ability of friendship to moderate the association between behavioral risk and peer victimization for girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 140) and comparison girls (n = 88) in a 5-week naturalistic summer camp setting. Participants were an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group of girls ages 6-12. Parents and teachers reported on pre-summer internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and social competence. Participants reported on friendships and peer victimization through a peer report measure at the summer camps; friendship was scored via mutual nominations. Pre-summer externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, and low social competence predicted peer victimization at the summer camps. Friendship moderated the association between behavioral risk and victimization for the entire sample, such that the presence of at least one friend reduced the risk of victimization. Additional analyses suggested that girls with ADHD were no more or less protected by the presence of a friendship than were comparison girls. Finally, preliminary analyses suggested that girls having only friends with ADHD were not significantly less protected than girls with at least one comparison friend. Future directions and implications for intervention are discussed.

AB The present study examined the association between covert narcissism and internalizing symptoms (i.e., shame, anxiety) in adolescents following an ego threat. Participants were 132 adolescents (101 males, 30 females, 1 not reported), ages 16-19 (M = 16.81 years, SD = .81), attending a residential program. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three feedback conditions (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral). Contrary to the main hypothesis, Time 2 internalizing symptoms tended to be highest for individuals in the positive feedback condition who had higher levels of narcissism. The implications of this study for understanding the role of narcissism in internalizing symptoms are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to regulate ones emotions effectively has been linked with many aspects of well-being. The current study examined discrepancies between mothers' and children's reports of child emotion regulation. This investigation examined patterns of discrepancies for key aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., inhibition and dysregulated expression) and for three emotions (anger, sadness, worry). A total of 61 mother-child dyads (mean children's age = 9.3 years) participated. As hypothesized, discrepancies for inhibition subscales were of a larger magnitude than those for dysregulated expression subscales. Furthermore, age was related to discrepancies in both anger subscales, parent reports of child externalizing symptoms were related to anger dysregulated expression discrepancies, and child reports of internalizing symptoms were related to sadness dysregulated expression discrepancies. Overall, the findings suggest that patterns of discrepant reports are not random but rather may provide meaningful and useful information about the nature of emotion regulation.

   SYMPTOMS; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; PROBLEM DRINKERS; ADULT CHILDREN;

AB Background: This study investigates the relationship between parental drinking and school adjustment in a total population sample of adolescents, with independent reports from mothers, fathers, and adolescents. As a group, children of alcohol abusers have previously been found to exhibit lowered academic achievement. However, few studies address which parts of school adjustment that may be impaired. Both a genetic approach and social strains predict elevated problem scores in these children. Previous research has had limitations such as only recruiting cases from clinics, relying on single responders for all measures, or incomplete control for comorbid psychopathology. The specific effects of maternal and paternal alcohol use are also understudied.
   Methods: In a Norwegian county, 88% of the population aged 13-19 years participated in a health survey (N = 8984). Among other variables, adolescents reported on four dimensions of school adjustment, while mothers and fathers reported their own drinking behaviour. Mental distress and other control variables were adjusted for. Multivariate analysis including generalized estimation equations was applied to investigate associations.
   Results: Compared to children of light drinkers, children of alcohol abusers had moderately elevated attention and conduct problem scores. Maternal alcohol abuse was particularly predictive of such problems. Children of abstainers did significantly better than children of light drinkers. Controlling for adolescent mental distress reduced the association between maternal abuse and attention problems. The associations between parental reported drinking and school adjustment were further reduced when controlling for the children's report of seeing their parents drunk, which itself predicted school adjustment. Controlling for parental mental distress did not reduce the associations.
   Conclusions: Parental alcohol abuse is an independent risk factor for attention and conduct problems at school. Some of the risk associated with mothers' drinking is likely to be mediated by adolescent mental distress. Despite lowered adjustment on the externalizing dimensions, children of alcohol abusers report that they enjoy being at school as much as other children.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the normative data and psychometric properties of the parent and teacher rating form of the child behavior checklist (CBCL) in an Iranian community sample.
   Methods: A sample of 6-12 year old students was randomly selected from ten elementary schools in Tehran, Iran. The parent's and teacher's versions of CBCL were accomplished. Clinical interview and the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia - present and lifetime version, Persian version (K-SADS-PL-PV) were used to evaluate the validity and the cut-off point of CBCL and the teacher rating form (TRF).
   Findings: Among 600 recruited students with mean age of 9.11 years (SD=1.45), 54.16% were girls (n=325). Girls had significantly lower scores in Attention Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, Externalizing and Total Problems than boys (P<0.01). The relation was significant between the CBCL Internalizing and students' ages (beta=0.124, P=0.002). The Internal consistency, the correlation among the CBCL and TRF scales, and the inter-rater correlations for CBCL/TRF scales were good to high for most indices and subscales. Based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis the best convergences were between the CBCL Attention Problems subscale and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, the CBCL Total Problems and any disorders, the CBCL Externalizing and ADHD+ODD diagnosis. The sensitivities and specificities of the CBCL subscales were higher than the TRF except for Externalizing/ADHD+ oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) which was reverse.
   Conclusion: These results support the multicultural CBCL/TRF findings. CBCL is a useful instrument to consider ADHD and any disorders in community samples.

AB Background: DSM-IV specifies three ADHD subtypes; the combined, the hyperactive-impulsive and the inattentive. Little is known about the developmental relationships underlying these subtypes. The objective of this study was to describe the development of parent-reported hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms from childhood to adolescence and to study their associations with genetic factors, family risk, and later adjustment problems in early adulthood. Method: Data in this study comes from 1,450 twin pairs participating in a population-based, longitudinal twin study. Developmental trajectories were defined using parent-ratings of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms at age 8-9, 13-14, and 16-17. Twin methods were used to explore genetic influences on trajectories. Family risk measures included low socioeconomic status, large family size and divorce. Self-ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems in early adulthood were used to examine adjustment problems related to the different trajectory combinations. Results: We found two hyperactivity-impulsivity trajectories (low, high/decreasing) and two inattention trajectories (low, high/increasing). Twin modeling revealed a substantial genetic component underlying both the hyperactivity-impulsivity and the inattention trajectory. Joint trajectory analyses identified four groups of adolescents with distinct developmental patterns of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention: a low/low group, a primarily hyperactive, a primarily inattentive and a combined (high/high) trajectory type. These trajectory combinations showed discriminant relations to adjustment problems in early adulthood. The hyperactive, inattentive and combined trajectory subtypes were associated with higher rates of family risk environments compared to the low/low group. Conclusion: Study results showed that for those on a high trajectory, hyperactivity decreased whereas inattention increased. The combinations of these trajectories lend developmental insight into how children shift from (i) a combined to inattentive subtype, and (ii) a hyperactive-impulsive to a combined subtype. This study suggests that ADHD subtypes cannot be viewed as discrete and stable categories.

AB The present investigation examined the relationships between motives for cannabis use and negative consequences associated with cannabis use following a brief intervention. The sample consisted of 205 adolescent cannabis users (66.3% male), who were recruited in high schools and randomly assigned to a brief two-session motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or an educational feedback control (EFC). Results supported the hypothesis that using cannabis to cope with negative affect would predict the number of problems and dependence symptoms related to cannabis use, after controlling for age, gender, years and frequency of cannabis use, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Significant interactions between internalizing behavior problems and the coping motive showed that using to cope was associated with a higher number of cannabis dependence symptoms among adolescents reporting lower levels internalizing behavior problems. Findings support the potential utility of conducting further research to explore the coping motive as an important indicator of problematic cannabis use.

AB In the current four-wave, longitudinal study, adolescent stress, internalizing problems, and the reciprocal influences of these variables were examined. Data were obtained from the Korea Youth Panel Study, which included 3188 (1594 male and 1594 female) middle- and high-school students who enrolled in the study from 2004 to 2007. The mean participant age was 14.79 years in 2004. By using a cross-lagged, autoregressive model, it was shown that stress levels and internalizing problems had reciprocal influences on one another over time (all four time points). At each of the time points, the effect sizes of stress on internalizing problems were significantly greater than those of internalizing problems on stress.

AB The Incredible Years (IY) Series includes separate group interventions to improve parenting interactions, teacher classroom management, and child social-emotional regulation. Although originally developed to treat early onset conduct problems, IY targets many of the proposed mechanisms and risk factors for internalizing distress in early childhood. Prior studies have demonstrated the effects of the IY parent intervention on co-occurring depressive symptoms. We attempted to extend these findings by examining the unique and combined effects of IY interventions on children's co-occurring internalizing symptoms. One-hundred and fifty-nine families with children ages 4- to 8-years-old were randomly assigned to parent training (PT); parent plus teacher training (PT + TT); child training (CT); child plus teacher training (CT + TT); parent, child, plus teacher training (PT + CT + TT); or a waiting list control group. Children who received any of the intervention components were more likely to have lower mother-rated internalizing symptoms at posttreatment compared to children in a wait-list control group. Implications for future research and for designing interventions and prevention strategies for children with internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB Objective: To examine associations between autonomic nervous system and adrenocortical reactivity to laboratory stressors and buccal cell telomere length (BTL) in children. Methods: The study sample comprised 78 children, aged 5 to 6 years, from a longitudinal cohort study of kindergarten social hierarchies, biologic responses to adversity, and child health. Buccal cell samples and reactivity measures were collected in the spring of the kindergarten year. BTL was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction, as the telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio. Parents provided demographic information; parents and teachers reported children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Components of children's autonomic (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA], and preejection period [PEP]) and adrenocortical (salivary cortisol) responses were monitored during standardized laboratory challenges. We examined relationships between reactivity, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and BTL, adjusted for age, race, and sex. Results: Heart rate and cortisol reactivity were inversely related to BTL, PEP was positively related to BTL, and RSA was unrelated to BTL. Internalizing behaviors were also inversely related to BTL (standardized beta = -0.33, p = .004). Split at the median of reactivity parameters, children with high sympathetic activation (decreasing PEP), and parasympathetic withdrawal (decreasing RSA) did not differ with regard to BTL. However, children with both this profile and high cortisol reactivity (n = 12) had significantly shorter BTL (0.80 versus 1.00; chi(2) = 7.6, p = .006), compared with other children. Conclusions: The combination of autonomic and adrenocortical reactivity was associated with shorter BTL in children. These data suggest that psychophysiological processes may influence, and that BTL may be a useful marker of, early biologic aging.

AB Research has shown that adults who sexually offend frequently report perpetrating a sexual offense for the first time during childhood/adolescence; therefore in this preliminary study, we examine the possible covariates related to offending sexually in adolescents. For this study, 62 incarcerated adolescents at a correctional facility in Alabama completed self-report questionnaires regarding demographic information, internalizing/externalizing behavior problems, attachment, and affect regulation. The results of this study indicate that attachment is related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as, both adaptive affect regulation and maladaptive affect regulation. Through path analyses, this study was the first to test and find that affect regulation ability mediated the relationship between attachment and externalizing behavior; however, it did not mediate the relationship between attachment and internalizing behavior. Interestingly, maladaptive affect regulation appeared to have a stronger influence on problem behaviors than adaptive affect regulation for these adolescents. The findings from this study could help professionals identify more successful therapeutic interventions for these adolescents and consequently prevent later sexual offending and further negative, individual or societal outcomes.

AB Pediatric gastrointestinal disorders are commonly experienced by youth and have been shown to be associated with increased rates of psychosocial difficulties. Aim of the current study was to extend development of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), a brief parent-completed measure designed to assess children's behavioral and emotional functioning, by examining its factor structure in a pediatric gastroenterology sample. Parents of 176 children ages 4-16 years visiting a pediatric gastroenterologist completed the PSC. The factor structure of the PSC was examined using principal component analysis. Parallel analysis was utilized to determine the number of factors to retain and indicated that three factors existed within the data. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation identified factors measuring internalizing, externalizing, and attention difficulties. The three factors that emerged on the PSC provide initial support for the utility of the PSC in pediatric gastroenterology clinics.

AB The present study examined the role of cardiovascular regulation in predicting pediatric obesity. Participants for this study included 268 children (141 girls) obtained from a larger ongoing longitudinal study. To assess cardiac vagal regulation, resting measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and RSA change (vagal withdrawal) to three cognitively challenging tasks were derived when children were 5.5 years of age. Heart period (HP) and HP change (heart rate (HR) acceleration) were also examined. Height and weight measures were collected when children were 5.5, 7.5, and 10.5 years of age. Results indicated that physiological regulation at age 5.5 was predictive of both normal variations in BMI development and pediatric obesity at age 10.5. Specifically, children with a cardiovascular regulation profile characterized by lower levels of RSA suppression and HP change experienced significantly greater levels of BMI growth and were more likely to be classified as overweight/at-risk for overweight at age 10.5 compared to children with a cardiovascular regulation profile characterized by high levels of RSA suppression and HP change. However, a significant interaction with racial status was found suggesting that the association between cardiovascular regulation profile and BMI growth and pediatric obesity was only significant for African-American children. An autonomic cardiovascular regulation profile consisting of low parasympathetic activity represents a significant individual risk factor for the development of pediatric obesity, but only for African-American children. Mechanisms by which early physiological regulation difficulties may contribute to the development of pediatric obesity are discussed.

AB Sleep disturbance is a significant problem in the general pediatric population, and it occurs even more frequently in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Much time and energy have been spent examining the characteristics that predispose children to insomnia and it is likely that equivalent factors influence sleep in PDDs. Though similarly affected, it is the unique set of characteristics incumbent in a diagnosis of PDD that has additive effects and increases the likelihood for developing other predisposing factors and subsequent sleep loss. This review summarized research that has explored the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional correlates of sleep disturbance in children with PDDs. The literature provided 38 sleep studies that used either subjective or objective sleep measures. Of these, 17 met criteria for inclusion. Studies were evaluated for their attempts at matching their study samples and adjusting for possible confounding variables. The results revealed that the combined effects of autism symptom severity, internalizing behavior, and externalizing behavior, were the main predisposing factors for the development of insomnia. Other factors included medical conditions, epilepsy, and medication use (likely a proxy for behavior difficulty and even sleep disorder). A bidirectional theoretical framework for sleep disturbance in children with PDDs has been posited as a conceptual guide for future study. Recommendations for future study designs are included.

AB This study examined the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescents' problem behaviors, moderated by adolescent gender, as well as the association between maternal depressive symptoms and the family environment characteristics above and beyond child variables. Data were collected from 137 mothers of runaway adolescents with alcohol and/or substance abuse problems. Results showed that both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors of adolescent girls, as opposed to problem behaviors of boys, were significantly associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In addition, higher family cohesion was significantly related to lower maternal depressive symptoms even after controlling for adolescent problem behaviors. Howevez; no significant relationship was found between family conflict and maternal depressive symptoms. These,findings indicate that both adolescents' problem behaviors and mothers' perceptions of the family environment are associated with maternal depressive symptoms, highlighting the potential utility of the family systems theoretical framework for understanding and intervening mothers' emotional problems in the family context.

AB This study assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and behavior problems in young children with burns and examined individual, injury-related, and family-related determinants. Seventy-six children, aged 12-49 months, were assessed at an average of 15 months after their burn injury, using parents as informants on the posttraumatic stress disorder semi-structured interview and observational record for infants and young children and the child behavior checklist. Ten children (13.2%) met the alternative criteria for PTSD proposed by Scheeringa et al. Number of PTSD symptoms were associated with family-related variables (maternal PTSD, quality of family relations). Compared to community norms, children with burns showed less externalizing behavior problems, and internalizing behavior problems were within the normal range. Overall, behavioral adjustment was associated with the quality of family relations (cohesion, expressiveness, conflicts). Whereas behavior was found to be normal in young children with burns, this study provides evidence for a substantial prevalence of PTSD.

AB PURPOSE: One of the specific aims of life course epidemiology is to assess the explanatory utility of three general hypotheses, namely he critical period hypothesis, the accumulation of risk hypothesis, and the effect modification hypothesis.
   METHODS: A structured regression approach to this problem is illustrated with data from an ongoing longitudinal study of children and their families established in Adelaide in 1998-2000. A series of nested models that correspond to the alternative life course hypotheses were fir in an investigation of the effects of maternal depressive stares in early childhood on internalizing child behavior at 9.5 years. Both linear and logistic regression models were considered.
   RESULTS: The structured regression framework showed the accumulation hypothesis was most plausible for these data. The analyses also provided some evidence of a critical period for the effect of maternal depressive status around child age 2 years on internalizing behavior at 9.5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that comparing a suite of nested models to a full model can be useful in attempting to disentangle life course processes. Ann Epidemiol 2011;21:654-659. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB The present quasi-experimental study examines the outcomes for a group of 102 children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder at age 2 who attended an inclusive toddler program (described by Stahmer and Ingersoll, 2004) until age 3. Outcomes on standardized developmental assessments indicate significant improvement, with large effect sizes, in developmental level, adaptive behavior and communication. Thirty-one of the children (31%) were functioning in the typically developing range when they exited the program at age 3, after an average of 8 months of intervention. Predictors of positive outcomes included length of time in the program, level of words and gestures use at entry and higher externalizing and lower internalizing behavior CBCL scores at entry. Implications for serving toddlers with autism in inclusive settings and suggestions for future research directions are discussed.

AB Recent studies have revealed evidence for interactions between autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, indexed by saliva alpha amylase (sAA), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity, in predicting psychological functioning. The present study extends this work by examining individual differences in sAA and cortisol stress reactivity in relation to behavioral and emotional adjustment in youth. Participants were 56 healthy children (age 7-16). sAA, cortisol, and other physiological and affective responses were measured before, during, and after stressor tasks (either performance or peer rejection). Basal and stress responsive sAA and cortisol as well as their interactions were assessed in relation to externalizing and internalizing behaviors and trait anxiety. sAA was positively related to anxiety, while sAA reactivity moderated associations between cortisol reactivity and problem behavior. Results highlight the importance of measuring multiple physiological systems to elucidate mechanisms underlying behavioral and emotional dysregulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The current study examined the independent effects of mothers' childhood abuse (CA) and intimate partner violence (IPV) on psychopathology and functional impairment in children; and the potential moderating and mediating role of individual and family factors in these relationships. Additionally, this study explored the potential cumulative effects of both maternal CA and IPV on children's outcomes.
   Method: The sample included 547 Spanish children and adolescents aged between 8 and 17 years, and their parents, who had accessed mental health services. The assessment was based on structured interviews with the children and their parents. Statistical analyses were carried out through hierarchical multiple, negative-binomial and logistic regressions, and Structural Equation Models.
   Results: Children whose mothers experienced CA and those whose mothers suffered physical IPV showed increased DSM-IV disruptive disorders and externalizing behavior problems, respectively. Children who directly observed physical IPV and also suffered physical punishment by parents showed increased internalizing problems. IPV had effects, either direct or indirect by physical punishment, on children's externalizing problems. Cumulative effect analyses indicated that the prevalence of disruptive disorders was highest in children whose mothers had suffered both CA and IPV.
   Conclusion: Spanish children whose mothers have suffered CA, IPV or both, are at high risk of serious conduct problems, whereas children exposed to IPV and who were also physically abused are at greater risk of internalizing problems. Physical punishment of children contributes in part to explain externalizing problems of IPV-exposed children. These findings indicate potential targets of assessment and intervention for families seeking help in mental health services. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review examines the question of whether there should be a cluster of disorders, including the adjustment disorders (ADs), acute stress disorder (ASD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the dissociative disorders (DDs), in a section devoted to abnormal responses to stress and trauma in the DSM-5. Environmental risk factors, including the individual's developmental experience, would thus become a major diagnostic consideration. The relationship of these disorders to one another is examined and also their relationship to other anxiety disorders to determine whether they are better grouped with anxiety disorders or a new specific grouping of trauma and stressor-related disorders. First how stress responses have been classified since DSM-III is reviewed. The major focus is on PTSD because it has received the most attention, regarding its proper placement among the psychiatric diagnoses. It is discussed whether PTSD should be considered an anxiety disorder, a stress-induced fear circuitry disorder, an internalizing disorder, or a trauma and stressor-related disorder. Then, ASD, AD, and DD are considered from a similar perspective. Evidence is examined pro and con, and a concision is offered recommending inclusion of this cluster of disorders in a section entitled "Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders." The recommendation to shift ASD and PTSD out of the anxiety disorders section reflects increased recognition of trauma as a precipitant, emphasizing common etiology over common phenomenology. Similar considerations are addressed with regard to AD and DD. Depression and Anxiety 28:737-749, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The present study investigated reciprocal relationships between adolescent mothers and their children's well-being through an analysis of the coupling relationship of mothers' depressive symptomatology and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Unlike studies using discrete time analyses, the present study used dynamical systems to model time continuously, which allowed for the study of dynamic, transactional effects between members of each dyad. Findings provided evidence of coupling between maternal depressive symptoms and children's behaviors. The most robust finding was that as maternal depressive symptoms became more or less severe, children's behavior problems increased or decreased in a reciprocal manner. Results from this study extended upon theoretical contributions of such authors as Richters (1997) and Granic and Hollenstein (2003), providing empirical validation from a longitudinal study for understanding the ongoing, dynamic relationships between at-risk mothers and their children.

AB Pubertal development is a nonlinear process progressing from prepubescent beginnings through biological, physical, and psychological changes to full sexual maturity. To tether theoretical concepts of puberty with sophisticated longitudinal, analytical models capable of articulating pubertal development more accurately, we used nonlinear mixed-effects models to describe both the timing and tempo of pubertal development in the sample of 364 White boys and 373 White girls measured across 6 years as part of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Individual differences in timing and tempo were extracted with models of logistic growth. Differential relations emerged for how boys' and girls' timing and tempo of development were related to physical characteristics (body mass index, height, and weight) and psychological outcomes (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and risky sexual behavior). Timing and tempo are associated in boys but not girls. Pubertal timing and tempo are particularly important for predicting psychological outcomes in girls but only sparsely related to boys' psychological outcomes. Results highlight the importance of considering the nonlinear nature of puberty and expand the repertoire of possibilities for examining important aspects of how and when pubertal processes contribute to development.

AB Background: Childhood behavior problems are associated with premature mortality. To identify plausible pathways that may account for this association, we explored the extent to which childhood behavior problems relate to health behaviors and health outcomes at midlife. Methods: The Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) study comprises 12,500 children from the Aberdeen area, Scotland, UK. Childhood behavior problems were assessed by teacher ratings at children's age of 6-12 years. Between 2001 and 2003, surviving study members, then aged 46-51 years, were mailed a questionnaire containing enquiries about physician-diagnosed conditions (long-term disease, diabetes, high blood pressure), general health, well-being, weight, smoking, and alcohol intake. A total of 7,183 responded. Results: Two dimensions of externalizing (conduct problems and hyperactivity) and one of internalizing (emotional problems) behaviors were associated with adult health. Childhood conduct problems were related to an increased risk of long-term disease (odds ratio per one standard deviation increase; 95% confidence interval: 1.15; 1.02-1.29 for men; 1.26; 1.08-1.47 for women), obesity (1.16; 1.01-1.33 in men; 1.38; 1.14-1.68 in women), cigarette smoking (1.20; 1.07-1.34 in men; 1.17; 1.01-1.35 in women), and lower well-being. Childhood hyperactivity was associated with earlier initiation of smoking in men and women; smoking more cigarettes in women; and binge-drinking, as well as a higher frequency of hangovers in men. Internalizing behavior was related to a reduced the risk of ever smoking (.87; .80-.95 in men;.92; .85-.99 in women) and to healthier drinking patterns. In women but not men, internalizing problems also predicted a later age of smoking onset. Adjusting for socio-economic status of origin, childhood intelligence, education and age had negligible effects on these results. Conclusions: Childhood behavior problems were associated with a series of adult health-related habits that may partially account for the link between early problem behaviors and premature mortality.

AB This article presents 4 studies (N = 1,413) describing the development and validation of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM). In Study 1 (n = 428), the authors determined procedures for item development and examined comprehensibility of the initial 25 items. In Study 2 (n = 334), they reduced the initial item pool from 25 to 10 items through exploratory factor analysis. Study 3 (n = 332) evaluated the final 10-item measure in a cross-validation sample, and Study 4 (n = 319) determined validity coefficients for the CAMM using bivariate and partial correlations with relevant variables. Results suggest that the CAMM is a developmentally appropriate measure with adequate internal consistency. As expected, CAMM scores were positively correlated with quality of life, academic competence, and social skills and negatively correlated with somatic complaints, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behavior problems. Correlations were reduced but generally still significant after controlling for the effects of 2 overlapping processes (thought suppression and psychological inflexibility). Overall, results suggest that the CAMM may be a useful measure of mindfulness skills for school-aged children and adolescents.

AB Research emanating from the field of developmental science indicates that initial risk factors for alcohol use and disorder can be evident in early childhood. One dominant developmental pathway connecting these initial risk factors with subsequent alcohol involvement focuses on the central role of disinhibited or externalizing behaviors. In the current paper, we delineate a second pathway that focuses on internalizing symptomatology. Several studies indicate that internalizing symptoms in early and middle childhood predict alcohol involvement in adolescence and young adulthood. We use a developmental psychopathology framework to describe a risk model that traces the potential developmental markers of this internalizing pathway and to consider the relation between the internalizing pathway and the more widely researched externalizing pathway. We outline the markers of risk in this pathway and conclude with a discussion of the implications of this model for prevention efforts and future research. In this manner, we strive for a translational goal, linking our existing understanding of internalizing processes and alcohol use and disorder with our efforts to develop effective prevention programs.

AB The sibling relationship of adolescents with and without intellectual disabilities was examined. Participants were 70 sibling dyads - each dyad was comprised of one 12-year old adolescent with (N = 23) or without intellectual disabilities (N = 47). Sibling relationships, behavior problems, and social skills were assessed using mother reports. Results revealed three findings. First, for typically developing adolescents, mothers reported more warmth in the sibling relationship for opposite sex dyads. For adolescents with intellectual disabilities, mothers reported more warmth in the sibling relationship for same-sex dyads. Second, for typically developing adolescents, Mothers reported more status/power differences when the sibling was younger than when the sibling was older. For adolescents with intellectual disabilities, birth order did not affect status/power in the sibling relationship. Third, for typically developing adolescents, conflict was related to internalizing behavior problems. For adolescents with intellectual disabilities, conflict was related to externalizing behavior problems. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Early-onset alcohol use is associated with increased vulnerability to subsequent alcohol abuse and dependence. However, not all early-onset alcohol users develop alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Using a sample of young women from the United States, we identify correlates that contribute to a greater likelihood of AUDs in early-onset alcohol users. Using interview and questionnaire data on participants of the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study (MOAFTS), we examine whether measures from domains including sociodemographic, pubertal development, religiosity, educational achievement, adverse life events, internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, and family history and discipline were associated with development of AUDs in 1,158 women who had their first drink of alcohol prior to age 16. Early-onset drinkers were 3.6 times more likely to meet criteria for AUDs than later onset drinkers. While univariate analyses revealed that a host of correlates were associated with likelihood of AUDs in early-onset drinkers, multivariate analyses suggested that, even after accounting for a particularly early age of onset of drinking, those with a history of physical abuse, cotwin alcohol problems, conduct disorder, regular smoking, older peers, and peer substance use were considerably more likely to meet criteria for AUDs than early-onset drinkers without a lifetime history of these correlates. The progression from first drink to AUDs is complex, and while early age at first drink is a potent risk factor, other aspects of psychopathology, family history, conduct problems, and peer affiliations can exacerbate or alleviate the risk of AUDs in these young female drinkers.

AB Aims This study investigated whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is associated with sustained improvement in behaviour and metabolic control.
   Methods Children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 27, 8-18 years old) who had been assessed previously prior to commencing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and 6-8 weeks later, were re-evaluated 2 years after commencing insulin pump therapy. Behaviour was reassessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2nd edition (BASC-2) and current HbA(1c) levels were recorded.
   Results Two years after commencing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms were significantly lower than pre-insulin pump therapy commencement levels. Self reports of internalizing and externalizing problems did not differ significantly across the three assessment points. There was no significant difference between pre-insulin pump therapy HbA(1c) and HbA(1c) after 2 years on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, despite an initial improvement 6-8 weeks after commencing the therapy.
   Conclusions Children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed sustained improvements in parent-reported behaviour, but not in self reports of behaviour or in metabolic control 2 years after commencement of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

AB Objective: To review evidence of trauma and exile-related mental health in young refugees from the Middle East.
   Method: A review of four empirical studies: i) a qualitative study of 11 children from torture surviving families, ii) a cohort study of 311 3-15-year-old asylum-seeking children, iii) a qualitative study of 14 members of torture surviving families and iv) a follow-up study of 131 11-23-year-old refugees.
   Results: The reactions of the children were not necessarily post-traumatic stress disorder specific. Seventy-seven per cent suffered from anxiety, sleep disturbance and/or depressed mood at arrival. Sleep disturbance (prevalence 34%) was primarily predicted by a family history of violence. At follow-up, 25.9% suffered from clinically relevant psychological symptoms. Traumatic experiences before arrival and stressful events in exile predicted internalizing behaviour, witnessing violence and frequent school changes in exile predicted externalizing behaviour. School participation, Danish friends, language proficiency and mother's education predicted less long-term psychological problems.
   Conclusion: Psychological problems are frequent in refugee children, but the extents are reduced over time in exile. Traumatic experience before arrival is most important for the short-term reaction of the children while aspects of life in exile are important for the children's ability to recover from early traumatization.

AB Background The goal of this study was to examine social skills deficits among children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) who were both referred to a respite programme.
   Methods Thirty-seven children with PAE and 23 non-exposed children (aged 3 to 8 years) were evaluated on the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) by their caregivers and respite workers.
   Results As compared with the non-exposed children, those with PAE showed more deficits on caregiver ratings of responsibility, hyperactivity, internalizing problems and overall social skills, as well as respite worker ratings of hyperactivity. The social skills among the PAE group were not related to home placement variables. Among both groups, caregivers rated social skills lower than respite workers, and among the PAE group, girls tended to display more social skills deficits than boys.
   Conclusions The SSRS is useful in identifying unique social skills deficits among children with PAE.

AB Girls in foster care have been shown to be at risk for emotional and behavioral problems, especially during the preadolescent and adolescent years. Based on these findings and on the lack of research-based preventive interventions for such youths, the current study examined the impact of an intervention targeting the prevention of internalizing and externalizing problems for girls in foster care prior to middle school entry. Study participants included 100 girls in state-supported foster homes who were randomly assigned to an intervention condition or to a control condition (foster care services as usual). The intervention girls were hypothesized to have fewer internalizing problems, fewer externalizing problems, and more prosocial behavior at 6-months post-baseline compared to the control girls. The results confirmed the hypotheses for internalizing and externalizing problems, but not for prosocial behavior. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB Previous research has revealed that youth seen at community clinics present with a higher frequency of externalizing problems and are demographically different from youth seen at research clinics. This study extends findings on these discrepancies by examining differences between youth at research and community clinics meeting criteria for two different primary disorders (anxiety and depression). Consistent with prior research, community clinic youth reported lower incomes, were more ethnically diverse, and had higher rates of externalizing problems compared to research clinic youth, regardless of primary diagnosis. Findings are discussed in terms of enhancing dissemination of evidence-based treatments for internalizing disorders in community settings.

ID POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; YOUNG-CHILDREN; SCALE
AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to conduct a prospective assessment of preoperative anxiety in adolescents undergoing surgery.
   Aim: To systematically conduct a multimodal evaluation of preoperative anxiety in adolescents undergoing surgery.
   Background: The existing literature on preoperative anxiety in children has overwhelmingly ignored adolescents in the surgical setting, yet adolescents may be at risk for under treatment of preoperative anxiety.
   Methods: A total of 59 adolescents aged 11-18 were recruited. Behavioral and physiological manifestations of anxiety were assessed with a visual analog scale and an ambulatory physiological data recorder that collected heart rate (HR), skin conductance level (SCL), and blood pressure data. Baseline emotional and behavioral functioning (child behavior checklist [CBCL]) as well as temperament (early adolescent temperament questionnaire-revised - parent version) and other potential risk factors were also assessed.
   Results: Over 80% of adolescents reported significant anxiety at the time of induction. Self-reported anxiety increased significantly at each time point (holding, separation from parents, and mask introduction), P = 0.001. Significant increases in both HR (P = 0.02) and SCL (P < 0.001) were found from holding to mask introduction. Several risk factors were found to predict higher anxiety at mask introduction, including baseline anxiety and depression (CBCL, Internalizing, P = 0.04), somatizing problems (P = 0.05), and fearful temperament (P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: A large proportion of adolescents experience significant anxiety that increases from the preoperative holding area to anesthesia induction. Underlying baseline anxiety and depression as well somatization and fearful temperament are predictors of this phenomenon.

AB We studied the efficacy and implementation outcomes of a culturally responsive parent training (PT) program. Fifty-four Chinese American parents participated in a wait-list controlled group randomized trial (32 immediate treatment, 22 delayed treatment) of a 14-week intervention designed to address the needs of high-risk immigrant families. Parents were eligible for intervention if they were Chinese-speaking immigrants referred from schools, community clinics, or child protective services with concerns about parenting or child behavior problems. Retention and engagement were high with 83% of families attending 10 or more sessions. Results revealed that the treatment was efficacious in reducing negative discipline, increasing positive parenting, and decreasing child externalizing and internalizing problems. Treatment effects were larger among families with higher levels of baseline behavior problems and lower levels of parenting stress. Further augmentation of PT to address immigrant parent stress may be warranted. Qualitative impressions from group leaders suggested that slower pacing and increased rehearsal of skills may improve efficacy for immigrant parents unfamiliar with skills introduced in PT.

AB Background and objectives: There is no clear gold standard treatment for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An annotated bibliography and meta-analysis were used to examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of pediatric PTSD as measured by outcome data from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Method: A literature search produced 21 studies; of these, 10 utilized the CBCL but only eight were both 1) randomized; and 2) reported pre- and post-intervention scores.
   Results: The annotated bibliography revealed efficacy in general of CBT for pediatric PTSD. Using four indices of the CBCL, the meta-analysis identified statistically significant effect sizes for three of the four scales: Total Problems (IP;-.327; p = .003), Internalizing (INT;-.314; p = .001), and Externalizing (EXT;.192; p = .040). The results for TP and INT were reliable as indicated by the fail-safe N and rank correlation tests. The effect size for the Total Competence (TCOMP;.054; p =.620) index did not reach statistical significance.
   Limitations: Limitations included methodological inconsistencies across studies and lack of a randomized control group design, yielding few studies for meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: The efficacy of CBT in the treatment of pediatric PTSD was supported by the annotated bibliography and meta-analysis, contributing to best practices data. CBT addressed internalizing signs and symptoms (as measured by the CBCL) such as anxiety and depression more robustly than it did externalizing symptoms such as aggression and rule-breaking behavior, consistent with its purpose as a therapeutic intervention.

AB This study examined the effects of marital conflict on Korean children's psychological adjustment and appraisal of hypothetical marital conflict situations. Children between the ages of 10 and 12 were divided into "highconflict'' (n = 58) and "low-conflict'' (n = 58) groups based on their self-reported degree of perceived interparental conflict in the home environment. Hypothetical marital conflict situations were provided in cartoon format, and were differentiated based conflict intensity (verbal versus physical aggression) and content (child-related conflict versus non-child-related conflict). In general, children reported greater negative affect and perceived threat to hypothetical conflict situations involving physical aggression compared to situations involving verbal conflict. In child-related conflict situations, children reported more fear of being drawn in and endorsed coping strategies that involved direct intervention. "High-conflict group'' children evidenced stronger reactivity in responding to marital conflict situations in general and endorsed indirect intervention strategies-a finding previously not found in similar studies conducted with European-American children-indicating the possibility of cross-cultural difference in coping preferences in interparental conflict situations. Furthermore, "high-conflict group'' children manifested more indices of maladjustment as indicated by externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, in addition to more self-reported depressive symptoms. Results highlight the effects of marital conflict on children's psychological adjustment and indicate the possibility of cross-cultural differences in preferred coping mechanism in interparental conflict situations for Korean children.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the level of agreement between child-and caregiver-reports of the child's psychosocial problems presenting to a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) using a validated screening tool. This was an anonymous, prospective, cross-sectional, multi-informant (child and caregiver) study assessing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems and physical complaints in children and adolescents presenting to a PED. Three-hundred and fifty-eight children and adolescents (8-18 years old) and their caregivers participated. Children completed the Youth-Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-Y), while their caregivers completed the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-35 (PSC-35) to measure psychosocial impairment. The child's physical complaints (e.g., chief complaint, chronicity, other medical problems, medications) and demographic information were assessed using an investigator-developed patient background questionnaire completed by the caregivers. Physical complaints (e.g., chief complaint, chronicity, other medical problems, medications) were assessed using an investigator-developed patient background questionnaire. Agreement between child-and caregiver-reports was analyzed using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Differences between child and caregiver-reported scores were determined by t-tests. Poor to moderate agreement was found between child-and caregiver-reports of attention problems (k = .355), externalizing problems (k = .340), internalizing problems (k = .065), and total PSC score (k = .410). Both children and caregivers should complete the psychosocial screener to maximize the accuracy of assessment and the identification of impairment.

AB Agreement between parents and teachers on ratings of three domains of behaviors exhibited by preschool children and the structural relations between these domains were measured. Parents and teachers rated the behaviors of a socioeconomically diverse sample of 610 children; ratings were obtained from parents at three time points and from teachers at two time points. The results indicated little agreement between sources on the ratings of individual child behaviors; however, ratings within a source were stable over time. Principal components analyses of source ratings combined and separately indicated virtually identical and independent three-component solutions comprised of a coping competence, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior component. These data suggest that competence and dysfunction develop in response to different contextual demands and underscore the importance of measuring each domain of behavior in clinical and research settings.

AB The present study examined associations between child sexual abuse (CSA), adult sexual victimization, and emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of 168 incarcerated women. Approximately 50% of the participants reported CSA, 54% reported adult sexual victimization, and 38% reported sexual revictimization (i.e., CSA and adult victimization). Revictimized women reported significantly greater difficulties with several facets of emotion regulation when compared to singly victimized and nonvictimized women. Interestingly, singly victimized women did not demonstrate greater emotion regulation deficits when compared to nonvictims. Findings suggest that the negative impact of victimization experiences on adult emotion regulation abilities may be cumulative. Furthermore, they highlight the potential importance of assessing and targeting emotion regulation difficulties among child abuse and adult sexual victimization survivors.

AB This study considers demographic, offense, and disorder contributors to exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a large (N = 9,611) dataset of standardized psychiatric assessments resulting from nationwide collaborations with justice agencies. Youths' antisocial history may elevate risk for traumatic exposure and PTSD; additionally, traumatic victimization increases risk for externalizing behavior. Rates of all types of traumatic exposure and PTSD were clearly elevated and expectably related to disorder and antisocial behavior. Males were significantly more likely than females to report assaultive violence, whereas females were significantly more likely than males to report forced sexual activity. Gender interactions with disorder and antisocial behavior were contributory only in predicting forced sexual activity: females' exposure was not conditional on features characterizing males' exposure. Findings highlight the high levels of trauma exposure at all levels of juvenile justice processing, and the particular vulnerability of males with internalizing psychopathology. Consistent with increased recent interest in the diagnosis of developmental trauma disorder, and given the likely interconnectedness between traumatic exposure and externalizing symptoms, treatment approaches for justice youths should address their co-occurrence.

AB Building upon previous evidence for the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviors, this research assessed and compared three models seeking to explain links between fathers' antisocial behaviors and children's behavior problems. A representative sample of children from low-income families (N=261) was followed from age 3 through age 9. Lagged OLS regression models assessed both short-term (1 1/2 years) and longer-term (5 1/2 years) prospective links between fathers' antisocial behaviors and children's behavior problems. Results supported a direct effects model: fathers' antisocial behaviors predicted growth in children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, with links stronger among resident-father families. Limited evidence of indirect effects emerged, with links between fathers' antisocial behaviors and children's behavior problems only slightly attenuated controlling for related risk factors and for parenting quality, showing limited evidence of mediation. A new interactive model was proposed and supported, with high levels of harsh discipline exacerbating negative links between fathers' antisocial behaviors and children's internalizing problems. Results suggest caution in policies and programs which seek to universally increase marriage or father involvement without attention to fathers' behaviors.

AB Using a dual trajectory modeling approach, we examined co-occurring trajectories of depression and delinquency from age 11 to age 18 and their relation to adult outcome six years later in a community sample of 1423 (674 boys) adolescents. We also examined the effects of childhood externalizing, internalizing, and social problems on trajectory membership for depression and delinquency. The results showed that although more girls than boys were likely to follow high-level, co-occurring trajectories on depression and delinquency, the adult outcome of adolescents following high-level trajectories on both domains was poorer for boys than for girls. However, the combination of decreasing depression symptoms and increasing delinquency symptoms across adolescence was related with poorer adult outcomes for girls compared to boys. Finally, whereas boys' high-level co-occurring trajectory of depression and delinquency was predicted by childhood aggression, girls' equivalent trajectory was predicted by childhood depression and delinquency. The findings support the "gender paradox" effect (Loeber & Keenan, 1994) stating that in disorders with an unequal gender ratio, members of the gender with the lower prevalence rate tend to be more seriously affected in terms of comorbidity and poor outcome.

AB Many newly arrived international adoptees (IA) have difficulties with eating, sleeping, and self-soothing/self-stimulating (SS) behaviors. However, to date the prevalence of these problems and associated risk factors have not been clearly identified. Therefore, we proposed to evaluate 387 IA for the presence of these self-regulation and behavioral difficulties, and examined the relationships between these behaviors and pre-adoptive risk factors including growth measures, orphanage care, age at arrival and presence of medical complications. Data on participants were collected in a retrospective chart review and entered into a standardized data collection sheet by a trained research assistant. This exploratory study included 133 M and 254 F with an average age (M = 16) months at the time of the study. Children in the study represented adoptees from seventeen countries. Forty-nine per cent (49%) of the retrospective sample exhibited SS behaviors, 48% had sleep disturbances, and 34% had eating issues. Many had difficulties in more than one area. Country of origin, pre-adoption residence, and arrival nutritional status all related to the presence of these problems. Hence, self-regulation difficulties are common but both the course and influence of those behaviors on family functioning remains unknown.

AB Parental deployment during military conflicts has the potential to impact child adjustment. As increased numbers of military Service members have children, it is critical to understand the association between military deployment and child adjustment. In order to resolve inconsistencies in the existing literature, we performed a meta-analytic review of 16 studies that report associations of military deployment with internalizing, externalizing, and academic adjustment among children. Results indicate a small association between deployment and poorer adjustment. This association varied across several features of the studies. Age moderation was such that the associations are strongest in middle childhood and weakest during adolescence. The method that adjustment was assessed also moderated this association, such that maladjustment was evident primarily with parents' reports. Study design also moderated associations, such that comparisons to civilian controls indicated associations with maladjustment, whereas comparisons to nondeployed military and prepost comparisons did not. These findings summarize the existing quantitative literature to indicate that parental deployment has a negligible association with child maladjustment and provide a foundation for future research.

AB Guided by an evolutionary model of allostatic load, this study examined the hypothesis that the association between interparental aggression and subsequent changes in children's cortisol reactivity to interparental conflict is moderated by their temperamental dispositions. Participants of the multimethod, longitudinal study included 201 2-year-old toddlers and their mothers. These children experienced elevated levels of aggression between parents. Consistent with the theory, the results indicated that interparental aggression predicted greater cortisol reactivity over a 1-year period for children who exhibited high levels of temperamental inhibition and vigilance. Conversely, for children with bold, aggressive temperamental characteristics, interparental aggression was marginally associated with diminished cortisol reactivity. Further underscoring its implications for allostatic load, increasing cortisol reactivity over the one year span was related to concomitant increases in internalizing symptoms but decreases in attention and hyperactivity difficulties. In supporting the evolutionary conceptualization, these results further supported the relative developmental advantages and costs associated with escalating and dampened cortisol reactivity to interparental conflict.

AB Although the majority of research attention to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in stress-related disorders and as a marker of allostatic load has focused on overactivation of this stress system, theory and data clearly indicate that underactivation is also an important type of dysregulation. In the current study we focused on low cortisol, exploring a constellation of risk factors including stress exposure, maternal depression, and attenuated basal and stress reactive cortisol in two samples of children. The first sample was comprised of 110 preschoolers living in high-stress environments. Cortisol was assessed across the day at home and at child care as well as across two stress paradigms. These data were used to classify whether children's HPA axis activity was attenuated. Serious family financial strain, maternal depression, and attenuated cortisol all made unique contributions in models predicting current clinical levels of internalizing symptoms as rated by mothers and teachers. The second sample was 166 third, sixth, and ninth graders studied five times across a 1-year period. Maternal and child depression were determined through structured clinical interviews, and stress exposure was assessed via checklist and interview techniques with the child and parent. Cortisol was assessed multiple times across a lab visit at Time 1, and these data were combined into a single continuous measure. Cortisol concentrations across the lab visit interacted with stress exposure across the year such that children with lower average cortisol at Time 1 and increased stress across the 12 months showed elevated levels of internalizing symptoms. Based on these and related data we propose that prior to puberty low cortisol may be an important marker of allostatic load, particularly for risk of depression and anxiety.

AB The current study investigated the stability of peer victimization and the impact of the timing and duration of victimization on psychological and academic outcomes for boys and girls on a sample of 863 middle school students. Results demonstrated strong support for the onset hypothesis and concurrent effects of maladjustment in anxiety, depression, self-esteem, poor school attitude, GPA, and attendance. Support for the cessation hypothesis was mixed, depending on the outcome and gentler: boys demonstrated recovery from internalizing distress, whereas girls demonstrated residual effects, even after the cessation of victimization. Girls also demonstrated residual effects of victimization on grades, and both boys and girls evidenced residual effects of victimization on attendance. Regarding duration of victimization, there was strong support for the life-events model of stress and coping across almost all outcomes, suggesting that even temporary experiences of victimization could have a negative impact on psychological and academic outcomes. Overall, results demonstrated the importance of considering the timing and duration of victimization in understanding the risks and damaging effects of victimization. The results from this study also highlight both the need and the potential to intervene during early adolescence when peer relationships are taking on increasing importance, as well as the importance of helping students regain social-emotional and academic functioning, even after victimization ceases.

AB Objective To determine whether children with hemifacial microsomia (HFM) have higher risk for psychosocial problems than children without HFM. Methods One hundred and thirty-six children with HFM (64% male, mean age 6.9 years) were compared to 568 matched controls (50% male, mean age 7.0 years) on parent and teacher measures of behavior problems and social competence, and teacher rankings of peer acceptance. Results Parents of cases and controls reported similar levels of behavior problems and social competence. Teachers reported higher frequencies of internalizing problems, lower social competence and less peer acceptance for cases. Relative to controls, teacher-rated outcomes were worse for female cases, those with younger mothers at the time of birth, those with eye anomalies, and those with one or more malformations in addition to the core features of HFM. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of relatively poor psychosocial outcomes among children with HFM.

AB Objective: In a long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (Compas et al., 2009) to examine the effects at 18- and 24-month follow-ups of a family group cognitive-behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for mental health outcomes for children and parents from families (N = 111) of parents with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Parents with a history of MDD and their 9- to 15-year-old children were randomly assigned to a FGCB intervention or a written information comparison condition. Children's internalizing, externalizing, anxiety/depression, and depressive symptoms; episodes of MDD and other psychiatric diagnoses; and parents' depressive symptoms and episodes of MDD were assessed at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Results: Children in the FGCB condition were significantly lower in self-reports of anxiety/depression and internalizing symptoms at 18 months and were significantly lower in self-reports of externalizing symptoms at 18 and 24 months. Rates of MDD were significantly lower for children in the FGCB intervention over the 24-month follow-up (odds ratio = 2.91). Marginal effects were found for parents' symptoms of depression at 18 and 24 months but not for episodes of MDD. Conclusions: Support was found for a FGCB preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of MDD significantly reducing children's episodes of MDD over a period of 2 years. Significant effects for the FGCB intervention were also found on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with stronger effects at 18- than at 24-month follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although many toddlers with expressive vocabulary delay ("late talkers") present with age-appropriate language skills by the time they are of school age, little is known about their broader behavioral and emotional profile. The aim of this study was to determine whether late talkers are at increased risk for behavioral and emotional problems during childhood and adolescence.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study. Early expressive vocabulary was measured by parent report at age 2 years using the Language Development Survey. Late talkers were defined as toddlers who scored at or below the 15th percentile on the Language Development Survey for their gender but were screened not to have any other developmental delays. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to measure problem child behavior with continuous z scores and clinical thresholds at ages 2, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years. Potential confounders included maternal and family sociodemographic characteristics as well as prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure.
   RESULTS: At age 2 years, late talkers (n = 142) had higher Child Behavior Checklist scores (representing poorer behavior) than control toddlers (n = 1245) in total, internalizing, and externalizing scales and higher risk for clinically significant internalizing and externalizing problems. Regression models, incorporating the confounding variables, revealed no association between late-talking status at age 2 years and behavioral and emotional problems at the 5-, 8-, 10-, 14-, and 17-year follow-ups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Expressive vocabulary delay at the age of 2 years is not in itself a risk factor for later behavioral and emotional disturbances. Pediatrics 2011;128:e324-e332

AB Previous studies suggest an altered circadian regulation of arousal in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as measured by activity, circadian preference, and sleep-wake patterns. Although heart rate is an important measure to evaluate arousal profiles, to date it is unknown whether 24-h heart rate patterns differentiate between children with and without ADHD. In this study, 24-h heart rate data were collected in 30 non-medicated children with ADHD (aged 6-11) and 30 sex-, class-, and age-matched normal controls in their naturalistic home and school setting, during 5 days. Simultaneously, 24-h activity patterns were registered. Confounding effects of demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, BMI, pubertal stage) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems on heart rate levels were additionally assessed. Longitudinal analysis showed that heart rate levels were overall higher in the ADHD group (p < 0.01)-with the largest effects during afternoon and night-in a model controlling for age. Other factors did not significantly contribute to variations in heart rate levels. Compared to controls, children with ADHD showed higher activity levels during daytime (especially early afternoon), but not during nighttime (p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses showed that environmental effects might influence daytime variations. Findings suggest an autonomic imbalance in children with ADHD as compared to controls, with higher heart rate levels in the ADHD group. Nighttime tachycardia in this group could not be explained by nighttime activity levels or comorbid externalizing/internalizing problems. Further research on autonomic functioning in ADHD is recommended because of the major impact of higher resting heart rate on health outcomes.

AB The main goal of this study was to examine the direct and moderating effects of trustworthiness and modeling on adolescent siblings' adjustment. Data were collected from 438 families including a mother, a younger sibling in fifth, sixth, or seventh grade (M = 11.6 years), and an older sibling (M = 14.3 years). Respondents completed Web-based surveys describing sibling conflict and warmth. Siblings reported on trustworthiness and modeling, and mothers described adjustment. Sibling conflict was directly associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors for both siblings. The older siblings' reports of trustworthiness were directly associated with the outcome measures. The younger siblings' reports of trustworthiness were less directly associated, but a possible salutary effect was most evident under the highest levels of sibling conflict or warmth. Higher sibling modeling was a risk factor for adjustment problems in relations characterized by high conflict. Results support exploring trustworthiness as a key dimension of sibling relations.

AB This essay provides estimates of the influence of mass imprisonment on racial disparities in childhood well-being. To do so, we integrate results from three existing studies in a novel way. The first two studies use two contemporary, broadly representative data sets to estimate the effects of paternal incarceration on a range of child behavioral and mental health problems. The third study estimates changes in Black-White disparities in the risk of paternal imprisonment across the 1978 and 1990 American birth cohorts. Our research demonstrates the following:
   1) The average effect of paternal incarceration on children is harmful, not helpful, and consistently in the direction of more mental health and behavioral problems.
   2) The rapid increase in the use of imprisonment coupled with significant racial disparities in the likelihood of paternal (and maternal) imprisonment are linked to large racial disparities in childhood mental health and behavioral problems.
   3) We find that mass imprisonment might have increased Black-White inequities in externalizing behaviors by 14-26% and in internalizing behaviors by 25-45%.
   Policy Implications
   Our results add to a growing research literature indicating that the costs associated with mass imprisonment extend far beyond well-documented impacts on current inmates. The legacy of mass incarceration will be continued and worsening racial disparities in childhood mental health and well-being, educational attainment, and occupational attainment. Moreover, the negative effects of mass imprisonment for childhood wellbeing are likely to remain, even if incarceration rates returned to pre-1970s levels. Our results show that paternal incarceration exacerbates child behavioral and mental health problems and that large, growing racial disparities in the risk of imprisonment have contributed to significant racial differences in child well-being. The policy implications of our work are as follows:
   1) Estimates of the costs associated with the current scale of imprisonment are likely to be severely underestimated because they do not account for the significant indirect effects of mass incarceration for children, for families, and for other social institutions such as the educational system and social service providers.
   2) Policies that reduce incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders with no history of domestic violence will most dramatically reduce the effects of mass incarceration on childhood racial inequality. More research is needed to detail other important factors (e.g., crime type, criminal history, or gender of parent) that condition the effect of paternal incarceration on children.
   3) Paternal incarceration effects target the most disadvantaged and vulnerable of children and are likely to result in long-term behavioral health problems. We propose a strengthening of the social safety net-especially as it applies to the poorest children-and programs that address the complicated needs of children of incarcerated parents.

AB Background: The adverse effect of both pre- and post-natal maternal anxiety and depression on the development of offspring is shown by a large body of research. No published studies, however, have simultaneously: (i) controlled for co-occurring prenatal risks that may influence maternal prenatal anxiety and depression; (ii) compared the relative contributions of prenatal and postnatal maternal anxiety and depression on child functioning; and (iii) assessed a full range of child psychopathology and functioning to determine the relative effects of prenatal and postnatal anxiety and depression in the mother. Method: Using 3,298 mother offspring pairs, the authors examined these factors in a single-path analytic model. Measurements of maternal anxiety and depression were collected at two time points: 32 weeks prenatal and 1.5 years postnatal. Other prenatal risks were assessed between 8 and 32 weeks of gestation. Child outcomes included (a) ordered-categorical measures of DSM-IV externalizing and internalizing disorders, and (b) an assessment of verbal IQ. Results: In both the prenatal and postnatal periods, maternal depression had a wider impact on different types of child maladjustment than maternal anxiety, which appeared more specific to internalizing difficulties in the child. Of note, prenatal risks were prospectively associated with child externalizing difficulties and verbal IQ, beyond the effects of prenatal and postnatal maternal anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The present results suggest that addressing both maternal anxiety and depression, in the prenatal and postnatal periods as well as associated risk factors may be the most effective approach to prevent adverse outcomes in the offspring.

AB Purpose: Video game use has been associated with several behavioral and health outcomes for adolescents. The aim of the current study was to assess the relationship between parental co-play of video games and behavioral and family outcomes.
   Method: Participants consisted of 287 adolescents and their parents who completed a number of video game-, behavioral-, and family-related questionnaires as part of a wider study. Most constructs included child, mother, and father reports.
   Results: At the bivariate level, time spent playing video games was associated with several negative outcomes, including heightened internalizing and aggressive behavior and lowered prosocial behavior. However, co-playing video games with parents was associated with decreased levels of internalizing and aggressive behaviors, and heightened prosocial behavior for girls only. Co-playing video games was also marginally related to parent-child connectedness for girls, even after controlling for age-inappropriate games played with parents.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to show positive associations for co-playing video games between girls and their parents. (C) 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Youth suicide represents an area of important public and mental health concern. Although diagnostic correlates (e.g., depression) of suicidality have been identified, very few studies of youth have analyzed relationships between empirically-derived dimensions of psychopathology, representing broader dimensions of risk, and different suicidality indicators. We recruited 223 adolescents (57% female; 32% ethnic minority) from mental health agencies and the community to assess psychopathology, substance use, and suicidality relying on multiple measures and reporters (youth, parent, and clinician). Using a 3-factor model of psychopathology, we found that the Internalizing factor (including depression and generalized anxiety) was associated with both suicidal thinking and behaviors (threats/attempts), the Externalizing factor (conduct, oppositional, and attention deficit disorders) was negatively related only to suicidal thinking, and the Substance Use factor (alcohol and cannabis use) related to suicidal behaviors of threats/attempts but not suicidal thinking. The results show the utility of a dimensional conceptualization for clarifying distinct vulnerabilities to suicidal thinking versus overt behaviors and have implications for the construct validity of distinct dimensions of psychopathology.

AB Background. Little is known about the long-term mental health of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (<1000 g) survivors. We test whether young adults aged 22 to 26 years born at ELBW differ from normal birth weight (NBW) controls in self-reported levels of psychopathology.
   Method. Participants included 142 ELBW survivors (86% response) born between 1977 and 1982 to residents of central-west Ontario, Canada and 133 NBW control subjects (92% response). The Young Adult Self-Report measure was used to create five DSM-IV oriented scales aggregated to form internalizing (depressive problems, anxiety problems, avoidant personality problems) and externalizing (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder problems and antisocial personality problems) scales.
   Results. After adjusting for family background characteristics, mean scores for ELBW survivors were 3.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-5.26] points higher for internalizing problems and no different, i.e. 0.00 (95% CI -1.17 to 1.17), for externalizing problems. There was a sex x group statistical interaction such that being male muted the risk for externalizing problems among those born at ELBW: -2.11 (95% CI -4.21 to -0.01). Stratifying ELBW adults as born small for gestational age (SGA) versus appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA) revealed a significant gradient of risk for levels of internalizing problems that was largest for SGA, i.e. 4.75 (95% CI 1.24-8.26), and next largest for AGA, 2.49 (95% CI 0.11-4.87), compared with NBW controls.
   Conclusions. Depression, anxiety and avoidant personality problems (internalizing problems) are elevated in young adulthood among ELBW survivors. This effect is relatively small overall but noticeably larger among ELBW survivors born SGA.

AB This study examined the relations among community violence exposure, inter-partner conflict and informal social support and the behaviour problems of pre-schoolers, and explored how mothers' parenting skills and children's social skills may mediate the child outcomes associated with such exposure. Participants were 185 African-American mothers and female caregivers of Head Start children who completed study measures in a structured interview. Path analyses revealed that greater inter-partner conflict was associated with more internalizing and externalizing child behaviour problems. Positive parenting was associated with fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Higher levels of child social skills were associated with fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. Child social skills fully mediated the relationship between community violence and externalizing behaviours as well as between informal support and externalizing behaviours. Social skills partially mediated the relationships between positive parenting and externalizing behaviours. No mediating effect was found on the relationships between inter-partner conflict and child behaviour problems. Implications of the findings for intervention and future research are discussed.

AB The present study set out to investigate the adjustment of Former Soviet Union (FSU) children living in Israel as well as their veteran-Israeli peers. The sample consisted of 145 children (70 veteran-Israelis and 75 FSU) between the ages of 4.0 and 6.5 years old (M = 5.54, SD = .48) and their parents. Mothers and fathers reported about the children's problem behavior and on their own parenting behavior. Analyses revealed that FSU children exhibited more externalizing and peer problems than did their veteran-Israeli peers. No significant differences, however, were found for internalizing problems. Furthermore, FSU mothers and fathers reported significantly lower levels of authoritarian parenting behavior than did their veteran-Israeli counterparts. Finally, ethnicity was found to moderate links between parenting and children's problem behavior for mothers but not for fathers. Specifically, for the veteran-Israeli group, the more authoritarian mothers were, the more externalizing and peer problems their children exhibited. However, for the FSU families, the more authoritarian mothers were, the more internalizing problems suffered by their children. These findings suggest that authoritarian parenting may be reflected differently in distinct cultures and cultural conditions, and they highlight the importance of considering both mothers and fathers, as they may go through different acculturation processes.

AB AIM It is now generally accepted that paediatric acquired brain injury (ABI) can have an impact on a child's cognitive, social, and behavioural functioning. However, the lack of guidelines on effective interventions for the affected children and their families, particularly beyond the acute recovery phase, can limit access to effective support. We provide a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of psychological interventions aimed at alleviating cognitive and psychosocial outcomes after paediatric ABI.
   METHOD The search used the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO databases and hand searches of key journals. Nine studies met inclusion criteria: five intervention studies of cognitive outcome and four of psychosocial outcome. Effect sizes and methodological quality ratings were calculated using specific criteria.
   RESULTS Only two of the nine studies were rated as high quality. There was limited evidence for effective interventions for cognitive outcomes (attention, memory, and learning difficulties). For psychosocial outcomes, there was evidence that interventions can alleviate internalizing symptoms.
   INTERPRETATION Although there are some encouraging findings, there is a need for further, more rigorously designed, and better controlled research in this important area. We discuss how future research may consider issues such as age-appropriate interventions, the delivery format, and optimum post-injury timing of interventions, as well as multicentre collaborations.

AB The goal of the current study was to determine within a clinical sample what differentiates children with ADHD who experience social functioning difficulties from those who appear to have healthy social functioning. Participants for this study included 62 children (mean age = 11.3 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD confirmed by a comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessment. Multiple indicators of children's social functioning were collected via parent report including: social skills, social adaptability, peer difficulties, and social quality of life. Parent reports of children's externalizing, internalizing, and atypical behaviors were also collected. Results indicated that both externalizing symptoms and atypical behaviors predicted children with ADHD's social functioning, even after controlling for ADHD symptoms severity. No association was found between internalizing symptoms and social functioning. The current study provides initial data suggesting that atypical behaviors found in children with ADHD are as powerful as comorbid externalizing symptoms in predicting social functioning difficulties. Due to the shared variance from relying solely on parent report, it will be critical for future research to replicate our findings using multi-informant data such as peer and teacher reports which provide unique information on children's social functioning.

AB Given the importance of predicting outcomes for early adolescents, this study examines a multivariate model of parent-adolescent relationship variables, including parenting, family environment, and conflict. Participants, who completed measures assessing these variables, included 710 culturally diverse 11-14-year-olds who were attending a middle school in a Southeastern state. The parents of a subset of these adolescents (i.e., 487 mother-father pairs) participated in this study as well. Correlational analyses indicate that authoritative and authoritarian parenting, family cohesion and adaptability, and conflict are significant predictors of early adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Structural equation modeling analyses indicate that fathers' parenting may not predict directly externalizing problems in male and female adolescents but instead may act through conflict. More direct relationships exist when examining mothers' parenting. The impact of parenting, family environment, and conflict on early adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems and the importance of both gender and cross-informant ratings are emphasized.

AB Background: While suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in most industrial countries, non-fatal suicidal behaviour is also a very important public health concern among adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in prevalence and emotional and behavioural correlates of suicidal behaviour in a representative school-based sample of adolescents.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to assess suicidal behaviour and various areas of emotional and behavioural problems by using a self-report booklet including the Youth Self-Report. One hundred sixteen schools in a region of Southern Germany agreed to participate. A representative sample of 5,512 ninth-grade students was studied. Mean age was 14.8 years (SD 0.73); 49.8% were female.
   Results: Serious suicidal thoughts were reported by 19.8% of the female students and 10.8% of the females had ever attempted suicide. In the male group, 9.3% had a history of suicidal thoughts and 4.9% had previously attempted suicide. Internalizing emotional and behavioural problems were shown to be higher in the female group (difference of the group means 4.41) while externalizing emotional and behavioural problems slightly predominated in male students (difference of the group means -0.65). However, the total rate of emotional and behavioural problems was significantly higher in the adolescent female group (difference of the group means 4.98). Using logistic regression models with suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide as dependent variables, the pseudo-R-2 of gender alone was only 2.7% or 2.3%, while it was 30% or 23.2% for emotional and behavioural problems measured by the YSR syndrome scales. By adding gender to the emotional and behavioural problems only an additional 0.3% of information could be explained.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that gender differences in non-fatal suicidal behaviour among adolescents can to a large extent be explained by the gender differences in emotional and behavioural problems during this age.

AB The question of whether a psychodynamic view is compatible with experimental research is still a challenging issue especially for child and adolescent psychopathology despite the influence of psychoanalytic theory in this field until the 1980s. In this article, is explored the relationship between psychodynamic theory and experimental research using examples of evidence-based studies in the fields of (i) psychotherapeutic intervention assessment, (ii) placebo response in children and adolescents, (iii) unconscious lasting traumatic effects in children and adolescents, (iv) psychodynamic-oriented psychological testing. There are now a sufficient number of evidence-based studies to support the use of psychodynamic therapy in mental disorders, particularly in personality disorder and anxious/depressive disorder. In addition, placebo responses in children and adolescents with internalizing disorders are significantly higher in major depression compared to obsessive-compulsive disorder or other anxiety disorders, which highlights differential psychopathologies regarding the experience of loss. Also, using an experimental task, psychoanalysts are able to identify, without explicit knowledge and above the level of chance, healthy adults whose siblings had experienced cancer during childhood. This experiment suggests that implicit information regarding a participant's history is conveyed in interpersonal exchanges that can be intuitively perceived by judges experienced in listening to free associations from a psychodynamic perspective. Finally, psychodynamic-oriented psychological testing may predict the transition to schizophrenia in adolescents with a history of manic/mixed episodes. It can be concluded that there are no discrepancies between psychodynamic views and experimental data, whether one tests psychotherapeutic approaches, discusses data from other fields such as psychopharmacology, or designs experiments based on psychodynamic theory.

AB Objective: Psychological maltreatment (PM) is the most prevalent form of child abuse, and is the core component of most of what is considered as child maltreatment. The aim of this work was to explore differential adverse outcomes of the different types of PM in the mental health and functioning of children living in homes in which they are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV).
   Method: Participants were 168 children, aged between 4 and 17, whose mothers experienced IPV. They were assessed using different measures of psychopathology and functioning: Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV, Child Behavior Checklists and Child and Adolescent Functioning Assessment Scale. Furthermore, IPV was assessed with the Schedule for Assessment of Intimate Partner Violence Exposure in Children and the Index of Spouse Abuse. Statistical analyses were carried out with regression models adjusted by means of Generalized Estimating Equations.
   Results: Spurning was the PM subtype with the greatest global effect on the children, as it was significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. Denying emotional responsiveness specifically increased the risk of internalizing psychopathology and impairment in the emotional area. Terrorizing was not significantly associated with a greater number of negative outcomes in children's psychopathology or functioning in this population.
   Implications: The results suggest the importance of taking PM types into account in order to fully understand the problems of children exposed to IPV at home, and for the design of effective treatment and prevention programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence and quality of friendships are posited to have developmental significance, yet little is known about the extent to which children without friends versus low-quality friendships compare on socioemotional adjustment. The current study utilized data from a subsample of 567 children (289 boys) participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Based on maternal reports at kindergarten, four friendship groups were formed: no friends, low quality, average quality, and high quality, and these groups were used to predict teacher-reported behaviour problems and social skills concurrently (in kindergarten) and longitudinally (in first and third grade). Concurrently, low-quality friendships were associated with greater externalizing behaviour, whereas high-quality friendships were associated with greater social skills. Longitudinally, having no friends in kindergarten was associated with higher levels of externalizing behaviour for boys, but lower levels for girls. Children without friends also showed more internalizing problems at first grade. Lastly, having a high-quality friendship in kindergarten was associated with greater social skills in first and third grades, but only for boys. Results underscore high-quality friendship as a context for the development of social skills and indicate different trajectories of problem behaviour for kindergarten children with no friends versus low-quality friendships.

AB Objective: Studies analyzing psychotherapy efficacy from the perspective of the different persons involved in the therapeutic process are lacking in the evaluation of psychotherapy outcome with children and adolescents. Methods: Treatment efficacy of 28 long-term treatments with adolescents were analyzed from the perspective of the afflicted adolescents, their parents, and their therapist. Assessments were made three times over a mean frequency of 113 h. Results: Therapy group (n = 28) and waiting group (n = 32) did not differ in relevant features, including diagnosis. In the therapy group, the therapists reported a strong reduction in symptomatology (eta(2) = .62) and communicative disturbances with parents, siblings and friends (eta(2) = .57) over time. Adolescents and parents reported a significant reduction in symptomatology (eta(2) = .26) over time, but did not differ in their evaluation of treatment effectiveness. The diagnosis (internalizing vs. externalizing disturbances) had no impact on the evaluation of treatment effectiveness of adolescents and parents. Conclusions: Psychotherapy should include the different perspectives of all persons involved.

AB Objective: This study aims to identify the predictive power of adolescents', parents', and illness characteristics on the functioning of adolescents when a mother has cancer.
   Methods: Two hundred and seventy-one adolescents, 128 mothers with cancer, and 96 spouses completed standardized questionnaires 1-5 years after diagnosis. Stress response symptoms (SRS), internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed in adolescents. Parents' SRS, trait anxiety, marital satisfaction, and parent-adolescent communication were assessed in parents. Descriptive statistics and multilevel analyses accounting for non-independence of observations within groups were used.
   Results: Descriptive analyses showed clinically elevated SRS in 20% of the sons and 30% of the daughters. Daughters experienced more internalizing problems than norm group girls. Multilevel analyses showed that adolescents' female gender and older age were associated with impaired child functioning. Higher levels of parents' trait anxiety and SRS, marital dissatisfaction, and poorer parent-adolescent communication were significant predictors also. Recurrent disease was associated with SRS and internalizing problems, and more intensive treatment with externalizing problems. Female gender and poorer parent-adolescent communication were overall the best predictors.
   Conclusions: Having a mother with cancer may have far-reaching consequences for more than a quarter of the adolescent offspring. The multilevel approach of this study identified individual-level adolescent' risk characteristics as well as family-level risk characteristics for mental health problems. Adolescents at risk should be referred to health-care professionals specialized in working with families to help them to adapt to their parent's illness. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The present study used a person-centered latent variable approach to classify types of perfectionism among 6th-grade African American children living in an urban setting. In particular, the authors were interested in determining whether an adaptive subtype could be found and validated against external criteria. The authors also attempted to identify any developmental precursors that could reliably differentiate the perfectionist subtypes. A social learning and competence framework was used to select potential 1st-grade risk and protective factors for future perfectionism profiles. Four classes best described the children's perfectionism scores in 6th grade. Three of these classes resembled the profiles most commonly seen in prior perfectionism research (Non-Critical/Adaptive, Critical/Maladaptive, and Non-Perfectionist). The fourth class, Non-Striving, was characterized by extremely low levels of reported personal standards. Sixth-grade correlates confirmed the distinctiveness of these classes. In particular, the Critical/Maladaptive and Non-Striving classes had higher rates of internalizing symptoms and disorders. Additionally, several 1st-grade predictors suggested unique developmental origins of these classes. The Critical/Maladaptive class was characterized by lower academic skills and elevated teacher-rated attention problems, hyperactivity, shyness, and peer rejection. The Non-Striving class had higher rates of family alcohol problems and lower levels of parent praise. Implications regarding the universal and culture-specific origins and effects of perfectionism are discussed.

AB The categorical model of psychopathology has failed to define unequivocal boundaries among disorders. Practical usefulness of constructs such as comorbidity, which does not solve overlapping between disorders, is scarce. Most of the problems posed by the categorical model could be solved if a dimensional explanation of psychopathology were adopted. Research data using CFA support a dimensional model, which reveals negative affect as a second order construct, underlying the symptoms of anxiety and depression. These findings have implications for diagnosis, as well as for treatment and treatment outcome research. Comparisons between categorial and functional methodology, associated respectively to categorical and dimensional models, reveal important differences.

AB An emerging body of research illustrates the connections between fathers and their children's development. This topic is particularly relevant in Quebec, a demographically and culturally unique province in which female lone parenthood is relatively common; this pattern is related to socioeconomic disadvantages that predict negative cognitive and behavioural outcomes in youth. Using data from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project, an intergenerational longitudinal data set collected in inner city areas of Montreal, the current study investigated the prospective relations between fathers' presence and parenting, and children's subsequent cognitive and behavioural functioning. The current sample included 138 families from lower to middle income backgrounds who participated in two waves of data collection: when children were in middle childhood and subsequently three to five years later in preadolescence. The results indicated that for girls only, fathers' presence in middle childhood predicted fewer internalizing problems in preadolescence. For both boys and girls, fathers' positive parental control predicted higher Performance IQ and fewer internalizing problems over six years later. These findings add to the increasing body of literature suggesting that fathers make important contributions to their children's cognitive and behavioural functioning, and point to the benefits of developing policies that encourage fathers to spend time with their children (i.e., parental leave for men) and promote positive fathering and involvement through parenting courses.

AB Disorganized/controlling attachment in preschool has been found to be associated with maternal and child maladjustment, making it of keen interest in the study of psychopathology. Additional work is needed, however, to better understand disorganized/controlling attachment occurring as early as age 3 years. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate risk factors and outcomes associated with disorganized/controlling behavior at age 3 years and to evaluate the risk factors and outcomes differentiating the four subtypes of disorganized/controlling attachment. Analyses were conducted with the first two phases of the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, a prospective study of 1,364 children from birth. At 36 months of age, across the attachment-relevant domains of maternal well-being, mother-child interactions, and child social adaptation, the disorganized/controlling group evidenced the most maladaptive patterns in comparison to both secure and insecure-organized groups. At 54 months of age, the disorganized/controlling group displayed the highest levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, as rated by mothers and teachers, and the lowest quality relationships with teachers. Significant differences found among the disorganized/controlling subtypes indicated that the behaviorally disorganized and controlling-punitive subtypes had more maladaptive patterns across variables than did the controlling-caregiving and controlling-mixed subtypes.

AB This study investigated whether measures of infant temperament, regulatory disorders, and physiological reactivity and concurrent measures of family environment were predictors of child behavior problems at 54 months of age. The sample consisted of 23 children-mother dyads. The sample recruitment strategy emphasized testing both typical and fussy/difficult infants at 9 months of age. Children were categorized into low and high behavioral problem groups at 54 months of age. The children in the high behavioral problem group were more likely at 9 months to have been temperamentally difficult, to have been classified as regulatory disordered, and to have displayed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) regulation difficulties. These children also were more likely to come from families described as less cohesive and providing less focus on active/recreational activities when the children were 54 months old. A logistic regression analysis, including only the 9-month infant measures (i.e., difficultness, regulatory disorders classification, and RSA regulation), resulted in a significant model with 100.0% accurate classification into high or low behavioral problem groups. Data suggest that infant measures of behavioral and physiological state regulation may be early indicators of child behavior problems, especially internalizing problems.

AB Youth who experience a greater number of caregiver transitions during childhood are at risk for developing a host of psychosocial problems. Although researchers have examined individual-level factors that may moderate this association, no known studies have examined the impact of community-level factors. The current study investigated whether community violence exposure (CVE) moderated the association between number of prior caregiver transitions and increases in levels of externalizing and internalizing problems for a sample of youth entering foster care. Participants included 156 youth (aged 9-11 at first assessment) removed from their homes because of maltreatment. Youth provided reports of caregiver transitions and CVE at baseline, and caregivers, teachers, and youth reported on externalizing and internalizing problems 18-22 months later. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that youth with a greater number of caregiver transitions and higher levels of CVE evidenced significant increases in levels of psychosocial problems. The results of the study are discussed in terms of their implications for child welfare services.

AB Background: Approximately 20%-25% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases have an onset in childhood or adolescence. Beyond disease severity, little is known regarding determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in this population. This study aimed to identify behavioral correlates of HRQOL and examine behavioral/emotional dysfunction (e.g., internalizing/externalizing symptoms) as the mechanism through which disease severity impacts HRQOL.
   Methods: In all, 62 adolescents (mean = 15.47 years, standard deviation [SD] = 1.42) with IBD (79% Crohn's disease) and their parents were recruited from one of two pediatric IBD specialty clinics located in the Midwest or Northeast region of the United States. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Youth Self-Report version of the Child Behavior Checklist, and the IMPACT-Ill. Disease severity was calculated for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using standardized measures.
   Results: Greater disease severity, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms were all independently associated with lower HRQOL. Furthermore internalizing symptoms partially mediated the relationship between disease activity and HRQOL, reducing the effect of disease severity on HRQOL from 22% to 9% in the mediation model. A Sobel test examining the significance of the indirect effect of disease severity on HRQOL via behavioral dysfunction was marginally nonsignificant (P = .053).
   Conclusions: Nondisease-specific variables (e.g., behavioral dysfunction) play an important role in impacting HRQOL. Behavioral dysfunction serves as the mechanism through which disease severity partially impacts HRQOL. Continued research to identify other predictors of HRQOL in pediatric IBD will greatly enhance our future ability to design interventions to improve HRQOL and maximize health outcomes.

AB Background: Analyses of large scale psychiatric epidemiology surveys suggest that common mental disorders can be generalized into two underlying dimensions, internalizing disorders (e.g. depression, and anxiety) and externalizing disorders (e.g. addictions). The present study explores the interactions among the genes (SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA) and selected environment factors (G x E), and gene x gene (G x G) interactions for internalizing disorders in the sample of Chinese university students.
   Methods: This is a genetic case control study. 259 undergraduates affected with internalizing disorders and 269 healthy controls were included. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the potential environmental risk factors. G x E interactions were analyzed using the method developed by Mukherjee et al. (2008). Analyses of G x G interactions were conducted by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) (Lou et al., 2007). We have previously reported on the polymorphism information for ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA genes (Meng et al., 2009; Meng, 2010).
   Results: We found that an offspring's reported parents' negative mood, subject's unwillingness to express emotion, being an only child, having an unfulfilling relationship with his/her mother, and increased activity and behavior restrictions by his/her father were social environment risk factors for internalizing disorders. No statistically significant interactions were found in the G x E analyses. G x G analyses found that subjects with mutational alleles concurrently on rs10835210 and rs2030324 (BDNF gene) were significantly likely to develop internalizing disorders. Those with one mutated allele on either SNPs were 1.761 times, and those with both mutated alleles were 3.353 times, more likely to develop internalizing disorders.
   Conclusion: A negative family emotional environment was found to be associated with internalizing disorders. BDNF gene variants were also found to be similarly associated. Using conservative statistical analyses we did not find any G x E interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present article used data from a community sample of primary caregivers of children between 4 and 7 years old to investigate the prevalence and correlates of emotional symptoms in young children transitioning to elementary school. Mothers (n = 3,483) and fathers (n = 1,019) living in metropolitan areas of eastern Australia participated in a telephone survey of parenting practices and child behavioral and emotional problems. Fifteen percent of mothers and 12% of fathers reported that their child showed clinically elevated levels of emotional symptoms. The most common parental responses to a child's anxious or distressed behavior were to use physical contact, talk in a soothing voice, or encourage their child to be brave, while fewer than 10% of parents ignored their child's distress by not giving any attention. For mothers, reports of child emotional symptoms were associated with mothers' use of physical contact to soothe their children, mothers' level of personal stress and depression, their confidence in managing anxious or distressed behavior, and consistency in their application of discipline. Fathers' encouragement of their children to be brave and fathers' confidence in managing anxious or distressed behavior were associated with reduced child emotional symptoms. These findings have implications for the development of universal prevention programs for internalizing disorders in children.

AB Objective: Young children involved with child welfare services are at high risk for behavior problems. This study aims to identify externalizing behavior paths that preschoolers in this high-risk population follow over a 6 year period, and the predictors of membership in normative and problematic pathways.
   Methods: Using data from the National Study of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW), the sample included 246 4-year-olds who remained home after investigation. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to estimate the number, size, and shape of subgroups of preschoolers following distinct behavioral pathways. Early predictors of membership in the resulting groups were then examined.
   Results: Four groups of preschool children following distinct behavior trajectories over 6 years were identified. Weighted results show that more than half (61%) of the children followed a low/normal problem behavior trajectory while just over one tenth (12%) were on a persistent high trajectory, remaining in the clinical range throughout the study. Improving (23%) and worsening (4%) problem behavior groups were also identified. Internalizing problems, attention problems, child ethnicity, and maltreatment type reported at age 4 predicted membership in the trajectory groups.
   Conclusions: Internalizing behavior problems and maltreatment type may distinguish preschool children who are more likely to experience worsening or persistent problematic externalizing behaviors from those likely to follow a normal behavior trajectory.
   Practice implications: Identifying early indicators of externalizing behavior problems and addressing them with evidence-based interventions to reduce negative behaviors may avert long-term negative outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To examine the prospective relationship between externalizing and internalizing problems and cannabis use in early adolescence.
   Materials and Methods: Data were used from the TRAILS study, a longitudinal cohort study of (pre)adolescents (n = 1,449), with measurements at age 11.1 (T1). age 13.6 (T2) and age 16.3 (T3). Internalizing (withdrawn behaviour, somatic complaints and depression) and externalizing (delinquent and aggressive behaviour) problems were assessed at all data waves, using the Youth Self Report. Participants reported on cannabis use at the second and third wave. Path analysis was used to identify the temporal order of internalizing and externalizing problems and cannabis use.
   Results: Path analysis showed no associations between cannabis use (T2-T3) and internalizing problems (T1-2-3). However, cannabis use and externalizing problems were associated (r ranged from .19-.58); path analysis showed that externalizing problems at T1 and T2 preceded cannabis use at T2 and T3, respectively. In contrast, cannabis use (T2) did not precede externalizing problems (T3).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that in early adolescence, there is no association between internalizing behaviour and cannabis use. There is an association between externalizing behaviour and cannabis use, and it appears that externalizing behaviour precedes cannabis use rather than the other way around during this age period.

AB Objective: To investigate whether children with varying severity of congenital heart defects (CHDs) have a higher risk of internalizing or externalizing emotional problems at 36 months of age. In addition, to analyze whether a history of emotional problems at 6 or 18 months of age increases the risk of emotional problems at 36 months in children with CHDs. Methods: Prospective data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, was linked with a nationwide CHD registry, and 175 children with CHDs were identified in a cohort of 44,104 children aged 36 months. Maternal reports on child characteristics were assessed by questionnaires at child age 6, 18, and 36 months. Results: Children with CHDs did not have elevated scores on internalizing or externalizing problems at 36 months of age compared with controls. Not even the children with CHDs with a history of emotional problems at age 6 or 18 months showed an increased risk. Conclusions: The absence of risk of emotional problems at 36 months of age in children with CHDs could be a consequence of the completion of the most extensive medical treatment.

AB This study aimed to examine alexithymic features and associations between alexithymia and psychiatric symptoms among adolescents living in a closed institution because of severe behavioral problems. Forty-seven adolescents (29 boys and 18 girls) aged 15 to 18 years completed the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) Questionnaire and the Youth Self-Report, whereas their foster parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. The TAS-20 scores of the participants were compared with those of an extensive population sample (N = 6000) matched by age and birth year. Reform school adolescents are significantly more alexithymic than the control group, and the TAS-20 scores are correlated with numerous psychiatric problems, mainly in the internalizing spectrum, but also with thought problems and self-reported aggression. Promoting abilities in identifying and describing feelings is important when treating delinquent adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND: Disentangling the effects of maternal depression in toddlerhood from concurrent maternal depression on child behavior is difficult from previous research. Child care may modify any effects of maternal depression on subsequent child behavior, but this has not been widely investigated.
   METHODS: We examined the influence of maternal depressive symptoms during toddlerhood on children's behavior at the age of 5 years and investigated if formal or informal child care during toddlerhood modified any relationship observed.
   RESULTS: Data were available from 438 mothers and their children (227 girls and 211 boys); the mothers who completed questionnaires during the children's infancy, in toddlerhood, and at the age of 5 years. Recurrent maternal depressive symptoms in toddlerhood (when study children were aged 2 and 3 1/2 years) was a significant risk factor for internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems when children were aged 5 years. Intermittent maternal depressive symptoms (study child age 2 or 3 1/2 years) did not significantly affect child behavior problems. Formal child care at the age of 2 years modified the effect of recurrent maternal depressive symptoms on total behavior problems at age 5 years. Informal child care in toddlerhood did not significantly affect child behavior problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent, but not intermittent, maternal depressive symptoms when children were toddlers were associated with child behavior problems at age 5 years. As little as half a day in formal child care at the age of 2 years significantly modified the effect of recurrent maternal depressive symptoms on total behavior problems. Formal child care for toddlers of depressed mothers may have positive benefits for the child's subsequent behavior. Pediatrics 2011;128:e78-e84

ID ADOPTION DISRUPTION; CARE; BIND; RISK; TIES
AB This study examines a range of outcomes for children in foster care who have siblings, using a large, national U.S. database. Three types of sibling placements are defined: split (child has no siblings in the home), splintered (at least one sibling in the home), and together (all siblings in the home). The study analyzes records (n = 1701) from the National Study of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing, including Child Protective Services (CPS) and Long-term Foster Care (LTFC) samples. It contributes to the literature in its inclusive definition of siblings, use of three categories for sibling placement status, and use of outcome measures that include the perceptions of foster children. The study reports limited significant findings. Neither foster parents' nor youths' reports of behavioral problems differ by sibling placement status. As rated by teachers, academic performance in the group placed together exceeds that in both of the other groups. For children in kinship homes, teachers also reported less problematic internalizing and externalizing behavior for the splintered and together groups than for the split group. Children in the splintered group also responded more favorably than those in the split group to questions of closeness to the primary caregiver and liking the people in the foster family.

AB Youth's friendships serve important functions in development; however, internalizing symptoms may undermine these relationships. Two studies are presented that examine the association of depressive and anxiety symptoms with friendship adjustment. Study 1 tested concurrent effects and Study 2 tested prospective effects over 6 months. Like past studies, depressive symptoms predicted greater problems in friendships. However, anxiety symptoms generally did not and, in some cases, actually predicted positive friendship adjustment. The results suggest that the friendships of youth with depressive symptoms should be targeted for intervention, but that incorporating the friendship strengths of anxious youth in interventions could be helpful for reducing these youth's anxiety. The results also caution researchers studying the interplay between friendships and internalizing symptoms against collapsing across assessments of depressive and anxiety symptoms.

AB Using a high-risk community sample, multiple regression analyses were conducted separately for mothers (n = 416) and fathers (n = 346) to test the unique, prospective influence of parental negative affect on adolescent maladjustment (internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and negative emotionality) 2 years later over and above parental alcohol and affective disorders, major disruption in the family environment, and parenting. Adolescent sex was tested as a moderator. Results indicated that maternal (but not paternal) negative affect had a unique, prospective effect on adolescent internalizing symptoms in girls and negative emotionality in both sexes but did not predict adolescent externalizing symptoms. Findings demonstrate that mothers' negative affect may have unique effects on adolescent adjustment that are separate from the effects of clinically significant parental psychopathology, parenting, and disruption in the family environment.

AB This study examined the relations among facial attractiveness, peer victimization, and internalizing problems in early adolescence. We hypothesized that experiences of peer victimization would partially mediate the relationship between attractiveness and internalizing problems. Ratings of attractiveness were obtained from standardized photographs of participants (93 girls and 82 boys). Teachers provided information regarding peer victimization experiences in sixth grade, and seventh-grade teachers assessed internalizing problems. Attractiveness was negatively correlated with victimization and internalizing problems. Experiences of peer victimization were positively correlated with internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling provided support for the hypothesized model of peer victimization partially mediating the relationship between attractiveness and internalizing problems. Implications for intervention programs and future research directions are discussed.

AB This study examined the role of the level and variability of happiness, anger, anxiety, and sadness in the development of adolescent-reported anxiety disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, and aggressive behavior in 452 adolescents (250 male) followed from age 13 to 14. Level and between-day variability of emotions were assessed through adolescent report at 3-month intervals across a 1 year period. Level and variability of the four emotions contributed to changes in anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms more consistently than to changes in aggressive behavior. All four emotions were predictive of changes in internalizing problems, while anger played the most prominent role in the development of aggressive behavior. Variability of emotions contributed to changes in anxiety disorder symptoms, while heightened levels of negative emotions and diminished happiness contributed to changes in depression. Results suggested somewhat stronger effects of negative affect on aggressive behavior for females than for males. Results underscore the role of emotion dysregulation in the development of psychopathology.

Participants reported on exposure to community violence, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses and, consistent with predictions, the results indicated that the association between violence and depression was curvilinear; whereas the association to anxiety was linear and positive. The results highlight the importance of considering more complex models of the impact of exposure to community violence on psychological functioning in African American youth from economically- disadvantaged communities.

AB Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms involved in the development of psychopathology following psychological maltreatment in children. This study therefore examined the role of thinking styles on children's outcomes following this subtype of maltreatment. Children who had experienced past maltreatment (n = 24) and a control group (n = 26) were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Maltreatment history, cognitive styles and psychological outcomes, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-esteem were assessed. Parents/caregivers also completed a measure of child internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Psychological maltreatment made a significant contribution to children's self-reported depression and low self-esteem, and parent reported internalizing and externalizing problems, even after controlling for other abusive experiences. This was not the case for PTSD symptoms. Further, children's cognitive styles were associated with self-reported depression, self-esteem and PTSD. They did not, however, predict parent-rated emotional and behavioural problems. This study provides preliminary support for a cognitive model of adjustment following psychological maltreatment. The results indicate the need for enhanced community awareness about the impact of psychological maltreatment, and suggest a direction for therapeutic intervention.

AB Objective: To investigate the extent to which children with ADHD in various medication statuses (i.e., medication naive, pure stimulant, stimulant plus another medication, nonstimulants) varied on cognitive or academic, behavioral, and social functioning during a psychoeducational assessment battery. Method: Participants for this study consisted of 66 children (20 girls) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) (DSM-IV) diagnosis of ADHD confirmed by a comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessment, including the use of a semistructured interview and Conners' Parent Rating Scales. Standardized cognitive and academic measures along with parent report of medication status, behavioral, and social functioning were collected. Results: No differences were found among children in the various medication groups in terms of ADHD symptoms severity, academic performance, processing speed, verbal abilities, or perceptual reasoning skills. However, children in the medication-naive group performed significantly better than the stimulant-plus-another-medication and nonstimulant groups in terms of overall cognitive abilities, working-memory skills, and social adaptability but had similar scores to children in the pure-stimulant group. Children in the pure-stimulant group also had marginally higher working-memory scores compared to children in the nonstimulant group but not compared to the stimulant-plus-another-medication group. The pure-stimulant group also had significantly lower externalizing and internalizing problems and higher social adaptability compared to the stimulant-plus-another-medication group but not compared to the medication-naive or nonstimulant groups. Conclusion: Findings showed evidence for distinct cognitive, behavioral, and social profiles among children with ADHD who are proactively not on medication, as well as differences among children with ADHD who are on only one stimulant versus a nonstimulant or stimulant-plus-another-medication regimen.

AB Purpose of review
   Although numerous studies have examined the latent structure of internalizing and externalizing mental disorders, the effects of this structure in predicting the development of comorbidity have remained unexamined until recently.
   Recent findings
   A novel approach to study the effects of latent internalizing and externalizing predispositions to the development of comorbidity was used to analyze data from 14 countries in the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Pervasive significant positive associations were found between temporally primary and secondary internalizing and externalizing disorders in survival analyses, with time-lagged associations consistently stronger within domains than between domains. The vast majority of these associations were explained by latent internalizing and externalizing variables. Specific phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder were the most important internalizing components and hyperactivity disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder the most important externalizing components. Several intriguing residual time-lagged associations remained significant, though, even after controlling latent predispositions.
   Summary
   The latent variable model suggests that common causal pathways account for most comorbidity among internalizing-externalizing disorders. These pathways should be the focus of future research on the development of comorbidity, although isolation of consistent residual time-lagged associations between certain pairs of primary-secondary disorders is also important in pointing the way to subsequent focused study.

AB Objective To explore the potential utility of a general and diabetes-specific measure of coparenting by evaluating linkages between coparenting and both the psychosocial and medical adjustment of children with type 1 diabetes (TID). Method Mothers and fathers of children (ages 8-12 years; n = 61) with TID completed questionnaires including measures of general and diabetes-specific coparenting, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Medical adjustment included parent-reported diabetes management behaviors, children's self-reported diabetes quality of life (QOL), and metabolic control (HbA1c) assessed during clinic appointments. Results Coparenting conflict around general child rearing tasks was significantly related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Diabetes-specific coparenting conflict was linked to poorer diabetes management behaviors and children's reports of poorer diabetes-specific quality of life, but not HbA1c. Conclusions Significant findings offer preliminary support for the inclusion of coparenting assessments among children with TID and warrant further exploration.

AB The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) Behavioral and Emotional Screening System Parent Form (BESS Parent; Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007) is a recently developed instrument designed to identify behavioral and emotional risk in students. To describe the underlying factor structure for this instrument, exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted utilizing two subsets of a large, nationally-representative sample. The results of the EFA suggested that the BESS Parent contained a four-factor latent structure (i.e., Externalizing, Internalizing, Adaptive Skills, and Inattention), which was supported by CFA. Results support further investigation into utilizing four subscales in addition to an overall risk score: distributional and reliability information for the BESS Parent subscales is provided. Practical implications for school psychologists interested in early identification and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2011 Society for the Study of School Psychology.

AB Relations of toddlers' observed negative affect in high- and low-threat contexts to maternal perceptions of their toddlers' internalizing problems and to mothers' responses to emotions (RTE) for fear and sadness were examined. Child-driven, parent-driven, and reciprocal transactional models across I year were directly compared. Two-year-old toddlers (N = 106) participated in lab-based activities to elicit distress, and their negative affect was coded. Mothers completed measures of their child's internalizing behaviors and their responses to their toddler's fear and sadness at ages 2 and 3. At age 2, only negative affect in low-threat contexts was associated with greater internalizing problems. Mothers' punishing and minimizing RTE at age 2 predicted an increase in internalizing problems across 1 year. Age 2 internalizing problems predicted an increase in mother's use of supportive RTE over time. Results highlight the importance of considering the context of toddlers' negative affective displays and supported a reciprocal conceptualization of toddlers' internalizing behaviors and mothers' RTE.

AB Previous research on anger and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is largely cross-sectional and retrospective. In this study, we prospectively examined the consequences of expressing anger among sexually abused women in contexts of either voluntarily disclosing or not disclosing a previous abuse episode (n = 94). All CSA survivors in the study had documented histories of CSA. These participants and a matched, nonabused sample were asked to describe their most distressing experience while being videotaped to allow coding of anger expression. Approximately two thirds of the CSA survivors voluntarily disclosed a previous abuse experience. Participants completed measures of internalizing symptoms and externalizing symptoms at the time of disclosure and again two years later. The expression of anger was associated with better long-term adjustment (decreased internalizing and externalizing symptoms), but only among CSA survivors who had expressed anger while not disclosing an abuse experience. For CSA survivors who disclosed an abuse experience and for nonabused women, anger expression was unrelated to long-term outcome. These findings suggest that the benefits of anger expression for CSA survivors may be context specific.

AB Background: Recent neuropsychological theories have targeted deficient executive functions (EF) as the main characteristic of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but the nature of the neuropsychological deficits remains elusive and findings are heterogeneous. In particular, it is still unclear whether ADHD subtypes and comorbidity affect intellectual and executive functioning, because large variability has been found in different patient populations. Furthermore, the role of IQ in EF deficits in individuals with ADHD has been debated. Methods: The aim of the present research was to study in detail the relationship between EF, ADHD subtypes, and comorbid diagnosis by taking into account the potential role of IQ. For this purpose, 23 children (aged from 5 to 16 years; 20 males and 3 females) with a diagnosis of ADHD were selected. Results: Data show no differences between children with different subtypes of ADHD on measures of EF, but they evidence differences on EF measures in children with different comorbidities (internalizing versus externalizing disorder). Namely, compared to the internalizing disorders group, the children with externalizing disorders obtained significantly lower scores on different measures of EF (i.e., verbal working memory and categorical fluency), but these differences were strictly dependent on IQ level. Conclusions: Comorbidity patterns, rather than ADHD subtypes, appear to be more valid for defining the neuropsychological features of the ADHD endophenotype. Moreover, general intelligence seems to play a substantial role in the cognitive processes underling the disorder, especially in relation to externalizing aspects.

AB Background: The aim was to identify risk indicators from preadolescence (age period 10-12) that significantly predict unfavorable deviations from normal anxiety development throughout adolescence (age period 10-17 years). Methods: Anxiety symptoms were assessed in a community sample of 2,220 boys and girls at three time-points across a 5-year interval. Risk indicators were measured at baseline and include indicators from the child, family, and peer domain. Associations with anxiety were measured with multilevel growth curve analyses. Results: A stable difference in anxiety over adolescence was found between high and low levels of a range of child factors (frustration, effortful control), family factors (emotional warmth received from parents, lifetime parental internalizing problems), and peer factor (victims of bullying) (P <.001). In contrast, the difference in anxiety between high and low levels of factors, such as self-competence, unfavorable parenting styles, and bully victims, decreased over adolescence (P <.001). For other family factors, associations were weaker (.05 < P <.001). Associations with parental education and family composition were not significant. Adjustment for concurrent depressive symptoms attenuated the associations, but those that were significant at P <.001 remained to be so. Specificity for anxiety subtypes (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, panic, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) was reported for each association. Conclusions: Several child, family, and peer factors measured in preadolescence were risk indicators of high levels of anxiety symptoms throughout adolescence. Some factors (such as rejective parenting) were vulnerability indicators for anxiety in early adolescence only, whereas other factors (such as peer victimization) were indicators of long-term elevated anxiety levels.

AB The BASC-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS) Student Form (Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007) is a recently developed youth self-report rating scale designed to identify students at risk for behavioral and emotional problems. The BESS Student Form was derived from the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition Self-Report of Personality (BASC-2 SRP; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) using principal component analytic procedures and theoretical considerations. Using 3 samples, the authors conducted exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to understand the underlying factor structure of the BESS Student Form. The results of the EFA suggested that the SRP contained a 4-factor (i.e., Personal Adjustment, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Internalizing, School Problems) emergent structure, which was supported by CFA in 2 additional samples. Practical and research implications are discussed.

AB P>Background
   Several studies reported that adults with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) frequently exhibit psychiatric comorbidity, most commonly depression and anxiety disorders. However the literature about children is limited.
   Objectives
   To investigate the frequency of psychiatric disorders and to determine the levels of depression, anxiety and behavioural problems in a group of children with CIU.
   Methods
   The study included 27 children with CIU and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Psychiatric assessment was done by using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used to examine the levels of depression, anxiety and behavioural behaviours, respectively.
   Results
   The study group had more frequent psychiatric diagnoses than the control group (70% vs. 30%) and the most common psychiatric disorders were social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Depression, trait anxiety, internalizing problems, somatic complaints and anxiety/depressed scores were significantly higher in children with CIU. No correlation was found between the severity and duration of illness and psychological functioning.
   Conclusion
   This study showed that children with CIU had high psychiatric morbidity. The results suggest that the psychological status of children with CIU should be screened by clinicians and that an interdisciplinary approach combining dermatological and psychiatric evaluations is necessary for the management of CIU.

AB Background: Most surveys are plagued by significant numbers of non-respondents. In psychiatric epidemiology, differences in levels of psychopathology are often assumed between respondents and non-respondents. However, studies on attrition are rare, especially in child and adolescent populations. The present study sought to estimate the association of depression, anti-social behaviour with attrition from a cohort study among adolescents. Methods: The adolescent mental health cohort study (AMHC) is a prospective follow-up study on prevalence and determinants of mental health problems and risk behaviour among Finnish adolescents at two study sites. Subjects of the final baseline sample (n = 3278) were reached for a 2-year follow-up. Differences in data collecting methods between the study sites yielded different response rates (78% vs. 51%). Chi-square statistics and logistic regression models were computed to estimate the effect of two types of problem behaviour on attrition. Results: Depression at baseline was associated with higher probability of attrition at follow-up. School performance was a stronger predictor of attrition than problem behaviour. The models predicted non-response in the study site with mainly school-based surveys but not in the study site with mainly postal surveys. Conclusion: Internalizing problem behaviour may be underrepresented in adolescent mental health surveys. School performance is strongly associated with attrition. Hence, special attention should be paid to designing questionnaires targeting adolescents.

AB Impulsivity is inherent to both problem gambling and ADHD. The purpose of this study is to examine ADHD key symptoms, and gambling behaviors and problem severity among adolescents. Additionally, internalizing and externalizing behaviors exhibited among these individuals and the role of these symptoms in gambling are examined. We used a cross-sectional study design and survey 1,130 adolescents aged 12-19. Results indicated that adolescents who screened positive for ADHD were significantly more likely than non-ADHD adolescents to engage in gambling and significantly more likely to develop gambling problems. Those who screened positive as predominantly inattentive and those who screened positive for ADHD Combined (Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity) were equally likely to gamble, but the latter were twice as likely to have gambling problems. However, we found no significant interaction between the key ADHD symptoms and gambling as the severity of hyperactivity-impulsivity or inattention did not significantly differ with respect to gambling pathology. Emotional problems and depressive affect were the only variables that could significantly differentiate the ADHD types and gambling severity. Our Results highlight the clinical importance of considering the subtype of ADHD among gamblers and the greater association of depressive affect and emotional problems with gambling among adolescents.

AB Objectives: Animal and human adult studies reveal a contribution of serotonin to behavior regulation. Whether these findings apply to children is unclear. The present study investigated serotonergic functioning in boys with a history of behavior regulation difficulties through a double-blind, acute tryptophan supplementation procedure.
   Method: Participants were 23 boys (age 10 years) with a history of elevated physical aggression, recruited from a community sample. Eleven were given a chocolate milkshake supplemented with 500mg tryptophan, and 12 received a chocolate milkshake without tryptophan. Boys engaged in a competitive reaction time game against a fictitious opponent, which assessed response to provocation, impulsivity, perspective taking, and sharing. Impulsivity was further assessed through a Go/No-Go paradigm. A computerized emotion recognition task and a staged instrumental help incident were also administered.
   Results: Boys, regardless of group, responded similarly to high provocation by the fictitious opponent. However, boys in the tryptophan group adjusted their level of responding optimally as a function of the level of provocation, whereas boys in the control group significantly decreased their level of responding towards the end of the competition. Boys in the tryptophan group tended to show greater perspective taking, tended to better distinguish facial expressions of fear and happiness, and tended to provide greater instrumental help to the experimenter.
   Conclusions: The present study provides initial evidence for the feasibility of acute tryptophan supplementation in children and some effect of tryptophan supplementation on children's behaviors. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential impact of increased serotonergic functioning on boys' dominant and affiliative behaviors.

AB Although large epidemiological data sets can inform research on the etiology and development of borderline personality disorder (BPD), they rarely include BPD measures. In some cases, however, proxy measures can be constructed using instruments already in these data sets. In this study, the authors developed and validated a self-report measure of BPD from the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). Items for the new instrument-the Minnesota BPD scale (MBPD) -were identified and refined using three large samples: undergraduates, community adolescent twins, and urban substance users. The authors determined the construct validity of the MBPD scale by examining its association with (a) diagnosed BPD, (b) questionnaire-reported BPD symptoms, and (c) clinical variables associated with BPD: suicidality, trauma, disinhibition, internalizing distress, and substance use. The authors also tested the MBPD scale in two prison inmate samples. Across samples, the MBPD scores correlated with BPD indices and external criteria and showed incremental validity above measures of negative affect, thus supporting its construct validity as a measure of BPD.

AB Research provides strong support for the efficacy and effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of childhood internalizing disorders. Given evidence for limited dissemination and implementation of CBT outside of academic settings, efforts are underway to improve its transportability so that more children with mental health needs may benefit from treatment. Creative modifications to existing treatments aim to deliver CBT for anxiety disorders and depression in a more transportable format. Notable progress has been made within the areas of computerized CBT, camp-based CBT, school-based CBT, and CBT delivered through primary care settings. These approaches are discussed within the context of key elements of transportability that are particularly germane to the dissemination and implementation of child treatments.

AB Background:
   Siblings of children with disabilities are at risk for internalizing psychological disorders; however, little is known about how culture influences this effect. This study examined the psychological and school functioning of Latino siblings of children with intellectual disability (ID).
   Methods:
   Participants were 100 Latino (L) and nonLatino (NL) siblings (8-15 years) of children with ID (50 LID, 50 NLID) and 100 Latino and nonLatino control siblings (50 LC, 50 NLC). Siblings, parents, and teachers completed standard questionnaires regarding sibling emotional and behavioral functioning; sibling school report cards were obtained. Analyses of variance were conducted, controlling for parent age and family income; planned contrasts compared LID siblings to the other sibling groups.
   Results:
   LID siblings reported significantly more internalizing (t(1) = 2.41, p < .05) and emotional t(1) = 3.06, p < .05) symptoms, poorer awareness of (t(1) = 2.26, p < .01) and greater reluctance to express (t(1) = 3.12, p < .01) their emotions, and more problems in personal adjustment and relationships with parents (t(1) = -2.50, p < .05). Significantly higher percentages of LID siblings scored in the at-risk or clinical range for internalizing and emotional symptoms, and were more likely to score above the clinical cut-off for separation anxiety disorder and to endorse global impairment. LID siblings experienced more school absences and lower academic performance. There were no group differences in externalizing behavior problems, somatic symptoms, or teacher-reported internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions:
   Latino siblings of children with ID are at greater risk for internalizing psychological disorders and greater impairment in personal and school functioning. Results are discussed in terms of their sociocultural significance and clinical implications.

   INFORMATION
AB The aim of this study was to test for gender differences in how negative cognitive errors (overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, selective abstraction, and personalizing) mediate the association between adverse life events and adolescents' emotional and behavioural problems (measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). The sample consisted of 202 boys and 227 girls (aged 11-15 years) from three state secondary schools in disadvantaged areas in one county in the South East of England. Control variables were age, ethnicity, special educational needs, exclusion history, family structure, family socio-economic disadvantage, and verbal cognitive ability. Adverse life events were measured with <link rid="b43">Tiet et al.'s (1998) Adverse Life Events Scale. For both genders, we assumed a pathway from adverse life events to emotional and behavioural problems via cognitive errors. We found no gender differences in life adversity, cognitive errors, total difficulties, peer problems, or hyperactivity. In both boys and girls, even after adjustment for controls, cognitive errors were related to total difficulties and emotional symptoms, and life adversity was related to total difficulties and conduct problems. The life adversity/conduct problems association was not explained by negative cognitive errors in either gender. However, we found gender differences in how adversity and cognitive errors produced hyperactivity and internalizing problems. In particular, life adversity was not related, after adjustment for controls, to hyperactivity in girls and to peer problems and emotional symptoms in boys. Cognitive errors fully mediated the effect of life adversity on hyperactivity in boys and on peer and emotional problems in girls.

AB In a multiethnic community sample of 1,170 preadolescent children, it was investigated whether discrepancies in parent-child reports of internalizing problems are related with gender, ethnic background (Dutch, Surinamese/Antillean, Moroccan, Turkish, Other) and with future internalizing problems. No significant differences in discrepancy scores between boys and girls were found. Parent-child disagreement of internalizing problems varied across ethnic groups, with significant differences among children from Surinamese/Antillean (children reporting more internalizing problems than their parents) and Turkish background (parents reporting more internalizing problems than their children). Disagreement between parents and their preadolescent child significantly contributed to the prediction of self-reported internalizing problems in early adolescence. For the early identification of internalizing problems, it is recommended to include both parent and child self-reports as part of routine health examinations in the setting of preventive youth health care because when parents underreport problems relative to their child, this can predict future internalizing problems.

AB The combined effect of race and place of residence on caregivers' perceptions of children's mental health services is underresearched. Differences in caregiver strain, barriers-to-care endorsement, and provider satisfaction are examined among 175 rural and urban African American caregivers from one Southern state whose children received Medicaid sponsored mental health services. Children exhibited clinical levels of externalizing and internalizing mental health symptoms and high levels of co-occurring physical health problems. Almost one quarter were cared for by someone other than biological parents. Almost all caregivers reported strain associated with children's mental health problems, compromised personal health status, and high levels of depression. Family perception barriers (such as concern about potential negative reactions of significant others) were most endorsed. Most caregivers were satisfied with their children's mental health services, with lowest levels on the provider sensitivity subscale. Initial rural-urban differences in caregiver strain did not remain significant in multiple regression analyses after other covariates were included.

AB Children aged 6 to 12 who were exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) within the last year participated in an intervention program found to be successful in reducing their internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. However, little is known about factors that may contribute to this efficacy. Both fixed and modifiable risk factors that predicted change in children's adjustment after the intervention were identified and tested. There was a significant relationship between the extent of exposure to IPV, gender, change in mothers' mental health, and change in child adjustment. Among fixed factors, length of exposure to violence was found to moderate the relationship between the amount of the child's and mother's participation in the intervention and change in child adjustment, specifically internalizing behavioral problems. Among the modifiable risk factors, change in mother's mental health, specifically symptoms of posttraumatic stress, was found to mediate the relationship between the amount of intervention participation and change in child adjustment. These findings can be used to inform and enhance evidence-based clinical services for children exposed to IPV.

AB Objective. This study investigated whether infants' temperament at 18 months is associated with the feeding of foods and drinks that may increase the risk for later obesity. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of mothers and infants (N = 40 266) participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected by questionnaire. Predictor variables were: infants' temperament at 18 months (internalizing, externalizing, and surgency/extraversion), and mothers' negative affectivity. Outcome variables were feeding of sweet foods, sweet drinks, and night-time caloric drinks at 18 months (all dichotomized). Confounders were child's gender, weight-for-height at 1 year, breastfeeding, and mother's level of education. Results. After controlling for confounders, infant temperament dimensions at 18 months were significantly associated with mothers' feeding of potentially obesogenic foods and drinks independent of mothers' negative affectivity. Infants who were more internalizing were more likely to be given sweet foods (OR 1.47, CI 1.32-1.65), sweet drinks (OR 1.76, CI 1.56-1.98), and drinks at night (OR 2.91, CI 2.54-3.33); infants who were more externalizing were more likely to be given sweet food (OR 1.53, CI 1.40-1.67) and sweet drinks (OR 1.22, CI 1.11-1.34); and infants who were more surgent were more likely to be given drinks at night (OR 1.66, CI 1.42-1.92). Conclusions. The association between infant temperament and maternal feeding patterns suggests early mechanisms for later obesity that should be investigated in future studies.

AB A previous report suggested that successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety reduced substance use problems at 7.4-year follow-up, but that report did not include predictors of: (a) substance use disorder (SUD: e.g., attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder symptoms, negative life events, family substance abuse, additional treatment), or (b) treatment outcome (e.g., severity of internalizing pathology, age). Analyses incorporating these factors tested previously reported findings in 72 participants (ages 15-22 at follow-up: 84% of the 7.4-year follow-up sample), using parent and youth diagnostic interviews and report measures. The majority of previously reported associations between less successful treatment and later substance use problems remained significant after controlling for known predictors of SUD and treatment outcome. Our findings bolster previous conclusions that effective CBT for child anxiety may have ameliorative effects on the target disorder and later substance use problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle with behavioral symptoms, yet little research has provided information about how behavioral symptoms impact their self-concept, especially in terms of gender, age, and ethnicity. Data were collected from 145 children and adolescents with ADHD and their mothers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Caucasians were nearly equally represented in the sample, with approximately one third each. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess ADHD symptom severity, and Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale was used to measure self-concept. Older ages and more internalizing behavior problems predicted lower self-concept. There were no significant differences between ethnic groups on behavior problem and self-concept scores, although post hoc analyses revealed a trend for Caucasian children with ADHD to have lower self-concept scores than those of African American or Hispanic children. The findings indicate that there is a need to assess self-concept in children and adolescents with ADHD, especially those who are older and have comorbid conditions of anxiety and depression.

AB In the present cross-national comparison, self-reported Big Five personality data on large samples of Dutch (N = 1521) and Italian (N = 1975) adolescents were employed. Results suggest that the personality of Dutch and Italian adolescents can be described by the same Big Five traits, but that these might have slightly different meanings to the Dutch and Italian adolescent respondents. Supplementary analyses uncovered that sex differences are largest among Italian adolescents. Further comparisons reveal subtle cross-national differences in personality-psychopathology relationships, with stronger associations of Emotional Stability with depression for Italian when compared to Dutch adolescents. Results underscore that cross-national comparisons of personality may be alluring to use in research, however the findings of these comparisons should be interpreted with caution.

AB Young women typically use same-sex friendships as a source of social support during times of stress. However, friendship interactions that are characterized by co-rumination, excessive problem discussion and negative affect focus, while related to quality friendships, are also related to internalizing symptoms. The goal of the current study was to better understand how the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (salivary cortisol) and sympathetic nervous system (salivary alpha-amylase, sAA), react to co-rumination. Observed co-rumination predicted increased cortisol responses while negative affect focus during problem discussion predicted increases in both cortisol and sAA. These findings suggest that dual system activation may be at least one physiological pattern that links co-rumination to increased internalizing symptoms, even in the context of a high-quality friendship.

AB Objective: Dysfunctions in both emotion regulation and social cognition (understanding behavior in mental state terms, theory of mind or mentalizing) have been proposed as explanations for disturbances of interpersonal behavior in borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study aimed to examine mentalizing in adolescents with emerging BPD from a dimensional and categorical point of view, controlling for gender, age, Axis I and Axis II symptoms, and to explore the mediating role of emotion regulation in the relation between theory of mind and borderline traits. Method: The newly developed Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was administered alongside self-report measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology to 111 adolescent inpatients between the ages of 12 to 17 (mean age = 15.5 years; SD = 1.44 years). For categorical analyses borderline diagnosis was determined through semi-structured clinical interview, which showed that 23% of the sample met criteria for BPD. Results: Findings suggest a relationship between borderline traits and "hypermentalizing" (excessive, inaccurate mentalizing) independent of age, gender, externalizing, internalizing and psychopathy symptoms. The relation between hypermentalizing and BPD traits was partially mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation, accounting for 43.5% of the hypermentalizing to BPD path. Conclusions: Results suggest that in adolescents with borderline personality features the loss of mentalization is more apparent in the emergence of unusual alternative strategies (hypermentalizing) than in the loss of the capacity per se (no mentalizing or undermentalizing). Moreover, for the first time, empirical evidence is provided to support the notion that mentalizing exerts its influence on borderline traits through the mediating role of emotion dysregulation. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(6): 563-573.

AB Nocturnal enuresis and urinary incontinence are common disorders in children. Despite great improvements in treatment, subgroups of incontinence take a chronic course or relapse. Besides conventional treatment approaches (behaviour therapy, guidance, medication), urotherapy (bladder training) has shown positive effects in these therapy-resistant cases. The present study describes the main components of an outpatient bladder training programme. Treatment effects are evaluated in an explorative pre/post comparison between wetting frequencies and behaviour problems. After the bladder training, day- and nighttime wetting was significantly reduced and behavioural, especially internalizing, symptoms decreased.

AB Research on the structure of adolescent psychopathology can provide information on broad factors that underlie different forms of maladjustment in youths. Multiple studies from the literature on adult populations suggest that 2 factors, Internalizing and Externalizing, meaningfully comprise the factor structure of adult psychopathology (e.g., Krueger, 1999) and presumably represent broad vulnerability for co-occurring disorders. Though this research was partially inspired by early work with children and adolescents (e.g., Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1984), the role of substance use in these models of youth psychopathology has not been fully explored. Toward this goal, we recruited 223 youths (10-17 years of age, M = 14.2) from mental health agencies and the community. We found evidence for a 3-factor model of youth psychopathology, including Internalizing (depression, generalized anxiety), Externalizing (conduct disorder, attention deficit, oppositional defiant disorder), and Substance Use (alcohol and cannabis). The 3-factor model showed the best fit to the data relative to other factor models tested, including across subsamples of adolescents who differed on level of psychopathology (treatment vs. community samples). Implications for the structure of adolescent psychopathology, including important developmental considerations, are discussed.

AB Victimization resulting from bullying affects millions of school children worldwide each year (e.g. Nansel et al., 2001; Sapouna, 2008; Smokowski & Kopasz, 2005). These children face the fear and humiliation of verbal, physical, and relational aggression and as a result, often suffer psychological ill effects (e. g. Kochenderfer-Ladd, & Skinner, 2002). This study examined the coping strategies of victims of bullying using qualitative research methodology. One-hundred-and-two fourth through eighth grade students participated in group interviews discussing the topics of bullying and coping with victimization. A coping model emerged from this study that included the primary categories of problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and eight subcategories, self-defense, stand up to the bully, seeking social support, distancing, internalizing, tension-reduction/externalizing, focus on the positive, and self-blame. Results revealed that problem-focused coping was the type of coping most often used by victims of bullying. Externalizing and seeking social support were the most commonly reported problem-focused coping strategies used by victims. Boys discussed using externalizing strategies with greater frequency than girls, whereas girls reported seeking social support more often than boys. Results also indicated that children generally found their implemented strategies to be ineffective in resolving their problem. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB The present study examined associations between narcissism (total, adaptive, and maladaptive), self-esteem, and externalizing and internalizing problems in 157 non-referred adolescents (aged 14 to 18). Consistent with previous research, narcissism was positively associated with self-reported delinquency, overt aggression, and relational aggression. Maladaptive narcissism showed unique positive associations with aggression and delinquency variables, while adaptive narcissism showed unique negative associations with anxiety symptoms. In general, self-esteem was negatively related to internalizing and externalizing problems. An interaction effect was observed for self-esteem and narcissism in predicting overt aggression. Specifically, at high levels of self-esteem narcissism was significantly associated with overt aggression, whereas it was not at low levels of self-esteem. The current results add to the growing body of research on the role of narcissism in the development of adjustment problems in youth.

AB P>We examined relations between children's sympathetic nervous system activity, indexed by skin conductance level (SCL) during baseline and reactivity to a challenging task and their sleep problems. We also assessed SCL as a moderator of associations between children's sleep problems and their mental health. A sample of healthy and typically developing school-attending children (78 boys and 98 girls) participated (mean age = 8.7 years; standard deviation = 0.36). Sleep was assessed via actigraphy and self-reports. Parents reported on children's externalizing behaviors and children reported their internalizing symptoms. Findings demonstrate that sleep disruptions (duration, quality) are associated with lower basal SCL. In the context of sleep problems, a lower level of basal SCL functioned as a vulnerability factor for depression symptoms and worse self-esteem. Further, children with both increased SCL reactivity and sleep problems were at risk for depression symptoms. Results illustrate the significance of simultaneous examinations of various biological and physiological systems in the prediction of children's wellbeing.

AB Background: Children with chronic illnesses are known to have increased risks for emotional and behavioral problems. In the present study, children and adolescent suffering from celiac disease (CD) were compared with healthy controls to assess differences in the psychological profile.
   Methods: A total of 100 well-treated and compliant CD patients (65 females/35 males; age mean +/- SD: 10.38 +/- 2.71) were compared to 100 normal controls (58 females/42 males; age mean +/- SD: 11.47 +/- 2.61). Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).
   Results: Subjects with CD self-reported an increased rate of anxiety and depression symptoms and showed higher scores in "harm avoidance" and "somatic complaints", in the CBCL parent-report questionnaire, as compared to healthy control subjects. Furthermore, gender differences could be observed in the group of CD patients, with males displaying significantly higher CBCL externalizing scores, in social, thought and attention problems, as compared to female, who in turns showed more prominent internalizing symptoms such as depression.
   Conclusions: The increased rate of emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescent with CD emphasizes the importance of an early detection of mental health problems in these children.

AB We examined interactions between children's physiological activity across two systems, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), as predictors of child-reported internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety). HPA activity was indexed by baseline salivary cortisol, and PNS activity was indexed by baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Study 1 consisted of 57 children (54% girls; M age = 8.81 years +/-.34), and Study 2 included 219 children (51% girls; M age = 9.31 years +/-.79). Cortisol interacted with RSA to explain unique variance in children's internalizing symptoms. Across the two studies, children with higher cortisol levels in conjunction with higher RSA levels tended to exhibit the lowest levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. Findings demonstrate that contemporaneous consideration of physiological activity across multiple systems can advance understanding of internalizing symptoms in children. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Child abuse is defined as causing or permitting any harmful or offensive contact on a child's body; and any communication or transaction of any kind which humiliates, shames, or frightens the child. Some child development experts go a bit further and define child abuse as any act or omission, which fails to nurture or in the upbringing of the children. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act defines child abuse and neglect as: at a minimum, any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.. Child abuse can be classified as physical, emotional, neglect or sexual.
   Physical Abuse:This type of abuse can be defined as the inflicting of physical injury upon a child. This may include burning, hitting, punching, shaking, kicking, beating, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or caretaker may not have intended to hurt the child, the injury is not an accident. It may, however, been the result of over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child's age.
   Emotional Abuse (also known as verbal abuse, mental abuse, and psychological maltreatment): This type of abuse includes acts or the failures to act by parents or caretakers that have caused or could cause serious behavioral, cognitive, emotional, or mental disorders.
   Neglect: This type is defined as the failure to provide for the child's basic needs. Neglect can be physical, educational, or emotional. Physical neglect can include not providing adequate food or clothing, appropriate medical care, supervision, or proper weather protection (heat or coats). It may include abandonment. Educational neglect includes failure to provide appropriate schooling or special educational needs, allowing excessive truancies.
   Sexual Abuse: It refers to the inappropriate sexual behavior with a child. It includes fondling a child's genitals, making the child fondle the adult's genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism and sexual exploitation. To be considered child abuse these acts have to be committed by a person responsible for the care of a child (for example a baby-sitter, a parent, or a daycare provider) or related to the child.
   The prevalence of child abuse has been reported as 4.5% to 21.6% in epidemiological studies and 14.6% to 48% in clinical studies. An epidemiological study in Mexico found at 16% to 20% prevalence, being the physical and emotional abuse the more frequently reported. This study also showed that the mother is the perpetrator in a high percentage of cases and mentioned some characteristics of the patients and their families which were associated with the different types of abuse.
   There are many factors that may contribute to the occurrence of child abuse and neglect, such as an inadequate family environment, the history of illness or any disability in the children or the presence of psychopathology in the parents. Parents may be more likely to maltreat their children if they abuse drugs or alcohol. They also may not be able to cope with the stress associated with Heir children care
   . Child abuse has been associated with psychopathology. The impairments in significant areas of child development caused by maltreatment may account for the elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct disorders and substance abuse among children and adolescents with histories of physical and sexual abuse. In particular, children and adolescents with externalizing disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder may be in a higher risk for maltreatment.
   The objectives of this study were to examine the frequency of maltreatment reported by adolescents with psychiatric disorders and explore their demographic characteristics and family functioning.
   Methods
   The sample included male and female adolescents (13 to 17 years old) attending the inpatient and outpatient services at the Child Psychiatric Hospital in Mexico City. After giving their informed consent, the patients and their parents were assessed with the Semistructured Interview for Adolescents, a diagnostic interview which follows DSM-IV criteria for 17 major diagnoses. After that, adolescents were asked to fulfill a survey for child abuse, a previously designed questionnaire to explore the presence of physical, emotional, sexual abuse, and neglect. This questionnaire also assesses some characteristics of the parents and the family (income, educational level, family structure and conflict resolution, among others). The obtained data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.
   Results
   One hundred patients (50% male, mean age 14.79+/-1.60 years old, with a mean of 7.8+/-1.68 years of school) were evaluated. Most of them (56%) were living with both parents, the parents educational level more frequently reported was middle school (32% of the mothers and 30% of the fathers). Intimate partner violence was reported by 22% of the sample.
   According to the psychiatric diagnostic interview, the most frequent diagnoses in the sample were major depressive disorder (61%), ADHD (39%), conduct disorder (31%), substance abuse (31%) and anxiety disorders (17%).
   The rates of the different types of abuse reported by this sample of adolescents were as follows: Emotional abuse (77% perpetrated by the mother and 61% by the father), physical abuse (41% perpetrated by the mother and 34% by the father), severe physical abuse (29% perpetrated by the mother and 26% by the father), neglect (8%) and sexual abuse (24%). A 19% of the sample reported to be physically abused by the mother before the age of 5, while 11% reported to be physically abused by the father by the age of 5. Patients with ADHD and those with conduct disorder reported the highest frequencies of abuse. The adolescents with substance abuse disorders reported high frequency of emotional abuse. When patients were asked to give their opinion about the frequency with which they were physically punished, the investigators found that a high percentage of adolescents agreed to receive physical punishment (22% considered to be punished,,with reason,, and 12% considered normal to be hit). Only 8% to 11% considered that their parents hit them excessively.
   The sample was divided according to their diagnoses in patients with externalizing disorders, internalizing disorders and substance abuse/dependence and the frequency of the different types of abuse was calculated. The physical abuse by the mother was more frequent in patients with externalizing disorders and substance abuse; the physical abuse by the father was more frequent in patients with externalizing disorders. These patients also reported the highest frequency of severe physical abuse and emotional abuse by the mother. The frequency of sexual abuse was reported by 22% or each diagnostic group.
   When the patients were asked to explain why were they physically punished, the main reasons exposed were disobedience and disrespect; however, more than 20% explained that their parents were intoxicated with alcohol or drugs while punishing them.
   Conclusions
   The frequency of abuse reported by this sample of adolescents with psychiatric disorders was higher than the reported in an epidemiologic sample, particularly in the rates of sexual abuse. The present sample also exhibited unfavorable social, demographic and familial characteristics. Emotional abuse was the most frequently reported in this sample. The mother was the more frequently perpetrator for physical and emotional abuse.

AB Research in the last fifteen years suggests that anxious individuals selectively attend towards threatening information. Attention modification interventions for internalizing adults have been developed to target cognition at this basic level: these programs have demonstrated initial efficacy in attention bias and anxiety symptom reduction. To date, there have been no published studies of attention modification in youths with clinical levels of anxiety. The current case series examined the initial efficacy of a four-week (12 sessions) attention modification program (AMP) designed to train attention away from threat in 16 children and adolescents (ages 10 to 17) diagnosed with DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Overall, youths experienced a significant decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms, and 12 of 16 youths no longer met criteria for any anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment. AMP was feasible with youths, and all youths and parents deemed the program acceptable. These findings provide support for further research on the use of cognitive bias modification interventions with clinically anxious youths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A growing body of research focuses on the development and correlates of emotion dysregulation, or deficits in the ability to regulate intense and shifting emotional states. Current models of psychopathology have incorporated the construct of emotion dysregulation, suggesting its unique and interactive contributions, along with childhood disruptive experiences and negative affect, in producing symptomatic distress. Some researchers have suggested that emotion dysregulation is simply a variant of high negative affect. The aim of this study was to assess the construct and incremental validity of self-reported emotion dysregulation over and above childhood trauma and negative affect in predicting a range of psychopathology.
   Method: Five hundred thirty individuals aged 18 to 77 years (62% female) were recruited from the waiting areas of the general medical and obstetric/gynecologic clinics in an urban public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures obtained by interview, including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Emotion Dysregulation Scale. Regression analyses examined the unique and incremental associations of these self-report measurements of childhood traumatic experiences, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation with concurrent structured interview-based measurements of psychiatric distress and history of self-destructive behaviors. These measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, the Short Drug Abuse Screening Test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Global Adaptive Functioning Scale from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. The presented data were collected between 2005 and 2009.
   Results: Regression models including age, gender, childhood trauma, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation were significantly (P <= .001) associated with each of the study's criterion variables, accounting for large portions of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms (R-2=0.21), alcohol and drug abuse (R-2=0.28 and 0.21, respectively), depression (R-2=0.55), adaptive functioning (R-2=0.14), and suicide history (omnibus chi(2)=74.80, P<.001). Emotion dysregulation added statistically significant (P<.01) incremental validity to each regression model (beta=0.25, 0.34, 0.35, 0.34, and -0.18, and Wald = 24.43, respectively).
   Conclusions: Results support the conceptualization of emotion dysregulation as a distinct and clinically meaningful construct associated with psychiatric distress that is not reducible to negative affect. Emotion dysregulation is a key component in a range of psychiatric symptoms and disorders and a core target for psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatment interventions.

AB Bullying is a major concern in schools, yet there has been limited research examining the ways in which students respond to frequent victimization by their peers. The current study explored whether there are discrete groups of children who display similar patterns of responses to frequent bullying. We also examined the associations between the patterns of responding, characteristics of the victimization (form, chronicity, and perpetration of bullying), and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Latent class analysis regarding response strategies was conducted on data from 4,312 frequently victimized middle and high school students. The results revealed 4 common patterns of responses, including passive/low, active/support-seeking, aggressive and an undifferentiated/high pattern. The patterns of responses were differentially related to internalizing and externalizing symptoms, such that the children with the undifferentiated/high pattern were most likely to experience social-emotional problems and were more likely to experience indirect forms of victimization. Implications for future research on interventions with victimized children are discussed.

AB Due to inaccessibility of child victims of commercial sexual exploitation, the majority of emergent research on the problem lacks theoretical framing or sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Drawing from Agnew's general strain theory, this study utilized structural equation modeling to explore: whether caregiver strain is linked to child maltreatment, if experiencing maltreatment is associated with risk-inflating behaviors or sexual denigration of self/others, and if these behavioral and psychosocial dysfunctions are related to vulnerability to commercial sexual exploitation. The proposed model was tested with data from 174 predominately African American women, 12% of whom indicated involvement in prostitution while a minor. Findings revealed child maltreatment worsened with increased caregiver strain. Experiencing child maltreatment was linked to running away, initiating substance use at earlier ages, and higher levels of sexual denigration of self/others. Sexual denigration of self/others was significantly related to the likelihood of prostitution as a minor. The network of variables in the model accounted for 34% of the variance in prostitution as a minor.

AB Two broadband latent factors-internalizing and externalizing-have frequently been identified in studies of the hierarchical structure of psychopathology. In the present research,.3 competing measurement models of putative internalizing disorders (i.e., a parsimonious single-factor model, a model based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed., American Psychiatric Association, 19941, and an alternative model proposed by Krueger, 1999, and Watson, 2005) were evaluated in terms of their ability to account for lifetime patterns of diagnostic comorbidity. Four diagnostic assessments were performed on an age-based cohort of 816 persons over a 15-year interval. Each of the 3 measurement models demonstrated adequate or good fit to the data and similar approximating abilities. Additional analyses, however, suggested that nonspecific aspects of lifetime mood/anxiety or distress/fear disorders (i.e., general negative affect) largely accounted for indicators of psychosocial functioning at age 30 as well as densities of specific psychiatric disorders among the 1st-degree relatives of probands. The relevance of these findings for theoretical and descriptive models of internalizing disorders is discussed.

AB This study examines how mothers with and without a history of childhood-onset depression respond to their 3-9 year-old children's emotions. Mother-child dyads included 55 offspring of mothers with a history of childhood-onset depressive disorders and 57 offspring of never-depressed mothers. Mothers with a history of childhood depression were less likely than control mothers to respond in supportive ways to their children's negative emotions and were more likely to magnify, punish, or neglect their children's negative emotions. Magnification, neglect, and punishment of children's negative emotions were concurrently associated with children's internalizing symptoms, and neglect and punishment were associated with internalizing over a one year follow-up. Maternal neglect of children's negative emotion was positively associated with later internalizing symptoms for children who already had higher internalizing symptoms at the initial assessment. Findings suggest that atypical socialization of emotion may be one mechanism in the development of internalizing disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This investigation examined the relation between developmental trajectories jointly estimated for social and physical aggression and adjustment problems at age 14. Teachers provided ratings of children's social and physical aggression in Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for a sample of 255 children (131 girls, 21% African American, 52% European American, 21% Mexican American). Participants, parents, and teachers completed measures of the adolescent's adjustment to assess internalizing symptoms, rule-breaking behaviors, and borderline and narcissistic personality features. Results showed that membership in a high and rising trajectory group predicted rule-breaking behaviors and borderline personality features. Membership in a high desister group predicted internalizing symptoms, rule-breaking behaviors, and borderline and narcissistic personality features. The findings suggest that although low levels of social and physical aggression may not bode poorly for adjustment, individuals engaging in high levels of social and physical aggression in middle childhood may be at greatest risk for adolescent psychopathology, whether they increase or desist in their aggression through early adolescence.

AB Research has documented associations between family functioning and offspring psychosocial adjustment, but questions remain regarding whether these associations are partly due to confounding genetic factors and other environmental factors. The current study used a genetically informed approach, the Children of Twins design, to explore the associations between family functioning (family conflict, marital quality, and agreement about parenting) and offspring psychopathology. Participants were 867 twin pairs (388 monozygotic; 479 dizygotic) from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden, their spouses, and children (51.7% female; M = 15.75 years). The results suggested associations between exposure to family conflict (assessed by the mother, father, and child) and child adjustment were independent of genetic factors and other environmental factors. However, when family conflict was assessed using only children's reports, the results indicated that genetic factors also influenced these associations. In addition, the analyses indicated that exposure to low marital quality and agreement about parenting was associated with children's internalizing and externalizing problems and that genetic factors also contributed to the associations of marital quality and agreement about parenting with offspring externalizing problems.

AB Children of ages 3 to 4.5 years (N = 107; 45 boys, 62 girls) were studied twice, 6 months apart, to examine whether the cortisol rise in child care at Time 1 (T1) was associated with (a) changes in anxious, vigilant behavior from T1 to Time 2 (T2) and (b) higher internalizing symptoms at T2. Controlling for measures of home environment and child care quality at T1, as well as for cortisol activity at T2, we obtained results indicating that behavioral inhibition moderated the associations between the rise in cortisol at T1 and child outcomes at T2 (i.e., anxious, vigilant behavior and internalizing symptoms). For both outcomes, the rise in cortisol at T1 became more positively predictive at increasing levels of behavioral inhibition. Specifically, at higher levels of behavioral inhibition, children with larger T1 cortisol increases expressed more internalizing symptoms than did children at lower levels of behavioral inhibition; in contrast, for those with low cortisol activity at T1, children with higher levels of inhibition expressed fewer internalizing symptoms than did children at lower levels of inhibition. In addition, children with higher levels of behavioral inhibition and lower cortisol activity at T1 exhibited reductions in anxious, vigilant behavior from T1 to T2, whereas at lower levels of behavioral inhibition, variations in the T1 cortisol rise bore no relation to changes in this behavior. These results suggest that the rise in cortisol at child care may have differential predictive value as a function of behaviorally inhibited temperament.

AB Objective: Children of depressed and/or anxious parents are at increased risk for developing psychiatric disorders. Little research has focused on screening parents bringing their children for psychiatric evaluation, and few studies have included fathers or Hispanic children. This study had the following aims: 1) to identify current symptom rates in parents bringing their children for evaluation; and 2) to determine whether parental symptoms were associated with children's symptoms, diagnoses, and functioning. Method: The sample included 801 mothers, 182 fathers, and 848 children (aged 6 through 17 years). The majority (55.66%) were Hispanic, who attended a child and adolescent psychiatric evaluation service. Parent and child symptoms were assessed via parental reports. Children's diagnoses and functioning were determined by clinicians. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine whether severity of parental symptoms was associated with clinical child variables adjusting for child and parent demographic variables. Results: In all, 18.80% of mothers and 18.42% of fathers reported elevated internalizing symptoms. Maternal symptoms were significantly associated with problems in children's functioning and children's anxiety, depression, and oppositional/conduct diagnoses; but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Adjusting for parental and child demographics had a reduction on the effect of maternal symptoms on child depression. Paternal symptoms and functioning were positively associated with children's diagnoses, but the associations were smaller and not significant. Both parents' symptoms were significantly associated with children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, these significant effects were not moderated by marital status or child ethnicity. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of screening parents when their children receive a psychiatric evaluation. The findings support the development of mental health services that address psychiatric needs of the entire family within one clinical setting. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(5):441-450.

AB Available research indicates a link between marital conflict and youth outcomes: however, relatively few studies examine these relationships in Latinos, the largest U.S. ethnic group. The present study examines this relationship in both Latino and European American families. Self-report data measuring externalizing and internalizing youth behaviors, along with overt and covert marital conflict, were used in analyses of 788 Latino and 751 European American adolescents. Results support current literature indicating a strong link between marital conflict and youth outcomes, regardless of ethnic group. These associations are similarly related for the differential effects of overt and covert marital conflict on externalizing and internalizing behaviors. However, overt conflict was significantly more predictive of internalizing behaviors than covert conflict. These results yield valuable information for clinical intervention and further research.

TI Genetic risk by experience interaction for childhood internalizing

AB Background:
   Identifying how genetic risk interacts with experience to predict psychopathology is an important step toward understanding the etiology of mental health problems. Few studies have examined genetic risk by experience interaction (GxE) in the development of childhood psychopathology.
   Methods:
   We used both co-twin and parent mental health as markers of genetic risk to test whether GxE predicted internalizing problems in a sample of 8-year-old twins. Multi-instrument composites were used to characterize both parent and child psychopathology, and five experiential risk factors (socioeconomic status, single parent upbringing, negative parent-child interactions, number of negative life events, negative impact of negative life events) composed a cumulative risk index.
   Results:
   We found consistent evidence for GxE for child internalizing problems, with significant interaction effects emerging both when genetic risk was indexed by co-twin mental health and when it was based on parent mental health. When co-twin mental health was used to estimate genetic risk, child internalizing problems were more heritable for children at low rather than high experiential risk. When parent mental health was used to estimate genetic risk, the association between genetic risk and internalizing problems was stronger for children at elevated experiential risk. Consideration of the interaction effect sizes helps to reconcile these findings.
   Conclusions:
   Our results suggest that the processes involved in both diathesis-stress and bioecological models of development may operate for child internalizing problems. Effect sizes indicated that the main effects of genetic and experiential risk were much better predictors of child internalizing problems than was their interaction.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to ascertain the prevalence of multiple pains (MPs) and detect psychosocial risk factors assessed 1 year previously. Method: MPs were defined by the number of sites where pain was reported to occur at least "sometimes" in a general population sample of 2,219 German youths. Results: Two or more sites of recurrent pain were reported by 54% of the participants, whereas 27% reported no pains. Girls were much more prone to MPs than boys. Stability of MP was high in the two waves. Regression analysis revealed that prior MP, age, sex, internalizing/externalizing symptoms, and time spent with visual media explained 25% of the variance: the contribution of the psychosocial factors to the model was small. Separate analyses for boys and girls displayed different risk-factor profiles and a higher degree of predictability in girls. Conclusion: A supposedly biological disposition, namely pain vulnerability, being particularly high in girls, is assumed to build the basis of pains felt in various sites of the body. Further research is needed to corroborate and specify these assumptions.

AB Research on adjustment of internationally adopted children indicates that, although they have adequate development, more emotional and behavioral problems are detected compared with nonadopted children. In this research, emotional and behavioral characteristics of a sample of 52 internationally adopted minors were examined with the BASC (Parent Rating Scales and Self-Report of Personality), comparing the outcomes with 44 nonadopted minors, all of them of ages between 6 and 11 years (mean age = 8.01 years). Results indicate differences between adopted and nonadopted children related to somatization, adopted minors are those that obtain lower scores in the scale, and in the adaptability scale, where nonadopted minors obtain higher scores. Significant differences were found in the adaptive abilities scales, suggesting that nonadopted boys show better abilities than adopted ones, and no differences were found among girls. In general, boys present higher scores in externalizing symptomatology and depression than girls. Among adopted children, time spent in an institution is a variable that has negative impact on the onset of externalizing and internalizing problems. Minors coming from Eastern Europe display more attentional problems, poorer adaptive abilities and poorer interpersonal relations than the rest of the minors. According to the age at placement, attentional problems appear in minors adopted after the age of 3 years.

AB The psychometric properties of the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (LOI-CV Survey Form) and the Short Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (Short LOI-CV Survey Form) were examined in a clinical sample of 50 children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The internal consistency of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms were acceptable and poor, respectively (alpha=.79 and .65). The LOI-CV Survey Form was significantly and moderately correlated with child-rated OCD-related impairment, but was not significantly correlated with any other measures of OCD symptom frequency or severity, OCD-related impairment, global symptom severity, child reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent reports of children's obsessive-compulsive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Modest support for the cognitive-behavioral treatment sensitivity of the LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d=0.98) but not the Short LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d=0.09) was demonstrated. Diagnostic sensitivity was poor for the LOI-CV Survey Form at both pre- (0.14) and post-treatment (0.06). Overall, these results suggest that the psychometric properties of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms are not adequate for use as a screening instrument or in assessing symptom severity in pediatric OCD.

AB This article used the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) data to examine the relationship between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child behavior problems (externalizing and internalizing), truancy, grade repetition, smoking, drinking, and use of marijuana. Longitudinal data analysis was conducted on 1,816 primary caregivers and their children. Fixed-effects regression models were employed to address concerns with selection bias. IPV was associated with significantly greater internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and truancy. Findings from age interaction models suggested that the relationship between IPV and child behavior problems may attenuate as the age of the child at time of exposure increases.

AB Factor structure analysis of the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale scores in Spanish population. Social competence and antisocial behavior in children are interesting variables for researchers and educators. Nonetheless, there are few assessment instruments capable of measuring the two constructs in small children. The aim of this study is to verify the structural validity of the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale for Teachers and Caregivers (PKBS-2), in order to determine the theoretical model that best fits the data from a Spanish sample. 1509 children from preschool education (741 males and 768 females) from 3 to 6 years old (M= 3.78; SD= 0.815) participated in the study. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS-15.0) and the Structural Equations Program (EQS 6.1). The resulting models of social skills and behavioral problems show adequate fit indexes, statistically significant loadings, and a high internal consistency index (Cronbach's alpha). Lastly, the structural model confirms a two-factor structure: a first factor of Social Skills, comprising three variables (social cooperation, social interaction, and social independence), and a second factor of Behavior Problems, comprising two variables (externalization and internalization of problems).

AB Parent-reported reactions to children's negative emotions and child negative emotionality were investigated as correlates of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Children (N = 107) and their parents participated in a short-term longitudinal study of social development. Mothers and fathers independently completed questionnaires assessing parental reactions to their child's negative emotions and child negative emotionality at Time 1 (33 months) and child behavior problems at Time 2 (39 months). Child negative emotionality was significantly related to greater internalizing and externalizing behavior. Maternal and paternal punitive reactions were related to greater internalizing behavior, but only for boys with high levels of negative emotionality. Results indicate that child temperament and child gender may be important moderators of the relation between parental emotion socialization and child internalizing problems during the toddler and early preschool years.

AB Previous meta-analytic research has shown both concurrent and prospective linkages between peer victimization and internalizing problems in youth. However, the linkages between peer victimization and externalizing problems over time have not been systematically examined, and it is therefore unknown if externalizing problems are antecedents of victimization, consequences of victimization, both, or neither. This study provides a meta-analysis of 14 longitudinal studies examining prospective linkages between peer victimization and externalizing problems (n = 7,821). Two prospective paths were examined: the extent to which peer victimization at baseline predicts future residualized changes in externalizing problems, as well as the extent to which externalizing problems at baseline predict future residualized changes in peer victimization. Results revealed significant associations between peer victimization and subsequent residualized changes in externalizing problems, as well as significant associations between externalizing problems and subsequent residualized changes in peer victimization. Hence, externalizing problems function as both antecedents and consequences of peer victimization. Aggr. Behav. 37:215-222, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This paper aims at investigating the causal effects of social behaviors on subsequent reading growth in elementary school, using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K) data. The sample was 8,869 subjects who provided longitudinal measures of reading IRT scores from kindergarten (1998-1999) to fifth grades (2003-2004) in the United States. To examine the causal relationship, propensity score methods were used to match higher and lower groups in four social behavior domains such as Approaches to learning, Interpersonal skills, Internalizing problem behavior and Externalizing problem behavior. Results showed that the matched sample achieved sufficient pretreatment balance between the two groups. To examine the effects of social behaviors on the reading growth, multilevel growth model (MGM) was employed. Comparisons of the matched samples showed that children in the high groups of pro-social behavior or in the low groups of problem behavior at kindergarten entrance started with higher reading skills and developed reading achievement faster than those who were not. This study suggests that children's early social behavior is crucial in reading development. Practical implication and direction of future research are also discussed.

AB Researchers have found that adolescents who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) are at a higher risk for increased substance use and mental health symptoms. The current study is a secondary analysis of two clinical trials for street-living youth. This analysis examines self-identification as GLB as a moderator of treatment effects and addresses whether street-living GLB youth respond differently to a therapeutic intervention than non-GLB street-living youth. Comparisons were made of treatment outcomes on two categories of variables (drug use and mental health symptoms) among 244 homeless GLB and non-GLB identified adolescents. Overall, GLB and non-GLB adolescents showed similar reductions in drug use and mental health symptoms. However, compared to non-GLB adolescents. GLB adolescents showed greater improvement in reduction of drug use and internalizing and depressive symptom scores. While both groups reported less drug use and fewer mental health symptoms from baseline to post-intervention. GLB youth's scores improved more drastically. Implications of using the identified treatment intervention are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between parental religiosity, parental harmony on the subject of religiosity, and the mental health of pre-adolescents. In a community-based sample of 2,230 pre-adolescents (10-12 years), mental health problems were assessed using self-report (Youth Self-Report, YSR), parental report (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL) as well as teacher report (Teacher Checklist for Psychopathology, TCP). Information about the religiosity of mother, the religiosity of father and religious harmony between the parents was obtained by parent report. The influence of maternal religiosity on internalizing symptoms depended on the religious harmony between parents. This was particularly apparent on the CBCL. Higher levels of internalizing symptoms were associated with parental religious disharmony when combined with passive maternal religiosity. Boys scored themselves as having more externalizing symptoms in case of religiously disharmonious parents. The levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in pre-adolescents were not influenced by parental religiosity. Religious disharmony between parents is a risk factor for internalizing problems when the mother is passive religious. Religious disharmony is a risk factor on its own for externalizing problems amongst boys. Parental religious activity and parental harmony play a role in the mental health of pre-adolescents.

AB The study examined adolescents' emotional separation and detachment from parents, analyzing their relations with connectedness and agency, with some aspects of self-other boundary regulation and with problem behavior. The participants were 331 Italian adolescents, aged from 16 to 19 years (mean age = 17.40, SD = 1.14). Separation and detachment were positively related; they were negatively related to connectedness; detachment was also negatively associated to agency. Emotional separation was negatively predicted by empathic concern, perspective-taking and separate self; emotional detachment was negatively predicted by empathic concern and self-other differentiation. Separation negatively predicted internalizing behavior, and detachment positively predicted internalizing and externalizing behavior. Globally, findings showed that emotional separation and detachment are two distinct dimensions of the parent-adolescent relationship.

AB We examined the persistence of psychiatric disorders at approximately 18 and 30 months after a hurricane among a random sample of the child and adolescent population (4-17 years) of Puerto Rico. Data were obtained from caretaker-child dyads (N = 1,886) through in person interviews with primary caretakers (all children) and youth (11-17 years) using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV in Spanish. Logistic regressions, controlling for sociodemographic variables, were used to study the relation between disaster exposure and internalizing, externalizing, or any disorder. Children's disaster-related distress manifested as internalizing disorders, rather than as externalizing disorders at 18 months post-disaster. At 30 months, there was no longer a significant difference in rates of disorder between hurricane-exposed and non-exposed youth. Results were similar across age ranges. Rates of specific internalizing disorders between exposed and unexposed children are provided. Research and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Suicidality represents one of the most important areas of risk for adolescents, with both internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing antisocial (e.g., substance use, conduct) disorders conferring risk for suicidal ideation and attempts (e.g., Bridge, Goldstein, & Brent, 2006). However, no study has attended to gender differences in relationships between suicidality and different facets of psychopathic tendencies in youth. Further, very little research has focused on disentangling the multiple manifestations of suicide risk in the same study, including behaviors (suicide attempts with intent to die, self-injurious behavior) and general suicide risk marked by suicidal ideation and plans. To better understand these relationships, we recruited 184 adolescents from the community and in treatment. As predicted, psychopathic traits and depressive symptoms in youth showed differential associations with components of suicidality. Specifically, impulsive traits uniquely contributed to suicide attempts and self-injurious behaviors, above the influence of depression. Indeed, once psychopathic tendencies were entered in the model, depressive symptoms only explained general suicide risk marked by ideation or plans but not behaviors. Further, callous-unemotional traits conferred protection from suicide attempts selectively in girls. These findings have important implications for developing integrative models that incorporate differential relationships between (a) depressed mood and (b) personality risk factors (i.e., impulsivity and callous-unemotional traits) for suicidality in youth.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the agreement between parent- and child-reported quality of life (QoL) and the self-perceptions of children with ADHD. Method: A cross-sectional survey of school-aged children with ADHD and their parents was undertaken. Results: Parents reported their child's QoL as lower than the children rated themselves in most QoL domains. Children reporting higher QoL than their parents had higher self-worth, than children who reported lower QoL. There was no difference in ADHD or oppositional symptoms or child age for children reporting higher versus lower QoL than their parents. Children reported experiencing ADHD symptoms and positive aspects in taking stimulant medication. Conclusion: It is important to elicit the report of both parents and children for understanding the functional impairment of children with ADHD. Children who report lower child QoL than their parents have lower overall self-worth; these children may be at risk for developing internalizing difficulties. (J. of Att. Dis. 2011; 15(4) 321-327)

AB Background:
   Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities, growth hormone dysregulation, hyperphagia, increased risks of morbid obesity, compulsive behaviors, and irritability. As aberrant serotonergic functioning is strongly implicated in PWS, we examined associations between the PWS phenotype and polymorphisms in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin in the brain.
   Methods:
   Ninety-two individuals with PWS aged 4 to 50 years (M = 21.97) were genotyped for the TPH2 G703-T polymorphism. IQ testing was conducted in offspring, and parents completed questionnaires that tapped their child's compulsivity, hyperphagia, and other behavior problems.
   Results:
   As expected, the frequency of G/T or T/T polymorphisms in participants with PWS (39%) was similar to rates found in the general population (38%). Compared to those with a homozygous (G/G) genotype, individuals with a T allele had significantly higher hyperphagic behavior, drive, and severity scores, and they also had a younger age of onset of hyperphagia. Those with a T allele also had higher IQ scores than their counterparts. Females with a T allele had significantly higher internalizing symptoms, primarily anxiety and depression, than all others.
   Conclusions:
   TPH2 G/T polymorphisms, and presumed loss of enzyme function, were associated with specific aspects of the PWS phenotype. Aberrant serotonergic functioning is strongly implicated in hyperphagia in PWS, and females with TPH2 T alleles may be at higher risk for affective or mood disorders. Findings hold promise for examining other serotonin-altering genes in PWS, and for future serotonin-altering treatment trials.

AB Depressive syndromes represent a disabling comorbidity for many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, the ascertainment of depression can be complicated by phenotypic overlap between the 2 conditions, by ways in which autistic symptomatology can mask cardinal features of depression and by atypical manifestations of depression in children with ASD. These issues have contributed to wide variation in the estimation of prevalence rates of depression in individuals with ASD and invoke the need for new approaches to the specific detection of depression and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities that aggregate in children affected by ASD. The authors review the scientific literature relevant to the occurrence of depression in ASD and consider important parameters of risk, including psychosocial factors such as insight into affectation status, as well as biological factors such as the aggregation of depressive syndromes in certain families affected by autism, which has suggested possible overlap in genetic influences underlying the 2 conditions. Variability in the manifestations of depression across environmental contexts provides important clues to intervention and underscores the potential importance of involving multiple informants in ascertaining depression in children and adolescents with ASD. A practical strategy for evaluating the presence of depression in youth with ASD is synthesized from the available data and discussed.

AB Objective To examine the long-term effects of fluconazole prophylaxis in extremely low birth weight infants.
   Study design Neurodevelopmental status and quality of life of survivors from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole prophylaxis were evaluated at 8 to 10 years of life using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) and the Child Health Questionnaire Parent-Completed Form 28 (CHQ-PF28), respectively.
   Results VABS-II Domain Scores for the fluconazole-treated (n = 21; 9.1 +/- 0.7 years) compared with the placebo group (n = 17; 9.3 +/- 0.8 years) were similar for communication [94.6 (+/- 14.8) versus 92.6 (+/- 12.6), P = .65], daily living skills [87.9 (+/- 10.6) versus 87.4 (+/- 9.3), P = .89], socialization [97.2 (+/- 9.2) versus 94.4 (+/- 7.9), P = .31], and motor skills [92.1 (+/- 17.8) versus 95.1 (+/- 14.6), P = .57]. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors and maladaptive behavior index were also similar. The CHQ-PF28 revealed no differences between the two groups regarding quality of life. Survivors were also happy or satisfied with school (90% versus 100%, P = .49), friendships (90% versus 88%, P = 1.00), and life (95% versus 100%, P = 1.00). Self esteem scores were 87.3 +/- 15.7 versus 89.7 +/- 10.4 (P = .59). There were also no differences between groups regarding emotional difficulties or behavior problems.
   Conclusions Fluconazole prophylaxis for the prevention of invasive Candida infections is safe in extremely low birth weight infants and does not appear to be associated with any long-term adverse effects on neurodevelopment and quality of life at 8 to 10 years of life.

AB Maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is implicated in the neurodevelopment of the offspring, yet little is known about the effect of maternal thyroid parameters on the behavior of children. We investigated the association of maternal thyroid function during the first half of pregnancy with parent-reported problem behavior of the offspring up to age of 3 y. In the Generation R study, a population-based cohort of 3736 children and their mothers, data on maternal thyroid function and child's behavior were examined. The degree of internalizing and externalizing problems in the children were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 1 1/2 and 3 y. Higher levels of maternal TSH during pregnancy predicted a higher externalizing scores in children at 1 1/2 and 3 y (B = 0.22 per SD of TSH; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.40; B = 0.10 per SD for internalizing scores; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.21). Maternal free thyroxine (T4) and total T4 were not associated with internalizing or externalizing scores of children. The linear relationship with more externalizing scores was across the range of TSH; this implies that subtle impairments of maternal thyroid function may affect the child. The results suggest that thyroid function is crucial for fetal brain development, which determines problem behavior later in life. (Pediatr Res 69: 454-459, 2011)

AB Background: Selective mutism (SM), considered an early-onset variant of social anxiety disorder, shares features of impaired social interaction and communication with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) suggesting a possible shared pathophysiology. We examined association of a susceptibility gene, contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), for ASDs and specific language impairment with SM and social anxiety-related traits.
   Methods: Sample 1 subjects were 99 nuclear families including 106 children with SM. Sample 2 subjects were young adults who completed measures of social interactional anxiety (n = 1028) and childhood behavioral inhibition (n = 920). Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in CNTNAP2 (including rs7794745 and rs2710102, previously associated with ASDs) were genotyped.
   Results: Analyses revealed nominal significance (p = .018) for association of SM with rs2710102, which, with rs6944808, was part of a common haplotype associated with SM (permutation p = .022). Adjusting for sex and ancestral proportion, each copy of the rs2710102*a risk allele in the young adults was associated with increased odds of being >1 SD above the mean on the Social Interactional Anxiety Scale (odds ratio = 1.33, p = .015) and Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition (odds ratio = 1.40, p = .010).
   Conclusions: Although association was found with rs2710102, the risk allele (a) for the traits studied here is the nonrisk allele for ASD and specific language impairment. These findings suggest a partially shared etiology between ASDs and SM and raise questions about which aspects of these syndromes are potentially influenced by CNTNAP2 and mechanism(s) by which these influences may be conveyed.

AB Background Research has shown that children's beliefs about the causes of psychological problems are related to their attitudes and reactions towards affected peers. This study describes the development of the Children's Attributions about Psychological Problems in their Peers (CAPPP) Scale, which assesses children's beliefs about the causes of an internalizing and an externalizing condition.
   Methods The 16 items comprising the CAPPP are derived from previous qualitative research findings. Five hundred and ninety-five young people, drawn from five different age groups spanning early childhood to late adolescence, completed a CAPPP Scale for each of two vignettes describing the behaviour of hypothetical peers with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression.
   Results Modifications following consideration of psychometric properties and conceptual fit resulted in a 12-item scale. For both the ADHD and depression conditions, the components that emerged were 'Volition','Recent Life Stress', 'Family Factors' and 'School Factors'.
   Conclusions The present study represents the first field trial of the CAPPP. Results suggest that children's and adolescents' beliefs about the causes of psychological problems are multidimensional and incorporate both individual and environmental factors.

AB Objective: To distinguish Cuban children clinically referred because of ADHD from an at-risk community sample and a community control group in terms of symptoms, associated difficulties and impairment of family and peer relations. Method: Parents and teachers of 1,036 children (6-8 years old) completed an established ADHD rating scale and a behavioral screening measure, including peer functioning. We also administered a structured clinical interview and measures of family impairment to the clinical sample and to an at-risk community-based subsample. Results: Although both clinical and at-risk groups displayed more externalizing and internalizing symptoms than controls, referred children were not only characterized by higher levels of ADHD symptoms, but also by greater impairment of family and peer relations than at-risk community children or community controls. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ADHD has major consequences on the family and peer functioning of Cuban children, which may lead to their referral for treatment. (J. of Att.

AB Aim:
   The present study examined the effects of maternal anxiety during infant hospitalization in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) on the child's cognitive and behavioural development at 24 months corrected age. Parental anxiety following the birth of a very low birthweight (VLBW, < 1500 g) infant may impede their capacity to be sensitive to the infant's cues and adversely affect infant developmental outcomes.
   Methods:
   A sample of 88 mothers and their VLBW infants were recruited in the NICU; 57 were followed at 24 months corrected age. During the infant's hospitalization, mothers completed a self-report measure of trait anxiety. When the infants were 24 months corrected age, mother-child interaction was videotaped during free play at home. These videotaped observations were coded using Emotional Availability Scales. Child cognitive and behavioural outcomes were evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (II) and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5.
   Results:
   Maternal anxiety in the NICU was found to be a significant and independent predictor of child cognitive development and internalizing behaviour problems, controlling for maternal education and neonatal morbidity.
   Conclusion:
   These results suggest that early intervention programmes targeting anxious mothers of VLBW infants are indicated, to promote optimal developmental outcomes.

AB Aim:
   A screening tool for psychosocial functioning of adolescents with diabetes is unavailable. We investigated whether one question using a Visual Analogue Scale that indicates a rating from the worst (0) to the best possible life (10) is related to standardized indices of psychosocial functioning and well-being in adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM).
   Method:
   One hundred and fifty-one adolescents with T1DM and 122 healthy peers between 12 and 18 years of age were asked to rate their life on a scale, varying from 0 to 10. Behaviour problems and depressive symptoms were measured with the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).
   Results:
   Adolescents with T1DM rated their life less positive in comparison with their healthy peers (F-1,F-269 = 14.01, p = 0.000). Adolescents with T1DM who rated their life with a 6 or lower reported more depressive symptoms and behaviour problems (F-2,F-131 = 24.19, p = 0.00) compared to those with higher scores (7 or up).
   Conclusion:
   One question the 'rate your life scale' identified most of the adolescents at risk of internalizing behaviour problems, especially depression. The results of this first step in exploring the validity of this question as a screening tool for psychological functioning are promising.

AB Several studies in the past have examined whether the hierarchical structure of anxiety and depressive symptoms can explain the high comorbidity between them but more studies are needed from other settings and with different methods. The present study aimed to examine the structure of common anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents 16-18 years old attending secondary schools using the Greek version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). a fully structured psychiatric interview. A total of 2431 adolescents were interviewed with the computerized version of the CIS-R. The hierarchical structure of 12 depressive and anxiety symptoms was examined with confirmatory factor analytical methods. Four alternative models of increasing complexity were tested. The best-fitting model included three first-order factors, representing the dimensions of anxiety, depression and non-specific distress respectively. A model with a higher-order factor representing the broader internalizing dimension was less supported by the data. The findings of this and other studies should be taken into account in future classifications of psychiatric disorders and may have clinical practical implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives: Successful development during the first year of life is dependent on the infant's ability to regulate behavioral and physiological state in response to unpredictable environmental challenges. Although most infants develop skills to self-soothe and regulate behavior, a subset lacks these skills and develops regulatory disorders (RD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the component features of RD by determining if infants with RD differ from typically developing infants on measures of temperament, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate, and mother-infant interactions. Methods: Parents of 50 9-month-old infants completed behavioral questionnaires that provided information necessary to complete the Regulatory Disorders Checklist, which evaluates for difficulties in self-regulation and hypersensitivities. Infants with difficulties in both domains were assigned to the RD group. Mothers and their infants were videotaped interacting for 10 minutes. Infant heart rate was monitored before and during the mental development test. Results: The RD group (n = 10) was more temperamentally difficult and exhibited atypical physiological regulation relative to infants with difficulties in either self-regulation or hypersensitivity (n = 25) or infants with no difficulties (n = 15). During the mother-infant interactions, the RD group exhibited more high-level withdrawal behaviors, including verbal and physical protests, although there were no differences in the quantity and quality of the maternal approaches. Conclusion: Infants with RD have both temperamental and physiological regulation difficulties and may be in a physiological state that makes it difficult to moderate behavior in response to social demands. Mothers of RD infants might be taught to modify their behavior to help their infants to regulate behavioral and physiological state. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 32:216-224, 2011)

TI Late-Preterm Birth and Its Association With Cognitive and Socioemotional
   Outcomes at 6 Years of Age
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB The prevalence of late-preterm birth (defined as 34-36 weeks' gestation) has increased substantially in the last 2 decades and now accounts for more than 70% of all singleton preterm deliveries in the United States. Late preterm birth has been linked to lower educational attainment and income, and it is important to determine the relationship between late preterm birth and cognitive performance across childhood.
   Previous studies have demonstrated that late-preterm birth is associated with cognitive and socioemotional problems during childhood. However, many of these studies failed to include important contributors to cognitive and socioemotional outcomes such as maternal IQ. Moreover, it is known that reductions in fetal growth may also result in late-preterm delivery and it is unclear whether effects of preterm birth on cognitive and behavioral functioning are independent of changes in fetal growth.
   This study investigated whether infants born late preterm and children born term differed in IQ and teacher-reported behavioral problems at age 6 years. Data were obtained from a previous study investigating cognitive and psychiatric sequelae associated with low birth weight. The study population consisted of random samples of low-birth-weight (n = 473) and normal-birth-weight (n = 350) infants from urban and suburban hospitals. Singletons born late-preterm were matched 1: 1 with term counterparts using birth weight z scores within 0.1 SD of the counterpart value, yielding a total of 336 participants (168 pairs). Subsets of the age-norm Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised measured a range of cognitive abilities, including full-scale IQ (FSIQ) and its constituent subscale, performance IQ (PIQ). To determine the effect of late preterm birth on cognitive and behavioral functioning at the age of 6 years, associations among late-preterm birth, IQ, and teacher-rated behavioral problems were investigated using random-effects models.
   After adjustment for confounders, late-preterm birth was associated with an increased risk of FSIQ and PIQ scores <85; the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the FSIQ score was 2.35, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.20-4.61 and the aOR for the PIQ score was 2.04, with a 95% CI of 1.09-3.82 (P <= 0.05 for both comparisons). With respect to behavioral problems, late-preterm birth was associated with an increased risk of exhibiting borderline or clinically significant internalizing problems (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.28-4.32) or attention problems (aOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.04-3.0) problems (P <= 0.05 for both comparisons).
   These findings show that children born late preterm exhibit higher levels of behavioral problems and lower levels of cognitive performance at the age of 6 compared with term counterparts, independent of socioeconomic factors and maternal IQ.

AB Three studies were designed to measure various indicators of the reliability and validity of the Preschool Behavior Screening System (PBSS) as a screening instrument for emotional and behavioral disorder risk status of children of preschool age. Study 1 and Study 2 served to establish evidence for content validity. Study 3 investigated one type of reliability evidence (i.e., internal consistency) and four types of validity evidence (i.e., internal structure validity, validity evidence based on external relations, concurrent validity, and cross-informant agreement). Teachers and parents of children (N = 113) enrolled in preschool and childcare programs completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the PBSS and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). Cross-informant agreement between parent and teacher ratings on the PBSS was generally moderate, and internal consistency was high. PBSS Phase 1 and PBSS Phase 2 were correlated in the expected directions, and sensitivity and negative predictive value were high. Results suggest that the PBSS may yield psychometrically sound scores for helping states meet child-find requirements. Directions for future development of the PBSS are provided.

AB The purpose of the current study was to explore clusters of proactive parenting practices, and how they might vary as a function of parental demographics, the quality of the parent-child relationship, and the traits and behaviors of the adolescent child. Data were taken from the Flourishing Families Project, which includes 500 families with an early adolescent child (M age = 11.49). Findings suggested that there were four clusters of parents, and patterns were similar for mothers and fathers. Findings also suggested that proactive clusters varied primarily as a function of demographics of the parent (e.g., religiosity, ethnicity, education) and the traits and behaviors of the adolescent child (e.g., empathy, internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Discussion highlights the importance of using a typological approach to study parenting, and places particular emphasis on parents' use of pre-arming (alone, or in conjunction with other practices) in an attempt to avoid misbehavior before it occurs.

AB Objective: To determine if youth born large for gestational age (LGA; birth weight above the 95th percentile) or small for gestational age (SGA; less than the fifth percentile) are at an increased risk of developing symptoms of externalizing and internalizing problems.
   Method: Data on members of the Ontario Child Health Study aged 4 to 16 years were used to examine associations between LGA, SGA, and psychopathology. This sample consisted of 2923 youth about whom parent, teacher, and self-reported levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were available, and whose caregivers retrospectively reported birth weight and gestational age (GA). Psychopathology was assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales derived from the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Multilevel linear regression analyses revealed that after adjustment for parental psychopathology, socioeconomic disadvantage, sex, age, maternal age, birth order, and child health and school performance, youth born LGA had higher scores on the self-reported externalizing scale (1.39, 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.78), but not internalizing scale, compared with youth born at an appropriate weight for GA (10th to 90th percentile). Parent and teacher ratings generally supported these findings in direction but did not reach statistical significance. Youth and parents reported increased levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms in youth born SGA, but these were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Youth born above the 95th percentile for GA manifest increased levels of externalizing symptoms. Given increasing rates of macrosomic births, further study is warranted to replicate and determine the clinical significance of these findings, the contribution of the antecedents of LGA to this risk and the extent to which this association may be causal.

AB Understanding the bidirectional relation between parenting behaviors and youth mental health in Mexican American families is crucial because of the current need to improve the availability of high quality services for this underserved population and to broaden the reach of extant theories on this topic. Youth (14-19 years old; N = 88) were recruited from a public high school in an urban immigrant enclave and reported their internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as six maternal parenting behaviors at two points approximately one year apart. Youth-reported parenting behaviors formed two factors: Supportive Parenting and Harsh Parental Control. T1 externalizing symptoms predicted higher T2 Harsh Parental Control, providing evidence for the coercive model. T1 internalizing symptoms predicted lower T2 Supportive Parenting, providing evidence for social interaction theory. However, T1 parenting factors did not predict T2 youth mental health symptoms as expected according to bidirectional theories. We advocate the use of eco-developmental models to interpret our findings and guide future research.

TI Is amount of food intake in overweight and obese children related to

AB Objective: To explore the relationship among the amount of food intake of 8- to 12-years old overweight children, their psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing and attention problems) and the mothers' amount of food intake. Methods: In a previous trial designed to test the influence of a preload on food intake, overweight to obese children and their mothers participated in a taste test thereby consuming a preweighed amount of a mousse-like dessert, which was reweighed again at the end. In the current study, we reanalyzed these data by assessing the relationship between children's amount of food intake and their psychopathology, as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: We found that children with high scores for attention problems consumed larger amounts of food. No such relationship could be observed for children's externalizing problems. Additionally, a positive and direct effect of mother's amount of food intake on children's energy food intake was present even when accounting for children's psychopathology. Conclusion: Results suggest that besides mothers' influence on children's food intake, children's problems to self-regulate impulses may be related to uncontrolled eating behavior and weight gain.

AB As the first step of an instrument development, teaching challenges that occur when students with autism spectrum disorders are educated in general physical education were elicited using Goldfried and D'Zurilla's (1969) behavioral-analytic model. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 43 certified physical educators (29 women and 14 men) using a demographic questionnaire and an elicitation questionnaire. Participants listed 225 teaching challenges, 46% related to cooperative, 31% to competitive, and 24% to individualistic learning situations. Teaching challenges were categorized into nine themes: inattentive and hyperactive behaviors, social impairment, emotional regulation difficulties, difficulties understanding and performing tasks, narrow focus and inflexible adherence to routines and structure, isolation by classmates, negative effects on classmates' learning, and need for support.

AB Adolescent family adversity is a considerable adaptive challenge in an increasingly turbulent developmental period. Using data from a prospective population cohort of 2230 Dutch adolescents, we tested risk-buffering interactions between adolescent family adversity and self-regulation capacities on mental health. We used two adaptive self-regulation capacities that could allow adolescents to manage relatively well with family adversity: (1) parent-reported effortful control, and (2) an attentional flexibility (in this case, set-shifting) task. Adolescent family adversity was associated with internalizing problems and externalizing problems. The risk-buffering effects of effortful control were found for externalizing problems but not for internalizing problems. There were no risk-buffering effects of attentional flexibility on both types of mental health problems. Effortful control is likely to benefit adolescents' ability to channel their frustrations in adaptive ways in the presence of family adversity. Additionally, (attentional) set-shifting tasks might have a limited predictive value for risk-buffering research.

AB Evidence suggests that parental marital discord contributes to the development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. Few studies, however, have examined the association between parental marital discord and youth's response to treatment. The present study examined the impact of interparental discord on treatment response in a randomized control trial of adolescents with major depression enrolled in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS). Participants were 260 adolescents from two-parent households randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: fluoxetine (FLX), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or placebo (PBO). Logistic regressions revealed that parental marital discord interacted with youth gender and co-morbid oppositionality symptoms to predict group differences in treatment response.

AB Models of developmental psychopathology emphasize both mediation and moderation processes among child and caregiving attributes; however, little research has examined both these processes simultaneously on the development of internalizing problems. This study tested a moderated mediation model that related early childhood shyness, emotion regulation and maternal negative control to school-age internalizing problems among 257 boys from low-income families. Shyness and maternal negative control was assessed at ages 1.5-2, emotion regulation was observed at age 3.5, and internalizing symptoms were assessed by mothers and teachers at age 6 or 7. Results indicated that 1) the active distraction regulation strategy mediated the relations between early shyness and maternal report of internalizing symptoms; 2) the passive/dependent regulation strategy mediated the relations between shyness and teacher report of internalizing symptoms; and 3) both mediation processes were moderated by maternal negative control. The results are discussed in relation to implications for early prevention and intervention.

AB A typology of music listeners was constructed on the basis of importance attributed to music and four types of music use: mood enhancement; coping with problems; defining personal identity; and marking social identity. Three Listener Groups were identified through Latent Class Analysis of internet survey data of 997 Dutch respondents, aged 12-29. High-Involved listeners (19.7%) experienced music as a very important medium and used music most often for mood enhancement, coping with distress, identity construction and social identity formation. Medium- (74.2%) and Low- Involved (6.1%) listeners formed two distinct groups with less intense importance/use patterns Furthermore, High-Involved listeners reported that they liked a broad range of genres (Pop, Rock, High Brow, Urban and Dance) and experienced the most intense positive affect when listening. However, both High- and Medium-Involved listeners also reported more negative affects (anger and sadness) when listening, compared to the Low-Involved group. Even the Low-Involved group listened frequently to music and used music as a mood enhancer. Generally, people who are 'moved by music', either positively or negatively, use it for mood enhancement and coping more often. Therefore, the High-Involved group seems to benefit most from music's capacity to enliven and enlighten life.

AB Objective: Depressive symptoms are elevated in adolescents who experienced significant malnutrition early in life. Early malnutrition can also have a significant impact on cognitive functioning, presumably because of the adverse impact of the malnutrition on the very young brain. In the context of a developmental cascade model, we tested the hypothesis that the association between early malnutrition and adolescent depressive symptoms is mediated by the cognitive impairment that ensues from the malnutrition. Methods: We evaluated Barbadian youth (N = 57) hospitalized for moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition in the first year of life and healthy controls (N = 60) longitudinally. The primary hypothesis was tested by multiple regression models. Results: After adjusting for covariates, early malnutrition predicted both cognitive functioning in childhood (IQ, p < .001; attention problems, p < .01; Common Entrance Examination, p < .01; and adolescent depressive symptoms, p < .05). Childhood cognitive functioning mediated the association between early malnutrition and depressive symptoms in adolescence (p < .001). Maternal depressive symptoms were a significant but independent predictor of adolescent depressive symptoms (p < .05). Conclusions: Cognitive compromise in childhood accounts indirectly for elevated depressive symptoms in previously malnourished adolescents, consistent with a developmental cascade model. The direct link between malnutrition and depressive symptoms in adolescence is small. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 32:225-232, 2011)

AB Objective To examine mediating processes linking parental involvement to diabetes management (adherence and metabolic control) during adolescence. Methods A total of 252 young adolescents (M age = 12.49 years, SD = 1.53, 53.6% females) with type 1 diabetes reported their parents' involvement in diabetes management (relationship quality, monitoring, and behavioral involvement), their own externalizing and internalizing behaviors, diabetes-self efficacy, and adherence behaviors. HbA1c was drawn from medical records. Results SEM analyses indicated that the associations of mothers' and fathers' relationship quality with diabetes outcomes were mediated by adolescents' perceptions of self-efficacy and externalizing behaviors, and the associations of fathers' monitoring and behavioral involvement with adherence were partially mediated by adolescents' self-efficacy. There were also direct (non-mediated) associations between mothers' monitoring and adherence, and fathers' monitoring and adherence and metabolic control. Conclusions Quality of the parent-adolescent relationship and monitoring are important for better adherence and metabolic control among adolescents through higher diabetes self-efficacy.

AB To date, relatively little is known about differences between perpetrators and victims of cyber and traditional forms of aggression. Hence, this study investigated differences among traditional and cyber aggressors and victims on psychosocial characteristics typically examined in research on traditional aggression and victimization, specifically effortful control, manipulativeness, remorselessness, proactive and reactive aggression, and anxious/depressive symptoms. Participants (N = 300; 63.2% female; M age = 12.89, SD = .95; 52% Caucasian, 27% African American, 11% Latino, and 10% other) were categorized based on aggressor type (non/low aggressor, traditional-only, cyber-only, and combined traditional and cyber) and victim type (non-victim, traditional-only, cyber-only, and combined traditional and cyber). Cyber aggressors reported lower levels of reactive aggression compared to traditional-only and combined aggressors. Combined aggressors demonstrated the poorest psychosocial profile compared to all other aggressor groups. For victimization, cyber-only and combined victims reported higher levels of reactive aggression and were more likely to be cyber aggressors themselves compared to traditional-only victims and non-victims. Findings suggest that there may be unique aspects about cyber aggression and victimization that warrant further investigation.

AB Given the propensity for clinical assessment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to focus on core behavioral symptoms, the current study examined how well other predictors classified children who were diagnosed with ADHD by licensed practitioners. Participants were 91 children (39 ADHD-identified, 52 without ADHD), aged 8 to 13 years. In addition to significantly more ADHD symptoms, the ADHD-identified group exhibited significantly more externalizing problems and internalizing symptoms, less adaptive functioning, and greater problem pervasiveness and severity. Binary logistic regression analyses indicated that problem pervasiveness and severity significantly predicted diagnostic group membership when controlling for other predictors, and pervasiveness added unique variance beyond measures of core ADHD symptoms. Diagnostic utility analyses showed measurement of problem pervasiveness and severity to be a useful tool in the identification of ADHD. Findings provide support for the practical use of a parent-report measure of impairment in the home as part of evidence-based assessment of ADHD.

AB The aims of this study were to examine prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), its associated factors and co-occurring psychological problems in a group of displaced adolescents 3 months following Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan. The relationship of trauma dimension and PTSD was also explored. A total of 271 adolescents who had been evacuated from their homes participated in this school-based survey. Adolescents were interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents. Subjects themselves completed the following questionnaires: an inventory of exposure experiences to Typhoon Morakot, the Chinese version of Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Family APGAR Index. Teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form in the Achenbach system of Empirically Bases Assessment. Results revealed that the prevalence of PTSD related to Typhoon Morakot was 25.8%. Adolescents who were female, had PTSD related to previous traumatic events before Typhoon Morakot, had more exposure experiences, were physically injured, or had family member in same household died or seriously injured were more likely to have the diagnoses of PTSD. Meanwhile, adolescents with PTSD had more severe depression, internalizing, externalizing, social, thought, and attention problems than those without PTSD. Our findings indicate that specialized trauma services are needed for these youngsters to lessen prolonged vulnerabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Few studies have examined the effects of household change on adolescent development. We study household composition change and its effect on development, as measured by both internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors, in a sample of urban African American adolescents. Household change was defined based on the movement in or out of the household of one of the 2 most important adults adolescents named. We found 25% of adolescents reported changes in their household composition over the 4 years of high school. Youth who experienced change reported more internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior than youth who did not experience change. Those reporting important people leaving their household had the greatest negative outcomes. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We examined to what extent internalizing and externalizing problems at age 3 preceded and predicted parental divorce, and if divorce and the time lapse since divorce were related to internalizing and externalizing problems at age 12.
   Parental ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems were collected with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in a large sample (N = 6,426) of 3-year-old children. All these children were followed through the age of 12 years, at which parents completed the CBCL again, while teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form. Children whose parents divorced between age 3 and age 12 were compared with children whose families remained intact.
   Girls whose parents divorced between ages 3 and 12 already showed more externalizing problems at age 3 than girls whose parents stayed married. Higher levels of externalizing problems in girls at age 3 predicted later parental divorce. Parental reports indicated that 12-year-olds with divorced parents showed more internalizing and externalizing problems than children with married parents. Levels of teacher-reported problems were not different between children with married versus divorced parents. However, children whose parents divorced between ages 3 and 12 showed more teacher-rated internalizing problems at age 12 when the divorce was more recent than when the divorce was less recent. Parental ratings of both internalizing and externalizing problems at age 12 were not associated with the time lapse since divorce.
   Externalizing problems in girls precede and predict later parental divorce. Post-divorce problems in children vary by raters, and may depend on the time lapse since divorce.

AB Background: Preterm children are at risk for behavior problems. Studies examining contributions of intellectual and environmental factors to behavior outcomes in preterm children are mixed.
   Aims: (1) To identify the nature of maladaptive behaviors in preterm children age 9 to 16 years born across the spectrum of gestational age and birth weight (BW). (2) To examine contributions of BW as a biological factor, socioeconomic status as an environmental factor, and intelligence quotient (IQ) as indicative of intellectual ability to behavior outcomes.
   Method: Using the Child Behavior Checklist, parent reports of behavior for 63 preterm children (gestational age 24 to < 36 weeks) were compared to 29 full term children of similar age, gender and socioeconomic status. Multiple regression models evaluated effects of prematurity, socioeconomic status, and intellectual ability on behavioral symptom scores.
   Results: Preterm children had higher total and internalizing problem scores compared to full term children. They also had lower IQ. BW was a significant predictor of total and internalizing behavior problems. Among the syndrome scales, anxious/depressed and attention problems were elevated. Socioeconomic status did not contribute to behavior scores. IQ contributed to total, but not to internalizing or externalizing, scores. IQ contributed to attention problems, but not to anxious/depressed scores.
   Conclusion: Preterm children had increased behavior problems, especially symptoms of inattention and anxiety. Lower BW predicted more behavior problems. IQ acted as a mediator between BW and attention scores, but not anxiety scores. These findings alert health care providers to assess anxiety in all preterm children regardless of intellectual ability and additional study on the influence of intellectual ability on behavioral outcomes in preterm children is needed.

AB Behavioral inhibition (BI) has been associated with the development of internalizing disorders in children and adolescents. It has further been shown that attentional control (AC) is negatively associated with internalizing problems. The combination of high BI and low AC may particularly lead to elevated symptomatology of internalizing behavior. This study broadens existing knowledge by investigating the additive and interacting effects of BI and AC on the various DSM-IV based internalizing dimensions. A sample of non-clinical adolescents (N = 1806, age M = 13.6 years), completed the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System Scales (BIS/BAS), the attentional control subscale of the Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). As expected, BI was positively, and AC was negatively related to internalizing dimensions, with stronger associations of BI than of AC with anxiety symptoms, and a stronger association of AC than of BI with depressive symptoms. AC moderated the association between BI and all measured internalizing dimensions (i.e., symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder). Since high AC may reduce the impact of high BI on the generation of internalizing symptoms, an intervention focused on changing AC may have potential for prevention and treatment of internalizing disorders.

AB Objective: To estimate associations between trajectories of conduct problems and social-cognitive competences through childhood into early adolescence. Method: A prospective population-based cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) recruited in the prenatal period (13,988 children alive at 12 months) formed the basis for the current study. Socio-emotional and pragmatic language competences were examined in relation to conduct problem development in a group of 6,047 children with no known autistic-spectrum disorders. Specifically, conduct problem trajectories (low, childhood-limited, adolescent-onset, and early-onset persistent) identified using maternal prospective reports (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: ages 4 through 13 years) were contrasted. Demographic confounders, child verbal IQ and other psychopathologies were controlled. Results: In contrast to individuals with low conduct problem levels, all conduct problem groups presented with difficulties in both social-cognitive domains. Deficits among those with early-onset persistent conduct problems were particularly apparent: 40.6% of boys and 24.3% of girls with persistent conduct problems met impairment criteria for one or other social-cognitive domain. Associations remained robust after controlling for demographic confounders (maternal age at birth, low SES, maternal education), child verbal IQ, and internalizing and inattention symptoms. For boys, results indicated that overlaps with overactivity symptoms may contribute problems with pragmatic language; this was not the case for girls or for socio-emotional difficulties. Conclusions: Findings have far-reaching implications for children with conduct problems, particularly those with early onset and persistent difficulties. Traditional parent training interventions are likely to be bolstered by strategies that help to develop the social competences of these children. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

AB Background: Suicide among young people is a global public health problem, but adequate information on determinants of suicidal expression is lacking in middle and low income countries. Young people in transitional economies are vulnerable to psychosocial stressors and suicidal expressions. This study explores the suicidal expressions and their determinants among high school students in Cambodia, with specific focus on gender differences.
   Methods: A sample of 320 young people, consisting of 153 boys and 167 girls between 15-18 years of age, was randomly selected from two high schools in Cambodia. Their self-reported suicidal expressions, mental health problems, life-skills dimensions, and exposure to suicidal behavior in others were measured using the Youth Self-Report (YSR), Life-Skills Development Scale (LSDS)-Adolescent Form, and Attitude Towards Suicide (ATTS) questionnaires.
   Results: Suicidal plans were reported more often by teenage boys than teenage girls (M = 17.3%, F = 5.6%, p = 0.001), whereas girls reported more attempts (M = 0.6%, F = 7.8%, p = 0.012). Young men scored significantly higher on rule-breaking behavior than young women (p = 0.001), whereas young women scored higher on anxious/depression (p = 0.000), withdrawn/depression (p = 0.002), somatic complaints (p = 0.034), social problems (p = 0.006), and internalizing syndrome (p = 0.000). Young men exposed to suicide had significantly higher scores for internalizing syndrome compared to those unexposed (p = 0.001), while young women exposed to suicide scored significantly higher on both internalizing (p = 0.001) and externalizing syndromes (p = 0.012). Any type of exposure to suicidal expressions increased the risk for own suicidal expressions in both genders (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.06-3.91); among young women, however, those exposed to suicide among friends and partners were at greater risk for the serious suicidal expressions (OR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.00-7.74). Life skills dimension scores inversely correlated with externalizing syndrome in young men (p = 0.026) and internalizing syndrome in young women (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: The significant gender differences in suicidal expressions and their determinants in Cambodian teenagers highlight the importance of culturally appropriate and gender-specific suicide prevention programs. School-based life skills promotion may indirectly influence the determinants for suicidal expressions, particularly among young women with internalizing syndrome in Cambodia.

DE OCD; children and adolescents; severe; comorbidity; family functioning
ID SPANISH VERSION; SCALE; IMPACT; OCD; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; RELIABILITY;
   FEATURES; ANXIETY; ONSET
AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder in children, adolescents and adults. Prevalence rates of 2% to 4% have been reported. Despite the presence of effective treatments, underdiagnosis in children and adolescents is frequent. In addition, OCD is frequently comorbid with externalizing disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social phobia and separation anxiety disorder. Comorbidity with affective disorders is frequent too. The OCD association with major depressive disorder (MDD) increases in adolescence, reaching similar rates in adults. The comorbidity and other clinical variables, such as the duration of illness, have been mentioned as predictors of severity and treatment response. An erratic family functioning has also been associated to the severity of the illness.
   The aim of this study was to determine if there were differences in demographic variables (sex and age), clinical variables (age onset of the illness and comorbid disorders) and family functioning between children and adolescents with mild/moderate vs. severe OCD.
   Methods
   In a comparative cross sectional design, 60 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, who met criteria for OCD and were drug naive, were assessed. Subjects who were unable to complete the interviews or had severe neurological or medical comorbidities were excluded.
   Subjects were recruited at the inpatients and outpatients services of the Child Psychiatric Hospital Dr. Juan N. Navarro (HPIJNN). Trained physicians interviewed the subjects and their parents using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAS) and the family APGAR rating scale. Based on CY-BOCS scores, the sample was divided in mild/moderate OCD (CY-BOCS < 30 points) and severe OCD (CY-BOCS >= 30 points).
   Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviation) and comparative (t student and Chi square) were used. Univariate analysis and linear regression were conducted for assessing factors associated with OCD severity.
   Results
   The sample had a mean age of 12.57 +/- 2.91 years old, they were 71.7% male. The mean duration of their illness was 19 +/- 10.75 months. The average score of CY-BOCS was 22.76 +/- 8.66, family APGAR 14.68 +/- 6.02 and GAS 54.91 +/- 15.05. A relative with OCD symptoms was reported by 23.3% of the sample; in these relatives, the most common symptoms were those related to contamination fears and washing (16%), symmetry and order (6.6%), checking (3.3%) and hoarding (1.6%).
   The mean number of comorbid disorders was 3.16 +/- 1.68. The most frequent were MDD, ADHD and GAD. The internalizing disorders were reported as secondary to OCD.
   The most common obsessions in the sample were those related to contamination and germs 60% (n=37), followed by fears to harm 58% (n=35), somatic 26.7% (n=16) and symmetry 20% (n=12). The most common compulsions were washing 50% (n=30), repeating 43% (n=26) and checking 35% (n=21). Six subjects reported contamination thoughts or rituals-related enuresis and encopresis (fear of contamination when using the bathroom or doing it only at a specific time).
   The main reason for attention seeking was the presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms (48%), externalized symptoms (27%), OCD symptoms (20%) and psychotic symptoms (5%). The KSADS-PL interview showed that 26% (n=16), 33% (n=20) and 43% (n=26) of the sample reported academic, social and family dysfunction respectively.
   When the sample was divided according to their severity, 81.7% (n=48) belonged to the mild/moderate OCD group and 18.3% (n=11) to the severe OCD group; this had a shorter duration of illness (16.54 +/- 5.3, vs. 19.73 +/- 11.5 months; t=0.913, df=58, p=0.003). The comparison of demographic characteristics, OCD in family members, and family functioning showed no differences between severity groups.
   Significant differences on rituals between groups were found, since they were reported in 45% of the severe OCD group and in 4% of the mild/moderate OCD group (chi(2) = 14.9, df=1, p=0.001). Although the severe OCD group had shorter duration of illness, some symptoms were present for a longer time than in the mild/moderate OCD group: checking (12.6 +/- 3 vs. 2.4 +/- 4.3 months, t=3.58, df=58, p=0.001), repeating (8.3 +/- 12 vs. 3.4 +/- 5.1 months, t=2.1, df=58, p=0.03) and the inclusion of others in their rituals (20.34 +/- 1.7 vs. 2.6 +/- 4.4 months, t=2, df=58, p=0.049). Two patients of the mild/moderate OCD group and one of the severe OCD group were affected with schizophreniform disorder. Psychotic symptoms secondary to OCD were found only in the severe OCD group (45.5%).
   The main reason for attention seeking of the severe OCD group was the presence of obsessions and compulsions, and in the mild/moderate OCD group the presence of internalized disorders.
   Univariate analysis showed that counting compulsions (F=7.27, p=0.01) and rituals (F=17.24, p=0.000) were related to OCD severity. However, the linear regression model showed that only the presence of rituals predicted the severity of OCD (B=0.591, t=4.1, p<0.001).
   Discussion
   The studied sample represents 2.7% of the patients who were evaluated during a seven-month period at the HPIJNN, the inclusion of a screening instrument for OCD would be helpful for the identification of obsessions and compulsions in clinical samples of children and adolescents.
   The demographic characteristics of the present sample were similar to those reported in previous studies of pediatric OCD. The duration of illness reported by this sample suggests an age of onset around 10 years old; the frequency of obsessions and compulsions reported were also similar to those in other samples. In particular, compulsions without obsessions and the rituals involving others. Almost all the studied patients had comorbid disorders, which in many cases lead their attention seeking. It has been observed that subjects with Severe obsessions regarding contamination and aggression seek for help more frequently than patients with other symptoms.
   Rituals were more frequently seen in patients with severe OCD; these symptoms have been associated to alterations in executive functions and have been related with psychosocial dysfunction.
   Conclusions: Subjects of the mild/moderate OCD group sought attention mainly due to the symptoms of comorbid disorders. Subjects with severe OCD had a shorter duration of illness and more frequency of psychotic symptoms. In the present sample, rituals predicted the severity of OCD (B=0.591, t=4.1, p<0.001).

AB Objective: To examine whether depressed mood and anger mediate the effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on self-injurious behavior and substance use.
   Methods: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted including 9,085 16-19 year old students attending all high schools in Iceland in 2004. Participants reported frequency of sexual abuse, family conflict/violence, self-injurious behavior, substance use, depressed mood, and anger.
   Results: Sexual abuse and family conflict/violence had direct effects on self-injurious behavior and substance use among both genders, when controlling for age, family structure, parental education, anger, and depressed mood. More importantly, the indirect effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on self-injurious behavior among both males and females were twice as strong through depressed mood as through anger, while the indirect effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on substance use were only significant through anger.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that in cases of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence, substance use is similar to externalizing behavior, where anger seems to be a key mediating variable, opposed to internalizing behavior such as self-injurious behavior, where depressed mood is a more critical mediator.
   Practice implications: Practical implications highlight the importance of focusing on a range of emotions, including depressed mood and anger, when working with stressed adolescents in prevention and treatment programs for self-injurious behavior and substance use.

AB Cardiac activity has long been considered as a psychophysiological marker of adaptive psychological adjustment. Irregularities in autonomic nervous system activity have long been implicated in both externalizing and disinhibitory behaviors. The present study used a battery of assessments in children ages 4.5-5.5 years to examine the relation among disinhibitory measures. Additionally, cardiovascular activity and reactivity was examined. Mothers rated impulsivity and internalizing/externalizing behaviors. Reward-dominance and passive-avoidance response inhibition (i.e., via errors of commission) tasks were included. Results showed that behaviorally uninhibited children began with an attenuated sympathetic response (i.e., lengthened pre-ejection period) to an interview with a novel experimenter, while inhibited children began with a high level of sympathetic activity. Further, behavioral impulsivity was related to low sympathetic activity at rest. Consistent with theories of disinhibition, externalizing behaviors and measures of behavioral impulsivity were related to a reward-dominant response style. Findings are discussed with regard to motivational theories of behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study used the monozygotic (MZ) twin difference method to examine whether differences in friends' aggression increased the differences in MZ twins' aggression and depressive symptoms from kindergarten to Grade 1 and whether perceived victimization by the friend played a mediating role in this context. Participants were 223 MZ twin pairs. Results showed that differences in kindergarten friends' aggression significantly predicted an increased difference in MZ twins' aggression from kindergarten (mean age = 6.7 years) to Grade 1 (mean age = 7.5 years) for both boys and girls. Differences in perceived victimization by the friend mediated this association, albeit only in boys. Differences in perceived victimization by the friend also predicted an increase in MZ twins' differences in depressive symptoms. These results support the importance of friendship experiences during early childhood.

AB Sociological research focuses on how poverty, family, and neighborhood dynamics shape children's problems, but knowledge about how school is related to children's mental health is underdeveloped, despite its central presence in children's lives. Using a social structure and personality-stress contagion perspective, the authors use a nationally representative sample of first graders (N = 10,700) to assess how the classroom learning environment affects children's emotional and behavior problems. Children in more negative environments-such as classrooms with fewer material resources and whose teachers receive less respect from colleagues-have more learning, externalizing, interpersonal, and internalizing problems. Moreover, children in classrooms with low academic standards, excessive administrative paperwork, rowdy behavior, and low skill level of peers have more problems across one or more outcomes. Some school effects vary across race and ethnicity.

AB Students with limited English proficiency (LEP) make up one of the fastest growing segments of the student population; however, LEP status is often related to poor academic and behavioral outcomes. Teacher-reported behavioral rating scales can be informative measurements to screen and identify students at risk for behavioral and emotional problems. Given the focus on early identification and the changing demographics in schools, it is important to research the validity of screening instruments, as well as more comprehensive assessments, among LEP students. Items on a teacher-rated screener and a comprehensive behavioral rating scale were evaluated for invariance across two language groups. Results showed that the majority of items could be considered invariant across groups. This study also examined how behavioral ratings on invariant measures differed at the mean level between LEP and non-LEP students. LEP students were rated as having more learning problems and fewer adaptive skills; no significant differences were found for internalizing and externalizing problems. Results highlight the need for further research on this topic.

The authors of the study examined the associations of such generational gaps with adolescents' behavioral problems and whether youth's appreciation of Chinese parent adolescent relationships (parental devotion, sacrifice, thoughtfulness, and goon) described by the notion of gin would moderate the relationship between discrepancies and youth's adjustment. A total of 634 high school students (M = 15.97 years; 95 and 154 first- and second-generation Chinese American respectively, and 385 European Americans) completed measures of parental warmth, parent adolescent open communication, qin, and psychological adjustment. The U.S.-born Chinese American adolescents' ideals exceeded perceptions of parents' warmth and open communication to a greater degree than it did for European American adolescents (ps < 0.05). Such discrepancies in parental warmth were related to greater internalizing symptoms for second-generation Chinese American youth than for their European American peers. In addition, for second-generation Chinese, their perceptions of qin, particularly parents' devotion and sacrifice, had stronger moderating effects, diminishing the associations between generational cultural gaps and youth's behavioral problems compared with those of European American and first-generation Chinese youth. Parental thoughtfulness also played a similar beneficial role, but did so for all youth.

AB In this study, we examined concurrent and longitudinal relations among Navajo adolescents' ethnic identity, experiences of discrimination, and psychosocial outcomes (i.e.. self-esteem, substance use, and social functioning). At Time I, 137 Navajo adolescents (67 male, 70 female), primarily in Grades 9 and 10, completed a written survey assessing ethnic identity, discrimination experiences, and a range of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Two years later, 92 participants completed the same survey again. Ethnic and cultural identification was assessed via the Multiethnic Ethnic Identity Measure (MEN; Phinney, 1992) and the Orthogonal Cultural Identification Scale (OCIS; Oetting & Beauvais, 1990). At Time 1, MEIM Affirmation and Belonging, MEIM Exploration, and OCIS White American identification all demonstrated strong, positive associations with adaptive functioning for male and female adolescents, whereas discrimination experiences were linked to lower self-esteem and social functioning for male adolescents. By Time 2, fewer significant concurrent associations between ethnic identity and psychosocial functioning scores remained, and discrimination experiences emerged as the most consistent correlate of poorer psychosocial functioning for male adolescents. Controlling for Time 1 psychosocial functioning, relatively few direct effects of ethnic and cultural identification variables predicted psychosocial functioning longitudinally, but discrimination experiences demonstrated strong and consistent longitudinal links with boys' substance use. Finally, interaction effects assessing the moderating influence of ethnic and cultural identification on negative links between discrimination and psychosocial functioning suggested that embeddedness in and connection to Navajo culture and, in some cases, connection to White American culture, served as a buffer to the negative effects of discrimination experiences.

AB The current study investigated relations among ethnic similarity in caregiver-therapist pairs of youth participating in Multisystemic Therapy, therapist adherence, and youth long-term behavioral and criminal outcomes. Participants were 1,979 youth and families treated by 429 therapists across provider organizations in 45 sites. Relations were found, independently, and in the presence of ethnic similarity, between adherence and reductions in youth externalizing and internalizing behavior problems 1-year posttreatment and youth criminal charges 4 years posttreatment. Relations between ethnic similarity and outcomes were found only for reductions in youth externalizing behavior problems and not when adherence was included in the model. Adherence ratings were higher, however, in ethnically similar caregiver-therapist pairs, and evidence was found that this increased adherence predicted slightly better outcomes for youth. Implications for further research and clinical practice are considered.

AB Personality pathology is examined in 100 female in-patients diagnosed with eating disorders. The Eating Disorder Inventory-II and the NEO-PI-R were self-administered and personality pathology was assessed using a structured interview. Clinicians additionally evaluated patients' global functioning. The results indicated sizeable personality disorder comorbidity, and two dimensions of personality pathology, for example, an internalizing and an externalizing factor, could be identified. Patients' global functioning was primarily associated with dimensions of personality pathology, but not with eating disorder symptoms. Assessment and therapeutic interventions should focus on this co-occurring pathology in order to improve patients' functioning.

AB Trauma theory suggests that to recover from exposure to traumatic events, such as exposure to violence, therapeutic interventions should include opportunities to disclose and to process the fearful and stressful events. Yet little is known about the circumstances that foster disclosure of such information in therapeutic environments by children and related mental health outcomes for those children. In this study, the process of disclosure was examined among children ages 6 to 12 years (N = 121) in a community-based intervention program for children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). Therapists documented children's spontaneous disclosure in their group. Mothers and children completed demographic and standardized attitudinal and mental health questionnaires. Fifty-two percent of children spontaneously disclosed during therapy. Child ethnicity, harm to the child, internalizing behavioral adjustment problems, and engagement in therapy predicted disclosure. Disclosure within the group was associated with gains for individual children in internalizing behavioral adjustment problems and improvement in attitudes and beliefs concerning the acceptability of violence.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the direction and the etiology of the association between different parenting styles (parental emotional overinvolvement [EOI] and parental criticism) and internalizing behavior from adolescence to early adulthood. A longitudinal genetically informative cross-lagged design was applied to a population-based sample of Swedish twins contacted at age 16-17 (n = 2369) and at age 19-20 (n = 1705). Sex-limitation modelling revealed different effects for boys and girls. For girls, genetic influences on internalizing problems at age 16-17 independently explained 2.7% of the heritability in parental EOI at age 19-20. These results suggest that emotionally overinvolved and self-sacrificing parental behavior stems in part from daughters (but not sons) genetic predisposition for internalizing behavior. These findings highlight the importance of genetically influenced child-driven effects underlying the parenting-internalizing association, and clarify that the role of such effects may differ depending on sex, type of parenting and developmental period.

AB Aims
   To examine the structure of illicit opioid abuse and dependence within an opioid dependent sample and its relationship to other clinical variables.
   Design, setting and participants
   A cross-sectional study of 1511 opioid dependent individuals recruited through opioid pharmacotherapy clinics in the Sydney area, Australia.
   Measurements
   A face-to-face structured interview covering substance use and dependence, psychiatric history, child maltreatment, family background, adult violence and criminal history. Dimensional, latent class and factor mixture models were fit to the opioid abuse and dependence data. Classes were then compared on a range of demographic and clinical covariates.
   Findings
   A two-class, one-factor model provided the best fit of all the models tested. The two classes differed with respect to endorsement probabilities on a range of abuse and dependence criteria, and also with respect to the odds of other drug dependence diagnoses, antisocial personality disorder and non-fatal opioid overdose. Within-class severity was associated with similar variables: other drug dependence, borderline personality disorder and opioid overdose.
   Conclusion
   In an in-treatment, opioid-dependent sample, there appears to be two classes of individuals exhibiting distinct patterns of abuse and dependence criteria endorsement and to differ on externalizing but not internalizing disorders. This study provides preliminary evidence that the proposed DSM-V opioid use disorder distinction between moderate and severely dependent people is valid. Class one participants were not only more severely dependent, but had greater odds for opioid overdoses, other drug dependence and antisocial personality disorder.

AB Aims: This study explores whether associations between anxiety and alcohol and other substance use are already evident in middle adolescence, and whether general anxiety or symptoms of social phobia affect continuity of frequent alcohol use, frequent drunkenness and cannabis use. Methods: Data from the Adolescent Mental Health Cohort Study, a school-based Finnish survey among adolescents aged 15-16 years at baseline, was utilized to assess prevalence, incidence and continuity of symptoms of social phobia, general anxiety, frequent alcohol use, frequent drunkenness and cannabis use (which in this context was smoked 'hashish' of unknown constituency), and the associations between the substance use variables and the anxiety variables in 2-year follow-up. Results: Anxiety preceded substance use while no reciprocal associations were observed. Depression mediated the associations between anxiety and substance use. Symptoms of social phobia did not elevate the incidence of substance use, but general anxiety did. Frequent drunkenness was less significantly associated with anxiety than the other two substance use variables. Co-morbid general anxiety increased the persistence of frequent alcohol use while co-morbid social phobia decreased its persistence. Continuity of frequent drunkenness and cannabis use were unaffected by co-morbid anxiety. Conclusions: General anxiety in middle adolescence places adolescents at risk for concurrent and subsequent substance use. The risk may, however, be associated with co-morbid depression. Social phobia in middle adolescence may protect from substance use. Adolescents with internalizing symptoms may need guidance in coping with the symptoms even if the symptoms do not fulfil the criteria of mood or anxiety disorder.

AB Data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication were used to evaluate links between parental posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and elevated (1) offspring internalizing problems and (2) parental physical aggression toward children. We extended prior tests via the use of an independent nationally representative sample and by examining specific associations between these outcomes and PTSD above and beyond variance accounted for by several theoretically relevant demographic factors and PTSD-related comorbidity. As hypothesized, offspring anxiety and depression was elevated among parents with PTSD compared to those without the condition. Parents with PTSD also were more likely to endorse the use of both moderate (e.g., pushing) and severe (e.g., hitting with a fist) physical aggression with their children. These findings advance work in the area by suggesting that there is a unique relation between PTSD and these outcomes, which sets the stage for research to elucidate factors uniquely introduced by PTSD.

AB Cortisol levels were compared in children born preterm at extremely low gestational age (ELGA; 24-28 weeks), very low gestational age (VGLA; 29-32 weeks), and full-term in response to cognitive assessment at 18 months corrected age (CA). Further, we investigated the relationship between maternal interactive behaviors and child internalizing behaviors (rated by the mother) in relation to child cortisol levels. EGLA children had higher "pretest" cortisol levels and a different pattern of cortisol response to cognitive assessment compared to VGLA and full-terms. Higher cortisol levels in ELGA, but not full-term, children were associated with less optimal mother interactive behavior. Moreover, the pattern of cortisol change was related to internalizing behaviors among ELGA, and to a lesser degree VLGA children. In conclusion, our findings suggest altered programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in preterm children, as well as their greater sensitivity to environmental context such as maternal interactive behavior.

AB The association between alcohol use and internalizing symptoms during adolescence varies across studies, and the causes underlying this association remain unclear. The current study examines the relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression and intoxication frequency in a sample of Swedish twins assessed longitudinally from ages 13-14 to 19-20. The objectives of the study were to assess the stability of genetic and environmental influences on each trait across adolescence; to investigate whether these traits share genetic and/or environmental liabilities; and to explore quantitative changes in the shared liability over time. We found that the magnitude of genetic influences on internalizing symptoms remained relatively stable across adolescence, while their impact on intoxication frequency was dynamic. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were influenced by unique environmental factors, while both shared and unique environmental factors influenced intoxication frequency. Genetic and environmental innovation and attenuation were observed for both traits. While no significant genetic correlation was observed between traits, unique environmental factors did contribute to a shared liability. This environmental correlation was positive and moderate (r(E) = 0.41) in the early assessment, but decreased and changed direction at later waves (r(E) = -.04 to -.01). The genetic and environmental factors underlying internalizing symptoms and intoxication frequency appear to be developmentally dynamic. Early environmental factors contribute to the association between these traits, but this shared liability diminishes across adolescence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined family and neighborhood influences relevant to low-income status to determine how they combine to predict the parenting behaviors of Mexican-American mothers and fathers. The study also examined the role of parenting as a mediator of these contextual influences on adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Study hypotheses were examined in a diverse sample of Mexican-American families in which 750 mothers and 467 fathers reported on their own levels of parental warmth and harsh parenting. Family economic hardship, neighborhood familism values, and neighborhood risk indicators were all uniquely associated with maternal and paternal warmth, and maternal warmth mediated the effects of these contextual influences on adolescent externalizing symptoms in prospective analyses. Parents' subjective perceptions of neighborhood danger interacted with objective indicators of neighborhood disadvantage to influence maternal and paternal warmth. Neighborhood familism values had unique direct effects on adolescent externalizing symptoms in prospective analyses, after accounting for all other context and parenting effects.

AB Although the association between maternal depression and adverse child outcomes is well established, the strength of the association, the breadth or specificity of the outcomes, and the role of moderators are not known. This information is essential to inform not only models of risk but also the design of preventive interventions by helping to identify subgroups at greater risk than others and to elucidate potential mechanisms as targets of interventions. A meta-analysis of 193 studies was conducted to examine the strength of the association between mothers' depression and children's behavioral problems or emotional functioning. Maternal depression was significantly related to higher levels of internalizing, externalizing, and general psychopathology and negative affect/behavior and to lower levels of positive affect/behavior, with all associations small in magnitude. These associations were significantly moderated by theoretically and methodologically relevant variables, with patterns of moderation found to vary somewhat with each child outcome. Results are interpreted in terms of implications for theoretical models that move beyond main effects models in order to more accurately identify which children of depressed mothers are more or less at risk for specific outcomes.

AB Childhood-onset epilepsy is associated with psychiatric and cognitive difficulties and with poor social outcomes in adulthood. In a prospective cohort of young people with epilepsy, we studied psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy-related characteristics, all factors that may influence long-term social outcomes. Five hundred one subjects, 159 with complicated (IQ < 80 or brain lesion) and 342 with uncomplicated epilepsy, were included. Psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were more common in complicated epilepsy (P < 0.005). In uncomplicated epilepsy, externalizing but not internalizing disorders were strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Internalizing disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were associated with lack of 5-year remission. Type of epilepsy was not associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or psychiatric disorders. Various comorbid conditions in epilepsy cluster together and are modestly associated with imperfect seizure control. These need to be considered together in evaluating and managing young people with epilepsy and may help explain long-term social outcomes above and beyond poor seizure control. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of oral medication adherence and perceived adherence barriers with disease severity in a sample of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   Methods Participants included 62 adolescents, aged 13-17 years, diagnosed with IBD, and their parents. Data on the measures of parent-rated and patient-rated oral medication adherence and related barriers, behavioral and emotional functioning per parent report and self-report, and disease severity per medical chart reported by a physician were obtained.
   Results Fifteen percent of the sample reported clinically elevated depressive symptoms and 24% reported clinically elevated internalizing behavioral problems. Number of reported adherence barriers was 2.6 +/- 1.5, and none of the participants reported zero barriers. Parental ratings of medication adherence (t = -2.11, P < 0.05) and perceived barriers to adherence (t = 2.05, P < 0.05) significantly predicted disease severity after statistically controlling for the contributions of behavioral and disease parameters to disease severity.
   Conclusion Results suggest that the oral medication adherence and perceived adherence barriers are significantly related to disease severity in adolescents with IBD. These patients also may be at risk for increased behavioral and emotional problems, which may impact health outcomes as well. Clinicians should make particular efforts to attend to medication adherence issues with their patients. Working with patients and families to develop solutions for eliminating adherence barriers might result in better disease outcomes.

AB Purpose: This study examines the association between childhood maltreatment and adolescent smoking and the extent to which internalizing behavioral problems mediate this hypothesized link.
   Methods: Data from 522 youth at ages 12, 14, and 16 and from their caregivers were obtained as part of a prospective, longitudinal study of child abuse and neglect (LONGSCAN). Official Child Protective Services (CPS) reports of maltreatment and self-reported abusive experiences of children aged 12 were obtained for this study. Internalizing behavioral problems were reported by caregivers for the adolescents at age 14. Cigarette use was self-reported by adolescents at age 16.
   Results: A significantly higher proportion of maltreated youth (19%) reported having smoked in the last 30 days compared with nonmaltreated youth (7%). A history of childhood maltreatment predicted smoking at the age of 16. Maltreatment history was associated with internalizing problems at the age of 14, and internalizing problems were associated with smoking. Finally, internalizing behaviors partially mediated the link between childhood maltreatment by the age of 12 years and adolescent smoking at 16.
   Conclusions: Internalizing problems are one mediating pathway by which adolescents with a history of childhood maltreatment may initiate smoking behavior during mid-adolescence. Given the elevated rate of smoking among maltreated adolescents, it is important to identify potential pathways to better guide prevention strategies. These finding suggest that youth with a history of maltreatment should be identified as a high-risk group, and that efforts to identify and address internalizing problems in this population may be an important area of intervention to reduce smoking among adolescents.

AB Background:
   Early adolescence is a critical time for the development of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. We aimed to investigate whether pituitary volume, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, represents a vulnerability factor for the emergence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms during adolescence using a prospective, longitudinal design.
   Methods:
   One hundred and fifty-five adolescents completed 3T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), symptom rating scales and a diagnostic interview during early adolescence (M age 12.6 years, SD .5 years); symptom rating scales were re-administered approximately three years later (M age 15.2 years). The volume of the pituitary gland was estimated by manually delineating its structure on MR images. The degree to which pituitary volumes prospectively predicted change in internalizing and externalizing symptoms across the two time-points was assessed using hierarchal linear regression, after controlling for the influence of gender, age, pubertal stage and intracranial volume.
   Results:
   Larger pituitary volumes prospectively predicted an increase in internalizing, but not externalizing, symptoms from early adolescence to mid-adolescence.
   Conclusions:
   This study provides the first evidence that increased pituitary volume might represent a specific vulnerability marker for the development of internalizing symptoms during early to mid-adolescence.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the relative contributions of both parental and adolescent functioning to family functioning in adolescent patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their families. Participants were 45 adolescents (27 male, 18 female) 13-17 years old (M = 15.41 years, SD = 1.32) with IBD and their parents. Families completed measures of patient behavioral functioning and depression, parent distress and family functioning. Disease severity assessments were completed via data provided by patients' gastroenterologists. Results indicated that parent-reported patient behavioral problems accounted for a significant 26% of variance in family functioning. Post-hoc analysis revealed that externalizing behavior problems accounted for the majority of this variance compared to internalizing behavior problems. These results suggest that externalizing problems may have a more significant impact on these families than previous research indicates. Moreover, externalizing behaviors may significantly impact family adaptation and should be taken into consideration during routine clinical care. Further research is needed to replicate and expand upon these findings.

AB Building on an existing latent variable analysis of executive function (EF) in children (N = 191, 57% boys and 43% girls) making the transition to school (Hughes et al. (2010), Developmental Neuropsychology, vol. 35, pp. 20-36), the current study both documented average developmental improvements from 4 to 6 years of age and examined individual differences in EF growth in relation to latent factors for two sets of child outcome measures at 6 years: (a) first-grade teachers' ratings of emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, and conduct/peer problems and (b) children's self-perceived academic and social competencies. With effects of concurrent verbal ability and EF controlled, variation in EF slopes across the transition to school predicted variation in latent constructs for (a) all four problem behavior subscales and (b) children's self-reported academic (but not social) competence. These findings underscore the clinical and educational significance of early individual differences in EF and highlight the value of adopting a developmental perspective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Despite the importance of understanding the long-term outcome for children of alcohol dependent (AD) women, the available literature is largely based on offspring of AD fathers and few have utilized prospective designs that include child, adolescent and young adult assessments. Multiplex AD families in which multiple cases of AD are present provide an ideal setting for understanding developmental variants of the adult phenotype.
   Method: Offspring from multiplex AD families identified through the mother or control families were evaluated multiple times during childhood and followed to young adulthood. Familial risk status and the presence of specific child/adolescent disorders were used as predictors of substance use disorder outcome by young adulthood.
   Results: Offspring who were members of maternal multiplex families had elevated rates of child and young adulthood disorders. High risk offspring of alcohol dependent women were at increased risk for externalizing (Conduct Disorder and ADHD) and internalizing disorders (Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Anxiety Disorders). By young adulthood, offspring from these multiplex families had significantly greater odds of developing alcohol abuse or dependence (odds ratio [OR] = 3.63 [CI 1.36-9.641) and drug abuse or dependence (OR = 4.23 [CI 1.73-10.32]). The prospective design of the study revealed that specific childhood disorders (Conduct Disorder, ADHD, MOD) increased the odds of subsequent development of substance use disorder (SLID).
   Conclusions: Multiplex familial risk for alcohol dependence is a significant predictor of substance use disorders by young adulthood. Familial risk and an earlier childhood disorder may set the stage for later development of SLID. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prior reviews have examined how stress, broadly defined, interacts with genetic diathesis in the pathogenesis of internalizing (i.e., depressive and anxiety) disorders. Recent findings have suggested a unique role for early life stress (ELS) in the development of internalizing disorders, contributing to the rapid proliferation of research in this area.
   This paper critically reviews studies in humans examining gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects of ELS on the risk for depression and anxiety, primarily from a candidate gene perspective. Major methodological challenges that are unique to such studies are considered.
   The majority of published studies have focused on candidates that regulate the serotonin system, especially the serotonin transporter. More recent work has addressed interactions of ELS with candidates from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurotrophin system. Available studies vary greatly with respect to definitions of ELS, examination of gene-gene interactions, consideration of gender effects, and attention to analytic limitations.
   Overall, there is support for GxE effects of ELS on the risk for depressive and anxiety outcomes. Future studies of ELS in this context will require careful attention to methodologic considerations. Such studies would benefit from more systematic assessment of positive environmental factors (e.g., social support) and greater utilization of developmentally sensitive paradigms.

AB Early parental loss has been associated with neuroendocrine dysregulation in youth; however, the form of cortisol dysregulation varies widely. Identifying risk and protective factors that influence physiological regulation has important implications for understanding the development of mental health problems in parentally bereaved youth.
   The current study investigated the prospective effects of positive parenting on the relation between recent negative life events and cortisol activity in adolescents/young adults several years after bereavement.
   Positive parenting was assessed an average of 18.5 months following parental death. Six years later, adolescents/young adults (N = 55) reported on exposure to recent negative life events, and salivary cortisol was assessed before and after a conflict discussion task with their caregiver. The interaction between positive parenting and exposure to recent negative events was used to predict total cortisol output and response to the task.
   Multilevel modeling and the probing of the interaction effect demonstrated that total cortisol output increased with greater exposure to recent negative events among those with lower levels of past positive parenting. These relations were significant over and above current internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   The current results highlight the need to consider the interactive influence of proximal and distal factors on neuroendocrine functioning for youth exposed to early parental loss.

AB Objective: Sleep disordered breathing (SOB) is common in children and ranges in severity from primary snoring (PS), to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). This study investigated everyday function (behavior, attention, executive skills) in children with varying degrees of SOB and control children with no history of SOB recruited from the community.
   Methods: One hundred thirty-six children aged 7-12 were studied. Routine overnight polysomnography (PSG) classified children into 4 groups: PS (n = 59), mild OSAS (n = 24), moderate/severe OSAS (n = 18), and controls (n = 35). Behavioral function and behavioral aspects of attention and executive function were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).
   Results: Children with all seventies of SDB had significantly higher rates of total, internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems compared to control children. increased rates of behavioral executive dysfunction were also found across the SOB spectrum.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that behavioral, attention, and executive function difficulties are present in children with PS as well as OSAS. These results have implications for the treatment of milder forms of SOB, particularly PS, which is commonly viewed as benign. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE To assess children with retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria (CM) for neurocognitive sequelae.
   METHODS Participants were selected from an ongoing exposure control study. Eighty-three Malawian children averaging 4.4 years of age and diagnosed with retinopathy-positive CM were compared to 95 controls. Each child was classified as delayed or not using age-based norms for the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) for developmental delay on the total scale and for the domains of gross motor, fine motor, language and social skills. Groups were also compared on the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (1.5-5 years).
   RESULTS Children with retinopathy-positive CM were delayed, relative to the comparison group, on MDAT total development (P = 0.028; odds ratio or OR = 2.13), with the greatest effects on language development (P = 0.003; OR = 4.93). The two groups did not differ significantly on the Achenbach CBCL internalizing and externalizing symptoms total scores. Stepwise regression demonstrated that coma duration, seizures while in hospital, platelet count and lactate level on admission were predictive of assessment outcomes for the children with retinopathy-positive CM.
   CONCLUSIONS Children who suffer retinopathy-positive CM at preschool age are at greater risk of developmental delay, particularly with respect to language development. This confirms previous retrospective study findings with school-age children evaluated years after acute illness. The MDAT and the Achenbach CBCL proved sensitive to clinical indicators of severity of malarial illness.

AB This study examined the psychosocial histories of 134 male, juvenile offenders, focusing on race and the probability of being diagnosed with internalizing and/or externalizing psychological disorders at the time of their sentencing to a correctional institution for committing serious and violent crimes as minors. In addition, based on case file information, the author investigated offenders' histories with child maltreatment, court-ordered probation, and counseling services received as part of the child welfare and/or juvenile justice system. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated the probability for White youth to be diagnosed with internalizing disorders was over 19 times that of Black youth; however, rates of externalizing disorders were similar across groups. Although maltreatment histories were comparable based on race, White youth received more counseling services, were significantly older at the time of diagnosis, and were more likely to be diagnosed with internalizing and comorbid disorders. Issues regarding multicultural assessment in the child welfare and juvenile justice system are discussed, specifically highlighting the potential for attributional bias in the diagnostic and treatment recommendation process.

AB Objectives. To examine whether enculturation factors, like cultural activities, ethnic pride and native language competence, are related to decreased internalizing and externalizing symptoms in Indigenous Sami youth from Arctic Norway. The impact of self-efficacy on the relationship between enculturation factors and mental health problems was also examined.
   Study design. Population-based, cross-sectional questionnaire study.
   Methods. The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study was conducted among 10th graders in junior high schools in north Norway during 2003-2005. The study sample consisted of 450 Indigenous Sami youth, aged 15-16 years. Internalizing symptoms were measured with the Hopkins Symptom Check List-10 (HSCL-10), while externalizing symptoms were measured by two subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Results. For boys, self-efficacy and participation in cultural activities were associated with decreased internalizing symptoms. Additionally, self-efficacy interacted with Sami language competence and cultural activities: when self-efficacy increased, these enculturation factors were related to symptom reduction. For girls, self-efficacy had an independent effect on internalizing symptoms and also strengthened the relationship between participation in cultural activities and reduced externalizing symptoms. Sami language competence was related to the reduction of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in girls.
   Conclusions. In the present study, several enculturation factors as well as self-efficacy were identified as potential protective factors against mental health problems. In order to develop theoretical models that explain the mechanisms between cultural resilience and mental health, there is a need for both qualitative studies and longitudinal studies.

AB The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-Parent Version (RCADS-P) is a parent-report questionnaire of youth anxiety and depression with scales corresponding to the DSM diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The RCADS-P was recently developed and has previously demonstrated strong psychometric properties in a clinic-referred sample (Ebesutani et al., Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology 38, 249-260, 2010b). The present study examined the psychometric properties of the RCADS-P in a school-based population. As completed by parents of 967 children and adolescents, the RCADS-P demonstrated high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and good convergent/divergent validity, supporting the RCADS-P as a measure of internalizing problems specific to depression and five anxiety disorders in school samples. Normative data are also reported to allow for the derivation of T-scores to enhance clinicians' ability to make classification decisions using RCADS-P subscale scores.

The data used was the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study. While no association could be established for men, results indicated that women who held low peer status positions in childhood were at a considerably higher risk of anxiety and/or depression later in life compared to women in average status positions. Women who held popular positions during childhood did not differ significantly from their average counterparts. These findings persisted after adjusting for family- and child-related problem-load, perceived security at school, family constellation, socioeconomic status as well as the child's cognitive ability, ninth grade school marks and continuance to upper secondary school.

AB Links between political violence and children's adjustment problems are well-documented. However, the mechanisms by which political tension and sectarian violence relate to children's well-being and development are little understood. This study longitudinally examined children's emotional security about community violence as a possible regulatory process in relations between community discord and children's adjustment problems. Families were selected from 18 working class neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Participants (695 mothers and children, M=12.17, SD=1.82) were interviewed in their homes over three consecutive years. Findings supported the notion that politically-motivated community violence has distinctive effects on children's externalizing and internalizing problems through the mechanism of increasing children's emotional insecurity about community. Implications are considered for understanding relations between political violence and child adjustment from a social ecological perspective.

AB This research explored and compared patterns of adjustment in siblings exposed to intimate partner violence. The quality of family relationships were investigated as potential mechanisms that accounted for heterogeneity in these patterns. Participants included 47 sibling pairs and their mothers recruited from the community. Mothers and children reported on child adjustment measures and the quality of family relationships. Five cluster patterns were identified for both younger and older siblings, replicating three identified in previous research: primarily internalizing symptoms, a combination of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and an asymptomatic cluster. There was little overlap in cluster membership within families; most siblings differed in terms of their pattern of adjustment. The quality of family relationships varied significantly across clusters. Overall, asymptomatic siblings reported the most positive family relationships. Maternal warmth differed across clusters for both older and younger siblings, while maternal hostility varied across clusters for older but not younger siblings. The quality of sibling relationships also differed across clusters for older but not younger siblings. These findings underscore the importance of examining differential sibling experiences within violent families, and demonstrate the significance of family relationships as a mediating mechanism influencing heterogeneous child adjustment.

AB Adolescent mothers and their children are particularly susceptible to witnessing or directly experiencing violence. Such violence exposure predicts maternal distress, parenting, and child behavior problems. The current study examined how mothers' depressive symptoms, aggression, harsh disciplinary practices, and home environment independently explain the association between mothers' violence exposure and children's externalizing and internalizing behavior, controlling for their children's violence exposure. Data were collected from 230 African American mothers living in Washington, DC who gave birth as adolescents and whose children were 3 to 5 years old. Path analysis revealed that the effect of mothers' experienced violence on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior was mediated by mothers' depressive symptoms and aggression. However, neither harsh discipline nor stimulation in the home environment acted as significant mediators, and there were no direct or indirect effects of mothers' witnessed violence on child behavior. This study builds on previous work by identifying an association between maternal violence exposure and children's behavior, independent of children's own violence exposure that is explained by mothers' increased distress but not their parenting. These findings suggest that a potential means of preventing behavior problems in minority children born to adolescent mothers is to identify mothers who have been directly exposed to violence and treat their depressive symptoms and aggressive behaviors.

AB In previous longitudinal studies in the US, lower socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with more emotional and behavioral problems. It remains unclear whether these findings can be generalized outside the US, as different countries vary in their health care systems and prevention of psychopathology in youth. Therefore, we studied the same associations in a comparable sample in The Netherlands and directly tested for differences between the US and The Netherlands.
   The US (N = 833) and Dutch (N = 708) population samples were followed-up for 9 years. Age at baseline ranged from 8 to 16 years. Parents filled out behavior checklists.
   Analyses revealed very few differences between the two countries. In both countries, SES predicted syndrome scores and cumulative prevalence rates for internalizing and externalizing problems (withdrawn and aggressive behavior) and for thought and attention Problems. The SES gradient in syndrome scores was stable over time. Only for withdrawn behavior, the gradient was larger in young adulthood.
   Although the health care systems differ between the US and The Netherlands, the socioeconomic disparities in emotional and behavioral problems were similar.

AB Research has traditionally focused on the role of genetic and environmental variables in the development and maintenance of childhood internalizing disorders. Temperament variables, such as negative affect and effortful control have gained considerable interest within the field of developmental psychopathology. Environmental factors such as mother-child interactions and family cohesion have also been linked with internalizing disorders. The current study examines the relationship between child negative affect, effortful control, maternal negative affect, family functioning, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of preschool-aged children using a path analysis approach. Sixty-five children, aged 3-5 years and their mothers completed measures on child temperament, family environment, maternal personality, and child internalizing symptoms. Results support a complex model for the influence of both direct and indirect factors on internalizing symptoms in preschool-aged children.

AB Growing evidence supports the biological sensitivity to context theory, which posits that physiologically reactive children, as indexed by autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to laboratory stressors, are more susceptible to both negative and positive environmental influences than their low reactive peers. High biological sensitivity is a risk factor for behavioral and health problems in the context of high adversity, whereas in contexts of low adversity it has been found to promote positive adaptation. However, several studies have shown the opposite effect, finding that children who exhibited high ANS reactivity in response to interpersonal stressors were buffered from the deleterious effects of marital conflict, whereas children who showed low ANS reactivity were more vulnerable to high levels of marital conflict. Using an ethnically diverse sample of 260 kindergartners (130 girls, 130 boys), the current study investigated whether the interaction effect of marital conflict and the two branches of ANS reactivity on children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms differs with the nature of the laboratory challenge task used to measure children's stress response. As hypothesized, results indicate that the interaction between ANS reactivity and marital conflict significantly predicted children's behavior problems, but the direction of the effect varied with the nature of the challenge task (i.e., interpersonal or cognitive). This study illustrates the importance of considering the effect of laboratory stimuli when assessing whether children's ANS reactivity moderates the effects of adversity exposure on adaptation.

AB The efficacy of a short-term attachment-based intervention for changing risk outcomes for children of maltreating families was examined using a randomized control trial. Sixty-seven primary caregivers reported for maltreatment and their children (1-5 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received 8 weekly home visits directed at the caregiver child dyad and focused on improving caregiver sensitivity. Intervention sessions included brief discussions of attachment-emotion regulation-related themes and video feedback of parent child interaction. Comparison of pre- and posttest scores revealed significant improvements for the intervention group in parental sensitivity and child attachment security, and a reduction in child disorganization. Older children in the intervention group also showed lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problems following intervention. This is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of short-term attachment-based intervention in enhancing parental sensitivity, improving child security, and reducing disorganization for children in the early childhood period.

AB This study examined the school adjustment of adolescents with disabilities and their nondisabled peers in a national sample of rural high school students. The total sample consisted of 7,376 students: 6,704 nondisabled students, 70 students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), 512 students with learning disabilities (LD), and 90 students identified as English language learners (ELL). Teacher ratings on the Interpersonal Competence Scale-Teacher (ICS-T) were used to assess students' adjustment on seven factors: academic, affiliative, aggressive, internalizing, popular, Olympian, and shy. Cluster analyses were used to identify distinct configurations of competence and risk separately for boys and girls. Differences between educational classifications were identified for the ICS-T factors and for the interpersonal competence configurations. Students with EBD were overrepresented in Multi-risk configurations (aggressive high-risk profiles), students with LD were overrepresented in both the Multi-risk and Disengaged (non-aggressive high-risk profiles) configurations, and students identified as ELL were overrepresented in Disengaged configurations.

AB CASE: Lucy is a 12-year-old Latina whose mother brought her to the pediatric clinic for help with her anxiety symptoms, "hearing voices," and episodes of "spacing out." Lucy did not cry at birth secondary to vocal cord paralysis and still has the tracheostomy performed at a few days of life. In addition to her neonatal intensive care unit stay, she has been hospitalized for pneumonia. Her mother says she is "sickly" and has a weak immune system due to her asthma symptoms. Lucy also experiences somatic complaints related to gastroesophageal reflux and constipation.
   Lucy is described as being "in another world" and must be called several times before she responds. Lucy states she is nervous "all the time" and often experiences a fast heartbeat, chest pain, and headache. Her attention and internalizing problems began at age 4 years and have worsened since she entered adolescence. When she is alone in the dark, she sees an unknown person and becomes frightened. She hears the voice of her paternal uncle telling her something will harm her mother and runs crying to "check" on her. Lucy also says she hears voices of paternal family members fighting. She has dreamed that her paternal uncle stabbed her in an alley. Lucy reports experiencing sadness and feelings of wanting to die. She has not tried to harm herself and has no plan to do this. She states that she does not know when she is awake or asleep and "hate people talking in my head." She does not report drug use.
   Lucy's family is bilingual, English and Spanish. Her mother works part-time as a nutritionist, and her father is a machinist. Her father receives counseling for anger management, and there have been previous unsubstantiated child abuse reports involving Lucy and her younger brother. The maternal uncle has been involved in a gang and attempts to phone Lucy's mother, who does not wish to have contact with him. Lucy's mother expresses strong Christian religious and spiritual beliefs, including demons and spirits that may enter her home and can be cast off with prayer. Recently, the family purchased a "cuadro" ( picture) at a yard sale, and Lucy's mother said this resulted in footprints in the bathroom that are disappearing with prayer, guidance from the church minister, and discarding of the "cuadro."
   The primary pediatrician ordered a home school program, given Lucy's frequent illnesses. She is progressing well with a special education teacher. Her recent psychological evaluation at school showed a below average nonverbal intelligence quotient, with strengths in the areas of perceptual, logical, and abstract relationships. Lucy's mother in the past has been hesitant to follow through with psychiatric evaluation because "it is up to God."
   In the clinic, she is pale and slender with an ethereal look. She is awake and alert with appropriate affect and mentation. Her tracheostomy is intact without any respiratory distress noted. There are no signs of drug use or active hallucinations. You are left wondering whether these voices need psychiatric management.

In addition, the relationship between the relative change in psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral functioning as measured by CAFAS (Hodges, 1989, 1994, 2000) and PECFAS (1994, 2000) scores and the children's age, gender, ethnicity, current living arrangement, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and severity of impairment at intake were evaluated. Fifty-three children received CPSR for a minimum of six months from a for-profit outpatient child and adolescent mental health clinic located in southwestern Idaho. Significant improvement in the children's overall functioning was found after six months of treatment. Middle or high school age children demonstrated significantly more impairment at intake compared with their younger counterparts. No significant differences in overall functioning were revealed considering the characteristic of gender, living arrangement and clinical profiles at intake. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background. The aim of this study was to quantify behavioral problems in clinically treated children and adolescents with asthma and to examine the association of these problems and quality of life with difficult-to-treat asthma. Methods. Clinical patients with difficult-to-treat asthma (n = 31) and patients with asthma who were not classified as difficult-to-treat asthma ( n = 52) completed the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [ PAQLQ(S)]. Their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess behavioral problems. Behavioral problem scores were compared to norms of population reference groups and both behavioral problems and quality of life were compared between children and adolescents with and without difficult-to-treat asthma. Results. Especially internalizing behavioral problems such as being withdrawn/depressed and somatic complaints were more severe in the asthmatic groups compared to the healthy reference groups. The behavioral problems 'somatic complaints' and 'thought problems' as well as a lower quality of life were more severe in children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat asthma than in asthma patients who did not fulfill the criteria of difficult-to-treat asthma. Conclusions. Behavioral problems and a lower quality of life are suggested to be more pronounced in clinically treated children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat asthma than in asthma patients who are not classified as difficult-to-treat asthma. With respect to practical implications, our data suggest that health-care professionals should - especially in children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat asthma - assess and, if necessary, treat behavioral problems.

AB Since its initial formulation, the biosocial theory of borderline personality disorder (BPD) still lacks robust empirical evidence, given there are no prospective longitudinal studies testing the main assumptions of the model. The current study examined longitudinally whether temperamental traits harm avoidance (HA) and novelty seeking (NS), internalizing and externalizing disorders, trauma and perceived invalidating parenting style, as measured during adolescence, contributed to the risk of BPD, diagnosed on the basis of standardized clinical interviews 5 years later. Individuals with BPD (n = 17) from a community sample of 416 young adults were compared to individuals with depressive disorders (n = 17) and psychiatrically healthy subjects (n = 34). Results indicated that adolescent internalizing disorders as well as the interaction of HA and perceived maternal overprotection predicted the risk of BPD 5 years later. NS was not shown to be a predisposing vulnerability. Results are interpreted as confirmation of the biosocial model. Gender-specific etiological differences are discussed.

The study took a sample of foster parents and their foster children (n = 60), who were aged 11-17 years, and analysed the severity of problem behaviour displayed by the foster children within 3 months of placement in the foster family and a year and a half later. The level of agreement was established with the intra-class correlation coefficient, which represents both the differences in scores and the differences in ranking. This coefficient shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the level of agreement on the Internalizing Problems scale of the Child Behaviour Checklist between the placements that broke down and those that continued. The level of agreement is associated with the severity score, which in turn is associated with the outcome of the foster care placement. To avoid placement breakdown, problem behaviour should also be assessed from the perspective of the foster child.

AB A non-experimental pilot study examined child, mother and family outcomes of a 10-session multi-family group intervention designed to reduce risk and promote resilience for mothers with depression and their families. Positive changes following the Keeping Families Strong intervention included mother-reported decreases in child behaviour and emotional problems, improvements in the quality of family interactions and routines and improvements in their own well-being and support from others. Children (9-16 years) reported decreased internalizing symptoms, improved coping, increased maternal warmth and acceptance and decreased stressful family events. Attendance and mother-reported satisfaction were high, indicating the perceived value of the intervention.

AB This article uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Survey (N = 2,427) to examine the association between the chronicity and timing of maternal depression and child well-being. Maternal depression, particularly chronic depression, is linked to internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in children, and children have worse behaviors when mothers report proximate depression. Children of depressed and nondepressed mothers have similar cognitive outcomes. Results also suggest that boys are more vulnerable to maternal depression than girls and that socioeconomic advantage does not buffer children from the consequences of maternal depression. Given that impairments in early childhood may place children on disadvantaged life-course trajectories, early intervention and treatment of depressed mothers may help ameliorate social disparities.

AB This study investigated differences in parent and child estimates of the child's exposure to violence. Using data (N = 1, 517) from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, analyses related differences between parent and child reports of the child's exposure to violence to the child's psychosocial functioning. Most parents (66%) underestimated their children's exposure to violence. Further, parental underestimation was associated with the child's internalizing and externalizing problems and delinquent behaviors but parental overestimation was not. Family support partially mediated these associations. Parental underestimation of the child's exposure to violence, therefore, reflected lower levels of family support, which in turn led to more internalizing and externalizing problems and delinquency for the child.

AB The psychometric properties of a Portuguese version of the Adolescent Psychopathology Scale-Short Form (APS-SF) were studied in a sample of 656 Portuguese adolescents, aged 12 to 19 years, assessed in school context. Also, the aim of the study was to gather data concerning age- and gender-related differences in the expression of psychopathological problems assessed by the APS-SF. Results of the reliability of APS-SF scales are compared with those obtained by Reynolds in the validation studies with the American sample. Factor analysis reproduced the bidimensionality of the original validation studies of the scale. These findings seem to support the use of the APS-SF as a valuable tool for early identification of psychosocial problems in the school context in Portuguese adolescents. Results concerning age- and gender-related differences in the expression of psychopathological problems in the adolescents are discussed.

AB Mexican-origin adolescent mothers are at increased risk for poor psychosocial functioning as a result of various stressors with which they must contend; however, existing theory suggests that cultural strengths may help mitigate the negative effects of stress. As such, the current study examined the associations between cultural and economic stressors and Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' (N = 207; M age = 16.23 years, SD = 1.0) internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as the degree to which ethnic identity affirmation and familism values moderated these links. Adolescent mothers who reported higher levels of discrimination, acculturative stress, and economic stress also reported higher depressive symptoms and greater involvement in risky behaviors. Importantly, ethnic identity affirmation minimized the negative associations between cultural stressors and adolescents' involvement in risky behaviors, with the associations being weakest among adolescents with high levels of ethnic identity. Familism appeared to serve a protective function under conditions of low levels of discrimination, but not under conditions of high levels of discrimination. Findings are discussed with special attention to the developmental and cultural contexts in which these adolescent mothers' lives are embedded, and implications for future research and practice are presented.

AB Aim: To examine the association of the severity of congenital heart defects (CHDs) with internalizing problems in 18-month-olds and to explore the extent to which the internalizing problems are influenced by maternal distress and emotional reactivity in the child at age 6 months.
   Methods: We linked prospective data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, with a nationwide CHD registry and identified 198 18-month-olds with CHDs in a cohort of 47 692 toddlers. Maternal reports on the children's emotional reactivity at age 6 months, the children's internalizing problems (anxiety, sleep problems, emotional reactivity) at age 18 months and maternal distress were assessed by questionnaires.
   Results: We found an association at age 18 months between the severity of the CHD and anxiety but not sleep problems or emotional reactivity. Children with severe but not with mild or moderate CHDs were twice as likely to experience the symptoms of anxiety compared with controls. These symptoms are not merely sequelae of earlier psychological reactions or concurrent maternal distress.
   Conclusion: Should these findings be replicated, future studies ought to investigate the mechanisms leading to elevated anxiety in toddlers with CHDs. In addition, clinical interventions should address the child's anxiety as well as the interaction between the parents and the child.

There were two main findings. First, high-quality teacher-child relationships predicted low levels of externalizing behaviors. Second, high-quality relationships acted as protective factors, helping to prevent children with high levels of internalizing behaviors in early childhood from developing trajectories of long-term internalizing behavior problems. Teacher-child relationships may be proximal phenomena that can be targeted in interventions to help prevent behavior problems in middle childhood.

AB Migraine in childhood and adolescence has been associated with the presence of behavioural and emotional difficulties, but only few data are available with respect to unusual types of headache syndromes such as Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood (BPVC). Aim of the present study was to evaluate the behavioural and emotional profiles of clinically referred children and adolescents suffering from BPVC and migraine, as compared to normal controls. According to the revised International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) the BPVC belongs to the category of "primary headache", as a migraine equivalent, in a subset that is called "periodic syndromes of childhood". A total of 60 clinically referred children and adolescents (4-15 years) 21 suffering from BPVC and 20 from migraine, according to the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD-2, and 19 normal control (NC) were recruited in this study. Psychological assessment were performed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). Although most of the patients suffering from headache had scores within the normative non-pathological range, both BPVC and migraine patients had significantly higher CBCL total, internalizing, and externalizing scores, as compared to NC. Furthermore, both BPVC and migraine groups displayed significantly higher CDI and MASC scores than NC group. No differences were found between the two types of headache. In conclusion, clinically referred children and adolescents with BPVC and migraine showed higher indices of behavioural and emotional symptoms, both internalizing and externalizing, as compared to normal peers.

AB This review examines the empirical literature on the relationship between internalizing disorders and substance use disorders (SUDs) in youth in terms of (a) comorbidity rates. (b) risk relationships, (c) temporal sequencing, and (d) implications for intervention. Findings from community and clinical samples suggest that comorbidity rates range from 9.0 to 47.9%. The majority of the evidence supports the temporal precedence of internalizing disorders before substance use disorders and a unidirectional risk model in which internalizing disorders increase risk for later substance use disorders. Implications of this relationship for interventions are considered, both in terms of treatment outcome for principal disorders and in terms of the potential "secondary benefit" of treating one disorder for preventing or reducing risk of the other. Finally, recommendations for future research on the relationship between internalizing disorders and SUDs in youth are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Children's Negative Cognitive Error Questionnaire (CNCEQ) is commonly used to measure four errors in young people's thinking, but research has failed to support the factorial validity of the measure. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the factor structure of a refined and extended version of the CNCEQ. Revision of the CNCEQ involved the exclusion of items rated as contaminated, and the addition of items measuring cognitive errors closely associated with anxiety ('threat conclusion' and 'underestimation of the ability to cope'). A secondary objective was to determine the relation between the negative cognitive errors and anxiety. Principal component analysis of data from 481 children and adolescents indicated five distinct negative cognitive error subscales labeled 'underestimation of the ability to cope', 'personalizing without mind reading', 'selective abstraction', 'overgeneralizing', and 'mind reading' which contained the new 'threat conclusion' items. Confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample of 295 children and adolescents yielded further support for the five-factor solution. All cognitive errors except 'selective abstraction' were correlated with anxiety. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the strongest predictors of anxiety were the two subscales containing new items, namely 'underestimation of the ability to cope' and 'mind reading'. The results are discussed with respect to further development of the instrument so as to advance the assessment of distorted cognitive processing in young people with internalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Psychotherapies with known efficacy in adolescent depression have been adapted for prepubertal children; however, none have been empirically validated for use with depressed very young children. Due to the centrality of the parent child relationship to the emotional well being of the young child, with caregiver support shown to mediate the risk for depression severity, we created an Emotional Development (ED) module to address emotion development impairments identified in preschool onset depression. The new module was integrated with an established intervention for preschool disruptive disorders, Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Preliminary findings of an open trial of this novel intervention, PCIT-ED, with depressed preschool children are reported. Methods: PCIT was adapted for the treatment of preschool depression by incorporating a novel emotional development module, focused on teaching the parent to facilitate the child's emotional development and enhance emotion regulation. Eight parent child dyads with depressed preschoolers participated in 14 sessions of the treatment. Depression severity, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, functional impairment, and emotion recognition/discrimination were measured pre- and posttreatment. Results: Depression severity scores significantly decreased with a large effect size (1.28). Internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as functional impairment were also significantly decreased pre- to posttreatment. Conclusions: PCIT-ED seems to be a promising treatment for preschoolers with depression, and the large effect sizes observed in this open trial suggest early intervention may provide a window of opportunity for more effective treatment. A randomized controlled trial of PCIT-ED in preschool depression is currently underway. Depression and Anxiety 28:153-159, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB In a sample of 273 adult women and their families, we examined the effects of women's psychopathology history, their social support, their husbands' and children's symptomatology, family stress, and neighborhood environment on their alcohol problems, antisocial behavior, and depression over a 12-year period during their 30s and early 40s. Women's alcohol problems and antisocial behavior decreased but their depression symptoms increased over time. Women's disorder history and their partners' parallel symptomatology were associated with their symptoms. For women's antisocial behavior, their own history of alcoholism and their partners' alcohol problems were also significant risk factors. Higher levels of social support were associated with lower levels of depression in women. Children's externalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' alcohol problems and antisocial behavior, whereas children's internalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' depression. Neighborhood residential instability was associated with higher levels of alcoholic and depressive symptomatology in women. Intervention efforts might target women with young children by improving social support, educational or professional training opportunity, access to family counseling, and neighborhood environment.

AB Aggressive victims-children who are both perpetrators and victims of peer aggression-experience greater concurrent mental health problems and impairments than children who are only aggressive or only victimized. The stability of early identified aggressive victim status has not been evaluated due to the fact that most studies of aggressor/victim subgroups have focused on preadolescents and/or adolescents. Further, whether children who exhibit early and persistent patterns of aggression and victimization continue to experience greater mental health problems and functional impairments through the transition to adolescence is not known. This study followed 344 children (180 girls) previously identified as socially adjusted, victims, aggressors, or aggressive victims at Grade 1 (Burk et al. 2008) to investigate their involvement in peer bullying through Grade 5. The children, their mothers, and teachers reported on children's involvement in peer aggression and victimization at Grades 1, 3, and 5; and reported on internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, inattention and impulsivity, as well as academic functioning, physical health, and service use at Grades 5, 7, and 9. Most children categorized as aggressive victims in Grade 1 continued to be significantly involved in peer bullying across elementary school. Children with recurrent aggressive victim status exhibited higher levels of some mental health problems and greater school impairments across the adolescent transition when compared to other longitudinal peer status groups. This study suggests screening for aggressive victim status at Grade 1 is potentially beneficial. Further early interventions may need to be carefully tailored to prevent and/or attenuate later psychological, academic, and physical health problems.

AB Preschool children have long been a neglected population in the study of psychopathology. The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA), which includes the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5) and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), constitutes the few available measures to assess preschoolers with an empirically derived taxonomy of preschool psychopathology. However, the utility of the measures and their taxonomy of preschool psychopathology to the Chinese is largely unknown and has not been studied. The present study aimed at testing the cross-cultural factorial validity of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF, as well as the applicability of the taxonomy of preschool psychopathology they embody, to Mainland Chinese preschoolers. Country effects between our Chinese sample and the original U. S. sample, gender differences, and cross-informant agreement between teachers and parents were also to be examined. A Chinese version of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF was completed by parents and teachers respectively on 876 preschoolers in Mainland China. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the original, U. S.-derived second order, multi-factor model best fit the Chinese preschool data of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF. Rates of total behavior problems in Chinese preschoolers were largely similar to those in American preschoolers. Specifically, Chinese preschoolers scored higher on internalizing problems while American preschoolers scored higher on externalizing problems. Chinese preschool boys had significantly higher rates of externalizing problems than Chinese preschool girls. Cross-informant agreement between Chinese teachers and parents was relatively low compared to agreement in the original U.S. sample. Results support the generalizability of the taxonomic structure of preschool psychopathology derived in the U.S. to the Chinese, as well as the applicability of the Chinese version of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF.

AB This study describes temperament, personality, and problem behaviors in children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) aged 6 to 14 years. It targets differences between an ADHD sample (N=54; 43 boys) and a large community sample (N=465; 393 boys) in means and variances, psychometric properties, and covariation between traits and internalizing and externalizing problems. Parents rated their children on Buss and Plomin's and Rothbart's temperament models, a child-oriented five-factor personality model and also on problem behavior. Relative to the comparison group, children with ADHD presented with a distinct trait profile exhibiting lower means on Effortful Control, Conscientiousness, Benevolence and Emotional Stability, higher means on Emotionality, Activity, and Negative Affect, but similar levels of Surgency, Shyness, and Extraversion. Striking similarities in variances, reliabilities and, in particular, of the covariation between trait and maladjustment variables corroborate the spectrum hypothesis and suggest that comparable processes regulate problem behavior in children with and without ADHD.

AB In early adolescence, the time spent using the Internet and video games is higher than in any other present-day age group. Due to age-inappropriate web and gaming content, the impact of new media use on teenagers is a matter of public and scientific concern. Based on current theories on inappropriate media use, a study was conducted that comprised 205 adolescents aged 10-14 years (Md = 13). Individuals were identified who showed clinically relevant problem behavior according to the problem scales of the Youth Self Report (YSR). Online gaming, communicational Internet use, and playing first-person shooters were predictive of externalizing behavior problems (aggression, delinquency). Playing online role-playing games was predictive of internalizing problem behavior (including withdrawal and anxiety). Parent-child communication about Internet activities was negatively related to problem behavior. (C) 2010 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   PERSISTENCE; PREDICTION
AB Background:
   Low levels of dispositional anger and a good attention span are critical to healthy social emotional development, with attention control reflecting effective cognitive self-regulation of negative emotions such as anger. Using a longitudinal design, we examined attention span as a moderator of reciprocal links between changes in anger and changes in externalizing and internalizing problems from 4.5 to 11 years of age.
   Method:
   Participants were children from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), assessed four times between 4.5 and 11 years. Composite scores for anger and attention were computed using indicators from multiple informants. Externalizing and internalizing problems were reported by mothers.
   Results:
   Latent difference score analysis showed reciprocal lagged effects between increased anger and elevated levels of externalizing or internalizing problems. Significant moderating effects of attention indicated more persistent effects of anger on externalizing problems in the poor attention group. Although the poor and the good attention groups did not differ regarding the effects of anger on internalizing problems, significant moderating effects of attention indicated stronger and more persistent reciprocal effects of internalizing problems on anger in the poor attention group.
   Conclusions:
   Attention control mechanisms are involved in self-regulation of anger and its connections with changes in behavioral and emotional problems. Strong attention regulation may serve to protect children with higher levels of dispositional anger from developing behavioral and emotional problems in middle childhood.

AB Background:
   Chronic maltreatment has been associated with the poorest developmental outcomes, but its effects may depend on the age when the maltreatment began, or be confounded by co-occurring psychosocial risk factors.
   Method:
   We used data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) to identify four groups of children who varied in the timing, extent, and continuity of their maltreatment from birth to 9 years. Internalizing and externalizing problems, prosocial behavior, and IQ were assessed 21 months, on average, following the most recent maltreatment report.
   Results:
   Children maltreated in multiple developmental periods had more externalizing and internalizing problems and lower IQ scores than children maltreated in only one developmental period. Chronically maltreated children had significantly more family risk factors than children maltreated in one developmental period and these accounted for maltreatment chronicity effects on externalizing and internalizing problems, but not IQ. The timing of maltreatment did not have a unique effect on cognitive or behavioral outcomes, although it did moderate the effect of maltreatment chronicity on prosocial behavior.
   Conclusion:
   There is a need for early intervention to prevent maltreatment from emerging and to provide more mental health and substance use services to caregivers involved with child welfare services.

AB Objective: This study examined the role that easy infant temperament and cumulative environmental risk play in predicting cognitive, language, and behavioral outcomes in 3-year-old children at high social risk. Methods: Subjects were 412 mother-infant dyads, recruited at birth, participating in a longitudinal study examining the effects of prenatal methamphetamine on child development. This analysis includes a subsample (n = 290) of the study with a completed 3-year visit. Temperament was assessed by the Infant Behavior Questionnaire at 12 months. Factor analysis from well-validated measures generated "easy" and "difficult" temperament profiles and a profile for high-risk environment. Caretaker receptive vocabulary served as a proxy for intelligence quotient. Outcomes at 3 years included motor and mental development, behavior problems, and language. Linear regression and hierarchical linear modeling examined the effects of temperament, high-risk environment, and caregiver receptive language on outcomes adjusting for maternal drug use and demographic and socioeconomic covariates. Results: Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were lower in children with easy temperament and higher with increased environmental risk. Easy temperament attenuated behavioral problems only in the setting of lower environmental risk. Caregiver receptive language was associated with lower internalizing scores. High-risk environment and temperament factors were not related to cognitive or motor outcomes. Prenatal methamphetamine exposure was not associated with 3-year-old outcomes, nor did it alter the protective effects of an easier temperament on child behavior. Conclusions: Children growing up in adverse social environments had increased behavioral problems and compromised language development. Conversely, an easy temperament acts as a protective factor for social-emotional development and could be related to resilience.

AB Studies of children's functioning following exposure to a traumatic event rarely have investigated change over the weeks following the event, but examining recovery in the short aftermath of a traumatic event is important for understanding vulnerability to subsequent disorder, as well as the potential utility of preventive interventions. Data are reported from a short-term longitudinal study of 35 mother-child dyads over 14 weeks following exposure to an incident of severe intimate partner violence. Using a developmental-ecological framework, we proposed that maternal parenting practices would be associated with children's recovery, and that maternal distress would be associated with her parenting practices. Consistent with hypotheses, observed parenting practices at baseline predicted the trajectory of children's self-reported internalizing problems over the study period. Maternal mental health problems were associated with child depression symptoms, but not with overall child internalizing symptoms. Parenting was not associated with maternal mental health symptoms. Further studies should pay closer attention to the role of parenting in children's adjustment in the aftermath of a traumatic event.

AB Neighborhood dangerousness and belongingness were expected to moderate associations between harsh parenting and toddler-age children's problem behaviors. Fifty-five predominantly African American mothers participated with their 2-year old children. Neighborhood danger, neighborhood belongingness, and children's problem behaviors were measured with mothers' reports. Harsh parenting was measured with observer ratings. Analyses considered variance common to externalizing and internalizing problems, using a total problems score, and unique variance, by controlling for internalizing behavior when predicting externalizing behavior, and vice versa. Regarding the common variance, only the main effects of neighborhood danger and harsh parenting were significantly associated with total problem behavior. In contrast, after controlling for externalizing problems, the positive association between harsh parenting and unique variance in internalizing problems became stronger as neighborhood danger increased. No statistically significant associations emerged for the models predicting the unique variance in externalizing problems or models considering neighborhood belongingness.

AB The potential effect of parental separation during early adolescence on adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems was investigated in a longitudinal sample of adolescents (n = 1274; mean age = 16.27; 52.3% girls). Pre-separation mental health problems were controlled for. Building on a large number of studies that overall showed a small effect of parental separation, it was argued that separation may only or especially have an effect under certain conditions. It was examined whether child temperament (effortful control and fearfulness) moderates the impact of parental separation on specific mental health domains. Hypotheses were derived from a goal-framing theory, with a focus on goals related to satisfying the need for autonomy and the need to belong. Controlling for the overlap between the outcome domains, we found that parental separation led to an increase in externalizing problems but not internalizing problems when interactions with child temperament were ignored. Moreover, child temperament moderated the impact of parental separation, in that it was only related to increased externalizing problems for children low on effortful control, whereas it was only related to increased internalizing problems for children high on fearfulness. The results indicate that person-environment interactions are important for understanding the development of mental health problems and that these interactions can be domain-specific.

AB This study tested a hypothesized model of the relationships among parental depressive symptoms, family process (interparental negativity and negative parenting behavior), child internalizing symptoms, and asthma disease activity. A total of 106 children with asthma, aged 7 to 17, participated with their fathers and mothers. Parental depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report. Interparental and parenting behaviors were observed and rated during family discussion tasks. Child internalizing symptoms were assessed by self-report and by clinician interview and rating. Asthma disease activity was assessed according to National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute guidelines. Results of structural equation modeling generally supported interparental negativity and negative parenting behavior as mediators linking parental depressive symptoms and child emotional and physical dysfunction. However, paternal and maternal depressive symptoms play their role through different pathways of negative family process.

One hundred and two families with 129 children (66 males; M-age = 11.42 years) were studied. The association of parental depressive symptoms with child internalizing problems was accounted for by parental guilt induction, which was assessed by behavioral observations and child report. Implications of the findings for parenting programs are discussed and future research directions are considered.

AB The multiple risk factors for alcohol use (AU) and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are interrelated through poorly understood pathways, many of which begin in childhood. In this report, the authors seek to develop an empirical, broad-based developmental model for the etiology of AU and AUDs in men. We assessed 15 risk factors in four developmental tiers in 1,794 adult male twins from the Virginia population based twin registry. The best fitting model explained 39% of the variance in late adolescent AU, and 30% of the liability to lifetime symptoms of AUD. AU and AUDs can be best understood as arising from the action and interaction of two pathways reflecting externalizing genetic/temperamental and familial/social factors. Peer group deviance was important in each pathway. Internalizing symptoms played a more minor role. Familial/social factors were especially important influences on AU, while genetic/temperamental factors were more critical for AUDs. We conclude that AU and AUDs in men are complex traits influenced by genetic, family, temperamental, and social factors, acting and interacting over developmental time.

AB A substantial minority of children are born as a consequence of an unplanned pregnancy. Yet little is known about the impact of unplanned/unwanted pregnancy (UP) on long-term health outcomes for children. This study aimed to examine the association between UP and child mental health and behavioural problems at 14 years, and whether this association is confounded or mediated by other variables. Data were from a pre-birth prospective study that included 4765 mothers and their children (48.4% female and 51.6% male) followed up from pregnancy to 14 years of the child's age in Brisbane, Australia. Child anxiety/depression, aggression, delinquency, attention problems, withdrawal problems, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems. internalizing, externalizing and total problems were measured using the Achenbach's Youth Self Report at 14 years. Child smoking and alcohol consumption were self-reported at 14 years. UP was prospectively assessed at the first antenatal visit of pregnancy. UP as reported by mothers at first antenatal visit predicted elevated levels of problem behaviours and increased substance use in children at 14 years. The impact of UP on child mental health and problem behaviours is partly due to the confounding effect of other variables, such as maternal socio-demographic status, mental health and substance use during pregnancy. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanism of association between UP and child aggression and early alcohol consumption at 14 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The psychometric characteristics of Carver and White's (1994) BIS/BAS scales were examined in 2 groups of Dutch adolescents (497 early adolescents and 237 middle adolescents, M-Age = 13.0 years and 16.4 years, respectively) and their middle-aged mothers (M-Age = 45.2 years; N = 734). Confirmatory factor analyses revealed an acceptably fitting 2-factor model for adapted BIS/BAS scales in all 3 groups, reflecting separate BIS and BAS factors. Reliabilities of the 2 scales were satisfactory. The results supported the convergent validity of BIS and BAS scales. BIS was positively correlated with internalizing problem behaviors and neuroticism. BAS was positively correlated with externalizing problem behaviors and extraversion. The discriminant validity of the BIS/BAS scales received mixed support in our data. BIS was negatively correlated with extraversion, and BAS was not correlated with depression. However, BIS was also found to be correlated with externalizing problem behaviors, and BAS was positively correlated with neuroticism. In sum, the scales are suitable for use in research settings, but caution is advocated in application for clinical practice.

AB This study examined whether the quality of parent - adolescent interactions moderate the association between stressful life events and internalizing and externalizing problems in referred adolescents (N - 101, M age 13.41 years, SD - 1.81). Adolescents and their parents reported on psychological problems at the time of referral and 4 years later. At follow-up parents reported on stressful life events and an interaction task was conducted to observe autonomy and relatedness promoting behaviors. For adolescents exposed to stressful events, levels of internalizing and externalizing problems went up except if observed parent - adolescent interactions were characterized by high autonomy and relatedness. The results implied that autonomy and relatedness protect adolescents against the deleterious effects of stressful life events. These findings build on previous research showing for psychologically vulnerable adolescents that parenting that promotes autonomy while maintaining relatedness is associated with resilience in times of stress.

AB Low-income youth experience social-emotional problems linked to chronic stress that are exacerbated by lack of access to care. Drumming is a non-verbal, universal activity that builds upon a collectivistic aspect of diverse cultures and does not bear the stigma of therapy. A pretest-post-test non-equivalent control group design was used to assess the effects of 12 weeks of school counselor-led drumming on social-emotional behavior in two fifth-grade intervention classrooms versus two standard education control classrooms. The weekly intervention integrated rhythmic and group counseling activities to build skills, such as emotion management, focus and listening. The Teacher's Report Form was used to assess each of 101 participants (n = 54 experimental, n = 47 control, 90% Latino, 53.5% female, mean age 10.5 years, range 10-12 years). There was 100% retention. ANOVA testing showed that intervention classrooms improved significantly compared to the control group in broad-band scales (total problems (P<.01), internalizing problems (P<.02)), narrow-band syndrome scales (withdrawn/depression (P<.02), attention problems (P<.01), inattention subscale (P<.001)), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales (anxiety problems (P<.01), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (P<.01), inattention subscale (P<.001), oppositional defiant problems (P<.03)), and other scales (post-traumatic stress problems (P<.01), sluggish cognitive tempo (P<.001)). Participation in group drumming led to significant improvements in multiple domains of social-emotional behavior. This sustainable intervention can foster positive youth development and increase student-counselor interaction. These findings underscore the potential value of the arts as a therapeutic tool.

AB This longitudinal investigation examined the utility of subjective well-being (SWB) and psychopathology in predicting subsequent academic achievement and in-school behavior in 300 middle school students. Initial SWB predicted students' grade point averages (GPAs) 1 year later, initial internalizing psychopathology predicted absences 1 year later, and initial externalizing psychopathology predicted grades, absences, and discipline problems 1 year later. Students' grades and attendance across time varied as a function of mental health group yielded from a dual factor model. Specifically, students in the troubled mental health group declined at a significantly faster rate on GPAs than youth without psychopathology. In contrast, students in the symptomatic but content group were not significantly different from peers with low psychopathology. At Time 2, the best attendance, grades, and math skills were found among students who had both average/high SWB and low psychopathology 1 year earlier, supporting the long-term utility of complete mental health.

AB In the present study of Norwegian adolescents aged 12-15 years, adolescents with reading difficulties (RD) were compared with adolescents without RD on emotional and behavioral problems. Of this group, 191 (7.8%) adolescents reported having RD at T1. At both time points, when compared with the non-RD group, those in the RD group had significantly higher internalizing and externalizing scale scores, a greater number of total problems, and higher scores on all subscales of the YSR. The number of social problems decreased from T1 to T2 for both groups. While externalizing scale scores did not change for the RD group, these problems increased for adolescents without RD. Having RD predicted higher levels of social problems after one year in multivariate analysis controlled for other problems and confounding variables.

AB This study examines processes linking inner-city community violence exposure to subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems. Hypothesized risk and protective factors from 3 ecological domains-children's parent and peer relationships and individual characteristics-were examined for mediating, moderating, or independent roles in predicting problem behavior among 667 children over 3 years of middle school. Mediation was not found. However, parent and peer variables moderated the association between exposure and internalizing problems. Under high exposure, normally protective factors (e.g., attachment to parents) were less effective in mitigating exposure's effects than under low exposure; attachment to friends was more effective. Individual competence was independently associated with decreased internalizing problems. Variables from all domains, and exposure, were independently associated with externalizing problems. Protective factors (e.g., parent attachment) predicted decreased problems; risk factors (e.g., friends' delinquency) predicted increased problems. Results indicate community violence reduction as essential in averting inner-city adolescents' poor behavioral outcomes.

This study sought to evaluate participants in Prodigy (a program synthesizing arts and self-regulation skills) regarding changes in mental health symptoms and academic performance. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest was conducted with 108 at-risk adolescents and their parents. Significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms and increases in academic self-efficacy with positive trends in improved academic achievement were noted. Future research regarding the potential of these two modalities is discussed.

AB Background and Objectives: The second to fourth (2D:4D) digit ratio is a sexually dimorphic trait which has been studied to examine the association between fetal hormones and a variety of behaviors. Lower 2D:4D ratios, suggestive of exposure to higher levels of prenatal testosterone, have been associated with male-linked disorders, while higher 2D:4D ratios, suggestive of exposure to weaker prenatal androgen action, have been associated with female-linked disorders. Past research has concentrated on the 2D:4D ratio, whereas the relationship between other ratios, such as the 3D:5D ratio, and psychopathology has not much been studied before. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the 2D:4D and 3D:5D ratio, and internalizing as well as externalizing symptoms, in a large non-clinical sample (143 boys, 150 girls) of white Caucasian children aged 7 to 13 years.
   Methods: Externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: The 3D:5D ratio in boys and in girls was positively associated with scores on Externalizing Problems. Further, in girls only, the 3D:5D ratio was positively correlated to scores on Internalizing Problems.
   Conclusions: The 3D:5D ratio can be considered a correlate of externalizing and internalizing problems in children from the general population.

AB Child abuse and neglect, often collectively called child maltreatment, are huge social problems affecting millions of children and adolescents in America. Adolescents are affected both by maltreatment which occurred during childhood with lingering effects and by maltreatment that continues into or begins in adolescence. Several decades of research indicate such maltreatment is associated with a number of mental health problems, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as other maladaptive developmental problems, in childhood and beyond. This is a review of research published from 2000 to 2010 with a specific focus on the nature and impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development. This article focuses on 3 especially critical themes of this recent research: (1) prospective longitudinal studies that examine adolescent adaptation and maladaptation of individuals abused or neglected earlier in life; (2) research that focuses on some developmental outcomes with particular salience during adolescence such as delinquency and substance abuse, romantic relationships, and sexuality; and (3) research that examined psychobiological processes in maltreated adolescents, processes that might indicate the mechanisms underlying maladaptive development.

AB This article summarizes the empirical studies showing pathways in the development of externalizing and delinquent behaviors. Pathways are defined as the orderly temporal development between more than two problem behaviors. The paper addresses the following questions: (1) What are the developmental pathways between different diagnoses of Disruptive Behavior Disorders, including Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), and Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD)? (2) What is a parsimonious model of pathways in externalizing problems that incorporates psychiatric symptoms of Disruptive Behaviors Disorders, other externalizing behaviors, and delinquent acts? And do the data best fit a single or multiple pathways? (3) Which pathways have been documented from externalizing to internalizing behaviors? (4) What are the limitations of past studies and what are the prospects of future studies on developmental pathways? Implications are discussed of the findings for assessments and interventions.

AB Objective. To increase understanding of the link between power assertive discipline and internalizing problems in adolescence, the present study investigated the role of attachment. Design. For this purpose, 514 families (mothers, fathers, and adolescents ranging in age from 10 to 18 years) completed questionnaires measuring power assertive discipline, attachment, and internalizing problems. Power assertive discipline was measured with multiple informants. The mediating and moderating role of attachment was investigated with bootstrapping analyses. Results. Complete mediation was found in the entire group and independent of parents' gender. Analyses for separate age groups confirmed the mediating role of attachment. Power assertive discipline tended to be linked with higher internalizing problems only when early adolescents reported high levels of attachment security. Conclusion. Power assertive discipline is associated with internalizing problems and less secure attachment, and attachment explained the association between power assertive discipline and internalizing problems.

AB The study examined the relationship between physical punishment and socioemotional well-being in a sample of Jamaican adolescents. The data indicated that the overwhelming majority of adolescent respondents experienced physical punishment within their families. Physical punishment was significantly associated with adverse psychological and behavioral consequences, in that adolescents reporting being victims of physical punishment also indicated a greater propensity to developmental adjustment problems than their non-victimized peers. However, unlike findings from research emanating from more industrialized cultures, sociodemographic factors were not associated with the incidence of physical punishment. Gender showed statistical significance on all socioemotional dimensions and with behavior problems but not with physical punishment. Implications for policy decisions to reduce children's exposure to violence within that particular cultural context are discussed.

AB Latent growth-mixture modeling was used to investigate patterns of change in Ioneliness for 170 children from third through fifth grades. A three-class model representing unique trajectories of loneliness provided the best overall fit to the data, including a Stable Low group (65%), as well as groups of Increasers (23%) and Decreasers (12%). Groups were then compared on aspects of peer functioning, including peer optimism, classroom sociometric ratings, and peer behavior nominations that were also collected in third, fourth, and fifth grades. The Stable Low group was characterized by positive peer functioning (elevated peer optimism, below-average victimization and passive social withdrawal nominations, and above-average mutual friendships). The Increasers had elevated passive social withdrawal and later victimization nominations, and possibly represent a subgroup of children at risk for developing later internalizing symptomatology. The Decreasers had a less clear pattern of peer functioning in third grade but were indistinguishable from the Stable Low group by fourth and fifth grades. Findings are discussed in the context of the development of loneliness in middle childhood.

AB The present meta-analysis examined the effects of psychosocial treatments at reducing deleterious outcomes of sexual abuse. The meta-analysis included a total of 35 published and unpublished studies written in English, focusing on youth under the age of 18, and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for the most common negative outcomes of sexual abuse: PTSD symptoms, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems. Results revealed medium effect sizes for PTSD symptoms, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems following treatment for sexual abuse. This study also examined the potential moderating effects of treatment (e.g., modality, duration, and inclusion of caregiver) and participant (e.g., age, gender, and ethnicity) characteristics. Results indicated that longer interventions were associated with greater treatment gains while group and individual treatments were equally effective. These findings shed new light on treatment effectiveness and provide useful information regarding the conditions under which treatment may be most effective. Future directions for research in this area are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and psychosocial well-being has been well documented in the global literature, existing studies also suggest the existence of multiple domains in definition and measurement of PSS. The current study, utilizing data from 1299 rural children affected by HIV/AIDS in central China, examines the relative importance of PSS functional measures (informational/emotional, material/tangible, affectionate, and social interaction) and PSS structural measures (family/relatives, teachers, friends, and significant others) in predicting psychosocial outcomes including internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and educational resilience. Both functional and structural measures of PSS provided reliable measures of related but unique aspects of PSS. The findings of the current study confirmed the previous results that PSS is highly correlated with children's psychosocial well-being and such correlations vary by functions and sources of the PSS as well as different psychosocial outcomes. The findings in the current study suggested the roles of specific social support functions or resources may need to be assessed in relation to specific psychosocial outcome and the context of children's lives. The strong association between PSS and psychosocial outcomes underscores the importance of adequate social support to alleviate stressful life events and improve psychosocial well-being of children affected by HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, the study findings call for gender and developmentally appropriate and situation-specific social support for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS.

AB Objective: Using longitudinal and prospective measures of trauma during childhood, the authors assessed the risk of developing psychotic symptoms associated with maltreatment, bullying, and accidents in a nationally representative U. K. cohort of young twins.
   Method: Data were from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, which follows 2,232 twin children and their families. Mothers were interviewed during home visits when children were ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 on whether the children had experienced maltreatment by an adult, bullying by peers, or involvement in an accident. At age 12, children were asked about bullying experiences and psychotic symptoms. Children's reports of psychotic symptoms were verified by clinicians.
   Results: Children who experienced maltreatment by an adult (relative risk=3.16, 95% CI=1.92-5.19) or bullying by peers (relative risk=2.47, 95% CI=1.74-3.52) were more likely to report psychotic symptoms at age 12 than were children who did not experience such traumatic events. The higher risk for psychotic symptoms was observed whether these events occurred early in life or later in childhood. The risk associated with childhood trauma remained significant in analyses controlling for children's gender, socioeconomic deprivation, and IQ; for children's early symptoms of internalizing or externalizing problems; and for children's genetic liability to developing psychosis. In contrast, the risk associated with accidents was small (relative risk=1.47, 95% CI=1.02-2.13) and inconsistent across ages.
   Conclusions: Trauma characterized by intention to harm is associated with children's reports of psychotic symptoms. Clinicians working with children who report early symptoms of psychosis should inquire about traumatic events such as maltreatment and bullying.

AB This research examines the relationship between witnessing of intimate partner violence (IPV) and externalizing and internalizing behaviors using birth to age 3 data from a longitudinal study (N = 187). We hypothesized that for infants and toddlers, direct witnessing of IPV, compared to living in a household where IPV occurred, would be more disruptive of behavior because it affects the child's emotional security within the family. Findings supported our hypothesis. Children who witnessed IPV displayed more externalizing behaviors at ages 2 and 3 as compared to children who did not witness IPV or whose mothers were not victims. Findings highlight the importance of assessing whether infants and toddlers witness IPV, as this has implications for infant behavior as well as maternal parenting.

ID BEHAVIOR; TEACHER; GENDER
AB In a child day-care setting, the naturally occurring social-emotional behaviours and play interaction of 51 infants were observed and recorded. Individual differences in gender, age, temperament, and maternal parenting behaviours were examined to understand how these variables might be related to social-emotional adjustment of infants. The measures used in this study were Social-emotional Behaviour, Play Interaction, Temperament, and Parenting Behaviour. Results indicate that boys showed externalizing problem behaviours more than girls, and the 2-year-olds showed more internalizing problem behaviours such as withdrawal/separation than 1-year-olds. Additionally, adaptability of infants showed a negative correlation with externalizing problem behaviours. Maternal behaviours of over-protectiveness/permissiveness had relations with a low social capability and refusal/neglect had relations with high externalizing problem behaviours. The results suggest that individual differences in social-emotional adjustment are variously determined.

AB Children's responses on a Narrative Story Stem Technique (NSST) were coded using scales reflecting essential attachment constructs, specifically, attachment, exploratory, sociability, and caregiving behavioral systems, as originally conceived by Bowlby (1973, 1982) and elaborated upon by his followers (Cassidy, 2008). NSST responses were examined in relation to both mother- and teacher-reported psycho-social adjustment and risk using the MacArthur Health & Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ). Forty-six children participated (average age 6 years 10 months), 19 of whom had high-risk backgrounds, and the rest demographically matched. Findings indicate that NSST scales were associated with behavior on certain HBQ scales, in expected directions. NSST responses appeared to differentiate socially competent children from children with the specific psycho-social risks of externalizing behavior problems and social isolation, according to mother-reports, on the one hand, and peer vulnerability and internalizing problems, according to teacher-reports, on the other. Implications for clinical applications are discussed.

AB Pediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is known to negatively impact home and classroom behavior. Preschool-age Hispanic children from Spanish-speaking households are at elevated risk for poor school readiness. The authors used a multi-informant approach to assess home and preschool behavior among Hispanic children at risk for SDB (n = 67). Higher parent-reported SDB risk and elevated snoring were associated with parent- and teacher-reported problem behaviors and poorer teacher-reported classroom executive function among boys; elevated snoring was associated with internalizing behaviors among girls. Elevated snoring may be associated with problems related to impaired inhibitory self-control, suggesting the need for early intervention in order to improve school readiness among these a priori defined at-risk Hispanic children.

AB Objective: Many children in the US who are court-ordered to live in out-of-home care are placed with kinship caregivers. Few studies have examined the impact of living with kin on child well-being. This study examined the relationship between length of time living with kin and indices of adolescent well-being in a cohort of children who were initially court-ordered into out-of-home care.
   Methods: Prospective cohort design with 148 youth, ages 7-12, who entered out-of-home care between May, 1990, and October, 1991. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed at T1 (6 months following placement) were interviewed at T2 (5 years later).
   Results: Bivariate analyses did not demonstrate significant relationships between length of time living with kin and the outcome variables. In multivariate analyses, longer length of time living with kin was related to: (1) greater involvement in risk behaviors including: delinquency (beta =.22, p < .05), sexual risk behaviors (beta = .31, p < .05), substance use (beta = .26, p < .05), and total risk behaviors (beta = .27, p < .05), and (2) poorer life-course outcomes including: Tickets/Arrests (OR = 1.4, p < .05) and lower grades (beta = -.24, p < .05). Time living with kin was not related to total competence, or self-destructive, internalizing, externalizing, or total behavior problems. There were trends (p < .10) for time living with kin to predict greater trauma symptomatology (beta = .17) and suspensions (OR = 1.1).
   Conclusions: There were no significant bivariate findings. The multivariate findings suggested a pattern of poorer functioning for youth who spent more time living with kin. No differences were found in current symptomatology.
   Practice implications: Although findings from a single study should not dictate changes in practice or policy, the current study's findings do suggest that the field needs to conduct more methodologically sophisticated research on the impact of kinship care.

AB Background Feeding and sleeping problems are common during infancy Many regulatory problems of this kind are connected to various child and family factors This study is a follow-up of children with early feeding and/or sleeping problems, 6 years after clinical contacts
   Methods A total of 230 families (72%) participated in the questionnaire follow-up Children and parents were compared with 227 (71%) reference families regarding sleeping and feeding problems health factors in parent and child, psychosocial problems, stressful life events, social support, life satisfaction, and externalizing and internalizing behaviour in the child
   Results Six years after clinical contacts the children with early feeding and/or sleeping problems still had more problems of this kind compared with the reference children Early child health problems were more frequent within the clinical group, but recent health problems did not separate the two groups Mothers in the clinical sample reported more health problems than mothers in the reference group and clinical parents were less content with their social support and had more psychosocial problems, including stressful life events Children in the clinical sample had more internalizing problems than comparison children Recent feeding and sleeping problems were connected to more externalizing and internalizing problems
   Conclusions Early regulatory problems concerning sleeping or feeding are less frequent when the child grows up, but nevertheless tend to remain A clinical recommendation for child health care is to take both child and family factors into account to individualize contacts work with an all-inclusive perspective and have close follow-ups

AB We followed an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of preadolescent girls with ADHD (n = 140) and matched comparison girls (n = 88) over a period of 5 years, from middle childhood through early/midadolescence, with the aim of determining whether childhood levels of executive function (EF) would predict adolescent multi-informant outcomes of social functioning and psychopathology, including comorbidity between externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. Predictors were well-established measures of planning, response inhibition, and working memory, along with a control measure of fine motor control. Independent of ADHD versus comparison group status, (a) childhood planning and response inhibition predicted adolescent social functioning and (b) childhood planning predicted comorbid internalizing/externalizing disorders in adolescence. Subgroup status (ADHD-Combined, ADHD-Inattentive, and comparison) moderated the relationship between childhood planning and adolescent internalizing/externalizing comorbidity, with the combined type revealing particularly strong associations between baseline planning and adolescent comorbidity. Mediation analyses indicated that adolescent social functioning mediated the prediction from childhood EF to comorbidity at follow-up; in turn, in the girls with ADHD, adolescent comorbidity mediated the prediction from childhood EF to social functioning at follow-up. We conclude that childhood interventions should target EF impairments in addition to behavioral symptoms.

Significant mediating effects indicated that youth at greater risk of maltreatment experienced higher levels of internalizing symptoms that result in increased risk for delinquent behavior, although longitudinal effects were not supported. These findings highlight internalizing mental health symptoms as an important factor to address in treating victimized children at risk of future delinquency.

DT Article
AB Many children in the child welfare system (CWS) have histories of recurrent interpersonal trauma perpetrated by caregivers early in life often referred to as complex trauma. Children in the CWS also experience a diverse range of reactions across multiple areas of functioning that are associated with such exposure. Nevertheless, few CWSs routinely screen for trauma exposure and associated symptoms beyond an initial assessment of the precipitating event. This study examines trauma histories, including complex trauma exposure (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence), posttraumatic stress, and behavioral and emotional problems of 2,251 youth (age 0 to 21; M = 9.5, SD = 4.3) in foster care who were referred to a National Child Traumatic Stress Network site for treatment. High prevalence rates of complex trauma exposure were observed: 70.4% of the sample reported at least two of the traumas that constitute complex trauma; 11.7% of the sample reported all 5 types. Compared to youth with other types of trauma, those with complex trauma histories had significantly higher rates of internalizing problems, posttraumatic stress, and clinical diagnoses, and differed on some demographic variables. Implications for child welfare practice and future research are discussed.

AB Based on Jessor's (1998) Problem Behavior Theory, this study investigated the relationship between risk and protective factors and adolescent psychopathology and adjustment. For this purpose, adolescent girls (n = 69) and boys (n = 71) living in residential foster homes in the city of Tehran, responded to an adapted version of the Adolescent Health and Development Questionnaire, Jessor, 1998) and their foster home caregivers rated the adolescents' internalizing/externalizing problems and prosocial behavior with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ Goodman, 2001). This study identified several influential aspects at the levels of the individual, foster home, peers and community that serve as a direct risk and protective factors, and also documented indirect pathways of gender, individual, foster home, peers and community influence.
   Three main patterns, protective, protective and enhancing, and protective but reactive seemed to characterize most of the risk by protective factor interactions. The risk and protective factors associated with foster home adolescents' mental health are broadly in line with previous published findings. Based on the present findings, the extension of universal intervention programs designed within the framework of PBT and which address multiple targets seems justified to be used with foster care home adolescents.

AB The primary goal of this study was to examine patterns or groupings of adolescents' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) (measured through cortisol) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (measured through salivary alpha amylase or sAA) responses as a function of their parents' communication skills. A related goal was to decipher whether adolescents who demonstrate different patterns of physiological reactivity vary in their personal and relational health. The sample consisted of 118 parent-adolescent dyads who were asked to talk about something stressful related to the parents' relationship. The results revealed that adolescents' perceptions of their parent's communication skills predicted the likelihood that the adolescents would overreact, show no reaction, or down regulate in response to such a discussion, but only for sAA. All of the communication skills in question-social support, communication competence, feeling caught between the parents' conflict, and inappropriate disclosures-supported the hypothesis that adolescents with parents who they think are more communicatively skilled are better able to recover from a stressful interaction than adolescents whose parents are less skilled. Adolescents who were considered "overreactors" in sAA also had more negative health indices, somewhat lower psychological well-being, and poorer quality relationships with their parents.

AB Although the association between antisocial behavior and depression has been widely supported, the direction and temporal order of this relationship are not fully understood in childhood and adolescence. Patterson and Capaldi formulated a failure model to explain how antisocial behaviors may cause and reinforce depression. Although co-occurring internalizing problems are commonly diagnosed in girls, few studies have examined the onset and progression of antisocial behavior and depression in female adolescents using prospective data that allow for a thorough investigation of the dynamics of this relationship. The present study extends previous research by examining the relationship between gender, crime, and depressive symptoms in youths participating in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Overall, there was mixed support for failure theory.

AB This article discusses the importance of and one approach to translational research to prevent internalizing problems very early in life. The World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts that by 2,030 internalizing problems will be second only to HIV/AIDS in the international burden of disease. Internalizing problems affect one in every seven school age children, with negative impacts on peer relations, school engagement, and later mental health, adult relationships, and employment. There is persuasive evidence that intervention in the preschool years can have a cost-effective impact on general developmental outcomes, compared to later school or adult intervention. However, the development of early childhood prevention for internalizing problems is in its infancy. Two significant risk factors for child internalizing problems are temperamental inhibition (characterized by fearfulness and withdrawal) and overinvolved/protective parenting practices. Rapee et al. have conducted two randomized "efficacy" trials with inhibited preschoolers in which a parenting group intervention reduced internalizing disorders up to 3 years later Translational "effectiveness" research is now underway at the population level, to determine the balance of benefits and harms of systematically screening preschoolers for inhibition and subsequent intervention for all those affected. This rigorous public health research, followed by effective dissemination, addresses gaps identified in the WHO Prevention of Mental Disorders report. Depression and Anxiety 28:50-57, 2011.

AB We used longitudinal data from a birth cohort study, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, to investigate the links between Head Start and school readiness in a large and diverse sample of urban children at age 5 (N = 2,803; 18 cities). We found that Head Start attendance was associated with enhanced cognitive ability and social competence and reduced attention problems but not reduced internalizing or externalizing behavior problems. These findings were robust to model specifications (including models with city-fixed effects and propensity-scoring matching). Furthermore, the effects of Head Start varied by the reference group. Head Start was associated with improved cognitive development when compared with parental care or other nonparental care, as well as improved social competence (compared with parental care) and reduced attention problems (compared with other nonparental care). In contrast, compared with attendance at pre-kindergarten or other center-based care, Head Start attendance was not associated with cognitive gains but with improved social competence and reduced attention and externalizing behavior problems (compared with attendance at other center-based care). These associations were not moderated by child gender or race/ethnicity.

AB Mothers in Sri Lanka are increasingly seeking overseas employment, resulting in disruption of the childcare environment. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of maternal migration on executive function (EF) and behavior, thereby also contributing to the scientific understanding of environmental effects - or more specifically family effects - on children's neurocognitive functioning. A sample of 60 healthy 11-year-old children whose mothers had been working overseas for more than 1 year formed the study group, and a comparison group was recruited from the same schools. Evaluations were made twice over a 1-year interval with regard to the EF components inhibition and working memory as well as teacher ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior. The children in the study group were found to have poorer EF and higher levels of externalizing behaviors. A composite score of inhibition partially mediated the group effect on externalizing behavior. Current home environment was assessed using the HOME scale, was poorer for the study group and was related to EF, but not to behavior problems. Keeping in mind the correlational nature of the present data, our results were discussed in relation to studies showing cognitive effects of stress.

AB Research Findings: Parental expressivity, child physiological regulation (indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia suppression), child behavioral regulation, and child adjustment outcomes were examined in 45 children (M age = 4.32 years, SD = 1.30) and their parents. With the exception of child adjustment (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems and adaptive skills), which were assessed with parents' ratings, all variables were observed behaviorally or physiologically. A 3-path mediation path model was tested with the relations between parental expressivity and child adjustment outcomes mediated through child physiological regulation and behavioral regulation. Despite low power to detect the mediated effect, there was evidence to suggest that physiological regulation and behavioral regulation were 2 mediating mechanisms by which parental high positive/low negative expressivity may influence adaptive skills. Thus, parental expressivity may shape children's physiological regulation. And physiological regulation may be 1 mechanism by which effortful control becomes manifested as behavioral regulation that becomes apparent to others who then make evaluations about individuals' adaptive skills. Practice or Policy: The results have implications for interventions aimed at parent training or parental coaching of emotion as well as interventions aimed at enhancing children's social-emotional or behavioral regulation to improve children's adaptive skills.

AB Aims: To study the prospective relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSP) and behavioral problems, heavy alcohol use, daily smoking, and ever use of cannabis in the offspring, and to assess the role of confounding and mediating factors in a systematic way. Methods: Population-based cohort study of 2,230 respondents, starting in 2001 when respondents were around the age of 11 years, and two follow-up measurements at intervals of about 2.5 years (response rates of 96.0 and 81.4%). Results: Almost one third of the respondents' mothers had smoked tobacco during pregnancy. These respondents were at an increased risk for all outcomes except internalizing problems (significant odds ratios ranged from 1.40 to 2.97). The successive models showed that the potential confounding factors reduced the strength of all relationships. In the full model, the strongest relationship was found for mothers who smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day during pregnancy and daily smoking in early adolescence (odds ratio: 1.56), but none of the relationships were statistically significant. Conclusions: MSP is a marker for future behavioral outcomes in the offspring, but reducing the prevalence of MSP is unlikely to make a meaningful contribution to the prevention of these problems in adolescents.

AB When families migrate the new culture and culture of origin may conflict, with possible consequences for parenting and children's development. Turks form one of the largest immigrant groups in Western Europe, and there is also much movement within Turkey. This study compares three groups; Turkish immigrants to the UK (N=142), migrants within Turkey (N=229), and Turkish non-migrants (locals, N=396). The children were 39-71 months old (M=58 months, SD=6.5), 392 were boys and 375 were girls. Parents supplied data on family characteristics and parenting, and teachers supplied data on children's behaviour. Using Baumrind's parenting model and allowing for background effects, compared to non-migrants and migrants, the immigrant parents were less permissive and more authoritarian. Children in immigrant families had more externalizing problems, internalizing problems and emotional dysregulation and less social competence than migrant and non-migrant children. Multilevel models and structural equation models both found that these effects upon child behaviour were evident after taking into account demographic factors and were not eliminated by taking into account parenting style differences, and thus suggest that immigration and migration are risk factors for child behaviour. Effects of immigrant and migrant status were partly direct and partly indirect via their effects on parenting.

AB Objective: It was the aim of this study to assess the prevalence of preschool neurobehavioral problems in children following fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) surgery. Methods: Prior to the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, 30 fMMC patients underwent a standardized neurodevelopmental examination at 5 years of age. The prevalence of behavioral problems was assessed by the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), which includes a total problem score and 2 broad-band indices (internalizing and externalizing problems). fMMC children were classified as having normal, at-risk or clinically significant scores based on calculated T scores. Results: Twenty-two (73%) fMMC families completed the evaluation. Mean age at delivery following fMMC surgery was 35.5 +/- 1.6 weeks. The prevalence of 'at-risk' or 'clinically significant' scores for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioral problems was similar to general population norms. No difference in overall internalizing (p = 0.19), externalizing (p = 0.54) and total behavioral (p = 0.18) scores was found between non-shunted and shunted fMMC children. However, shunted fMMC children were more likely to experience anxiety and depressive (p = 0.02), pervasive developmental (p = 0.03) and withdrawn (p = 0.06) behavior. Oppositional defiant, attention deficit and hyperactivity problems were not found. No correlation was found between overall neurodevelopmental outcome and abnormal CBCL scores. Conclusions: fMMC surgery and subsequent preterm delivery is not associated with increased behavioral problems, impaired social interactions and restricted behavior patterns. Shunted fMMC children were more likely to have scores in the 'at-risk' or 'clinically significant' range for multiple CBCL subindices. Early detection of behavioral problems following fMMC surgery provides an opportunity for targeted and timely intervention enabling affected fMMC children to be socially successful.

AB Background/Aims: To evaluate effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment on behaviour and psychosocial characteristics in short-stature children. Methods: 99 referred prepubertal non-familiar short-stature children (32 GH deficiency; 67 idiopathic short stature) aged 3-11 years, randomized to fixed or individual GH doses and their parents completed questionnaires (Child Behaviour Checklist, Birleson Depression Self-Report Scale, Abbreviated Parent-Teacher Questionnaire, I Think I Am, Well-Being Visual-Analogue Scales for Short-Stature Children) at baseline (BL) and after 3, 12, and 24 months. Results: At BL, children showed higher levels of internalizing behaviour (p < 0.001), lower levels of externalizing behaviour (p < 0.006) and self-esteem (p < 0.001) compared to reference values. During GH treatment, behavioural measures (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.01) changed towards the mean of the population within the first 3 months and remained improved to 24 months. Self-esteem improved at all time points (p < 0.001), and in all subgroups, as did well-being dimensions stability and mood (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that greater improvements were related to lower BL value, height gain, higher maximal GH value, being older, and being male. Conclusion: On GH treatment, prepubertal short children significantly improved on behavioural, depression, and psychosocial evaluations over a 2-year period of GH treatment. Most change occurred within the first 3 months, which highlights this short period as important not only for growth and metabolic changes but also for behaviour and psychosocial improvements following GH treatment. copyright (C) 2011 S.

AB Research examining cortisol dysregulation is seemingly contradictory with studies showing that both internalizing and externalizing behaviors are related to high and low cortisol. One extant theory to explain divergent findings in the stress literature is that both hypo- and hyper-arousal of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be present depending on time since onset of the stressor. This theory may extend to the onset of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Data from 96 youth participating in a longitudinal project were used to examine this possibility. Composite measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors at both childhood and early adolescence were formed using mother and teacher reports. Multiple salivary cortisol samples were also collected over two consecutive days during early adolescence. Problematic behaviors were associated with cortisol and the direction of the association was dependent on amount of time passed since onset of the behaviors. When examined concurrently in adolescence, youth with more internalizing behaviors had higher morning cortisol; however, when examined longitudinally, youth with more internalizing behaviors in childhood had lower morning cortisol levels as adolescents. Youth with more externalizing behaviors in childhood had flattened diurnal cortisol rhythms as adolescents, and this finding persisted when examined in adolescence. Cortisol dysregulation was greatest in children with the most severe behavior problems. Findings support the theoretical model of blunting of the HPA axis over time. While the HPA axis may show hyper-arousal when youth first display behaviors, long-term exposure may lead to a hypo-arousal of the HPA axis which culminates in a dysregulated diurnal rhythm.

AB Background: To date, there is little evidence to support an association between symptoms of pediatric allergic disorders and psychosocial factors in the general population, particularly in Asian countries. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between psychosocial factors and symptoms of allergic disorders and to investigate the association between behavior problems and biomarkers of atopy. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of parental responses to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire and the Korean version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was conducted from one elementary school in Seoul, Korea. Skin prick tests for 18 major allergens were also performed. Results: A total of 780 children with valid CBCL surveys were included in the study. Externalizing problems were significantly larger in children with asthmatic symptoms, while internalizing problems were significantly larger in children with symptoms of both asthma and allergic rhinitis. Social adaptations were significantly lower in children with symptoms of allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Boys with more positive allergens via the skin prick tests showed larger internalizing problems. Conclusions: While school children with allergic symptoms have been reported to have more difficulties with psychosocial adaptation, the patterns of psychosocial problems varied somewhat according to the types of atopic disorder. There was a positive relationship between atopy and behavior problems, especially in boys. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This study examined the processes and predictors of change in maternal ratings of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and attachment security in 70 infant girls adopted from China at a mean age of 13.5 months. These children's mental and language development were also directly assessed. The adopted children were assessed within the first month of adoption and again six, 12 and 24 months later. Comparisons were made with 43 girls of similar age and family background. Results indicated that from six months postadoption onward, adopted children exhibited a rapid increase in internalizing symptoms, especially in emotion reactivity. Adopted children initially formed attachment rapidly. Growth in attachment gradually slowed down over time. Individual differences that emerged in the rate of attachment growth from six months postadoption were related to mental ability in both groups. The results point to the effects of potential risk factors on the processes of change, at least in the two years following adoption.

AB The present study examined whether a sample of 214 (52.8% male, M age = 15.76, SD = 1.29) institutionalized adolescents could be classified into subgroups based on psychopathic traits. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed a relationship between the subscales of the Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory (YPI) and the three latent constructs of the original model on which it is based. Latent Class Analyses showed that adolescents showing psychopathic traits could be classified into three subgroups. The first group showed low scores on the grandiose/manipulative dimension, the callous/unemotional dimension, and the impulsive/irresponsible dimension (normal group). The second group scored moderate on the grandiose/manipulative dimension and the callous/unemotional dimension and high on the impulsive/irresponsible dimension (impulsive, non-psychopathic-like group). The third group scored high on all three dimensions (psychopathy-like group). The findings revealed that the impulsive, non-psychopathic like group scored significantly higher on internalizing problem behavior compared to the normal group, while the psychopathy-like and the impulsive, non-psychopathic-like group both scored higher on externalizing problem behavior compared to the normal group. Based on a self-report delinquency measure, it appeared that the psychopathy-like group had the highest delinquency rates, except for vandalism. Both the impulsive and psychopathy-like group had the highest scores on the use of soft drugs.

AB This study examined the moderating effects of family conflict and gender on the relationship between community violence and psychosocial development at age 18. The study sample consisted of 728 children and families who were part of the Infant Health and Development Program study of low-birth-weight, pre-term infants. In this sample, adolescent psychosocial outcomes were predicted by community violence differently for male and female children and based on their experiences of conflict at home. For male children, being in a high conflict family as a child exacerbated the negative effects of community violence such that internalizing problems (depression and anxiety) and risk-taking behaviors increased as community violence increased, while being in a low conflict family protected the child against the negative impacts of the community. For female adolescents, there were no moderating effects of family conflict on the relationship between community violence and externalizing problems. Moderating effects for internalizing problems demonstrated that being in low conflict families did not serve as protection against community violence for girls as was demonstrated for boys. These findings demonstrate the long-term effects of community violence on child development, highlighting the importance of gender and family context in the development of internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Several studies suggest that a two-factor model positing internalizing and externalizing factors explains the interrelationships among psychiatric disorders. However, it is unclear whether the covariation between internalizing and externalizing disorders is due to common genetic or environmental influences. We examined whether a model positing two latent factors, internalizing and externalizing, explained the interrelationships among six psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder) in adolescents, and whether there are common genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing latent factors. Multivariate behavior genetic analyses of data from 1162 twin pairs and 426 siblings ascertained from the general population via the Colorado Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence (CADD) were conducted. We found support for a model positing two latent factors (internalizing and externalizing). These factors were moderately heritable and influenced by significant common genetic and nonshared environmental influences. These findings suggest that co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in adolescents results from both genetic and environmental influences.

AB Background: Family history is a major risk factor for child problem behaviour, yet few studies have examined the association between grandparental psychiatric disorder and child problem behaviour. Results are inconsistent as to whether the effect of grandparental depression on child problem behaviour is independent of parental psychopathology.
   Methods: Mothers and their children participated in an ethnically Dutch subcohort of a population-based prospective cohort in the Netherlands. N = 816 (66%) mothers and n = 691 fathers participated in the prenatal interviews. N = 687 (84%) mothers and children and n = 565 (82%) fathers participated three years postpartum. (Grand)parental psychopathology was assessed during pregnancy of the mothers with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Child behaviour was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by mother and father when the child was three years old.
   Results: Grandparental anxiety disorder predicted maternal reports of children's internalizing problems (OR = 1.98,95% CI. (1.20, 3.28), p-value<0.01) and externalizing problems (OR = 1.73, 95% C.I. (1.04, 2.87), p-value = 0.03), independent of parental psychopathology. Results were similar for grandparental depression; internalizing OR = 1.75,95% C.I (1.11, 2.75), p-value = 0.02 and externalizing OR = 1.67, 95% C.I. (1.05, 2.64) p-value = 0.03. However, grandparental psychopathology was not associated with children's problem behaviour as reported by the father.
   Limitations: Information on grandparental lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed through a parental interview which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence rates.
   Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of a family history including not only the parental but also the grandparental generations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background:
   Experience in institutional/orphanage care has been linked to increased mental health problems. Research suggests that children adopted from institutions experience specific difficulties related to inattention/overactivity. Evidence of internalizing and conduct problems relative to non-adopted peers has been found in early childhood and early adolescence, but problems may not differ from other adopted children. This study clarifies the understanding of behavioral and emotional symptoms of post-institutionalized (PI) children during middle childhood.
   Methods:
   Eight- to eleven-year-old PI children (n = 68) and two comparison groups, children internationally adopted from foster care (n = 74) and non-adopted children (n = 76), and their parents completed the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), externalizing, and internalizing symptoms. Group means for symptom level and number of children with symptoms above clinical cutoffs were compared.
   Results:
   PI children displayed an increased level of ADHD symptoms per parent report. PI child and parent report indicated a higher number of PI children above clinical ADHD cutoff. Both groups of internationally adopted (IA) children had higher levels of externalizing symptoms relative to non-adopted children, with parent report indicating higher numbers of IA children above the externalizing clinical threshold. Informants differed in their report of internalizing symptoms. Parents indicated that both IA groups displayed increased internalizing symptom levels and greater numbers above clinical threshold; however, children reported this to be true only for the PI group.
   Conclusions:
   PI children differ from non-adopted peers across symptom domains in middle childhood. Whether these concerns were more broadly associated with international adoption rather than institutional care depended on symptom domain and informant. An understanding of this variability may be beneficial for treatment and intervention.

AB This preliminary investigation examined the efficacy of a game-based cognitive-behavioral therapy group program for elementary school-aged children who have experienced sexual abuse. Treatment aimed to improve: (a) internalizing symptoms, (b) externalizing behaviors, (c) sexually inappropriate behaviors, (d) social skills deficits, (e) self-esteem problems, and (1) knowledge of healthy sexuality and self-protection skills. Results indicate that game-based cognitive-behavioral therapy was effective for improving internalizing and externalizing symptoms, reducing sexually inappropriate behaviors, and improving children's knowledge of abuse and self-protection skills. Although results pointed in a positive direction for social skills and self-perception, these findings were not statistically significant. Clinical significance was also evaluated to assess the clinical utility of treatment effects. Treatment implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.

AB Parental locus of control refers to parents' perceived power and efficacy in child-rearing situations. This study explored parental locus of control and its correlates in 160 mothers of children ages 8 to 14 cross-sectionally and 1 year later. Maternal depression, maternal expressed emotion, and child internalizing and externalizing behavior were examined, along with a number of sociodemographic factors. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that external parental locus of control was associated with child externalizing behavior, maternal depression, less maternal education, lower income, and older maternal age. Longitudinal analyses showed that child age and externalizing behavior also predicted increases in external parental locus of control 1 year later. Finally, lower income and less parental perceived control predicted increases in child externalizing behavior over time.

AB The present study first examined the links between reactive temperament (negative affectivity), regulative temperament (effortful control [EC]) and internalizing problems in adolescents (12-18 years) with anxiety disorders (ANX; N=39) and without anxiety disorders (nANX; N=35). Links differed between ANX and nANX participants. Negative affectivity predicted internalizing problems, with almost no role of EC in nANX, but a protective role of EC was found in ANX youth. Second, we investigated the role of attentional bias as a mediator between temperament and internalizing problems. Strategic threat-related bias was predicted by initial attention and EC, but these relations differed in both groups. In nANX participants, higher initial bias scores were predictive for lower strategic bias scores and higher levels of EC were associated with higher bias scores. In ANX participants, there was almost no effect of initial bias or EC on strategic attention. Internalizing problems were predicted by strategic attention, but again differently in ANX and nANX participants. High strategic bias scores were associated with an increase in anxiety in ANX and a decrease in anxiety in nANX participants.

AB This study was designed to examine the contribution of multiple risk factors to early internalizing problems and to investigate whether family and ecological context moderated the association between child temperament and internalizing outcomes. A sample of 1,202 mothers of 2- and 3-year-old children completed a survey of child social-emotional functioning, family environment, and violence exposure. Child temperament, maternal affective symptoms, and family expressiveness were associated with child anxiety and depression problems. Violence exposure was related only to child anxiety. When maternal affective symptoms were elevated, inhibited girls but not boys were rated as more anxious and youngsters with heightened negative emotionality were rated as more depressed. Family expressiveness moderated the association between inhibited temperament and anxiety symptoms.

AB The Youth Self Report (YSR) is a widely used measure of youth emotional and behavioral problems. Although the YSR was designed for youths ages 11 to 18, no studies have systematically evaluated whether youths younger than age 11 can make valid reports on this measure. This study thus examined the reliability and validity of the YSR scales scores for younger (ages 7-10; n=184) and older (ages 11-14; n=147) youths. Results demonstrated that younger youths were able to provide reliable reports on the YSR broad band (Internalizing, Externalizing) scales, though less so on the narrow band scales. Across all scales, the externalizing scales performed more favorably than the internalizing scales among both younger and older youth. Younger youths' DSM-oriented scales corresponded significantly with DSM diagnoses.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the tripartite model of depression and anxiety in a community-based sample of 278 African American adolescents (M age=12.89) from low-income communities and to identify stressors and coping strategies that were associated with the specific features of each disorder. Participants reported on depression, anxiety, stressors, and coping strategies. As predicted, the three-factor structure of the tripartite model was a valid representation of anxiety and depression in African American youth. Further, stressors and coping strategies showed specific associations to features of depression and anxiety. The findings provide evidence of factors that may help to distinguish between internalizing symptoms in African American youth.

AB Family-related stressors pose special challenges for adolescents of Mexican origin, given traditional cultural norms that compel youths to get involved with family problems despite their limited ability to effect change. The current study examines the prospective effects of coping strategies (i.e., active, distraction, avoidance, support-seeking, and religious coping) on psychological symptoms in the context of family stress with a sample (N=189) of Mexican Origin adolescents (11-14). Hypotheses on the limits of coping were partially supported. Stress-coping interaction effects were further moderated by gender. Stress-buffering effect of active coping for internalizing symptoms was only found for girls and only at low levels of family stress for boys. Support-seeking and distraction coping both increased internalizing symptoms for boys at high levels of family stress.

AB We investigated how mothers' and fathers' depressed mood and father-child and mother-child relationship predicted preschool children's problem behavior. The sample was 11,286 continuously intact, two-parent biological families of the United Kingdom's Millennium Cohort Study. We found that mother-child relationship and maternal depressed mood had larger effects on children's problem behavior than father-child relationship and paternal depressed mood. The effect of paternal depressed mood was completely mediated by quality of father-child relationship. There were significant moderator effects but only on internalizing problems. There was little evidence to suggest that, among children of this developmental stage, quality of father-child relationship buffers the effect of contextual risk (i.e., promotes resilience). Quality of mother-child relationship, in contrast, buffered the effect of socioeconomic disadvantage but only on emotional symptoms.

AB This study extends the determinants of parenting model to adolescent mothers by examining how adolescent mother-grandmother psychological conflict and perceptions of infant fussiness from birth through age 2 years relate to children's problem behaviors at age 7. Participants were 181 adolescent mother, child, and grandmother triads living in multigenerational households and recruited at delivery. Psychological conflict was characterized by two stable trajectories. In multivariate models that included maternal depression, both psychological conflict and perceptions of infant fussiness predicted externalizing behavior at age 7. Perceptions of infant fussiness, but not psychological conflict, predicted internalizing behavior at age 7.

AB International comparisons were conducted of preschool children's behavioral and emotional problems as reported on the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 11/2-5 by parents in 24 societies (N=19,850). Item ratings were aggregated into scores on syndromes; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales; a Stress Problems scale; and Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems scales. Effect sizes for scale score differences among the 24 societies ranged from small to medium (3-12%). Although societies differed greatly in language, culture, and other characteristics, Total Problems scores for 18 of the 24 societies were within 7.1 points of the omnicultural mean of 33.3 (on a scale of 0-198). Gender and age differences, as well as gender and age interactions with society, were all very small (effect sizes1%). Across all pairs of societies, correlations between mean item ratings averaged .78, and correlations between internal consistency alphas for the scales averaged .92, indicating that the rank orders of mean item ratings and internal consistencies of scales were very similar across diverse societies.

AB This study investigated how parenting accounted for interindividual differences in developmental trajectories of different child behaviors across childhood and adolescence. In a cohort sequential community sample of 1,049 children, latent class growth analysis was applied to three parent-reported dimensions (monitoring, positive parenting, inconsistent discipline) across 12 annual assessments (ages 6-18). Four longitudinal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, uninvolved) were differentiated on the basis of levels and rates of change in the constituent parenting dimensions. Multigroup analyses demonstrated that these parenting styles were differentially related to changes in parent- and child-reported measures of children's alcohol and cigarette use, antisocial behavior, and internalizing symptoms, with the authoritative parenting class being related to the most optimal long-term development.

AB This study tested the Adaptation to Poverty-related Stress Model and its proposed relations between poverty-related stress, effortful and involuntary stress responses, and symptoms of psychopathology in an ethnically diverse sample of low-income children and their parents. Prospective Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses conducted with 98 families (300 family members: 136 adults, 82 adolescents and preadolescents, 82 school-age children) revealed that, consistent with the model, primary and secondary control coping were protective against poverty-related stress primarily for internalizing symptoms. Conversely, disengagement coping exacerbated externalizing symptoms over time. In addition, involuntary engagement stress responses exacerbated the effects of poverty-related stress for internalizing symptoms, whereas involuntary disengagement responses exacerbated externalizing symptoms. Age and gender effects were found in most models, reflecting more symptoms of both types for parents than children and higher levels of internalizing symptoms for girls.

AB This article reports on the first study to investigate interparent agreement when the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is used to assess school-aged children. It is also the first study conducted in China on agreement between parents reporting on their child. Both parents of 380 girls and 320 boys completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Chinese version). Because reliabilities were poor, the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity/Inattention subscales were merged to form an Externalizing Problems subscale, and the Peer Problems subscale as an independent variable was omitted from analyses. Consistent with past research, moderate to strong correlations were found between mother and father reports for emotional and behavioral problems, although interparent agreement was better for externalizing problems than internalizing problems for both girls and boys. Mothers reported significantly higher scores than fathers for prosocial behaviors for their sons. Findings suggest that, in general, one parent's report will be similar to the other's when the SDQ is used in the form adapted for this study. More work on the psychometric properties of the SDQ is needed in China.

AB The prevention of and early intervention with internalizing problems are vital to children's overall health and development. Schools are strongly considered a venue where these services can be provided. The Strong Kids program was developed to increase youths' resiliency. This study examined the efficacy of Strong Kids with middle school students in terms of knowledge of healthy social-emotional behaviors, reduction in internalizing symptoms, and the exploratory use of performance feedback with features of motivational interviewing. Students who participated in the program significantly increased their knowledge. Negative symptoms did not change. Teachers implemented the program with strong fidelity. It is unclear at this time the extent to which it is necessary to use performance feedback with features of motivational interviewing to improve the implementation of highly structured social-emotional learning programs.

AB Guided by the emotional security hypothesis and the cognitive-contextual framework, the authors investigated whether the associations between negative parental conflict resolution styles and children's internalizing and externalizing problems were mediated by children's appraisals of threat and self-blame and their emotion regulation. Participants were 192 Swiss 2-parent families with children aged 9-12 years (M age= 10.62 years, SD= 0.41 years). Structural equation modeling was used to test the empirical validity of the theoretical model. Results indicated that children's maladaptive emotion regulation mediated the association between negative parental conflict resolution styles and children's internalizing as well as externalizing problems. Whereas perceived threat was related only to children's internalizing problems, self-blame did not mediate the links between negative parental conflict resolution styles and children's adjustment. Implications for understanding the mechanisms by which exposure to interparental conflict could lead to children's maladjustment and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB To examine the reciprocal relations between teacher-child relationships and children's behavior problems, the authors analyzed cross-lagged longitudinal data on teacher-child relationships and children's internalizing and externalizing problems using a structural equation modeling approach. The homeroom teachers of 105 first-year preschoolers aged 2-3 years filled in the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale and the Child Behavior Checklist/2-3, first at 3 months after the children's preschool entrance and then at the end of the first preschool year. Results showed significant cross-wave reciprocal relations between externalizing problems and teacher-child conflict and significant cross-wave relation from early internalizing problems to later teacher-child conflict. However, the cross-wave associations between internalizing and externalizing problems and teacher-child closeness were not significant.

AB This study uses data from 2,309 biological fathers who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS) to examine associations between psychosocial characteristics and levels of corporal punishment (CP) toward their 3-year-old children over the past month. Results indicate that 61% of the fathers reported no CP over the past month, 23% reported using CP once or twice, and 16% reported using CP a few times in the past month or more. In multivariate models controlling for important sociodemographic factors as well as characteristics of the child, fathers' parenting stress, major depression, heavy alcohol use, and drug use were significantly associated with greater use of CP, whereas involvement with the child and generalized anxiety disorder were not. Girls were less likely to be the recipient of CP than were boys, and child externalizing behavior problems but not internalizing behavior problems were associated with more CP.

AB This article presents the results of a meta-analysis of the empirical literature on anxious symptomatology among school-aged students with learning disabilities (LD) in comparison to their non-LD peers. Fifty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Results indicate that students with LD had higher mean scores on measures of anxiety than did non-LD students. The overall effect size was statistically significant and medium in magnitude (d = .61) although substantial heterogeneity of results was found. Moderator effects were examined for informant type, gender, grade, publication status, and identification source. Informant type (i.e., self-, parent, or teacher report) explained a significant amount of variability in the sample of studies, and identification source (i.e., school identified or special school and clinic/hospital identified) approached statistical significance. Implications for assessment and intervention are discussed.

AB To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL) and Social-Emotional/Behavioral functioning of survivors treated on the "Head Start I" protocol at participating medical centers across the United States between 1991 and 1997. Parents of 25 of 27 (92.5%) patients completed the Child Health Questionnaire PF-50 (CHQ), to assess their child's QoL, along with the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), to assess their social-emotional/behavioral functioning, after a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (range 13-96 months). Nineteen (76%) of the 25 parents subsequently completed the same instruments after a mean of 11.6 years (range 90-181 months), three (12%) patients died of disease and three (12%) were lost to follow-up. Mean Physical and Psychosocial QoL Summary Scores on the CHQ at Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) were within the normal range. Of the ten individual means for CHQ subscales, nine were within normal limits with the exception of Parental Emotional Impact at T1 and General Health at T2. Additionally, mean scores on the BASC at T1 and T2 were within normal limits for Externalizing and Internalizing Behaviors as well as Adaptive Skills. Serial analyses between T1 and T2 revealed non-significant changes over time with the exception of decreased General Health on the CHQ. The lack of QoL and Social-Emotional/Behavioral deficits suggests that the Head Start I protocol, involving intensive induction followed by myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell rescue in order to avoid or delay cranial irradiation, provides encouraging pilot data warranting continued monitoring.

AB Objective While studies of the effects of prenatal smoking on child psychopathology have found positive relationships, most studies (1) failed to control for a range of correlates of maternal smoking that could affect children's behavior; (2) have been conducted with school-age rather than younger children, so it is not clear when such problems emerge; and (3) have not examined the effects on internalizing problems. Method This study examined the effects of prenatal smoke exposure on behaviors associated with externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and negative temperament in a diverse community sample of 679 4-year-olds. Results After controlling for correlates that include socioeconomic status, life stress, family conflict, maternal depression, maternal scaffolding skills, mother-child attachment, child negative affect and effortful control, smoking during pregnancy was no longer associated with child behavior or emotional problems. Conclusions Future studies need to control for a wide range of covariates of maternal smoking.

AB Objective To examine heart rate (HR) responses to and coping with stress in children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), anxiety, and healthy controls. Methods A clinical sample (children with RAP and children with anxiety) was compared to control children on self-reported and HR responses to stress and a laboratory test of pain tolerance and intensity (cold pressor). Results Children in the clinical sample had elevated HRs compared to healthy controls before, during, and after laboratory tasks. Self-reported stress reactivity to social stress was positively correlated with HR at all study time intervals. Secondary control coping with social stress was negatively correlated with HR at most study time intervals. Internalizing symptoms were positively correlated with HR and self-reported stress reactivity. Conclusions Stress reactivity, as reflected in both self-reported and HR responses to laboratory stressors, is related to the presence of both RAP and anxiety in children.

AB A long-standing issue in child clinical research is the integration of various informants, but this topic has not been comprehensively applied to the domain of child personality. Mothers and fathers rated their children (N = 346) on personality traits and behavioral problems. Mother-father agreement was highest for Conscientiousness and lowest for Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Each parent's ratings added incremental variance in predicting behavioral problems, and mother-father discrepancy predicted internalizing problems. These results suggest that both parents should be used as informants in child personality assessment and discrepancies might reflect meaningful variance with clinical utility.

Our review includes a summary of studies examining the associations between neighborhood poverty and adolescent identity development followed by a review of studies addressing both direct and indirect linking among neighborhood poverty to academic achievement as well as internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Available neighborhood studies that examined physical health disparities, as well as genetic and environmental influences on adolescent development, were also included. Within each section we summarize findings that address the direct and indirect effects of neighborhood poverty. We conclude with promising strategies for future research, including recommendations for addressing theoretical and methodological issues that continue to plague this field of research.

AB The present study examines the associations between coping efforts and psychological (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and behavioral adjustment in a sample of 373 male juvenile offenders (ages 14-17) during the first month of incarceration. Social support seeking was associated with a more rapid decline in internalizing symptoms and lower levels of externalizing symptoms. Acceptance had a stress-buffering effect with regard to internalizing symptoms, whereas denial predicted higher levels of these symptoms. The only coping variable related to violent behavior was active coping, which was associated with lower rates of violent offending among youth with any violent incidents. The importance of fostering coping skills and increasing positive coping options for incarcerated adolescents is discussed.

AB This study investigated the impact of anxiety and depression on sexual activity and substance use behaviors in a sample of 56 community- (traditional living arrangements) and foster care-dwelling adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. It was hypothesized that higher levels of anxiety and depression would be related to higher rates of risky sexual activity and substance use. Regression analyses were used to examine impact of the internalizing predictors on the risky behaviors. Results of the sample were presented with group membership emerging as a robust predictor of both sexual activity and substance use. Results suggest that adolescents within out-of-home care are at increased risk for engaging in these behaviors when compared with community-dwelling peers, and they may benefit from specific interventions aimed at decreasing participation. Future research may focus on assessing the effectiveness of interventions for these youth.

AB This study explores how adult survivors of chronic abuse and neglect define pleasure, the disruption of pleasure, and the repair of the capacity for pleasure in the context of the therapeutic relationship. Using narrative methodology, I interviewed 15 clinical pairs of patients and their therapists separately. Thematic analysis revealed 8 findings. All patients reported the capacity to experience pleasure throughout life prior to therapy. Subjects defined pleasure as a variety of positive affects that fell into 2 categories: pleasure in activities and interests and pleasure in relationships. All patients reported a history of traumatic disruption of pleasure in childhood. Patients reported a history of internalizing and reenacting their own disruption of pleasure. Narratives of the patients were consistent with the narratives told by the therapists. In many clinical pairs, both parties spoke positively of an important therapeutic event when the therapist stepped out of his or her usual treatment frame. Safety, consistency, reliability, predictability, and compassionate caring were spoken of throughout the sample as elements that created a pleasurable and therapeutically reparative relationship. Patients spoke repeatedly of the importance of "finding a self" to the experience of pleasure. Pleasure enhanced the ability to find a self, and finding a self enhanced patients' capacity for pleasure. This study invites further research to investigate the function of pleasure in the process of therapeutic repair for chronically traumatized populations.

AB Foster children often have experienced early traumatization and various psychosocial and biological risk factors. Especially the high prevalence of reactive attachment disorders in foster children is often described as a consequence of stressful relationship experiences in their families of origin. Traumatic experiences were assessed with the Essener Trauma Inventory for Children (ETI-KJ-F) as part of an epidemiological survey. Additionally, the German versions of the Relationship Problems Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used. Data from 275 foster children aged 5 to 16 years were analyzed (M = 10.98 years; SD = 3.26). 69 % of the foster children had experienced a relational traumatic event. When subjects were grouped based on the experience of a relational trauma, significant mean differences were found concerning the extent of relationship problems and psychopathological symptoms according to the CBCL (controlled for gender, age, duration of foster relationship, and number of placement changes). The two groups differed especially in terms of inhibited attachment and internalizing symptoms. The number of placement changes influenced these variables as well. The high prevalence of trauma in foster children and the high association with relationship problems and psychopathology indicate how important a "trauma-sensitive" agenda for support and corresponding counselling and training of the foster parents are.

AB This study evaluates the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral prevention program for children with internalizing symptoms. A modified German version of the Australian FRIENDS program was applied in an indicated prevention context and evaluated using a single group-waiting list design. 81 children (42 boys) aged 8-12 years were assessed using parent (CBCL) and child reports (SCAS; DIKJ). Data collection was conducted 3 months prior to, at onset and after intervention. The results indicate that the program is effective; symptom score reductions during intervention were significantly better than in the waiting list group. Medium effect sizes were found for parent (d = .72) and child reports (d = .55).

AB Background: We previously reported an association between prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) and childhood behavior problems as observed by the parent or caretaker. However, these behavior problems may not manifest in a structured environment, such as a school setting.
   Objective: We determined whether there is an association between PCE and school behavior problems and whether ratings of behavior problems from the teacher differ from those noted by the parent or caretaker.
   Methods: The Maternal Lifestyle Study, a multicenter study, enrolled 1388 children with and without PCE at one month of age for longitudinal assessment Teachers masked to prenatal drug exposure status completed the Teacher Report Form (TRF/6-18) when children were 7, 9, and 11 years old. We also administered the Child Behavior Checklist-parent report (CBCL) to the parent/caretaker at same ages and then at 13 years. We performed latent growth curve modeling to determine whether high PCE will predict externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems at 7 years of age and whether changes in problems' scores over time differ between those exposed and non-exposed from both teacher and parent report. Besides levels of PCE as predictors, we controlled for the following covariates, namely: site, child characteristics (gender and other prenatal drug exposures), family level influences (maternal age, depression and psychological symptomatology, continuing drug use, exposure to domestic violence, home environment and socioeconomic status), and community level factors (neighborhood and community violence).
   Results: The mean behavior problem T scores from the teacher report were significantly higher than ratings by the parent or caretaker. Latent growth curve modeling revealed a significant relationship between intercepts of problem T scores from teacher and parent ratings; i.e., children that were rated poorly by teachers were also rated poorly by their parent/caretaker or vice versa. After controlling for covariates, we found high PCE to be a significant predictor of higher externalizing behavior problem T scores from both parent and teacher report at 7 years (p = 0.034 and p = 0.021, respectively) in comparison to non-PCE children. These differences in scores from either teacher or caregiver were stable through subsequent years or did not change significantly over time. Boys had higher T scores than girls on internalizing and total problems by caretaker report; they also had significantly higher T scores for internalizing, total, and attention problems by teacher ratings; the difference was marginally significant for externalizing behavior (p = 0.070). Caretaker postnatal use of tobacco, depression, and community violence were significant predictors of all behavior problems rated by parent/caretaker, while lower scores on the home environment predicted all behavior outcomes by the teacher report.
   Conclusions: Children with high PCE are likely to manifest externalizing behavior problems; their behavior problem scores at 7 years from either report of teacher or parent remained higher than scores of non-exposed children on subsequent years. Screening and identification of behavior problems at earlier ages could make possible initiation of intervention, while considering the likely effects of other confounders. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB OBJECTIVE: Greater maternal prepregnancy adiposity has been associated with behavioral problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and lower intellectual function in offspring. However, few studies of humans have explored this, and it is unclear if intrauterine mechanisms or confounding factors drive these associations.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parental adiposity and offspring verbal skills, nonverbal skills, and behavioral problems were assessed in the British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = similar to 5000) and Dutch Generation R (N = similar to 2500) cohorts. We aimed to determine the plausibility of intrauterine effects by (1) adjusting for multiple confounders, (2) comparing associations between maternal and paternal overweight with offspring cognition/behaviors, and (3) searching for cross-cohort consistency.
   RESULTS: Maternal prepregnancy overweight was associated with reduced child verbal skills (unadjusted). However, after adjusting for confounders, this result was not consistently observed in both cohorts. Maternal overweight was also associated with child total behavior problems and externalizing problems even after adjusting for confounders. However, this was observed in Generation R only and was not replicated in the British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. No associations of maternal overweight with child attention problems, emotional/internalizing problems, or nonverbal skills were observed in either cohort. Paternal overweight was not associated with any of the child outcomes but was also less strongly related to potential confounding factors than was maternal overweight.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little consistent evidence of intrauterine effects of maternal prepregnancy overweight on child cognition and behavior. Some associations initially observed were not consistently replicated across cohorts or robust to adjustment for confounding factors and, thus, are likely to reflect confounding by socioeconomic or postnatal factors.

AB Background. Different theories of the link between socio-economic status (SES) and mental illness have been postulated. In particular, two theories of this association, social causation and social selection, differ in the implied causal pathway. The authors employ behavior genetic modeling to consider evidence for both social selection and social causation in the relationship between income variation and internalizing disorders.
   Method. Behavior genetic modeling was used to estimate the presence of gene-environment interaction (GxE, social causation) in the presence of gene-environment correlation (rGE, social selection). Participants were members of a sample of 719 twin pairs from the Midlife in the United States study. Four internalizing (INT) syndromes were assessed : major depression (MD); generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); panic attacks (PA); neuroticism (N). SES was measured with total family household income.
   Results. One factor best accounted for the variance shared between MD, GAD, PA and N. The etiology of variation in INT changed from high to low levels of income, with unique environmental factors playing a larger role in INT variation at lower levels of income. Across levels of income, rGE between income and INT was modest (low income r(a)=0.39 to high income r(a)=0.54), implying a selection process operating through genetic effects linking lower income with INT psychopathology.
   Conclusions. Findings support social causation by suggesting that low income contributes significantly to environmental variation in INT. Modest support was found for social selection, but should be extended using longitudinal designs. Effective interventions for internalizing psychopathology may differ depending on income.

AB This study focuses on parental stress and considers children's temperament and behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing symptomatology) as possible predictors. Emotionality, activity and shyness were included as dimensions of temperament. Participants of the study were 616 parents of first to fourth grade elementary school children. The parents were asked about their child's temperament, internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and their degree of parental stress. In order to test for biases in parental reports of their child's internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, additional self reports of a subsample of 104 third and fourth graders were collected. The results show a significant relation between the parental ratings of their child's emotionality and parental stress. Mediator analyses revealed an incomplete mediation for the symptomatology assessments of the parents as well as of the children (in the case of the children only for externalizing symptomatology). This means that the relationship between emotionality and parental stress can in part, but not completely be explained by the symptomatology assessments. The results underline the significance of the temperament dimension emotionality for children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as for the perceived parental stress.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between parental loss, trusting relationship with current caregivers, and psychosocial adjustment among children affected by AIDS in China. In this study, cross- sectional data were collected from 755 AIDS orphans (296 double orphans and 459 single orphans), 466 vulnerable children living with HIV- infected parents, and 404 comparison children in China. The trusting relationship with current caregivers was measured with a 15- item scale (Cronbach's a 0.84) modified from the Trusting Relationship Questionnaire developed by Mustillo et al. in 2005 (Quality of relationships between youth and community service providers: Reliability and validity of the trusting relationship questionnaire. Journal of Child and Family Studies, 14, 577590). The psychosocial measures include rule compliance/acting out, anxiety/ withdrawal, peer social skills, school interest, depressive symptoms, loneliness, self- esteem, future expectation, hopefulness about future, and perceived control over the future. Group mean comparisons using analysis of variance suggested a significant association (p<0.0001) between the trusting relationship with current caregivers and all the psychosocial measures, except anxiety and depression. These associations remained significant in General Linear Model analysis, controlling for children's gender, age, family socioeconomic status, orphan status (orphans, vulnerable children, and comparison children), and appropriate interaction terms among factor variables. The findings in the current study support the global literature on the importance of attachment relationship with caregivers in promoting children's psychosocial development. Future prevention intervention efforts to improve AIDS orphans' psychosocial well-being will need to take into consideration the quality of the child's attachment relationships with current caregivers and help their current caregivers to improve the quality of care for these children. Future study is needed to explore the possible reasons for the lack of association between a trusting relationship and some internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression among children affected by HIV/AIDS.

AB As the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) is often used to aid in diagnosis it is important to discern how children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) score on the BASC-2 compared to typically developing controls. This study compared scores of typically developing children and adolescents to those diagnosed with ASD on all subscales and composites of the BASC-2. Except for the aggression subscale, anxiety subscale, and the internalizing composite, the ASD group scored significantly higher on all clinical subscales and composites (i.e., hyperactivity, conduct problems, externalizing composite, depression, atypicality, withdrawal, attention problems, and the Behavioral Symptoms Index). However, the ASD group scored significantly lower on the adaptability composite and all subscales comprising this composite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effortful control is the regulative dimension of temperament, and plays an important role in the etiology of internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. Temperamental traits are thought to be constitutional, but could also be modified by experience. If maternal parenting is an environmental experience for adolescents' regulative temperamental trait, it should account for effortful control differences between siblings growing up in the same family even after the genetic effect on adolescents' effortful control is taken into account. This hypothesis was tested in 585 pairs of Chinese monozygotic (MZ) twins. Results revealed that within MZ pairs, the twin receiving more warm, nurturant-involved maternal parenting and less hostile, harsh-inconsistent maternal parenting had a higher level of effortful control. These results suggest that markedly different maternal parenting situations, such as a nonshared environment, have an effect on adolescents' effortful control. Although effortful control is constitutional, it may be modifiable by experience of parenting.

AB Community violence exposure among youth can lead to various negative outcomes, including post-traumatic stress symptoms. Research in the Western world indicates that a number of social support factors may moderate the relation between violence exposure and internalizing symptoms. Little research has been carried out in non-Western countries. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the relations among violence exposure, parental warmth, positive school climate, and post-traumatic stress reactions among youth in The Republic of The Gambia, Africa.
   A school-based survey of youth behaviors, feelings, attitudes, and perceptions was administered to 653 students at senior secondary schools in four Gambian communities.
   Students reported high levels of exposure to violence. Over half of students reported witnessing someone threatened with serious physical harm, beaten up or mugged, attacked or stabbed with a knife/piece of glass, or seriously wounded in an incident of violence. Nearly half of students reported being beaten up or mugged during the past year, and nearly a quarter reported being threatened with serious physical harm. There were no sex differences in levels of exposure. Traumatic stress symptoms were common, especially among females. Both violence witnessing and violent victimization significantly predicted post-traumatic stress symptoms, and positive school climate moderated the relationship. Among youth victimized by violence, positive school climate was most strongly correlated with lower levels of post-traumatic stress at low levels of exposure. Among youth who had witnessed violence, positive school climate was most strongly correlated with lower levels of post-traumatic stress at high levels of exposure.
   Community-based programs that bring together parents, schools, and youth may play an important role in combating the negative effects of some types of violence exposure among Gambian youth. Youth experiencing high levels of violent victimization represent a sample of particular concern and merit special research and clinical attention.

   SAMPLE
AB Violence exposure has a significant impact on victims' psychological well-being. This study examined the relationship between two types of violence exposures (threats and physical assaults), coping styles (emotion focused, avoidant, and problem focused), gender, and depression among 211 (147 females and 64 males) young urban adults (ages 18-24). Most participants (60%) endorsed being physically assaulted, whereas many (40%) endorsed being threatened. Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted. As hypothesized, women reported using more emotion-focused coping and reported greater depression than men. Avoidant coping was a predictor for increased depression for both men and women. However, women who employed problem-focused coping after their first physical assault reported lower rates of depression. These findings have implications for designing early interventions.

AB This study examines the relationships among variables that were likely to mediate the effects of exposure to domestic violence on children's internalizing problems (i.e., children's appraisals of domestic violence and their perceptions of family relationships). The study was conducted with 79 children exposed to domestic violence, including 41 boys and 38 girls, aged between 9 and 12 years old. Indicators used for children's appraisals of violence were attribution of blame and perceived threat. Children's perceptions of family relationships were based on their levels of parentification and the degree of their loyalty conflicts. A path analysis was used to verify the predictive model's pathways and to test the multiple mediator effects. Findings confirm the contribution of mediating variables and also reflect the association between self-blame and children's parentification. The results stress the relevance of evaluating the combined role of different potential mediators to provide a better understanding of the impact of domestic violence on children.
