AB Some past conceptualizations in family research have synthesized the constructs of family cohesion and enmeshment by placing enmeshment al the high extreme end of cohesion. In this article, we argue that, theoretically, the 2 are different constructs-cohesion is a measure of supportive interaction, and enmeshment is a measure of psychological control. We examine this hypothesis by testing the associations between adolescent reports of family cohesion and enmeshment and several measures of adolescent problem behaviors using a sample of 471 students in preadolescence and early and middle adolescence from a suburb of a city in the South. Results show that cohesion is associated negatively with both internalizing and externalizing adolescent problem behaviors. Enmeshment is related positively with youth problems, and more strongly with internalizing problems. Furthermore, different patterns of interaction emerge among the 2 family variables and the adolescents' grade in school and sex.

ID CHILDREN
AB Objective: An extended series of 100 children with elective mutism (EM) was clinically analyzed. Method: The total sample included two subgroups of clinically referred children at different locations and a subgroup of nonreferred children with EM. The study was based on comprehensive item sheets and, in the nonreferred sample only, the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: EM is a rare disorder in the referred child psychiatric samples. It typically starts at preschool age, is more common in girls, and is seen in all social strata. A background of migration and early developmental risk factors is also quite common. Premorbid speech and language disorders play a role in one third of the clientele, and three quarters of children with EM had behavioral abnormalities during infancy and preschool age. School and unfamiliar people create the social context in which children with EM most frequently do not speak. Shyness and internalizing behavior problems are the most common personality features in EM, and comorbid diagnoses are quite frequent. Conclusion: This large series of affected children has identified the most typical features of EM and thereby extends the limited knowledge of this rare disorder of childhood.

AB Effects of family status on the trajectory of problematic temperament-adjustment at I to 10 years of age and associated psychiatric disturbance 8 years later were examined in an epidemiological sample of 648 children. After adjusting for predivorce temperament-adjustment and background factors, logistic regression yielded independent effects of single custodial mother (SCM) family status for increased risk of disruptive and anxiety disorders, and of stepfamily status for increased risk of disruptive disorders. Increased risk of psychiatric disorders was more pervasive for SCM family boys versus intact family boys than for SCM family girls versus intact family girls, however only significantly more so for depression. No significant sex interaction was observed for stepfamily status. When girls and boys were treated independently, patterns of family status and outcomes of internalizing disorders varied. In stepfamilies, an elevated risk of depression and anxiety disorders was observed in girls but not boys, whereas in SCM families an elevated risk of depression was observed in boys but not girls. Within each family status group there was support for an altered risk of later psychiatric disorders given specific problematic predivorce temperament-adjustment characteristics. Implications for future research and treatment are discussed.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to document associations among problem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence and several health risk behaviors in middle adolescence, including a cumulative index of sexual intercourse risk.
   Method: A nontreatment sample of 1167 10th and 11th grade students was recruited from three homogenous suburban high schools in western New York. Intercourse activity and number of sexual partners were assessed four times at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period via self-report questionnaires administered in classroom settings.
   Results: Sexual intercourse activity, once initiated, was found to be relatively persistent, rather than sporadic, for most adolescents. Repeated intercourse experience with multiple partners over the assessed time periods was associated with higher levels of externalizing childhood behavior problems, earlier onset of antisocial behaviors and substance use, and higher concurrent substance use. An avoidant, withdrawn behavioral style in childhood was associated with lower rates of sexual involvement in adolescence.
   Conclusions: Temporal linkages among childhood precursors and adolescent sexual behaviors were identified as critical to understanding adolescent risk behaviors. These cross-time relationships may identify potential targets for future intervention/prevention efforts among high risk subsamples of children and adolescents.

AB We assessed the delay of gratification behavior of 428 twelve- and thirteen-year-old boys, half of whom were known to manifest symptoms of behavioral disturbance. Consistent with the hypothesis that low self-control is a risk factor specific to externalizing (aggressive and delinquent) disorders, boys who showed signs of externalizing disorders tended to seek immediate gratification in a laboratory task more often than both nondisordered boys and boys who showed signs of internalizing (anxious and depressed) disorders. In addition, children who were able to delay immediate gratification were described by their mothers as ego controlled, ego resilient, conscientious, open to experience, and agreeable. These results suggest that poor delay of gratification may be one of a select number of specific risk factors for externalizing disorder, and that good delay of gratification is linked to multiple adaptive tendencies in early adolescence.

AB Objective: To explore the 21-month course of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) and psychological morbidity in 30 school-age children (7 to 13 years) after exposure to Hurricane Andrew. Method: Pynoos' Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index and Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form were administered at 8 and 21 months after Hurricane Andrew. Results: At 21 months 70% of the children endorsed moderate-severe PTSS. The reduction in PTSS was greater for boys than girls. Psychopathology as measured by the Teacher's Report Form increased over the 19-month period. Boys demonstrated significant increases in internalizing symptoms and in Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems, and Attention Problems scales, and girls showed a significant increase in the Anxious/Depressed scale. Conclusions: Twenty-one months after exposure to Hurricane Andrew, there were continuing high levels of PTSS and evidence of increasing emotional and behavioral problems. While girls sustained higher levels of PTSS, boys demonstrated higher indices of other psychopathology. The enduring effects of disaster associated with secondary stressors and ''traumatic reminders'' continue to be etiologically important for continuing psychological morbidity.

ID ADULT LIFE; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ADJUSTMENT; DISORDERS
AB The literature on personality research, developmental psychology and psychopathology has consistently revealed two types of personality. According to different theoretical and methodological approaches these types are considered as prototypes of a personality dimension, or as behavioral patterns in psychopathology. In the research on adult personality, they are known as extraversion and introversion. Child psychiatrists refer to these prototypes as externalizing and internalizing disorders. However, there are few empirical studies on the congruency between adult personality types and childhood disorders. Longitudinal studies from the USA and New Zealand give evidence that adult personality types can predict coping styles of school age children in stressfull and challenging situations. Research on infant attachment to caregivers, revealing consistently different qualities of interaction patterns, may also be predictive for different coping styles in children of preschool age. Interdisciplinary discussions will focus on the question, whether early behavior patterns should be seen as predictors for adult traits (homotypic continuity) or as developmentally determined indicators for underlying functions (heterotypic continuity). Possibly, in early developmental stages behavior patterns have adaptive functions and in later stages become chronic strategies over time. Another topic concerns the relation between personality traits and pathologic behavior patterns and whether chronic strain may be influential.

AB Age and sex differences in the use of coping and defense strategies were examined in a life-span sample of 381 individuals. Participants responded to 2 self-report measures assessing mechanisms of coping and defense and measures assessing their level of cognitive complexity. Older adults used a combination of coping and defense strategies indicative of greater impulse control and the tendency to positively appraise conflict situations. Adolescents and younger adults used strategies that were outwardly aggressive and psychologically undifferentiated, indicating lower levels of impulse control and self-awareness. Women used more internalizing defenses than men and used coping strategies that flexibly integrated intra- and interpersonal aspects of conflict situations. Taken together, findings provide evidence for the age- and sex-specific use of strategies of coping and defense, suggesting that men and women may face different developmental tasks in the process toward maturity in adulthood.

ID EXPOSURE
AB Objective.-To evaluate the association between body lead burden and social adjustment.
   Design.-Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting.-Public school community.
   Participants.-From a population of 850 boys in the first grade at public schools, 503 were selected on the basis of a risk scale for antisocial behavior. All of the 850 boys who scored in the upper 30th percentile of the distribution on a self-reported antisocial behavior scale were matched with an equal number drawn by lot from the lower 70% of the distribution. From this sample, 301 students accepted the invitation to participate.
   Exposure Measure.-K x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy of tibia at subjects' age of 12 years.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), teachers' and parents' reports, and subjects' self-report of antisocial behavior and delinquency at 7 and 11 years of age.
   Results.-Subjects, teachers, and parents were blind to the bone lead measurements. At 7 years of age, borderline associations between teachers' aggression, delinquency, and externalizing scores and lead levels were observed after adjustment for covariates. At 11 years of age, parents reported a significant lead-related association with the following CBCL cluster scores: somatic complaints and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior. Teachers reported significant associations of lead with somatic complaints, anxious/depressed behavior, social problems, attention problems, and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior. High-lead subjects reported; higher scores in subjects' self-reports of delinquency at 11 years. High-lead subjects were more likely to obtain worse scores on all items of the CBCL during the 4-year period of observation. High bone lead levels were associated with an increased risk of exceeding the clinical score (T>70) for attention, aggression, and delinquency.
   Conclusion.-Lead exposure is associated with increased risk for antisocial and delinquent behavior, and the effect follows a developmental course.

Observers rated the dysphoric mothers as having more negative affect during play interactions, although their children's affect was not rated more negatively. The dysphoric mother-infant dyads were also rated as having a poorer quality interaction. These data suggest that mothers' chronic dysphoria (75% were chronically dysphoric) has a negative impact on the mothers' perceptions of their children as well as the mothers' and children's interaction behavior.

AB Twenty-seven mothers and 27 fathers were given the Adult Attachment Interview (M. Main & R. Goldwyn, in press) when their children were 3.5 years old. Continuous ratings of narrative coherence, probable experience quality (parents perceived as loving), and state of mind (current anger at parents) were entered as latent variables in partial least squares structural equation models that included observational measures of marital quality and parenting style. Models that include fathers' attachment histories predicted more variance in kindergarten teachers' descriptions of children's externalizing behavior, whereas models that include mothers' attachment histories predicted more variance in children's internalizing behavior. Marital data added predictive power to the equations. Discussion is focused on the importance of integrating attachment and family systems approaches, and of parents' gender and marital quality, in understanding specific links between parents' attachment histories and their young children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors.

AB Objective: Longitudinal evaluation of the competence and the prevalence of behavior problems in preterm children with serious neonatal complications. Method: Prospective follow-up of nonhandicapped preterm children who had been hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (n = 177). The follow-up extended from early school age to early adolescence and was conducted with the help of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (parent form). Results: The preterm children had lower scores on the Social and School Competence scales than did controls (n = 276). They also were more likely to attend special schools than were children in the general population. With regard to behavior problems, the preterm children had more social problems. The very preterm children and the children who were small for gestational age (SGA) were the ones who contributed to the significant findings. The children who were appropriate for gestational age did not differ from controls. No differential changes in CBCL ratings were found between the preterm and control children. The stability with regard to internalizing problems, attention problems, and social problems was high among the very preterm children and SGA children. Conclusion: Very preterm and preterm SGA children are at increased risk of problems in social functioning and functioning at school. These problems persist with age.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of child temperament and stressful family functioning on child behavior problems among preschool children. Method: One hundred forty-five preschool children, aged 2 to 5 years, were evaluated by teachers, mothers, and independent observers. Teachers reported on child temperament; from these ratings, two dimensions or temperament were derived: difficult/easy and approachability. Mothers reported on two dimensions of family functioning: conflict and expressiveness. Both teachers and independent observers rated child behavior problems. Results: Children with more difficult temperaments who were in high-conflict families had the most internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, while children with easy temperaments had fewer such problems, regardless of levels of family conflict. Difficult children whose families were highly expressive engaged in the most observed aggression. Conclusions: Results suggest that temperament is involved in both protective and vulnerability processes. A difficult temperament operates as a vulnerability factor for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and observed aggression, while an easy temperament functions as a protective mechanism for these outcomes.

AB Three groups of adolescents who were 14 years old in 1974 were formed on the basis of peer nominations and teacher ratings in an ongoing longitudinal study: 1) reactively aggressive (REA) individuals who displayed reactive, that is, self-defensive aggression but not proactive aggression (43 boys, 35 girls); 2) proactively aggressive (PROA) individuals who attacked another person without a reason (56 boys, 35 girls); and 3) nonaggressive (NONA) individuals who were low in proactive and reactive aggression (48 boys, 45 girls). The groups were compared at ages 8, 14, and 27 in variables representing the constructs of a two-dimensional model of emotional and behavioral regulation. The REA Ss were characterized by higher self-control, especially constructiveness, at each age and better adult adjustment than the PROA Ss. The PROA males were prone to externalizing problems and criminality in adulthood, whereas the PROA females were prone to internalizing problems and neuroticism in adulthood. Both exhibited conduct problems in adolescence, and became heavy users of alcohol in adulthood. The PROA Ss had more children at age 27 than the other Ss. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The present study describes the development and preliminary validation of the ''How I Think'' questionnaire (HIT), a new measure of self-serving cognitive distortion. The HIT is based upon Gibbs and Potter's [Gibbs, 1993; Gibbs et al., 1995] four-category typology of cognitive distortion: Self-Centered, Blaming Others, Minimizing/Mislabeling, and Assuming the Worst. The preliminary HIT exhibited high test-retest and internal consistency reliability, and generally good construct validity. Correlations between the HIT and self-reported antisocial or externalizing behavior remained significant after controlling for internalizing disorders [Achenbach, 1991]. The four typological categories performed comparably well. The HIT was partially successful in discriminating criterion groups. The findings are discussed in terms of theory, research, and application. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB We conducted this study with a sample of sons of fathers having a Psychoactive Substance Use Disorder (PSUD+, n = 55) and sons of fathers who did not qualify for a PSUD (PSUD-, n = 97). Parental discipline practice from the child's perspective was investigated in relation to the child's difficult temperament to determine their association with sons' externalizing and internalizing behavior problems reported by mothers. PSUD+ status, difficult temperament in the boys, and their ratings of parental discipline practices accounted for a significant proportion of variance with respect to their externalizing behavior (11%), bur only PSUD+ status had a main effect on internalizing behavior. However, the main finding of this study was that the interaction of parental discipline and difficult temperament in the child moderated both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, accounting for an additional 5% of an explained variance. Thus, this study illustrates the importance of the conjoint influence of children's temperament characteristics and parental discipline practices on the children's adjustment, These results support the findings from previous studies showing that a difficult temperament disposition places the child at risk for maltreatment by parents and for development of a disruptive behavior disorder. Both outcomes have been found in many investigations to presage alcohol and drug abuse in adolescence. The findings also underscore the importance of both individual and contextual variables for understanding the development of psychopathology. In this regard, the results show the need for prevention and treatment to encompass strategies directed at disaggregating the basis of maladaptive family interaction patterns.

AB Clinical observation suggests that anxiety and affective disorders are important in the development and course of psychoactive substance abuse in some adolescents. These internalizing disorders sometimes precede and may contribute to the development of psychoactive substance-use disorders, Screening for internalizing disorders, suicide risk, and trauma history is important in the clinical evaluation of all adolescents with psychoactive substance-use disorders. Depression and anxiety symptoms may be caused, however, by chronic alcohol or drug consumption or withdrawal. Therefore, a period of abstinence and reevaluation should precede specific treatments. Specific treatment for anxiety disorders or depression may be appropriate in some substance-abusing adolescents. Focused psychotherapeutic techniques or psycho-pharmacologic treatments can sometimes be useful adjuncts to psychoactive substance-abuse programs.

AB Parents read one of eight vignettes counterbalanced for gender (boy or girl), age (6-year old or 15-year old), and type of clinical problem (internalizing or externalizing). After reading the vignette, parents rated their perceptions of responsibility for the child's problems and the acceptability of different treatments. Results showed that mothers, fathers, and teachers were seen as more responsible for younger rather than older children's problems, whereas older children were seen as more responsible than younger children for their own problems. Teachers were seen as more responsible for children's internalizing problems and children were seen as more responsible for their own externalizing problems. This pattern of results was similar for mothers and fathers who were participants. Greater behavioral contingencies were perceived to be more acceptable for younger children and children with externalizing problems. Individual therapy, family therapy, and medication were perceived as more acceptable for internalizing than externalizing problems. Overall, internalizing problems were perceived as more severe than externalizing problems. Results were discussed in terms of the relationships between parents' perceptions and findings from empirical research.

AB A 32-page educational booklet was mailed to half of all parents filing for divorce in one urban domestic relations court over a la-week period. A total of 358 primarily lower-middle class intervention and wait-list control parents were interviewed by telephone approximately three months post-filing. Mothers in the treatment group reported greater reduction of loyalty conflict behaviors and increased encouragement of child-father involvement. No differences were observed between intervention and control for either mothers' willingness to share responsibility or in rate of conveyance to children of interparental conflict and personal distress. No differences were observed for father behaviors. Children exhibiting greater internalizing and externalizing behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist (Parents) had mothers who reported experiencing greater interpersonal conflict and personal distress, and more often spoke of their difficulties to their children.
   A one-year follow-up revealed that intervention parents were more likely to communicate positively with their children about their other parent, and that nonresidential parents had greater access to their children than parents in the control conditions. The implications for this change in reducing stress in children of divorce are discussed.

AB Three replicable personality types were identified in a sample of 300 adolescent boys and shown to generalize across African Americans and Caucasians. The types had conceptually coherent relations with the Big Five dimensions, ego resiliency, and ego control, and converged with three of the types identified by J. Block (1971). The behavioral implications of the types were explored using several independent data sources. Resilients were intelligent, successful in school, unlikely to be delinquents, and relatively free of psychopathology; Overcontrollers shared some of these characteristics but were also prone to internalizing problems; and Undercontrollers showed a general pattern of academic, behavioral, and emotional problems. This research demonstrates that replicable and generalizable personality types can be identified empirically, and that the unique constellation of traits defining an individual has important consequences for a wide range of outcomes.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the relation of familial responsiveness and behavioral control with internalizing and externalizing symptomatology in an adolescent inpatient psychiatric sample. Lower levels of familial responsiveness were found to be associated with adolescent externalizing symptomatology. Contrary to the relation between parental behavioral control and externalizing behavior found among normal high school students, parental behavioral control did not distinguish internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Lower levels of familial responsiveness were also found to be associated with adolescents' dismissive attachment representations and with later attainment of formal operational thought. The implications of these findings for understanding adolescent psychopathological outcome were explored. Differences in the patterns of association between responsiveness and symptomatology for male and female adolescents suggest the utility of investigating further how current family interaction and attachment representations may mutually influence adolescent psychopathological outcome.

AB Objective: To review family-based treatment research. A growing body of research and several meta-analytic reviews demonstrate that family-based treatments are effective for a variety of child and adolescent disorders. In addition, an emerging tradition of family-based process research has begun to identify important ingredients of effective family psychotherapy. This article reviews these advances and their implications for future research. Method: Selected studies on the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, attention deficit, conduct disorder, and substance abuse are reviewed, as well as several process research and meta-analytic studies. Results: Family-based therapies have been shown to be effective for treating schizophrenia, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. Some data support their effectiveness in the treatment of eating disorders. Few studies have targeted internalizing disorders. A process research tradition is emerging, but it is in need of methodological advances, Meta-analytic studies suggest that family-based therapies are as effective as other models. Conclusions: More well-designed studies with diverse populations are needed to assess accurately the effectiveness of this increasingly popular treatment approach.

AB Self-regulation is analyzed in terms of self-determination theory using the concepts of intrinsic motivation and the internalization of extrinsic motivation. Laboratory experiments and field studies are reviewed indicating that: (1) intrinsic motivation and fully internalized extrinsic motivation are positively associated with high quality learning and personal adjustment; and (2) maintaining intrinsic motivation and internalizing extrinsic motivation are facilitated by social contexts that allow satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Such contexts are ones that are characterized by the provision of choice, optimal challenge, informational feedback, interpersonal involvement, and acknowledgment of feelings.

AB The focus concerns psychobiological risk factors in the development of antisocial behavior among male and female subjects. Using longitudinal data, violent and nonviolent criminal offences were studied in relation to childhood vulnerability indicators, norm-breaking behavior in adolescence, and to personality traits and biochemical measures in adult age. Subsequently, levels of norm-breaking behavior in adolescence were studied as related to personality and biochemical measures in adult age. Data were obtained from a representative group of 82 male and 87 female subjects as (1) teacher ratings of behavior at age 13, assumed to differentially reflect vulnerability to externalizing and internalizing psychosocial disturbances; (2) self-ratings of norm-breaking behaviours at age 1 5; (3) Karolinska Scales of Personality scores and biochemical measures at age 26-27 years, and (4) records for criminal offences up to age 40. In both the male and female groups, criminal offences during the life span were associated with childhood externalizing and adolescent norm-breaking behavior. Furthermore, in the male group, criminal and violent offences were associated with adult psychopathy-related personality traits and a biochemical indicator of psychosocial vulnerability; platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. Among female subjects, criminal offenders displayed significantly lower MAO activity in comparison to noncriminals. High levels of norm-breaking behavior in adolescence were associated with adult high impulsiveness, low socialization, and low platelet MAO activity in both male and female subjects. The results of the analyses were used as a basis for some theoretical and methodological conclusions.

AB In Sweden the first epidemiologic study on mental disorders in children and adolescents was made in 1945-46. Since then investigations have been made on different age groups using various methods to clarify the nature and magnitude of psychiatric morbidity in children and adolescents. During the last two decades the assessment of single behaviour deviances and stress reactions has been replaced by studies on psychiatric disorders according to the DSM system or using factor-analysed composite clusters of behaviours. High rates of comorbidity show that the symptoms of young people are more diffuse than those of adults. The frequency of ''psychiatric cases'' varied depending on the methods used. Most studies rate 5-20% as behaviourally disturbed i.e. enough to cause a problem to the child and/or his/her parents and teachers. Most studies state that boys have more behaviour deviances than girls before puberty. Girls have more problems during adolescence, especially depressions and psychosomatic symptoms. Girls have more internalizing symptoms, while boys display more acting-out behaviours. Self-reported symptoms are generally more frequent than symptoms reported by parents. Teachers report the lowest frequencies. Severe psychopathology like anorexia nervosa, major depressive disorders and psychoses are comparatively rare. The study of such conditions requires different methods than the study of adjustment problems and stress reactions.

AB A multimethod, multidimensional approach, consisting of teacher ratings, self-ratings, sociometric ratings, direct observations, and semistructured interview, was used to assess the social skills of fifth-grade Asian, African, and European American students. inter- and intragroup differences were found on several of the measures. Teachers attributed characteristic internalizing and externalizing behaviors to Asian and African American students, respectively. Teacher perceptions were only partially supported through direct observations and self-reports. European and Asian American students differed significantly on the sociometric ratings, and Asian American students engaged in proportionately more outergroup social communications. The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for viewing the social skills of culturally and racially different inner city students.

A summary of the DSM-IV criteria for childhood anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as modifications in diagnostic criteria from DSM-III-R to DSM-IV are presented. A brief review of major research findings regarding anxiety and depression in children also is provided, and DSM-IV is evaluated in terms of its grounding in empirical research. The utility of DSM-IV for school psychology is discussed, including a delineation of essential criteria for diagnosis and the need to determine the functional impact of a disorder. Finally, potential limitations of DSM-IV are examined.

AB A central issue in studies of risk factors for childhood psychopathology is utilization of the information obtained about the child's mental health status from multiple informants, In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to the analysis of risk factor data when the outcomes are binary ratings (presence/absence of symptoms), This new approach has several attractive features in this setting, The strategy taken is to perform a single analysis using multivariate modeling, in which simultaneous logistic regressions are conducted for the outcomes given by each of several informants, The advantages of this approach include the following: 1) it retains the complete information about case status for each informant; 2) it permits assessment of informant-risk factor interactions as well as ''overall'' risk factor effects; 3) it provides measures of association between the multiple informants and adjusts for the association between responses in the analysis; and 4) missing data on a subset of respondents can be incorporated in a straightforward way, permitting all subjects with at least one informant to be used in the analysis, To illustrate the methods, the authors present findings on risk factors for measures of ''internalizing'' and ''Externalizing'' behaviors from two surveys using parent and teacher ratings of 6- to 11-year-old children in Connecticut between 1986 and 1989.

AB Salivary cortisol concentrations (10:30-11:30 a.m.) and social behavior (observations and teacher reports) were examined in 33 maltreated (26 boys) and 16 comparison (8 boys) children. The maltreated children were studied for 31 days while they attended a therapeutic preschool for abused and neglected children. Children in the comparison sample were studied while attending a preschool serving economically disadvantaged families. Each child's cortisol values over days were used to compute measures of basal activity (median cortisol) and reactivity (ratio of quartile ranges). Median cortisol was not significantly correlated with social behavior measures; Cortisol reactivity was positively correlated with social competence and negatively correlated with shy/internalizing behavior. Maltreated children exhibited less cortisol reactivity then did comparison children. Maltreated children also scored lower in social competence and higher in shy/internalizing and acting out/externalizing behaviors. In additional analyses, maltreated children failed to show elevations in cortisol on days of high versus low social conflict in the classroom. Social competence was also found to correlate positively with cortisol levels on high-conflict days. In all, the results suggest a reduction in cortisol reactivity in maltreated children related to the impairment in social competence frequently noted among these children.

AB It was proposed that the interaction between the constructs of emotion regulation and social interaction would predict social adaptation in preschoolers. Ninety-six 4-year-olds were observed in quartets of unfamiliar same-sex peers. Based on parent temperament ratings and observed free play behaviors, 68 children from the original sample were classified as: low social interaction, good emotion regulators; low social interaction, poor emotion regulators; high social interaction, good emotion regulators; high social interaction, poor emotion regulators; or average. The results indicated that the low social interaction children who were poor regulators displayed more wary and anxious behaviors during free play and other episodes, and were rated as having more internalizing problems than both the low social interaction children who were good regulators and the average group. The high social interaction children who were poor regulators were rated as having more externalizing problems than either the high social interaction children who were good regulators or the average group. Thus, it seems as if emotion dysregulation is associated with psychological maladaptation, but that this association is tempered by the degree to which children engage in social interaction.

AB The study investigated effects of day care quality in interaction with child and family characteristics on socioemotional development concurrently at 29 months and longitudinally at 4 years. By international standards, the study was performed in high-quality day care settings and in a fairly homogeneous group of well-functioning families. In a group of 52 children UM day care experience = 12.6 months at the age of 29 months), main effects of day care quality and effects due to interactions between such quality and the background characteristics of SES, home environment quality, gender, and infant manageability were studied. Socioemotional development was studied both in terms of children's problems (externalizing and internalizing) and positive aspects of functioning (positive emotional expressions and ego strength/effectance). The results showed a main effect of day care quality on expressions of positive emotions, and interactive effects were demonstrated for several of the other indicators of socioemotional functioning. Compensatory effects of high-quality care on externalizing behaviors for children from less advantaged homes as well as positive effects on boys' internalizing problems and ego strength/effectance were among the findings. Thus, using culturally relevant measures of day care quality, clear influences can be demonstrated even in a culture with a fairly uniform and high standard of care.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist's (CBCL) applicability to a sample of 105 Russian 9- and 10-year-old children was evaluated by examining the internal consistency of Russian adaptations of parent and teacher report forms. In addition, child behavior scores were correlated with child reports of internalizing symptoms and maternal reports of their own internalizing symptoms and general family functioning. Finally, races of child behavior problems and patterns of interrater agreement were compared with U.S. normative data. The psychometric properties of the adaptations demonstrate the adequacy of these instruments for use in Russia. Internal consistency and interrater agreement were generally comparable to estimates obtained in U.S. normative samples. Further, an exploration of the construct validity of the Russian versions of the CBCL and Teacher Report Form (TRF) fends additional support to the adequacy of these instruments.

AB The validity of two measures assessing degree of stress associated with child sexual abuse was examined in a sample of 48 girls who had been sexually abused. The Checklist of Sexual Abuse and Related Stressors (C-SARS) assessed negative life events that were part of or were related to the abuse, and the Negative Appraisals of Sexual Abuse Scale (NAS4S) assessed negative cognitive appraisals of threat, harm, or loss associated with the abuse. Total scores for victim reports of bath stressful events and negative appraisals were positively and significantly related to two other measures of abuse severity: therapist ratings of abuse stress and the number of types of sexual abuse reported. Stressful event scores were also related to aggressive behavior problems, sexual concerns, and total symptom scores on the Child Behavior Checklist. Negative cognitive appraisal scores were related to victims' self-reports of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, and to parent reports of child depression and total symptoms. Regression analyses indicated that there were significant effects of negative appraisals on internalizing symptoms when controlling for the level of stressful events experienced. The results suggest that negative life events and negative appraisals associated with sexual abuse are valid constructs that help account for variability in mental health outcomes among child victims. The implications of these results and fixture research directions in examining variable outcomes among sexual abuse victims are discussed.

Subjects, parents, and teachers completed questionnaire measures of depression and anxiety. Rejected and withdrawn girls showed more internalizing problems as reported by girls and their teachers compared to peers. The combination of rejection and withdrawal was associated with more internalizing behaviors. Neglected girls did not differ from peers on depression or anxiety; nor was the combination of neglect and withdrawal associated with increased scores on dependent measures.

ID IMPACT
AB The present study examined pre- to posttreatment changes on several outcome variables following a group treatment for sexually abused adolescent females living in a group home setting. The treatment, called SAY Group, is a 20-week, closed-enrollment group that employs a cognitive-behavioral, PTSD-informed approach. Pre- and posttest assessments were completed by 43 SAY Group participants and by their group-home caregivers. Significant improvements were found on adolescent self-report measures of internalizing and externalizing problems, PTSD symptoms, and self-worth. No significant improvement was noted for depression. Caregivers reported significant improvement on internalizing behavior problems and PTSD symptoms, but not on externalizing problems. Preliminary findings indicate that SAY Group is effective in reducing symptoms commonly associated with sexual abuse.

AB The effect of level of identity status on the internalization of a public self-presentation was investigated. American late adolescents, pretested on identity status and sociability, were instructed to portray themselves positively or negatively during a face-to-face interview, in a written interview, or on an anonymous questionnaire. Participants internalized positive presentations and resisted internalizing negative ones. Regression analyses indicated that differences in identity-status scores moderated shifts in private self-appraisals. Increased susceptibility was associated with moratorium scores, but only in the negative role conditions. Foreclosure scores accounted for enhanced resistance, but only in the positive role conditions. Evidence for the moderating effect of identity diffusion was obtained only in actual face-to-face encounters.

AB Objective: To evaluate psychosocial adjustment in children with port-wine stain (PWS) and children with prominent ears (PE). Method: Thirty-two children aged 7 to 16 years with facial PWS and 42 children with PE were evaluated using the Harter Self-Perception Profile, the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Disfigurement Perception Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist. Results were compared with normative data for the local population or with a control group. Profile scores were correlated with severity of the PWS or prominence of the ears. Results: Children with PE had poorer self-perception, higher concentration anxiety, and more internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and they were more withdrawn and had more social problems than children with PWS. The children with PWS functioned as well as or better than nondisfigured peers on measurements of psychosocial adjustment, while children with PE scored lower than nondisfigured peers on measures of self-perception and parent-rated social and attention problems. There was no correlation between degree of disfigurement and level of psychosocial adjustment. Conclusions: Psychosocial adjustment varied according to the nature of the disfigurement or deformity and was unrelated to the severity of the disfigurement.

AB Maternal reports on the health, behavioral, and educational characteristics of Hispanic low-income preschoolers were gathered from a pediatric clinic to conduct appropriate consultation and teaching of behavioral issues to pediatric residents. Fifty-two Hispanic mothers attending an urban hospital clinic were given a questionnaire. Interviews provided data on family demographics, children's health status, behavior problems (65 items adapted from Achenbach's 1981 and 1987 Child Behavior Checklists [CBCL]), maternal depression, family life stressful events, and discipline methods, Thirteen externalizing and five internalizing high frequency behaviors were identified, Behavior problem scores were significantly related to the use of yelling and hitting/spanking as methods of discipline, Precarious health status and low enrollment in preschool programs also were reported. A broader preventive role for pediatricians in that pediatric setting was recommended and pursued. Results suggest a broad preventive role for pediatricians and pediatric clinics servicing low-income preschoolers.

AB This study examined various hemophilic mechanisms by which adolescents affect, and are affected by, levels of internalized distress within their immediate peer groups. The sample included approximately 6,000 14- to 18-year-olds who were assessed twice over a 1-year period. Results showed that adolescents tend to associate with peers who report similar levels of internalized distress and that internalizers are no less successful than others at establishing friendships. Moreover, homophily of internalizing symptoms develops from 3 distinct sources: (a) Adolescents tend to choose friends who possess similar levels of internalized distress (selection effect); (b) in male, but not female, peer groups, individual distress levels grow increasingly similar to peer levels over time (socialization effect); and (c) peer group distress levels vary according to the distress of individual members (contagion effect).

AB On the basis of the widespread belief that emotions underpin psychological adjustment, the authors tested 3 predicted relations between externalizing problems and anger, internalizing problems and fear and sadness, and the absence of externalizing problems and social-moral emotion (embarrassment). Seventy adolescent boys were classified into 1 of 4 comparison groups on the basis ofteacher reports using a behavior problem checklist: internalizers, externalizers, mixed (both internalizers and externalizers), and nondisordered boys. The authors coded the facial expressions of emotion shown by the boys during a structured social interaction. Results supported the 3 hypotheses: (a) Externalizing adolescents showed increased facial expressions of anger, (b) on 1 measure internalizing adolescents showed increased facial expressions of fear, and (c) the absence of externalizing problems (or nondisordered classification) was related to increased displays of embarrassment. Discussion focused on the relations of these findings to hypotheses concerning the role of impulse control in antisocial behavior.

Results indicated that the three groups differed on several domains of self-perception, with each group reporting perceived strengths and weaknesses. Second-order principal component analyses revealed differences across groups in the structure of their self-perceptions. Finally, regression analyses indicated that self-perceptions share variance with a mixture of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results are discussed from a clinical-developmental perspective.

AB Objective: DSM-IV defines trichotillomania as an impulse disorder with rising tension followed by relief or gratification. Alternative formulations view trichotillomania as an internalizing disorder or variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study addresses this controversy by examining the phenomenology, comorbidity, and family genetics of childhood trichotillomania. Method: Fifteen chronic hair-pullers (13 girls), aged 9 through 17 years (mean 12.3 +/- 2.3 years), were systematically assessed. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) profiles of the hair-pulling girls were compared with those of 37 girls from a general child psychiatry clinic and of 15 girls with OCD. Results: All the hair-pullers had impairing cosmetic disfigurement; however, 4 subjects (26.7%) denied rising tension or relief. All three groups had comparable global CBCL problem scores. The CBCL symptom profile of the hair-pulling group differed significantly from that of the general clinic group but strongly resembled that of the OCD group. The hair-pulling group, however, had few obsessions or compulsions aside from hair-pulling; two (13%) subjects met criteria for OCD. As a group, hair-pulling subjects had substantial comorbid psychopathology, and a parental history of ties, habits, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms was common. Conclusions: These findings lend only partial support to the notion of trichotillomania as an OCD-spectrum disorder. Rising tension followed by relief or gratification may not be an appropriate diagnostic criterion for trichotillomania.

AB A brief battery of self-report measures was constructed to discriminate effectively 45 matched clinic versus nonclinic subjects, ages 8 to 15. The battery consisted of measures from six domains, including externalizing problems, child and parent report of internalizing problems, peer relations, school functioning, and family relationships. Data on subjects and their families were provided by various sources, including parents, teachers, and the children. In an effort to facilitate interpretation and use of this information by unsophisticated staff, within domain scores were converted to bivariate risk scores. Results indicated effective classification (82%) of groups using the bivariate risk scores alone. This constituted only a small loss of information when the risk scores replaced t-scores. Implications for the use of the risk scores to facilitate treatment planning and program evaluation are discussed.

Parents of 469 6-to-13-year-old children of each nationality completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Cross-cultural differences were generally modest in magnitude. Chinese children scored higher on TRF Delinquent Behavior and Anxious/Depressed syndromes, and on Internalizing. American children scored higher on CBCL Aggressive Behavior and TRF Attention Problems syndromes. Boys exhibited more externalizing behaviors across both cultures. The mean correlation between parent and teacher ratings was .36 in the Chinese sample and .29 in the American sample, a nonsignificant difference. Findings indicate considerable similarity between problems reported for children in very different societies.

AB Children and adolescents with diabetes indicated how they coped with three diabetes-related situations (diabetes-related social, diet, fingerprick) and a general peer-argument situation. Children utilized approach-coping strategies (i.e., problem solving, seeking social support) more frequently than adolescents. Both the approach- and avoidance-coping strategies (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, distancing) were highly and positively correlated across situations. Across all four situations, approach-coping strategies were used more frequently than avoidance-coping strategies. Approach-coping strategies were used less frequently for dealing with fingerpricks than the other situations. Avoidance-coping strategies were used more frequently for a general peer argument than the diabetes-related situations. In hierarchical regressions, after controlling for age, coping strategies accounted for a significant portion of the variance in predicting some global adjustment indices (grade point average, depression) and situation-specific, self-rated coping effectiveness. Higher levels of approach coping and lower levels of avoidance coping were generally related to more positive outcomes.

AB Generalization from twin studies relies on the assumption that liability to develop the disorder which is studied is influenced by similar factors in twins and singletons. The present study examines the impact of pre- and perinatal factors on parental reports of behaviour problems in 1832 twins, and compares level of attention problems, internalizing and externalizing behaviour in the twins with 723 children and adolescents from a general population sample. The modest influence of relative birth weight and birth order on level of attention problems in twins did not contribute to significant differences between twins and the general population sample. The levels of attention problems and externalizing behaviour was similar and there was a modest age dependent difference in internalizing behaviour. An increased variance was found for externalizing behaviour in twins.

AB Behavior problems and family functioning were investigated in a sample of 10 adolescent girls with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), 10 matched healthy adolescent girls, and 10 adolescents with childhood cancer in remission. Based on the adolescent girls' reports, the CFS group had significantly higher scores than the cancer and healthy comparison adolescent girls on somatic complaints and also significantly higher scores than the cancer controls on internalizing symptoms and depression. Parent reports resulted in significantly higher scores in the CFS group than the adolescent girls from the healthy comparison groups on internalizing scores and somatic complaints. There were no significant differences on any family variables.

AB Some reliability and validity indices of peer ratings of internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (aggression) behaviors were explored for elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 86) 8- to 12-year-old children. Interrater reliabilities for the peer ratings were very good (all above .94) for both samples on all types of behaviors. Peer ratings corresponded significantly with child self-reports on all three traits in both the elementary school and inpatient samples in both the younger (ages 8 and 9) and older (ages 10, 11, and 12) children and in both girls and boys. Peer ratings of depression and aggression corresponded significantly with teacher ratings of those same traits in both samples; however, on anxiety, peer-teacher correspondence was not significant in both samples. For both older and younger children, as well as boys and girls, same-trait peer-teacher correspondence was significant on both depression and aggression, with correspondence on anxiety significant for boys and older children and nonsignificant for girls and younger children. Inpatient children were rated significantly higher by their peers than elementary school children on all three traits. Both samples of children self-reported significantly more depression and anxiety than their peers reported, and inpatient children self-reported significantly less aggression than their peers reported. The potential utility of peer ratings is discussed.

AB Based primarily on the contributions to this Special Issue of JMFT, this article provides an overview of the empirical research on the efficacy of marital and family therapy for the following disorders and problems: schizophrenia; affective (mood) disorders; selected externalizing, internalizing, and pervasive developmental disorders of childhood; adolescent conduct disorder; marital distress and the prevention of divorce; alcoholism; adult and adolescent drug abuse; and various chronic adult, adolescent, and childhood physical disorders. Convincing scientific evidence supports the efficacy of broadly defined marital and family therapy for the treatment of many disorders, as well as its superiority to standard and individual treatments for certain disorders and populations. We conclude with recommendations for future research as well as for collaborative initiatives between marital/family therapists and other professionals working in the marriage and family field.

AB Objective: To use multiple methods and measures to investigate preliminarily the emotional impact of children's exposure to community violence. Method: Thirty-seven schoolchildren between the ages of 7 and 12 years were categorized into groups with ''high'' or ''low'' frequency of exposure. Results: Differing levels of exposure to community violence did not appear to have an impact on DSM-III-R diagnoses. Exposure to high levels of community violence was not related to internalizing behavior and disorders, but rather was associated with externalizing behavior. Conclusions: There appears to be an adverse relationship between high levels of exposure to community violence and emotional and conduct problems. Vicarious learning serves as an explanatory construct for these findings.

ID 4-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH; CHILD
AB This study assessed the 8-y stability and change of parent-reported problem behaviors in 791 children from the general population assessed at 2-y intervals with the same standardized procedure, the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Problem behaviors were rather stable across even the relatively long time interval of 8 y. The 8-y stability coefficient for total problem score was 0.48, with somewhat higher stability for externalizing than internalizing problems. Despite stability, problem behaviors also changed considerably across time. These changes do not only reflect the increase in chronologic age. The present study showed that there are changes in children's problem levels that result from historical time influences. These secular trends seemed of even greater importance than aging effects, and reflect a slight increase of the norm of children's problem behaviors.

Data were examined from the records of 307 male adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 committed to a state training school for hard-core offenders.  Adolescent offenders with externalizing behavior problems, such as aggression, showed a more favorable treatment outcome when they attributed overall successes to their own behavior and when they viewed themselves as worried or anxious.  They showed a less favorable treatment outcome when they viewed themselves as generally happy.  Adolescent offenders with internalizing behavior problems, such as anxiety or depression, tended to show less favorable treatment outcomes when they viewed themselves as being high in physical competence and when they attributed failures to themselves.

AB We examined the relationship between the frequency of four types of aversive exchanges with peers (teased, threatened, hit, excluded), disclosure, and psychological distress in a sample of 130 early adolescents (65 boys, 65 girls). Most (73%) reported at least one aversive exchange with a peer during the 3-month target period. Many reported that they did not talk to anyone about these exchanges. When disclosure occurred, other adolescents were more likely than adults to be chosen as confidants. More frequent aversive exchanges and non-disclosure of these events were related to higher self-reported loneliness for boys and girls. A similar pattern was found for girls only using mothers' ratings of the adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB Examining 61 youths diagnosed with sickle cell syndromes, this study focused on both protective and risk factors of adaptive behavioral functioning in these children. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic status), severity of disease (number of days hospitalized, emergency room visits, hemoglobin, and school days missed), behavioral adjustment, and family functioning were examined to determine their relation to adaptive behavioral competencies. Age, sex, and intellectual functioning were found to be efficient predictors of the majority of adaptive behavioral domains, with higher adaptive functioning being associated with younger children, girls, and greater intellectual functioning. Adjustment difficulties characterized by internalizing symptoms were found to predict communication and global adaptive functioning. Within the context of a risk-resistance adaptation model, the present data were interpreted to support the use of secondary prevention efforts for children with sickle cell syndrome who may be designated at high risk for developmental delays.

AB Viewing social rejection from same-age peers as a source of stress for children, the current study sought to determine the most appropriate model of the effects of temporary versus consistent experiences with rejection for both short-term and long-term internalizing problems. Adopting a cross-sectional longitudinal design, the sociometric status of children in the first year of the study (when the children were in the first, second, or third grades), and then again in the next school year (when children were in the second, third, or fourth grades) was assessed to determine which children were rejected by their peers. Internalizing outcome measures were administered in the third and sixth years of follow-up. Results indicated that, for boys, the Threshold Model best represented the stressful effects of rejection. That is, only boys who were exposed to rejection for 2 consecutive years demonstrated both short-term and long-term internalizing problems in subsequent years. For girls, however, there appeared to be few significant differences among those who never experienced rejection, who had only temporary experiences with rejection, and girls who were consistently exposed to rejection. Results are discussed in terms of the significance of a Threshold Model as well as possible explanations for these gender differences.

AB The significance of childhood peer rejection and aggression as predictors of adolescent disorder was tested on 1147 children who were followed longitudinally from Grade 3 through Grade 10. Growth curve analyses of parent- and self-reported problems suggested that boys who were both aggressive and rejected in third grade had profiles of increasingly severe internalizing and externalizing problems across three assessment points in adolescence. Other groups showed either decreasing symptom patterns from Grade 6 to 10 or had consistently lower problem profiles. The longitudinal patterns were more complex for the girls. Childhood peer rejection was the only predictor of stable disorder as reported by parents, whereas self-reported externalizing problems were best predicted by childhood aggression.

AB We examined childhood social withdrawal and aggression as predictive of adolescent maladaption, comparing and contrasting social and emotional outcomes associated with aggression and social withdrawal. We also focused on childhood social competence as a predictor of adolescent adaptation. The sample comprised 60 children for whom a complete data set was available at both ages 7 and 14 years. The predictors were aggregated measures of social withdrawal, aggression, and social competence derived from three sources-behavioral observations, peer assessments, and teacher ratings. The outcomes focused primarily on markers of internalizing and externalizing problems. The results indicated that childhood social withdrawal uniquely and significantly contributed to the prediction of adolescent loneliness, felt insecurity, and negative self-regard. Aggression predicted adolescent delinquent activity; social competence predicted felt security in the peer group and substance use in adolescence.

TI PEER VARIABLES AS PREDICTORS OF LATER CHILDHOOD ADJUSTMENT
SO DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examined the relation between children's peer relationships and teacher-rated psychological adjustment. A number of shortcomings in the peer literature were addressed by: (a) employing carefully delineated peer variables (passive isolation, rejected isolation, aggressive-disruptive, peer preference, mutual friendship); (b) employing a data analytic strategy that permitted simultaneous examination of main effects of and interactions among peer variables; (c) using an outcome measure that is well-normed for children and widely used in studies of adjustment; and (d) controlling for outcome measures' autocorrelations across time points. For 236 school children in the third, fourth, and fifth grades, concurrent associations were examined between these peer variables and internalizing and externalizing problems. Longitudinal associations were examined over a period of 2 years. In so doing, we found that passive isolation was a risk factor for internalizing problems, and rejected isolation was marginally predictive of externalizing problems. Furthermore, we found complex moderating effects of mutual friendship, such that children who were not isolated may derive benefits from having a close mutual friend, but the results were not clear for children with poor peer-group relationships. Much additional research is needed to further clarify these findings.

AB Examined relations among daily stressors, coping, and adjustment in a kindergarten sample by administering a daily-hassles measure and vignettes designed to elicit coping responses. Each child's parent and teacher completed a behavioral checklist. Daily hassles were associated with externalizing behavior problems, as well as total behavior problems as reported by parents. Active coping strategies were positively related to behavior problems independent of hassles. Specifically, coping strategies in response to a family stressor were related to parent reports of internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems, whereas strategies generated for a school stressor were related to teacher reports of externalizing behavior problems. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB Investigated the effect of homelessness on the psychological and developmental functioning of 3- to 5-year-old children. Compared 82 homeless children with 62 sociodemographically matched housed children and with standardization groups. Risk factors (homelessness and maternal depressive symptomatology) and protective factors (additional caregiver and early childhood education) were included as variables potentially moderating child outcomes. Compared to normative groups, 4- and 5-year-old homeless children had significantly more behavior problems, and significantly more of both housed and homeless children were at risk for developmental delays. Regressions of outcomes on risk and protective variables and their interactions indicated no significant differences between the housed and homeless groups. Overall, two main effects were obtained: Maternal depressive symptomatology predicted increased internalizing behavior problems, and early childhood education predicted higher developmental competencies.

AB Examined the relation among marital conflict children's coping responses to parents' marital conflict, and child adjustment. Eighty-three families participated in this investigation Preadolescent children reported on the frequency and intensity of interparental conflict they witnessed; the strategies they used to cope with their parents' marital conflict; and their symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility, and their self-esteem. Mothers and fathers reported on children's hostility, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Results indicate that children's use of coping strategies that involve them in parents' marital conflict is predictive of child reports of increased levels of child maladjustment, whereas use of coping strategies that distance children from parents' marital conflict is predictive of child reports of decreased levels of child maladjustment Children's use of coping strategies that activate social support is predictive of mother reports of decreased levels of child maladjustment.

ID CHILDREN
AB Research findings on possible links between the constructs of social skills and internalizing disorders during early childhood are presented. Developmental research data from a new child behavioral rating instrument, the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales (PKBS), were utilized to explore the social skills/internalizing problems link and to identify some important behavioral characteristics of young children who are at high risk for developing internalizing type social-emotional problems. Social skills scores on the PKBS were found to be associated negatively with internalizing problem scores on three different criterion measures. Using the criterion of 1.5 standard deviations or higher than the normative mean on the Internalizing Problems broad band score on the PKBS, a base rate of approximately 6.8% of a large national normative sample of preschool-age children was identified as having moderately high to significant internalizing problem ratings. This group of ''internalizers'' was found to have significantly poorer social skills than non-internalizing children in the same normative group and could be classified with a relatively high degree of accuracy based on discriminant function analysis of the PKBS scores alone. implications of these findings, potential clinical uses of the PKBS, and possible directions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective: To explore the prevalence and progression of posttraumatic symptomatology (PTS), using emotional and behavioral indices of psychopathology in school-age children in the pathway of Hurricane Andrew (HI-IMPACT) and in a comparison group north of Miami (LO-IMPACT). Method: Pynoos' Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index and Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form (TRF) were administered 8 weeks and 32 weeks after the hurricane. In addition, 21 measures of disruptive behavior cataloged by Dade County Public Schools were aggregated and compared by grading period between pre- and posthurricane school years. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the two schools in PTS at 8 weeks after the hurricane, although the children in the HI-IMPACT school were more likely to have severe PTS. TRF findings at 8 weeks revealed that children in the HI-IMPACT school evidenced lower means on the eight TRF scales and on the broader Internalizing and Externalizing measures. Analysis of the disruptive behavior revealed a drop in the marking period immediately after the hurricane in the HI-IMPACT area, but an opposite effect was observed in the LO-IMPACT area. Conclusions: After the hurricane there was an initial increase in PTS and a concomitant decrease in other measures of behavior and psychopathology. PTS remained relatively high throughout the school year, but there was a rebound and subsequent normalization of the measures of disruptive behavior.

AB Objective: To determine the specificity to major depressive disorder (MDD) of a wide array of psychosocial risk factors in older adolescents (aged 14 through 18 years), Method: Diagnostic and psychosocial assessments were conducted with 1,507 randomly selected high school students at T-1 and after approximately 1 year (T-2). Three diagnostic groups were compared: those who had an episode of MDD during that year (n = 90), those who had an episode of substance use disorder during that year (SUD) (n = 42), and a control group with no disorder (n = 1,189). Results: Risk factors specific to MDD were stress (minor and major events), emotional reliance, physical symptoms and disease, history of suicide attempt, and a past episode of depression or anxiety disorder. Risk factors specific to SUD were tobacco use, academic difficulties, and a past episode of SUD. Risk factors that were shared were current depression symptoms, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, coping skills, interpersonal conflict with parents, and dissatisfaction with grades. Conclusions: By determining the number of risk factors for MDD, for SUD, or those that are general to both disorders, clinicians can make informed predictions concerning the probable future onset of a full-fledged episode of MDD and/or SUD in individual cases. The results of this study allow for the identification of adolescents who are at elevated risk for MDD and SUD. The results also have implications for the design of interventions aimed at preventing the occurrence of these disorders. Such interventions should target change on risk factors of the type identified in this study.

AB This study evaluated potential differences among 82 adult children of paternal alcoholics, 80 adult children of divorced parents, and 82 controls. Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychosocial functioning, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, alcohol use, and early family environment. After controlling for stressors often associated with alcoholic families, the authors found no group differences on current outcome measures. However, there were group differences on measures of early family environment. Children of alcoholics reported less father warmth than children of divorce or controls, and children of alcoholic and divorced parents reported more parental conflict than did controls. Post hoc analyses revealed that these early family environment variables were associated with participants' current psychosocial functioning.

AB Investigated ethnicity and parental alcoholism as factors that might influence the stress vulnerability of adolescents. It extended an initial cross-sectional study of this same sample by adding two annual assessments which allowed for additional cross-sectional analyses and longitudinal tests. Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents (N = 306 at Time 1) completed measures of their own life stress, family conflict, and alcohol use. Their parents reported on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Cross-sectional analyses at Time 2, and prospective analyses involving Time 1 and Time 2 measures were, for the most part, consistent with the original study's results. Caucasian adolescents and children of alcoholic parents appeared to be more vulnerable to stress than Hispanic adolescents and children of nonalcoholic parents. Family conflict was a partial explanation for this increased vulnerability.

AB This study is the first prospective longitudinal and clinical investigation of homesickness in children. The moods of 329 boys ages 8-16 were assessed on a daily basis during either a 2- or 4-week period of separation from primary caregivers. Results supported 4 hypotheses: (1) homesickness was prevalent and varied in intensity. 83% of the boys reported some homesickness on at least 1 day during their stay, and 5.8% experienced severe depression and anxiety; (2) homesickness was experienced as a combination of depression and anxiety, particularly the former; (3) younger boys were at greater risk for homesickness than older boys; and (4) homesickness presented most often as internalizing behavior and was sometimes detectable to observers who knew the boys. 63% of the boys who self-reported moderate or high levels of homesickness were judged by observers to be homesick. Inconsistent with popular notions, the most homesick boys became progressively more homesick over the course of their separation, experiencing a significant drop in homesickness just before reuniting with parents. The phenomenology of homesickness is discussed, as are issues of simultaneous depression and anxiety in children.

AB Objective: Although childhood psychiatric diagnoses often rely on maternal reports, little is known about their long-term reliability and diagnostic accuracy. Thus, the authors sought to examine these psychometric features in a cohort of ADHD and control children. Method: The sample consisted of 140 referred children with ADHD and 120 normal controls. The authors compared childhood diagnoses based on maternal reports of their children's psychopathology at this baseline assessment with those collected 1 year later. Results: Both reliability and accuracy were excellent for ADHD. Reliability and specificity were also excellent for conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, separation anxiety, and multiple anxiety disorders. Reliability and sensitivity were relatively low for simple phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, and overanxious disorder. Conclusions: With some exceptions, maternal reports of their children's psychopathology provided a reliable and accurate means of assessment. Generally, maternally derived diagnoses were less accurate for internalizing compared with externalizing disorders. However, specificity was high for all diagnoses, suggesting that mothers were not biased to report symptoms that had not occurred.

AB Objective: This study contrasted a group of sexually abused girls, aged 6 to 12 years, with two demographically comparable control groups, girls from a child psychiatry outpatient department, and girls from a general pediatric clinic to determine whether differences in sexual behavior and psychopathology symptoms could be demonstrated. Method: All girls and their mothers underwent an evaluation protocol composed of two parent-report inventories, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory. Results: Sexually abused girls and psychiatric controls manifested more psychopathology symptoms, including internalizing and externalizing behaviors, than the nonpsychiatric controls. Relative to both control groups, sexually abused girls manifested more sexual behavior problems: masturbating openly and excessively, exposing their genitals, indiscriminately hugging and kissing strange adults and children, and attempting to insert objects into their genitals. Abuse by fathers or stepfathers involving intercourse was associated with particularly marked sexual behavior disturbances. There was a subgroup of sexually abused girls who tended to force sexual activities on siblings and peers. All of these girls had experienced prolonged sexual abuse (more than 2 years) involving physical force which was perpetrated by a parent. Conclusions: Findings suggest that sexual abuse in preadolescent girls is associated with sexual behavior problems.

AB Objective: To test the prediction that the interaction of physical abuse and internalizing problems will heighten levels of aggressive behavior in a group of disruptive children. Method: Fifty-two clinic-referred disruptive children (aged 7 through 15 years) were assessed in terms of history of physical abuse, internalizing behavior problems (rated by parents), and aggressive behavior (rated by parents, teachers, and clinic staff). Results: Physically abused children with co-occurring high levels of internalizing problems (based on a median split) exhibited significantly higher levels of aggression as rated by parents (p<.000) and teachers (p<.020) and a trend toward heightened aggression as rated by staff (p<.08). The patterns were similar across the three independent informants and remained regardless of age, gender, or race. Conclusions: Physical abuse was related to heightened levels of aggression only in those children who also had emotional difficulties. Results lend some support to a transactional model of the development of aggression, suggesting that problems arise out of interactions between child factors (such as internalizing problems) and adverse family experiences (such as physical abuse).

AB Objective: The primary aim of the study was to ascertain the usefulness and the validity of the set of criteria proposed to define a subgroup within the DSM-III/-R category of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified under the name of multiple complex developmental disorder (MCDD). Method: A multivariate analysis (cluster and principal-components analysis) was performed on the characteristics, reliably extracted from the charts of 105 children with MCDD, 32 with autistic disorder, 51 with externalizing disorders, and 56 with internalizing disorders, all with an IQ greater than 70, fully assessed in our department between 1984 and 1991. Results: The main finding was a strong correspondence between the classification of the cases by DSM-III-R categories and the subdivision by means of a multivariate cluster analysis. The cluster analysis did not discriminate between children with emotional and disruptive disorders. Furthermore, children with MCDD and autistic disorder were significantly different both on symptom factors (''psychotic thinking/anxiety,'' ''aggression,'' ''deficient interaction/communication,'' ''stereotyped and rigid behavior,'' and ''suspiciousness/odd interaction'') and on factors that reflected developmental and environmental background variables. Conclusion: The results of this study add to the nosology of autistic spectrum disorders and lend additional support to the need for a separate subcategory of MCDD within DSM-V. Further corroboration of these results in independent (multicenter) samples will be required.

Results indicated that higher externalizing scores in adolescence predicted more alcohol use in young adulthood for both males and females and also predicted more marijuana and hard drug use for males. Lower internalizing scores were found to predict more marijuana and hard drug use in young adulthood for boys, but not for girls.

AB Recent research has started to examine the effect of clinical status on the correspondence between maternal and adolescent ratings of emotional and behavioural problems. This study compared maternal and youth ratings of the youths' adjustment using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Youth Self-Report in young offender (n = 50) and non-clinical males (n = 51) 12-16 years of age. In the young offender group, significant differences were found between maternal and youth ratings on all Internalizing and Externalizing scales. While delinquent youths' reports were in the clinical range only on the delinquent behaviour subscale, maternal ratings were in the clinical range on most subscales. By contrast, maternal and youth reports in the control group showed comparable ratings on Internalizing scales, with normal adolescents endorsing significantly more Externalizing behaviour problems than their mothers. Maternal and youth ratings in the controls were in the normal range on all scales. Several hypotheses to explain the differences between young offenders' and their mother's reporting of symptoms are presented. The implications of these findings for forensic assessment of adolescents are discussed.

AB Measures of developmental delay alone do not provide complete information regarding possible early developmental difficulties. In addition to or rather than delay, some children may evidence atypical or qualitatively different behaviors that can thwart development. Neurobehavioral assessment provides appraisal of the kinds and extent of atypical behaviors that may signal present or future developmental complications amenable to early intervention. Infants and children exposed to drugs, head trauma, or other sources of neurologic compromise may especially evidence atypical behavior in self-regulation. Difficulties In such areas as consolability, attention, sleep and eating routines, impulsivity, and excessive staring may be markers for more extensive developmental problems. This article provides a rationale for neurobehavioral assessment and includes a description of research and development of a new instrument, Neurobehavioral Indicators of Atypical Development (NIAD), that is designed to assist in early intervention screening and diagnosis.

Mothers of children with CD expressed significantly less criticism and higher warmth after 9 months. Initial externalizing scores in the CD group and initial internalizing scores in the ED group at the first assessment predicted symptomatic change, in contrast with EE scales. Initial externalizing scores and low levels of maternal warmth predicted presence of conduct disorder at the last contact with the clinician. The implications of the findings on the development of treatment techniques are discussed.

AB This study examined administration method (standard written administration vs. oral administration by an examiner) as a variable in influencing children's self-report test scores. Subjects included 139 students in grades 3-6, randomly assigned to one or the other administration condition. Subjects completed the Internalizing Disorders Evaluation Scale for Children (IDESC) according to the assigned administration method. Internal consistency estimates of each group were essentially similar. Mean IDESC scores of the two groups did not differ significantly from either a statistical or practical standpoint, based on t-test and effect size calculations. Results suggest that method of administration did not affect test performance. Implications for child assessment and future research are discussed.

ID PSYCHIATRIC STATUS; HYPERACTIVE BOYS; DISORDERS; DEPRESSION; CHILDHOOD;
   HEALTH
AB Objective: The authors examined the stability of DSM-III-R disorders and groups of disorders in adolescent inpatients followed up 2 years after hospitalization. Method: Seventy hospitalized adolescents were reliably assessed by using structured diagnostic interviews for DSM-III-R disorders. Two years later the subjects were independently assessed with the same interviews. Diagnostic stability was measured by determining both the percentage of persisting cases and the kappa statistic. Results: Internalizing disorders had the highest percentage of persisting cases (59%) but an insignificant kappa due to many new cases at follow-up. Externalizing disorders had a lower percentage of stable cases (39%) but a significant kappa because Of fewer new cases. Substance use disorders were fairly stable (53%) and had a significant kappa, indicating that this may be the most stable group of disorders in adolescents. Personality disorder clusters were relatively unstable, especially clusters A and C. Conclusions: Diagnostic stability in these hospitalized adolescents was less than that reported for adults. This may indicate that DSM-III-R diagnoses in adolescents have poor construct validity, but it may also reflect the different paths for development of psychopathology during adolescence. For axis I, externalizing disorders appear most specific to adolescence, with some persistence but decreasing incidence over time. Existing cases of internalizing disorders tend to be even more persistent, but the high incidence of new cases during adolescence contributes to lower overall stability. Substance use disorders appear to be most stable, and personality disorders appear to be least stable, in adolescents.

AB Person perception is one of several aspects of the first steps in social informatation-processing, viz., encoding and mental representation of social cues. To study person perception in conduct-disordered bays, we ur;ed the method of free person description. First, age-related effects on the various measures of peer descriptions were studied in normal boys. Second, peer descriptions made by oppositional-defiant and conduct-disordered (CD) boys were compared with those made by a normal control (NC) group and a psychiatric control group with internalizing disorders (ID). Just like younger normal bays when compared with older ones CD boys, when compared with NC boys, perceived their peers more from an egocentric point of view. They paid less attention to the peers' inner, personal worlds and instead attended more to the peers' external qualities; more specifically they focused more on items relating to the peers' activities with others. In all these respects ID boys took a position in between CD and NC boys without differing significantly from either group. Findings concerning CD boys' representations of peers are discussed with respect to other aspects of mental representation (perspective-taking, empathy) and the effect of these representations on the generation of nonprosocial and antisocial solutions to social problems with peers.

AB Research on the development of childhood internalizing problems has largely failed to consider that there may be different developmental paths for boys and girls. Additionally, studies have begun with elementary school children who are well beyond their first social experiences. This study follows 144 boys and 125 girls from kindergarten (for most children the time of first social experiences) to fifth grade. We identify the best predictors of fifth grade internalizing problems from kindergarten measure of anxiety-withdrawal, shyness, adaptability, and popularity. We also test whether maternal overprotectiveness moderates the link between kindergarten predictors and fifth-grade internalizing problems. Throughout, we consider boys and girls separately. Peer-rated unpopularity was the best predictor of later problems for both boys and girls, followed by peer-rated shyness for boys and teacher-rated anxiety-withdrawal for girls. Maternal overprotectiveness was more important for boys than girls. For boys overprotectiveness reduced the predictive link between some kindergarten variables and some fifth-grade outcomes; for girls overprotectiveness did not significantly moderate the predictive link. We discuss the advantages of different perspectives (peers, teachers, and mothers) for predicting internalizing problems. We also discuss the roles of early temperament, early social experience, and maternal overprotectiveness versus close temporal experience in developing internalizing problems.

AB This study rested whether retrospective reports of childhood exposure to parental partner abuse were associated with internalizing aspects of adult adjustment. Participants were 550 men and women college students. Among women, childhood exposure to partner abuse was related to depression, trauma-related symptoms, and low self-esteem; among men, exposure was associated with trauma-related symptoms. These relationships were statistically independent of reported parental alcohol abuse and divorce. Relationships of parental partner abuse to low self-esteem and depression among women were also independent of variation in retrospective reports of child sexual and physical abuse. However the relationship of partner abuse to trauma-related symptoms depended, in part, on the co-occurrence of child abuse. The discussion addressed implications of the findings for future research and for clinical practice.

AB Choosiness, manifested in refusal of foods, eating little, and disinterest in food, was studied with regard to prevalence, stability, sociodemographic characteristics, health problems, weight, and associated problem behaviors in a sample of 240 Swedish primary school children. Questionnaires were used, and data on sociodemographic variables, health problems, weight, and height were collected from child health-care and school health records. Choosiness was present in one third of the children, but only 8% showed choosy behavior both at home and in school. The choosy children had no more health problems than others, nor were they significantly thinner. Choosiness was not related to gender, social class, or ethnic background. The choosy children had modestly elevated levels of externalizing, hyperactive, and internalizing behavior. The choosy children with a history of refusal to eat in infancy or preschool age had more pronounced choosy behavior and had more problem behaviors than the other choosy children. Choosiness can not easily be categorized within an eating disorders or main problem syndromes of childhood frame of reference.

AB Employing predictors derived from the stress resistance and adult attachment literature, two studies are reported on the effects of war separation due to Operation Desert Storm on the families of South Carolina Reserve and National Guard member families. Study One, conducted during March and April 1991 (just following the cessation of fighting), sampled soldiers' spouses who attended military support group meetings. Data showed that separation was correlated with emotional distress for spouses and internalizing-type behavior problems in children. Spouse distress was positively correlated with family disruption ratings and negatively correlated with attachment security whereas children's reactions were primarily determined by mother distress and, to a lesser extent, family disruption. Attachment style was a particularly powerful predictor of distress among childless spouses. Only for those reporting high levels of family disruption did military support group perceptions moderate distress levels. In Study Two, conducted in December 1991, six months after reunion, another sample was studied using participants who responded to a survey mailed to spouses of all state Reserve and National Guard personnel activated during Desert Storm. The instrument assessed retrospective accounts of distress during separation, and children's behavior at separation and reunion. As in Study One, distress was related to family disruption and attachment style, and maternal distress was highly related to children's behavior during deployment and at reunion. Adult attachment security was significantly related to children's behavior at reunion and marginally related to behavior problems during separation. Results are discussed with reference to both research on effects of war-related stresses on families, and on importance of considering adult attachment in research on stressful separations.

AB Objective: Despite the prevalence of nonalcohol substance abuse disorders, few data are available on the high-risk children of parents with these disorders. To this end as a preliminary study, children of opioid-dependent parents were assessed on measures of emotional and behavioral problems. Method: Child Behavior Checklist data from 15 girls and 29 boys (mean age 10.4 years) from 27 families of parents receiving treatment in a methadone maintenance clinic were compared with matched data from referred children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: plus comorbid psychiatric disorders (''comorbid ADHD children'') and medically referred children without ADHD (''controls''). Results: The children of opioid-dependent parents had significantly poorer competency scores, and higher scores on both Internalizing and Externalizing subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist, compared with controls (p values < .01), but not compared with comorbid ADHD children. Twenty-four children (55%) of opioid-dependent parents had elevated subscale scores indicative of significant psychopathology. Conclusions: These pilot data seem to indicate that the 4- to 18-year-old children of parents with opioid dependence have high rates of psychopathology and significant dysfunction and suggest the need for further controlled studies in this population.

AB In order to better understand the transgeneration liability for a substance abuse disorder, we investigated the impact of parental and familial substance abuse disorders on prepubertal boys. Specifically, the influence of each parent's substance abuse history and the effects of significant family aggregation of substance abuse disorders were tested as predictors of the child's behavioral disposition, IQ, and school achievement scores, while controlling for socioeconomic status (SES). Sons of substance abusing fathers were found to have higher externalizing and internalizing problem-behavior scores, Lower IQ scores, and lower school achievement scores. Internalizing and externalizing problem-behavior scores were most strongly associated with bilinear parental substance abuse, whereas SES and paternal substance abuse were most strongly associated with IQ and school performance scores. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that although paternal substance abuse has an adverse impact on the son's functioning, bilineal parental substance abuse is associated with the greatest behavioral deviancy among prepubertal males and is associated with a greater liability for substance abuse.

AB Objective: To investigate the 4-year course of behavioral and emotional problems from adolescence into young adulthood in a general population sample. Method: The population consisted of 364 individuals, aged 15 to 18 years at the beginning of the study. Subjects filled out the Youth Self-Report at the first time of assessment. At follow-up, 2 and 4 years later, subjects aged 19 or older completed the Young Adult Self-Report, which was derived from the Youth Self-Report. Results: Almost 40% of the adolescents who were classified as deviant initially were still deviant 4 years later. There was no significant difference in the continuity of internalizing problems versus externalizing problems in this sample. Conclusions: All types of problems tended to persist to a similar degree. This holds also for problems that are often regarded as typical childhood problems, such as attention problems and hyperactivity. Because adolescent problems are likely to continue, we need more knowledge on the efficacy of interventions.

AB Numerous children of migrant and seasonal farm workers live in rural areas of our country.  The lifestyles and living conditions of farm workers place the children of these families at high risk for many health problems.  However, few studies have focused on the emotional and behavioral well-being of these children.
   This study extends past research by examining the emotional and behavioral health of the children of farm workers in relation to a potentially risky environmental exposure, namely, exposure to violence.  In this descriptive study, the extent of violence exposure, including being a witness to and a victim of violence, is examined among 8-11-year-old children of migrant and seasonal farm workers.  Potential relationships between sociodemographic factors and violence exposure are examined, and associations between violence exposure and children's emotional and behavioral problems, and weapon carrying behavior are investigated.
   The results show that more than half of the study children had been exposed to violence, with 46 percent having witnessed violence among others and 19 percent having been the direct victims of violence.  There was a fair degree of overlap between having witnessed violence and having been a victim of violence; 13 percent of all study children both witnessed and had been victims of violence, 33 percent only had witnessed violence, and 6 percent only had been victims of violence.
   Violence exposure was positively related to children's emotional problems, behavioral problems, and weapon carrying behavior.  Compared to nonexposed children, violence exposed children were eight times more likely to evidence internalizing problems, were six times more likely to evidence externalizing problems, and were four times more likely to carry weapons (specifically, knives or guns).
   These findings suggest that there is a need for further research on this high-risk population, as well as the need to develop and implement innovative public health interventions for rural children.

AB In this 6-month prospective study of 138 ninth-grade inner-city students, associations among different aspects of school-based social competence were examined. In addition, links between initial emotional adjustment and subsequent social competence at school were explored. Aspects of social competence examined included academic achievement, peer reputation, and teacher-rated classroom behaviors. Emotional adjustment was measured based on self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Consonant with views positing continuity and coherence of development, high temporal consistency was found within each social competence domain. In addition, superior adjustment in one domain was sometimes associated with subsequent improvements in other spheres as well. Exceptions found to this pattern were that (a) both as an antecedent and as a consequent variable, peer-rated sociability was negatively linked with other indices of school-based functioning, and (b) among girls, high anxiety was related to improved performance at school over the year. Ecological influences in adolescent adjustment are discussed, and implications of the findings for future research are explored.

AB The social competence of students with learning disabilities (LD), low achievement (LA), and average to high achievement (AHA) was examined from the perspectives of parents, teachers, peels, and self, guided by a theoretical model of social competence (Vaughn & Hogan, 1990) that includes social skills, behavior problems, peer relations, and self-perceptions. Parent ratings of social skills did not differ significantly among achievement groups; however, for two factors of behavior problems (internalizing and hyperactivity), students with LD and LA were rated as having more problems than AHA students. Teachers perceived students with LD and LA as demonstrating poorer social skills and more behavior problems than AHA students. Peer ratings indicated that students with LD and LA were less liked by peers than were AHA students, yet only LA students received significantly higher peer rejection. Self-reports differentiated the groups on one factor: cooperation. Discussion focuses on the complexity of social competence as a construct, and explanations of the results are offered.

Both former patients and their mothers were interviewed for this follow-up study. Medical records were obtained for those patients who reported receiving new diagnoses for abdominal pain since their initial assessment. Results indicated that only one of the former RAP patients was later diagnosed with organic disease that clearly accounted for his earlier abdominal pain. Nonetheless, at follow-lip former RAP patients reported significantly higher levels of abdominal pain, other somatic symptoms, and functional disability (including school/work absence) than did former well patients. Mothers reported higher levels of internalizing emotional symptoms in former RAP patients than in former well patients.

ID CHILDREN; PARENTS; COMPETENCE
AB There is substantial evidence of the relationship between maternal depressive mood and problematic child functioning.  The vast majority of studies in this area concentrate on cross-sectional designs and depressive mood at one point in time.  In contrast to the existing literature, the goal of this study was to investigate the relation of change in maternal depressed mood across time and adolescent functioning, including the possible moderating effects of gender of the adolescent and the marital status of parents.  Regression analyses indicated that increased depressed mood across one year predicted teacher report of higher levels of externalizing and internalizing problems and lower levels of social competence, above that which could be predicted from the initial assessment of depressed mood.  With one exception, neither gender nor parental marital status qualified the findings.  The results suggest that static levels of maternal depressive mood are not sufficient for forecasting adolescent functioning.  Future research needs also to consider change in such mood.

AB Objective:  This study examined the relationship between behavioural inhibition, insecure mother-child attachment and evidence of anxiety in the offspring of mothers with anxiety disorders.  Method:  Twenty children aged 18 to 59 months who were born to 18 mothers with diagnosed anxiety disorders were examined for behavioural inhibition (Kagan's measures) and mother-child attachment (Strange Situation Procedure).  Child anxiety was assessed using DSM-III-R criteria and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).  Results:  Sixty-five percent of the children were behaviourally inhibited.  They showed more somatic problems and fewer destructive behaviours than those who were not inhibited.  Eighty percent of the children were insecurely attached.  They had higher CBCL internalizing scores than secure children and three of them met diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders.  Conclusion:  Though preliminary, this work suggests a need to identify children of anxious mothers as being at risk for anxiety, especially in the presence of inhibited temperament or attachment difficulties.

ID CHRONIC ILLNESS
AB Analysis of longitudinal data for 145 children [5] healthy, 40 with cystic fibrosis (CF), and 54 with congenital heart disease (CHD)I was conducted: (a) to ascertain whether behavioral problems evident in older medically compromised children would be reported as early as 2-3 years-of-age; and (b) to test theoretical predictions concerning the role of infant-mother attachment in the etiology of behavior problems. As predicted, children with a medical diagnosis received higher scores from parents on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), primarily on the Internalizing scale. Reports of somatic symptoms did not account for this effect. Contrary to predictions, children with CHD were reported to have more behavior problems than those with CF. Secure attachment was associated with lower CBCL scores for internalizing problems regardless of medical status. The increase in behavior problem reports associated with insecure attachment was shown to reflect an effect of avoidance rather than insecurity per se. The importance of distinguishing effects of different types of insecurity and the need for meta-analytic strategies to do so is emphasized.

TI AN EXAGGERATED CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPONSE TO METHYLPHENIDATE IN ADHD
   CHILDREN WITH ANXIETY
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The cardiovascular responses to methylphenidate (MPH) were investigated in anxious and nonanxious children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design was used to evaluate the acute effects of three doses (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg/kg) of MPH on cardiovascular function in 63 children (34 nonanxious, 29 anxious), aged 6 to 12 years, with ADHD. Resting heart rate as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were taken prior to 1 hr after, and 2 hrs after administration of medication. Results indicated that baseline cardiovascular measures were similar for the two diagnostic groups. MPH produced the expected dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in heart rate and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all children. However, MPH produced significantly greater increases in diastolic blood pressure in the anxious ADHD group, particularly 1 hr after its administration, than in the nonanxious ADHD children. Although these stimulant-induced changes were generally of little clinical concern, the exaggerated response of the ADHD/ANX children to MPH challenge supports the hypothesis of increased sensitivity to augmented noradrenergic function in this group. The presence of high levels of trait anxiety in some ADHD children alters the cardiovascular response to MPH, suggesting that highly anxious children with ADHD may constitute a distinct subgroup of children with ADHD. In this study, anxiety was defined by the child's self-report, so the findings attest to the importance of obtaining children's self-report of internalizing symptomatology. The presence of self-reported anxiety in ADHD children should alert clinicians to the possibility of a differential response to psychostimulants in anxious ADHD children.

AB Examined adaptive behaviors among 126 psychiatrically hospitalized children. Intelligence has previously been found to serve protective functions for the maintenance of socially competent behaviors. In this study, two constructs in addition to intelligence, possibly associated with this protective effect, were examined: level of academic achievement and the distinction between internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Sex effects were also examined. Of the variables examined, achievement showed the strongest associations with different types of adaptive behaviors. Further, achievement levels appeared to mediate the modest associations that were found for intelligence. Type of symptomatology had significant associations with adaptive behaviors chiefly in the socialization domain, and these effects seemed largely independent of both IQ and achievement. Results are discussed in terms of implications for interventions with psychiatrically hospitalized children.

AB Mothers, fathers, and 6- to 10-year-old children used the Family Cohesion Index to type their family system as cohesive (all close), separate (all distant), triangulated (cross-generational coalitions), or detouring (child excluded from the parental subsystem). Family members agreed modestly with one another. Multivariate analyses of variance showed that parents in triangulated families were higher in marital conflict and dissatisfaction than were cohesive and detouring parents. Children in triangulated families reported more interparental conflict and more negative affect in the family. Children in detouring families rated themselves higher in self-blame for their parents' conflicts, and their parents rated them highest in internalizing problems. Parents in separate families rated their children highest in externalizing problems. Implications for the integration of family systems perspectives with research on marriage and parenting are discussed.

ID ADULT-RATS; CHILDREN; INFANTS
AB Objective: To study the effects of initial and concurrent dose levels of L-thyroxine on ability and behavior in children with congenital hypothyroidism.
   Methods: An existing database, involving a large cohort of children with congenital hypothyroidism detected by neonatal screening, was analyzed retrospectively, There were 94 children: 89 were assessed at age 7 years for intelligence and selective cognitive abilities, and 87 at age 8 years for behavior, achievement, and selective abilities.
   Results: Subjects were stratified by median spilt into low and high starting dose groups. The high-dose group performed better on indexes of intelligence, verbal ability, and memory but had more behavior problems reflecting increased anxiety, social withdrawal, and poorer concentration. The dose of L-thyroxine at age 8 years was negatively correlated with memory task performance.
   Conclusion: A higher starting dose of L-thyroxine is beneficial for subsequent intellectual outcome in children with congenital hypothyroidism but may be associated with internalizing behavior problems.

AB This exploratory study examined parenting and child problem behavior differences between families of preschoolers with and without mild handicapping conditions. Sixty-five families of preschoolers with mild handicaps were compared with sixty families with nonhandicapped children by means of the Parent Behavior Checklist and the Child Behavior Checklist, The results indicated that mothers of the mildly handicapped sample had lower developmental expectations for their children than did mothers of the nonhandicapped sample. Parents rated their preschoolers with mild handicaps as displaying higher levels of internalizing and total behavior problems than did parents of nonhandicapped preschoolers. Increases in parental discipline were related to increases in parents' ratings of children's externalizing behavior for ail families. The implications of these findings for school psychologists relative to developing individualized family service plans are discussed.

AB This study examined the comparability and predictive validity of three approaches to the measurement of child maltreatment. Adolescents (N = 160, aged 11-17) were randomly selected from the open caseload of a child protection agency. Global ratings of maltreatment severity were made by three reporting sources: researchers on the basis of protection agency case files, protection agency social workers, and the adolescents themselves. Ratings were made of five types of maltreatment: physical, sexual, emotional, neglect, and exposure to family violence. Self-reported (YSR) and caretaker-reported (CBCL) adjustment measures were also obtained for each subject. Results indicated that over 90% of the sample had experienced more than one type of malteatment. Comparison of ratings across sources indicated considerable disagreement with respect to judgments of maltreatment occurrence and severity. Relative to professional ratings, adolescent ratings were better predictors of externalizing and internalizing symptomatology in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

AB We assessed relations between early temperament and behavior problems across 12 years in an unselected sample of over 800 children.  Temperament measures were drawn from behavior ratings made by examiners who observed children at ages 3, 5, 7, and 9.  Factor analyses revealed 3 dimensions at each age:  Lack of Control, Approach, and Sluggishness.  Temperament dimensions at ages 3 and 5 were correlated in theoretically coherent ways with behavior problems that were independently evaluated by parents and teachers at ages 9 and 11, and by parents at ages 13 and 15.  Lack of Control was more strongly associated with later externalizing behavior problems than with internalizing problems; Approach was associated with fewer internalizing problems among boys; and Sluggishness was weakly associated with both anxiety and inattention, especially among girls.  Lack of Control and Sluggishness were also associated with fewer adolescent competencies.  These results suggest that early temperament may have predictive specificity for the development of later psychopathology.

AB Objective. To determine the demographic characteristics, medical features, psychological profile, and natural history of children with chronic fatigue.
   Design. Case control study.
   Setting. Pediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic of Kosair Children's Hospital, 1990 to 1992.
   Participants. Forty-four patients referred for persistent tent fatigue were evaluated. Twenty patients participated in a psychological study; 20 healthy controls of similar age and gender were recruited from community pediatric practices and 20 matched depressed controls were recruited from university psychiatry services (subjects were treated as groups in the analyses).
   Measures. Demographic data were obtained for all referred patients. Those with fatigue for at least 2 months and no alternative diagnosis received a detailed history, physical and battery of laboratory tests (complete blood count, sedimentation rate, chemistry panel, chest X-ray, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, anti-nuclear antibodies, urinalysis, immunoglobulins, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), toxoplasma, and cytomegalovirus serologies). Psychological study participants completed the following: background structured interview; Kaufman Brief intelligence Test; Children's Depression Inventory; Child Behavior Checklist; Youth Self Report; Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised; mail-in follow-up survey.
   Results. The median age of fatigue patients was 14.3 years; 60% were female, 96% white, and 87% from the mid/upper socioeconomic status (SES). Fatigue patients were demographically similar to 21 patients referred for infectious mononucleosis (IM) but were older than other clinic patients (P < .0001). White race (P = .0568) and mid/upper SES (P = .0403) were over-represented among fatigue patients compared to patients referred for other diagnoses. Of 36 patients meeting criteria for further study, 5 had an IM-like illness including evidence of recent EBV infection. For the remaining 31 patients, clinical and laboratory evaluations were unrevealing. Psychological study subjects reported marked declines in quality-of-life and scored high on measures of internalizing, withdrawal, and social isolation. Nine met diagnostic criteria for depression, although depressive symptoms were not as prominent as those reported by depressed controls. Fatigue subjects scored higher on somatization than both control groups. The follow-up survey indicated symptomatic improvement in most patients.
   Conclusions. Chronic fatigue was a common reason for referral, with over-representation of white children from mid/upper SES. After exclusion of EBV-associated IM, screening laboratory tests were not helpful in establishing specific organic diagnoses. Whereas the natural history was favorable, chronic fatigue resulted in major quality-of-life changes and was associated with significant levels of psychosocial distress.
   Implications. Psychological evaluation is warranted in these patients, as some may have treatable psychological conditions. Given the absence of proved medical therapies, psychosocial interventions to improve quality-of-life should be studied.

AB Research on children with learning disabilities, and reading disabilities in particular, indicates a high comorbidity with both internalizing and externalizing disorders. In the first study, a group of children with reading disability (RD, N = 17) was compared with a group of children with RD and co-occurring psychopathology (RD+, N = 17) on a number of neuropsychological measures. Group comparisons did not reveal any significant differences. The second study investigated the performance of subjects with significant reading disability (RD/RD+, N = 16) as compared to subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (N = 18) on a number of neurolinguistic and phonological measures. Group comparisons revealed the RD group to have relative deficits in phonological coding, expressive language, elision, and vocabulary. The results of these studies revealed that regardless of the presence of co-occurring psychopathology, children with RD suffer deficits in neurolinguistic abilities, particularly those relating to phonological processes. These results support the notion that children with reading disabilities suffer primary deficits in language and phonological processes and that these deficits are specific to the presence of reading disabilities even when comorbid psychopathology exists.

AB Two subgroups of learning disabled students, reading disabled only (RD) and reading/arithmetic disabled (RAD), were contrasted at two age levels, 8 to 12 years old and 12 to 17 years old. At both age levels, RAD students were significantly poorer spellers and weaker on the Arithmetic and Coding subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) than RD-only students, The younger subgroups were also differentiated by four other WISC-R subtests: Information, Similarities, Comprehension, and Block Design. The adolescent subgroups differed on the new Symbol Search subtest of the WISC-III. The subgroups did not differ at either age level on phonological skills, memory tasks, naming speed, and picture vocabulary. Nor did they differ on parent ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Evidence is presented that arithmetic disabled children fall relatively further behind with increasing age. A core weakness in reading and arithmetic disability is processing speed, and students with dual disabilities are particularly impaired. Other possible factors in co-occurring reading and arithmetic disability are inferential reasoning, generalization, temperament, and inadequate supervised practice.

The analyses were based on a sample of patients in a child and adolescent psychiatric hospital (N = 2921. The internal consistencies of the total score and the Externalizing and Internalizing groupings are at least satisfactory (r(tt) > .80). Apart from the syndrome scales ''Withdrawn'' and ''Thought Problems'', the reliabilities of the syndrome scales are satisfactory (r(tt) > .70). The internal consistencies of the syndrome scales of the German and the American samples are comparable. The intercorrelations of the scales are generally relatively low or moderate. The structure of the syndrome scales was confirmed by factor analyses, except for the scale ''Withdrawn''. Corn parisons with a clinical sample from the United States show high correspondences of the scale scores in some cases.

AB This study compared parent-reported competencies and behavioral/emotional problems in demographically-matched samples of Creek and American children, ages 6-11. Parents of 356 children of each nationality completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Competence scores were higher for American children, except on Academic Competence, where scores were higher for Creek children. Creek scores were significantly higher than American scores on the Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problem scales. On the Anxious/Depressed syndrome, nationality accounted for 14% of the variance. There were few main effects for sex and age and fewer interactions. The higher problem scores in the Creek sample were partly due to the tendency of Greek parents to use extreme item scores. When items were scored present v. absent, Creek scores were higher only on Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, Internalizing, and Total Problems, while American scores were higher on Somatic Complaints and Thought Problems. Nationality differences in rates of referral for mental health services and sample differences in exclusion criteria for prior mental health services may have contributed to differences in problem scores. Results are compared to findings from other cross-cultural studies.

AB This study examined the psychosocial adjustment of children with asthma compared to children with diabetes, with cancer, and healthy children and the role of functional status in psychosocial adjustment. The total sample included 100 children, aged 8-16 years, (mean = 11.5 years), consisting of 48 boys and 52 girls. Children with asthma scored significantly higher on measures of affective adjustment (depression and internalizing behavior), significantly lower on self-esteem, and evidenced significantly greater functional impairment. Children with cancer missed significantly more school days. After controlling for functional status, no significant differences remained in affective adjustment but absences remained significantly higher for the children with cancer.

AB This study empirically investigated the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and combat level on Vietnam veterans' perceptions of their children's behavior, as well as its effects on their marital adjustment.  Results indicated that the predictor variables of PTSD and combat level together explained 33.6% of the variance in perceived child behavior problems (p < .001) and 51.8% of the variance in marital adjustment (p < .001).  In addition, PTSD and combat level, when observed together, reliably predicted internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in addition to four specific areas of marital adjustment.  When observed individually, however, it was shown that child behavior problems and marital adjustment were predicted primarily by PTSD, rather than combat level.

AB Ample research has shown that female adolescents endorse more internalizing and fewer externalizing symptoms than do male adolescents, but explanations for these gender differences have not been forthcoming. In this review, we integrated research findings of gender differences in subtypes of depressive vulnerabilities and in reactivity to stressful life events involving the self or others in order to suggest possible explanations of gender differences in adolescent psychopathology. Adolescent girls show greater interpersonal depressive vulnerability and greater reactivity to stressful events involving others. In contrast, gender differences have not been found in adolescents' self-critical depressive vulnerability and in their reactivity to stressful events involving issues of self-worth. We argue that adolescents with heightened interpersonal depressive vulnerability (who fear abandonment and seek attention and nurturing) arree more reactive to stressful events involving others and are more likely to exhibit internalizing than externalizing syndromes. On the other hand, adolescents with heightened self-critical depressive vulnerability (who experience guilt and self-blame and avoid interpersonal intimacy) are more reactive to stressful events involving threats to the self and are more likely to exhibit externalizing, in addition to internalizing, syndromes.

AB Objective:  The primary purpose of this investigation is to assess psychiatric symptoms of Chinese-American children using Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and to determine the impact of acculturation on these symptoms.  Method:  One hundred eighty-one forms of a Chinese CBCL and a 10-item questionnaire on adjustment and ethnic patterns of socialization were completed by a parent or guardian of Chinese-American children attending a Chinese school in New York City.  Results:  The sample's total problem, internalizing, externalizing, total competence, activities, and social scores were significantly lower than Achenbach's American norms by age and sex.  Favorable adjustment was correlated significantly with lower total problem and internalizing scores.  Recent immigrants did not have higher symptom scores.  Conclusion:  Lower scores of the Chinese-American children may be due to temperamental differences, underreporting by the respondent, or cultural intolerance of misbehavior.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish a dose-response relationship between extent of perinatal cerebral injury and quality of developmental outcome in childhood. To attain this goal, 54 school-and preschool-age children who had incurred perinatal intracranial hemorrhage were recruited. The main index of hemorrhage severity-the degree of acute ventriculomegaly observed on the cranial ultrasonogram during the neonatal period-was significantly associated with outcome in all measured domains. These included verbal and nonverbal intelligence, motor skills, and behavioral problems associated with the externalizing and internalizing syndromal groupings. The putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed dose-response relationship between perinatal lesion severity and developmental outcome are discussed.

AB The study was carried out in two stages. In the first stage 408 school going children between eight and twelve years of age were selected for screening and their respective teachers were asked to fill up the Rutter's A and B proforma. The point prevalence of disturbance was found to be 10.54 percent, being somewhat similar for both the sexes, with peaking of disturbance at eight to nine years of age. In the second stage, to obtain the profile and pattern of disturbance, a sample of eighteen children were selected from each of the 'disturbed' and 'nondisturbed' group, through stratified sampling for age and sex, and their respective teachers rated them on the Achenbach's Child Behaviour Check Lists. The disturbed students were found to be significantly higher on unpopular, self destructive, inattentive, nervous, overactive and other problems scores than nondisturbed students. Boys had higher externalising problems, while the girls had higher internalizing problems. Rutter's proforma was found to have less sensitivity for detecting internalizing problems.

Each child psychiatric ward was the only one in the respective area.  The purpose of the study was to investigate the short-term effectiveness of brief, time-limited inpatient treatment programs.  Children were evaluated by a parent or parent figure with the Child Behaviour Checklist and Rutter Parent's Questionnaire A2 and by a school teacher with the Teacher Report Form and Rutter Teacher's Questionnaire B2 both on admission to inpatient treatment and at follow-up after discharge.  In general, there was a rather remarkable improvement in behaviour.  However, two-thirds of the patients were functioning outside the normal range at follow-up.  Treatment programs seemed to have more short-term impact on externalizing than on internalizing behaviour problems.

AB The effect of early prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure on cognitive and behavioral development, behavior problems, and temperament were examined in 26 consecutively identified children aged 6 mo to 5 1/2 years, whose mothers had been DEX-treated during pregnancy because their offspring was at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and compared with 14 children from untreated CAH-risk pregnancies. Three children in each group were CAH-affected. Assessments were performed by way of mother-completed standard questionnaires. No significant differences in cognitive abilities or behavior problems were identified. On temperament questionnaires, DEX-exposed children showed more Shyness (p < .004), greater Emotionality (p < .03), less Sociability (p < .04), and a trend for greater Avoidance (p < .07) than unexposed children. DEX-exposed children also had significantly higher Internalizing (p < .002) and Total Problem scores (p < .05) on the behavior problem measure for 2-3 year olds. The results should be considered preliminary until they have been replicated by the study of a larger sample and direct examination of the children.

AB Temperament has been hypothesized to mediate the effects of family history of substance abuse (SA) on behavioral maladjustment in children. To date no study has provided empirical evidence to support this mediation hypothesis. In this study the temperament mediation hypothesis was tested employing hierarchical regression and other linear regression procedures. ''Difficult affective temperament'' in fathers and sons was found to mediate the relationship between SA+ family history and behavior maladjustment in 10- to 12-year-old sons of SA+ (n = 41) and SA- (n = 39) families. The authors discuss implications of the phenotype of difficult affective temperament in describing the developmental pathway to substance abuse.

AB The authors conducted a cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study of stress, coping, and psychological symptoms in children of divorce. The sample consisted of 258 children (mean age = 10.1; SD = 1.2), of whom 196 were successfully followed 5.5 months later. A 4-dimensional model of coping was found using confirmatory factor analysis, with the factors being active coping, avoidance, distraction, and support. In the cross-sectional model avoidance coping partially mediated the relations between negative events and symptoms while active coping moderated the relations between negative events and conduct problems. In the longitudinal model significant negative paths were found from active coping and distraction Time 1 to internalizing symptoms Time 2, while Time 1 support coping had a positive path coefficient to Time 2 depression. Positive paths were found between negative events at Time 1 and anxiety at Time 2, and between all symptoms at Time 1 and negative events at Time 2.

AB The experience of peer rejection is associated with a number of concurrent and later problems for children.  However, we know very little about differences in risk relative to different experiences of rejection over time.  This study examined later academic and behavioral problems as a function of two dimensions by which rejection may vary over time:  chronicity and temporal proximity.  622 second- through fourth-grade children (ages 7-12) were tested in the spring of 4 consecutive years.  The results indicated that both chronicity and proximity directly influenced later adjustment.  Taken together, the findings suggest that all levels of rejection were associated with greater absenteeism from school, and more chronic and proximal experiences of rejection were associated with elevated externalizing behavior problems and teacher-rated internalizing behavior problems.  There was evidence that initial level of adjustment, gender, and development moderated the relation among these dimensions of rejection and later adjustment.

AB This study evaluated adolescents: parents: and teachers' self-reported distress and wishes to change adolescents' emotional/behavioral problems in a sample of clinically referred adolescents. Parents reported being bothered more than adolescents or teachers by adolescents' internalizing behavior. Both parents and teachers rated adolescents' externalizing behavior as more bothersome than did adolescents. Adolescents were significantly less likely to want to change their behavior than were parents or teachers. In addition, adolescents were significantly more likely to want to change their internalizing problems than their externalizing problems. For all three informants, being bothered by adolescents' behaviors was strongly associated with a desire to change the behaviors. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Evaluated behavioral difficulties in three groups of preschoolers (ages 2 to 4 years). low risk, social risk (e.g., poverty, one-parent families), and dual risk (both biological and social risk conditions). Parents of 238 toddlers completed the Child Behavior Checklist/2-3 (CBCL/2-3) and the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). Demographic, prenatal, and perinatal information was obtained to determine group status. Results indicated that toddlers in social- and dual-risk groups obtained significantly higher parent ratings on the Internalizing behaviors scale and the Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, and Destructive behavior subscales of the CBCL/2-3 when compared to toddlers in the low-risk group. No significant differences were obtained between social- and dual-risk groups or between specific biological risk categories (e.g., prematurity vs. developmental disorder). All ECBI results were nonsignificant. These findings suggest that social risk conditions place a preschooler at greater risk for behavioral difficulties, whether these poor social conditions occur with full-term, healthy infants or with children at biological risk (e.g., prematurity). It is recommended that social risk factors as well as biological risk factors be considered so that early intervention programs may target problematic behavior in their treatment approaches with preschoolers.

DE PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT; RATING SCALES; INTERNALIZING PROBLEMS;
   EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS
AB The Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) is a well-designed and useful set of measures for the assessment and identification of school-age children with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders.  The BASC consists of five measures designed to gather information about a child or adolescent from a variety of sources (teachers, parents, direct observations, students, and historical records).  In combining this information into an integrated system, the BASC uniquely attempts to provide a multidimensional understanding of a child.  This review summarizes the technical qualities of the BASC and critiques its usefulness for practicing school psychologists.  Although there are shortcomings, the BASC is made up of some of the best measures of their kind and represents an approach of choice for identifying children with emotional and behavioral disorders in schools.

AB This study examined predictors of strategies used to cope with pain in children with sickle cell disease and their mothers. Method: Disease severity, socioeconomic status, child adjustment and adaptive behavior, maternal psychopathology, and family functioning were examined in 55 mother-child dyads to determine the predictive potential of these factors on engagement and disengagement coping. Results: While controlling for socioeconomic status and psychopathology in the mothers, 15% of the variance in engagement coping was predicted by family adaptability. Disengagement coping was predicted by internalizing symptoms exhibited by the child, including a negative and pessimistic attributional style, which accounted for nearly one fifth of the variance. Finally, mothers who reported more active strategies for coping with their child's pain were more likely to endorse greater use of techniques to prevent and effectively manage pain in their children. Conclusions: Neither coping strategy was predicted by severity of disease presentation in the children, suggesting the importance of psychosocial factors in adapting to childhood chronic illness and that severity of disease may not necessarily be a marker for families at risk for adjustment difficulties. Findings were interpreted to support a systemic family model in promoting active and adaptive engagement coping in caretakers of children with sickle cell syndrome.

AB Objective: This study examined whether adolescents having a first onset of major depression are changed by the experience (i.e., does having an episode of depression result in residual effects that did not exist before the episode?). Method: Among 1,507 community adolescents assessed at two time points approximately 1 year apart, 45 experienced and recovered from a first episode of depression between the two assessments. These adolescents were contrasted with never-depressed control subjects on an array of depression-related psychosocial variables before and after the episode. Results: Psychosocial scars (characteristics evident after but not before the episode) include internalizing behavior problems, stressful major life events, excessive emotional reliance on others, cigarette smoking, and subsyndromal depression symptoms. Both before and after the episode, the depressed adolescents reported an elevated level of physical health problems. Conclusions: More scars were found in the present study than in previous research with formerly depressed adults. This is consistent with the hypothesis that early-onset depression is a more pernicious form of the disorder that may impact adolescents more severely than adults.

AB During an investigation into behavioral problems of deaf children, 41 deaf boys were compared to a large group of hearing children of the same age.  T.M. Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist was used for data collection and analysis.  It appeared the deaf boys had more behavioral problems overall but that they were no more often disturbed than their hearing counterparts.  Internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems emerged with greater frequency in the deaf group.  Younger deaf boys showed more behavioral problems than older deaf boys with differences in age emerging as discriminating factors.

Comparisons between the two countries on the total behaviour problem scores, the total number of positive codings, the externalizing and internalizing scales and the social competence scales revealed a number of cultural differences. Greek children displayed consistently higher problem scores and lower scores on social and activities competence scores than the German children with the one exception of school competence. These results are discussed in relation to different intercultural attitudes, meanings and expectations of parents on their children.

AB The present study examined two aspects of depressed mood in adolescence:  (1) stability across the adolescent years and (2) ability to predict functioning in young adulthood.  Participants included 82 Caucasian individuals (46 females and 36 males) who were assessed one time per year for 4 consecutive years during adolescence (mean age at initial assessment = 13.5 years) and again during young adulthood (mean age = 19).  The results indicated that depressed mood, as measured by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), remained relatively stable across at least 3 consecutive years of data collection during adolescence.  In addition, adolescent CDI scores predicted young adult functioning in each of four areas:  prosocial competence, self-esteem, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems.

AB This review examines the role of longitudinal data in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of internalizing disorders in children and adolescents. On the basis of the limited longitudinal data available, it is suggested that internalizing disorders in children and adolescents are highly prevalent, frequently comorbid with other childhood disorders, and, arguably so, persistent over time. However, it is also noted that a considerable amount of instability characterizes these disorders and that the developmental course is not fully understood at this time. In addition, these disorders are responsive to treatment, at least on a short-term basis. Finally, a plea is made for longitudinal studies that use a developmental perspective in examining internalizing disorders in children and adolescents.

AB A clinic-referred population of 116 children with attentional problems was classified by DSM-III [attention deficit disorder (ADD)] with respect to inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The sample proved to subdivide into three groups: inattentive, impulsive, and hyperactive (HII), n = 60; inattentive and impulsive (II), n = 26; and inattentive (I), n = 30. The distinction between II and I resolves the confounding of impulsivity and inattention in previous studies of children who have ADD but are not hyperactive. The three groups were found to be similar in mean age, gender ratio, prevalence, and pattern of associated learning disabilities, family history of psychopathology, and probability of favorable response to methylphenidate. Group I differed from Groups HII and II in the frequency of externalizing relative to internalizing comorbid psychopathology. A group that is hyperactive and impulsive but not inattentive was not found. The preponderance of similarities in associated characteristics suggests that the three groups are differing clinical presentations of an ADD spectrum.

AB Examined the impact of a range of health related constructs reflecting maternal physical symptomatology, health services utilization, subjective health status, depressed mood, medical-psychological complaints, and marital adjustment on children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in a community sample (N = 145). Physical symptomatology predicted a general second-order latent factor of children's behavior problems. Depressed mood predicted a primary latent factor of internalizing child behavior problems. Seizure symptoms, and more health problems in the last 4 years specifically predicted child psychosomatic complaints/anxiety. Thus, general physical symptoms predicted a broad spectrum of problem behaviors, whereas specific mental or physical health problems predicted similar distinct problem behavior syndromes. Implications of these results for identifying children at risk for psychopathology, and the relevance of social learning theory and a broader based family systems approach are discussed.

AB Objective: To review the literature on conduct disorder in two areas: long-term outcome and the effects of interventions. Method: The sources of the articles for review were computer searches, but the articles were selected for this review to illustrate key findings in the long-term outcome area and to review critically four intervention strategies to prevent or treat conduct disorder, namely, parent- and family-targeted programs, social-cognitive programs, peer and school-based programs, and community programs. Results: Conduct problems in childhood predict the same increased rates of psychiatric disorder overall in men and women but the patterns are different: for externalizing disorders, the prediction is stronger in men and for internalizing disorders, the prediction is stronger in women. In the intervention domain, the literature provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of either primary or secondary prevention. Conclusions: Prospective studies of community samples of children provide the best opportunity to understand more thoroughly the adult outcomes of conduct disorder. Because of the heavy burden of suffering of conduct disorder, and the limited effectiveness of clinical interventions, there is a compelling argument in favor of an increased emphasis on primary prevention efforts.

AB Objective: To test predictions that basal salivary testosterone and cortisol are related to antisocial and internalizing behaviors, respectively, and that cortisol moderates the testosterone-aggression relationship. Method: Saliva samples were assayed to determine testosterone and cortisol levels in 40 clinic-referred disruptive children (aged 7 through 14 years) who were rated on aggression, inattention/overactivity, and internalizing behavior by parents, teachers, and clinic staff members. Results: Results indicated significant positive relationships between testosterone and staff-rated aggression and between cortisol and parent-rated internalizing behavior. A significant negative relationship was found between cortisol and staff-rated inattention/overactivity. No interactions between testosterone and cortisol were found. These results were maintained regardless of age, racial background, height, weight, diagnosis, or medication status. Conclusions: Results suggest moderate relationships between testosterone and observed aggression, and between cortisol and emotional behaviors, in a group of disruptive children. Cortisol did not moderate the testosterone-aggression relationship in this population.

AB Interviews were conducted with parents of 136 female and 45 male adolescents categorized into risk groups for the later development of an eating disorder.  The family and school concomitants of risk status in females were demonstrated to be different from that in males.  Risk group female adolescents rated family cohesion, parent-adolescent communication processes, and overall family satisfaction more negatively than the comparison group.  Mothers of moderate risk group females reported lower family cohesion than the comparison group; there were no group differences for adolescent females in fathers' ratings of family measures.  However, no group differences were found on any of the family measures between male risk and comparison males.  For both females and males, there were no significant group differences in family history of eating and mood disorders, or alcohol dependence.  Teacher ratings indicated relatively greater internalizing tendencies in the high-risk female group.

AB Parents gave histories of 589 children just before kindergarten.  Children were later assessed with teacher, peer, and observer measures of social adjustment in school.  Children with higher day-care amounts in each of 3 eras (0-1, 1-4, and 4-5 years) scored higher on the composite negative adjustment and lower on positive adjustment (however, they also scored lower on teacher-rated internalizing problems).  Day care predicted even after statistical control for measures representing alternative explanations, such as family stress and socioeconomic status, accounting for 2.7% of variance in negative adjustment and 2.9% of positive adjustment.  Interactions between day care and other variables did not add to predictions of the molar adjustment composites.  Extensive infancy care did not in itself predict adjustment, according to planned contrasts that controlled for total amount of day care received across the 3 eras of the child's life.

AB Examined the role of family social support and social problem-solving skills in moderating the effects of children's stressful life events on behavioral adjustment.  Participants were 322 fourth and fifth graders who reported on their stressful experiences during the past year.  Children from both regular education (RE) or special education (SE) classrooms were included in the sample.  Additional self-report data from children also included measures related to perceived level of family social support, a personality questionnaire, and a social problem-solving measure.  In addition, teachers provided reports of the children's behavior and adjustment.  Main effects were found for total stress, school/peer stress, family social support, and social problem solving.  Significant moderator effects were found for family support on total stress for the teacher-reported internalizing problems of RE students and for family support on school/peer stress on the teacher-reported externalizing problems and self-reported anxiety problems of SE students.  Specific, theory-generated hypotheses are discussed as a more effective method of examining relations between stress and various moderator variables.

AB Objective: The current study examined a mixed-race, longitudinal sample of 114 boys to assess the relative power of aggression, low peer acceptance, and race in predicting a broad range of adolescent outcomes and behaviors. Method: Outcomes were assessed through self-report and through peer, teacher, and independent observer ratings. Results: Results indicate that preadolescent levels of aggression are predictive of boys' subsequent adolescent involvement in marijuana, drugs, and alcohol and in delinquent activity. Aggression and low peer acceptance served as predictors of teacher, peer, and independent observer ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior at follow-up. Results also indicate that peer ratings of social acceptance and of aggressive behavior operate differently across racial groups, when predicting to self-reported follow-up behaviors. Conclusions: Aggressive and socially disliked boys are at risk for engaging in a progressive series of behaviors that increase their engagement in contranormative behavior. The moderating effects of race may be due to biases in elementary school peer ratings in mixed-race samples, or they may represent actual differences in how early risk markers operate with boys of different racial status.

AB This study was designed to identify patterns of social-emotional subgroups among students with learning disabilities.  The sample consisted of 122 students from 12 self-contained classes for students with learning disabilities situated in regular schools in Israel.  Through cluster analysis using measures of loneliness and externalizing and internalizing behavioral maladjustment, four subgroups of students were identified:  two non-lonely groups-one behaviorally adjusted and the other with externalizing maladjustment; and two highly lonely groups-one with high externalizing maladjustment, the other with high internalizing maladjustment.  Internal validation through MANCOVA analysis revealed significant differences between subgroups on the three classification criteria.  As external validation of the classification, significant intergroup differences were also found on teacher- and student-rated social skills and peer acceptance ratings.  Case studies demonstrated subgroup patterns, individual differences, and the personal meaning attributed to loneliness and social relations.

AB This paper examines psychiatric symptoms and disorders in children in the care of a Children's Aid Society.  Youth caretaker and teacher scores on the Standardized Clinical Information System questionnaire were correlated with demographic and maltreatment data gathered from the files of children from a Children's Aid Society.  Mean externalizing and internalizing scores for the study group were significantly elevated above the norm on the youth, caretaker and teacher reports; externalizing more so than internalizing.  Forty-one percent to 63% of the children studied scored in the pathological range for one or more disorders.  Conduct disorder was the most common disorder (30% to 50%).  Within the study sample, temporary wards and children with a history of having been abused had more elevated scores.  The authors conclude that children in foster care have significant psychiatric morbidity reflective of the extreme adversity and maltreatment they have experienced.

AB This study examined the relationship of case characteristics, maternal support, and child psychopathology to acceptance of child sexual abuse cases for prosecution. Cases referred to prosecutors' offices over a 1-year period in four urban jurisdictions (N = 43 1) were examined, and a smaller sample of mothers and children (N = 289) were interviewed as well. Background characteristics of the perpetrator and victim, severity of abuse, and nature of available evidence were all significantly related to acceptance for prosecution. Specific independent predictors of acceptance were victim age, presence of oral-genital abuse, use or threat of force, duration of abuse, and presence of physical or eyewitness evidence. With other variables controlled, maternal support was higher and child internalizing psychopathology lower in accepted cases. The results are interpreted in terms of prosecutors' concern for serving justice and protecting children and their perceptions of their ability to prosecute cases successfully.

AB We examined 2-year recall of reports of lifetime symptomatology and substance use questions on the K-SADS-E in a sample of offspring at high and low risk for depression. Comparisons were made between those who forgot and those who remembered reports of screening symptoms made at the initial interview. In general, recall for symptoms of internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety disorder) was much worse than recall for symptoms of externalizing disorders (conduct disorder and substance use). Less than two-thirds of those initially meeting the lifetime depression screening criteria provided reports which met the lifetime screening criteria at followup. Significant correlates of screening criteria recall included the following variables (measured at the initial interview): history of treatment for any disorder, impairment on the GAS (a score less than 61), and the presence of hypersomnia and suicidal symptoms (thoughts or ideation). Logistic regression suggested that a prior report of suicidal symptoms (including thoughts, ideation, or behavior) was the most important correlate of screen recall.

AB Rates of poor psychological adjustment of children with sickle cell disease remained relatively constant over initial and follow-up assessment points. However, there was relatively little stability in the classification of the adjustment of individuals, low congruence in specific behavior problem patterns and diagnoses in accordance with the Diagnostic, and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1980), and less stability in child adjustment by child report than by mother report. With initial levels of adjustment controlled, children's strategies for coping with pain accounted for a significant increment in child-reported symptoms (19%) and mother-reported internalizing behavior problems (8%) at follow-up beyond the contribution of illness and demographic parameters and follow-up interval. The findings suggest that children's coping strategies are a salient intervention target for enhancing adjustment.

AB The association between early lead exposure and later problem behaviors was evaluated prospectively in a cohort of 8-year-old children born during a 12-month period at one hospital. Lead levels in umbilical cord blood (($) over bar X = 6.8 mu g/dl, SD = 3.1) and the dentin of a shed deciduous tooth (($) over tilde X = 3.4 mu g/g, SD = 2.4) provided measures of prenatal and postnatal exposure, respectively. Ratings on the Teacher Report Form of the Child Behavior Profile provided information about children's problem behaviors. Cord blood lead level was not associated with the overall prevalence or nature of problem behaviors. In both crude and adjusted analyses, tooth lead level was significantly associated with total problem behavior scores (approximately 2 points in T score per log unit increase in teeth lead). Significant tooth lead-associated increases in both internalizing and externalizing scores were also observed (approximately 1.5 points in T score per log unit increase). Weaker associations were noted between tooth lead level and the prevalence of ''extreme'' problem behavior scores. The extent to which these associations reflect residual confounding is uncertain. These data suggest, however, that social and emotional dysfunctions are correlates and may be expressions of increased lead exposure. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

Method: A sample of 40 children with ADHD was subdivided into three groups based on the severity of comorbid internalizing symptoms. Differential effects of three doses of MPH (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion using multiple outcome measures across home, school, and clinic settings. Results: Children with ADHD and comorbid internalizing symptoms were significantly less likely to respond positively to MPH than were their noninternalizing counterparts according to teacher ratings and behavioral observations during a clinic-based academic task. Conclusions: Children who exhibit comorbid symptoms of ADHD and internalizing disorder are less likely to respond to MPH in classroom settings and on academic tasks. A significant minority of children with comorbid conditions may be at a higher risk for an adverse medication response relative to patients with ADHD who are not exhibiting internalizing symptoms. Further research is necessary to delineate the characteristics of possible adverse responders.

AB The ability of the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR), the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to predict maladjustment across a 2-year time-span was assessed in a general population sample of 528 18- to 22-year-olds. Referral for mental health services and need for professional help were predicted by total problem scores of the YASR, the GHQ-28 and the SCL-90 and by the internalizing scale of the YASR. Furthermore, the internalizing scale predicted suicide attempts or suicidal ideation, whereas the externalizing scale predicted police contacts. The YASR delinquent behavior syndrome was the only significant predictor of alcohol abuse. The findings supported the validity of the YASR as an instrument for the assessment of psychopathology in young adults.

AB The purpose of the present study was to compare the depression profile of four subtYPes of peer-rejected children and a group of neglected children to a normative sample and evaluate whether or not these subgroups showed distinctive patterns. A total of 140 children were selected on the basis of peer status and peer assessment of social behavior. Depressed mood was evaluated by self-reports and peer assessments. As expected, withdrawn-rejected children expressed stronger feelings of depression, both generally (i.e., higher Child Depression Inventory [CDI] scores) and specifically (i.e., energy/interest), as well as more loneliness and social dissatisfaction than the normative group. They were also seen by their peers as being sadder. The aggressive-withdrawn-rejected children displayed results that were very similar to those of withdrawn-rejected children. They manifested stronger feelings of depression both generally (i.e., higher CDI scores) and specifically (i.e., mood/affect) and expressed more loneliness and social dissatisfaction than the normative group. They were also nominated more often as getting their feelings hurt easily and as being usually sad. Contrary to expectations, aggressive-rejected children were also found to differ from the normative children but only on a general index of depression, not on the more specific measures nor on loneliness and social dissatisfaction. Also, they did not differ from the normative sample on the peer assessment items. The neglected children did not differ from the normative sample on any of the self-report or peer assessment measures. The results concerning withdrawn-rejected and aggressive-withdrawn-rejected children suggest that peer rejection could play a mediating role with respect to feelings of distress and confirm that these children are at risk for internalizing problems. The pattern of results for aggressive-rejected children suggests that peer rejection may not play such a role.

AB Research has supported linkages between depression and social impairment in youngsters, but has often focused on depressive symptoms in isolation. We collected data on depressive, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms in 161 school children. Information about interpersonal competence was gathered from several sources, including children, teachers, and behavioral observations. Depressive symptoms were found to be related to difficulties in multiple areas of competence, including maladaptive social problem-solving styles, conflict-negotiation and affect-regulation deficits, and peer rejection. Comparisons of the relative contributions made by depressive and anxiety symptoms to the prediction of functioning yielded some evidence for a specific relation between depressive symptoms and impairment. Children with cooccurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms generally suffered from the most social dysfunction. If replicated in clinical samples, findings such as these may help to guide intervention efforts with depressed children.

AB A number of investigations have reported that depressive and aggressive behavior are correlated in children. However, this relation actually may represent an association between the more broadband constructs of internalizing and externalizing problems. Three hundred fifty third through sixth graders and their teachers completed measures assessing aggression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and depression. Results of a second-order confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the relation between aggression and depression in fact may represent a more broadband relation between externalizing and internalizing problems. These findings may have implications for understanding of the causal processes underlying the relation between aggression and depression in children, and more generally, for our conceptualization of the nature of the comorbidity of depression and aggression.

The models are applied to the maternal ratings of behavior of a subsample of 515 monozygotic and 749 dizygotic juvenile twin pairs, ages 8 through 16, obtained through mailed questionnaires as part of the Medical College of Virginia Adolescent Behavioral Development Twin Project. The importance of genetic, shared, and specific environmental factors for explaining variation is reported for both externalizing and internalizing behaviors, as well as significant differences in the causes of variation in externalizing behaviors among young boys and girls. The usefulness of applying structural equation models to data on monozygotic and dizygotic twins and the potential implications for addressing clinically relevant questions regarding the causes of psychopathology are discussed.

AB Genetic and environmental influences on problem behaviors were studies in a sample of international adoptees. Parental ratings of childrens' problem behaviors were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The sample (mean age, 12.4 years) comprised a group of biological siblings (111 pairs), a group of nonbiological siblings (221 pairs), and a group of singletons (94). Nonshared environmental influences were most important for problem behaviors studies in this paper. Genetic influences were substantial for Externalizing behaviors but unimportant for Internalizing behaviors. For the CBCL total problem score, Attention Problem, and Externalizing behaviors, the results of the present study were in agreement with findings from twin studies. The lack of genetic influences on Internalizing behaviors contrasts with results from twin studies. For the total problem score, the Externalizing grouping, Delinquent Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior, variances for singletons were significantly smaller than for siblings. Model fit indices indicated that these differences in variances are better attributed to smaller effects of factors associated with sibship size than to active influences of siblings on each other. Significant sex differences were found for 8 of the 10 scales. The larger variances for boys on the Externalizing grouping and Aggressive Behavior could be explained by genetic influences.

AB Recent studies have suggested an association between birth order and psychopathology. However, the association remains unclear due to a lack of consideration of the confounding effects of family size. At age seven years the family size and birth order of children from a large cohort of New Zealand children were examined in relation to parental help seeking for behavioural and emotional problems, and the development of DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980) disorder in pre-adolescence and adolescence. Neither the child's gender, birth order nor family size were associated with parental help seeking or the prevalence of DSM-III disorder in pre-adolescence at age 11. In adolescence at age 15, however, significantly more girls, first-borns and children from small families had DSM-III disorder, but the interactions between these factors were not significant. In particular, these associations were found with internalizing disorders. The appropriateness of further studies of birth order in relation to psychopathology is discussed.

AB Despite previous research indicating that early negative child behavior and the quality of the parent-child relationship are predictive of later externalizing problems, few investigators have attempted to trace these antecedents back to infancy. In a sample of 100 infants from low-income families, it was possible to identify developmental sequences leading from infant persistence and lack of maternal responsiveness to later child disruptive. aggressive child behavior at ages 2 and 3. Gender differences were found with respect to the range and type of variables that showed continuity in predicting disruptive behavior. For boys, salient predictors of age 2 and age 3 externalizing behavior were maternal unresponsiveness, infant attention-seeking, aggression, and noncompliance, whereas for girls. infant noncompliance was related to both age 3 externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB The risk of adjustment problems increases when a child has a serious life-threatening illness. This article estimates the frequency of adjustment problems across multiple domains for children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Parents provided information on the social, emotional, academic, and family adjustment of 327 children with SCA who were being treated at a comprehensive sickle cell clinic serving a predominantly poor and urban population. More than 25 percent of these children had emotional adjustment problems in the form of internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression. In addition, at least one child in five had problems related to social functioning and academic performance. These impairments were related significantly to the frequency of serious pain episodes but not to absolute family income. No significant differences in the data were found based on family income. The data also showed that the disruptive effects of the illness were related to gender and age.

AB Literature on neuroendocrine-behavior relations suggests that cortisol reactivity to social challenge may be associated with children's internalizing problem behavior. To explore this possibility, and the role of control-related beliefs, we studied 102 7-17-year-old clinic-referred children. Measures of problem behavior, depression and anxiety, and control-related beliefs were collected, and Ss' saliva was sampled before and after a parent-child conflict task. Neuroendocrine activation (i.e., cortisol increase) in response to the interaction task was associated with Ss' (a) social withdrawal, social anxiety, and social problems: (b) socially inhibited behavior during the task; and (c) low levels of perceived social contingency and high levels of external attributions for personal successes and failures. Our findings are among the first to link children's behavioral response to social challenge, neuroendocrine activation, cognitions, and psychopathology

AB In a prospective study of adolescent depression, adolescents (N = 1,508) were assessed at Time 1 and after 1 year (Time 2) on psychosocial variables hypothesized to be associated with depression. Most psychosocial variables were associated with current (n = 45) depression. Formerly depressed adolescents (n = 217) continued to differ from never depressed controls on many of the psychosocial variables. Many of the depression-related measures also acted as risk factors for future depression (n = 112), especially past depression, current other mental disorders, past suicide attempt, internalizing behavior problems, and physical symptoms. Young women were more likely to be, to become, and to have been depressed. Controlling for the psychosocial variables eliminated the gender difference for current and future but not for past depression.

AB The influence of maternal drug use and unconventional behavior on children's behavioral problems, cognitive functioning, and self-esteem is examined for children aged 8 and older born to adolescent mothers. Analyses are based on 581 unique mother-child dyads from the 1986 National Longitudinal Survey of the Work Experience of Youth (NLSY). Causal models indicate that maternal attitudes and experiences as an adolescent or young adult (having been raised in a nonintact home, self-esteem, and delinquency) and current family structure have different consequences for the home environments provided for girls and boys. These same maternal characteristics also directly influence children's externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, and feelings of self-worth. The effect of maternal drug use on children is indirect and operates through increasing the risk of marital disruption.

AB The present study used panel data on 207 divorced women and their children to examine the influence of mothers' parenting practices, involvement of nonresidential fathers, and parental conflict on the adjustment of adolescents living in mother-headed households. In addition, the study investigated the possibility that child adjustment problems may be a cause, as well as a consequence, of parental behavior. Quality of parenting by nonresidential fathers was related to externalizing problems for boys and girls, although the results differed somewhat depending on the source of data used to assess father's parenting. Quality of mother's parenting showed an association with externalizing problems of boys and girls, and was also related to internalizing problems for boys. Parental conflict was associated with internalizing problems for boys but not girls. Finally, adolescent externalizing problems appeared to reduce the quality of mother's parenting for both boys and girls, and to diminish father involvement in parenting in the case of boys.

AB We propose a model of family conflict and coercion that links economic stress in family life to adolescent symptoms of internalizing and externalizing emotions and behaviors. The 180 boys and 198 girls in the study were living in intact families in the rural Midwest, an area characterized by economic decline and uncertainty. Theoretical constructs in the model were measured using both trained observer and family member reports. These adolescents and their parents were interviewed each year for 3 years during the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. Our theoretical model proposes that economic pressure experienced by parents increases parental dysphoria and marital conflict as well as conflicts between parents and children over money. High levels of spousal irritability, coupled with coercive exchanges over money matters, were expected to be associated with greater hostility in general by parents toward their children. These hostile/coercive exchanges were expected to increase the likelihood of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems. Overall, results were consistent with the proposed model. Moreover, the hypothesized processes applied equally well to the behavior of mothers and fathers, as well as sons and daughters.

AB Group treatment programs are a common intervention for children who have been sexually abused. However, empirical literature demonstrating their effectiveness, particularly among preadolescent males, is scarce. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of semistructured group work with six preadolescent boys who had experienced either extra- or intrafamilial sexual abuse. From pre- to postgroup, the boys experienced decreased anxiety, decreased depression, increased self-esteem, and decreased internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Further gains were generally observed from postgroup to follow-up. The success of the group-treatment program is attributed, in part, to the implementation of a reward program designed to reduce disruptive behavior.

AB This study examined psychopathology, family functioning, and cognitive style in 121 African-American adolescents who attempted suicide. Group means suggested that these youths, when taken together, were not reporting significant psychological distress. However, after classifying the youths into three groups by level of depressive symptoms interesting findings emerged Youth self-reports of depressive symptoms on the Children's Depression Inventory were associated with the presence of internalizing and externalizing disorders on the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist, and with a maladaptive attributional style. Sixty-seven percent of participants classified their family types as maladaptive in terms of levels of cohesion and/or adaptability. In fact, the majority of adolescents and parents reported their families as disengaged These findings are discussed from a culturally and developmentally sensitive framework which considers key demographic variables (race, socioeconomic status, age). Clinical implications are offered for individual and family interventions.

AB Behavioral family systems therapy (BFST) was compared with ego-oriented individual therapy (EOIT) in a controlled, random-assignment investigation involving 22 young adolescents with anorexia nervosa.  Each adolescent and her parents received approximately 16 months of outpatient therapy along with a common medical and dietary regimen.  BFST emphasized parental control over eating and weight gain, coupled with cognitive restructuring and problem-solving communication training.  EOIT emphasized building ego strength, adolescent autonomy, and insight into the emotional blocks to eating.  BFST produced greater change on body-mass index than did EOIT, but both treatments produced comparable improvements on eating attitudes, body shape dissatisfaction, interoceptive awareness, depression/internalizing psychopathology, and eating-related family conflict.  The implications of these results for the clinician who treats adolescents with anorexia nervosa are discussed.

AB The current study examines the role of the father-adolescent relationship as a buffer for maternal depressive mood in a nonclinic young adolescent sample (n = 282). Internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as grade point average, were examined. Results indicated that, for all three variables, maternal depressive mood was associated with poorer functioning. Of most importance, for internalizing and externalizing problems, a good father-adolescent relationship served to buffer the adolescent from maternal depressed mood. This effect existed regardless of the gender of the adolescent or parental marital status. The findings suggest that behavior problems are associated with even mild levels of one family stressor, maternal depressive mood, and that these problems can be counteracted through an intrafamilial support system-the father. Implications for the behavior therapist are considered.

AB In this 6-month prospective study, interactions between intelligence and emotional distress were examined in predicting social competence among 138 inner-city adolescents. The attempt was to extend previous cross-sectional findings obtained with a similar sample of disadvantaged youth. Intelligence was assessed via a nonverbal test of cognitive abilities, and social competence was operationalized based on teacher and peer ratings and school grades. Distress variables examined in interaction with intelligence included internalizing and externalizing symptomatology as well as the more specific internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Interaction effects obtained indicated that intelligent youth who reported high depression and anxiety at Time 1 showed decreases in social competence over time, whereas those low on initial distress showed improvements in social competence levels. No such associations between initial distress and subsequent social competence were seen among the less intelligent children. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical issues and empirical evidence in developmental psychopathology, and implications for future research are noted.

Deviations from mental test performance were indexed by residuals computed from 24-month Bayley MDI and 48-month WPPSI correlations, and from 48-month WPPSI and 96-month WISC-R correlations.  Deviations from predicted values of mental test performance across 24 to 48 months were predicted by maternal personality, the interaction, and child problem-solving behavior.  Deviations from predicted values across the 48- to 96-month period were predicted by maternal social support and mother interactive behavior from the 24- to 48-month period, and in a separate regression, from children's internalizing behaviors in kindergarden.  The results are discussed with regard to the relations between specific aspects of the childrearing environment and child intelligence and the role of child characteristics.

DT Article
AB This article examines the relationship of dexamethasone nonsuppression to both categorical (i.e., diagnostic categories) and dimensional (i.e., quantitative, multivariate) measures of depression in children. Sixty inpatients, ages 5-13 years, were administered the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Categorical measures were the diagnoses of major depression or dysthymic disorder obtained from semi-structured interviews of child and parent. Dimensional measures of depression were the Short Child Depression Inventory (which is a child's self-report instrument) and the Child Behavior Checklist (which gave parent-rated quantitative scores for depression, aggression, hyperactivity, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors). Cortisol nonsuppression was associated with both dimensional and categorical measures of depression, but not with ratings of aggression or hyperactivity or with the diagnoses of dysthymic disorder or disruptive behavior disorder. Children with major depression had a higher rate of nonsuppression (69%) than children with either dysthymic disorder (29%) or disruptive behavior disorders (36%). Abnormal DST findings and postdexamethasone cortisol levels appeared significantly associated with higher scores on both dimensional measures of depression, but not with measures of internalizing or externalizing behavior, aggression, or hyperactivity. The total variance in dexamethasone suppression accounted for by dimensional ratings of depression was relatively modest (<20%). Although the potentially confounding roles of comorbid anxiety disorders and psychosocial stressors remain to be investigated, it appears that biological studies of mood disorders in children may be advanced by the use of both dimensional and categorical approaches to the assessment of depression.

AB The relation of individual differences in internalizing and externalizing behavior in middle childhood and early adolescence to children's concurrent sibling relationships and their mothers' mood, and to their sibling and mother-child relationships in the preschool period was studied. Thirty-nine younger and 39 older siblings observed at home in the preschool period were studied 5 and 7 years later. Differences in adjustment were related to contemporary sibling relationships and maternal mood, and to sibling and mother-child interaction in the preschool period, even when mothers' current mood was taken into account.

AB Objective: In an investigation of the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other Axis I psychiatric disorders, and social and behavioral difficulties, 27 physically abused adolescents were compared with 27 nonabused controls who were recruited through random-digit dialing procedures. Method: The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (PTSD module), Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and Youth Self-Report were administered to all subjects; mothers were interviewed regarding their adolescent's behavior using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children and Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The three physically abused adolescents who received a diagnosis of PTSD on the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis reported their PTSD symptoms were in reaction to extrafamilial sexual assaults and not to physical abuse. In contrast, the abused adolescents showed significantly higher prevalence rates of depression, conduct disorder, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and social deficits. Conclusions: Findings suggest that physically abused adolescents may be more at risk for behavioral and social difficulties than for PTSD.

AB The California Child Q-set (CCQ) was used to explore the structure of personality in early adoloscence and to develop scales to measure the ''Big Five'' dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. Mothers provided Q-sorts of 350 ethnically diverse boys between 12 and 13 years old. Analyses of the construct validity of the scales provided a nomological network relating the Big Five to theoretically and socially important criterion variables, such as juvenile delinquency, Externalizing and Internalizing disorders of childhood psychopathology, school performance, IQ, SES, and race. These effects were obtained using diverse methods, including self-reports from the boys, ratings by their mothers and their teachers, and objective-test data. In addition to the Big Five, analyses also suggested 2 possibly age-specific dimensions of personality in early adolescence. Discussion is focused on the changing manifestations of personality traits throughout development.

AB This investigation contrasted the cognitive content or cognitions of 162 inpatient adolescents (M = 14.6, SD = 1.6) in an effort to differentiate noncognitive anxiety and depressive symptoms. A principal-factors analysis with promax rotation of the Cognition Checklist (Beck, Brown, Steer, Eidelson, & Riskind, 1987) revealed that anxiety and depressive cognitions consisted of three factors, consistent with the tripartite theory of internalizing affect (Clark & Watson, 1991): specific anxiety cognitions, specific depressive cognitions, and general cognitions (overlapping depressive and anxious cognitions). Self-reported noncognitive depressive symptoms were significantly predicted by specific depressive cognitions and general cognitions; specific anxiety cognitions did not significantly predict depressive symptoms. Self-reported noncognitive anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by specific anxiety cognitions and general cognitions, but were not predicted by specific depressive cognitions. Results were interpreted in light of the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis (Beck, 1976) and the tripartite model of internalizing symptoms.

AB zResearch on child behavior problems requires standardized methodology in order to identify similarities and differences between societies. The present study compared parent-reported behavior problems of 360 Jamaican and 946 U.S. children aged 6 to 11. It revealed few differences in individual, total, internalizing (e.g., depression), and externalizing (e.g., fighting) problem scores as a function of nationality, gender, or age. Findings from this and other studies indicate the feasibility of a common methodology in cross-national studies of children's problems, but also the need for further refinement.

DE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT; SHORT CHILDREN; GROWTH HORMONE
AB Limited information is available on the educational and behavioral functioning of short children. Through 27 participating medical centers, we administered a battery of psychologic tests to 166 children referred for growth hormone (GH) treatment (5 to 16 years) who were below the third percentile for height (mean height = -2.7 SD). The sample consisted of 86 children with isolated growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and 80 children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). Despite average intelligence, absence of significant family dysfunction, and advantaged social background, a large number of children had academic under-achievement. Both groups showed significant discrepancy (p <.01) between IQ and achievement scores in reading (6%), spelling (10%), and arithmetic (13%) and a higher-than-expected rate of behavior problems (GHD, 12%, p <.0001; ISS, 10%, p <.0001). Behavior problems included elevated rates of internalizing behavior (e.g., anxiety, somatic complaints) and externalizing behavior (e.g., impulsive, distractible, attention-seeking). Social competence was reduced in school-related activities for GHD patients (6%, p <.03).
   The high frequency of underachievement, behavior problems, and reduced social competency in these children suggests that short stature itself may predispose them to some of their difficulties. Alternately, parents of short, underachieving children may be more likely to seek help. In addition, some problems may be caused by factors related to specific diagnoses.

AB The negative impact on psychologic adjustment from the stress of living with newly diagnosed cancer is hypothesized to be affected by perceived social support. Thirty children with newly diagnosed cancer completed standardized assessment instruments measuring depressive symptoms, state anxiety, trait anxiety, social anxiety, general self-esteem, and perceived social support from classmates, parents, teachers, and friends. Their parents completed a standardized assessment instrument measuring internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Perceived classmate, parent, and teacher social support were variously correlated with the psychologic adjustment parameters in the hypothesized direction of greater support predicting lower psychologic distress and higher self-esteem. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified perceived classmate social support as the most consistent predictor of adaptation, providing further evidence of the essential function of the social environment of the school setting in affecting the adjustment of children with newly diagnosed cancer.

AB Eighty-nine mothers with children between the ages of 8 and 11 years reported perceptions of their child's adjustment and temperament, and described concurrent family circumstances such as socioeconomic status, level of parental distress, major life events experienced, maternal hassles, and their own psychiatric symptoms. A conceptual model hypothesizing the direct and indirect effects of family circumstances, maternal characteristics, and child temperament on the maladjustment of school-age children was tested using causal modeling with residual analysis. Fifty-six percent of child externalizing behavior was directly explained by the negative reactivity and nonpersistence of the child's temperament, and maternal hassles. A total of 33% of the variance of internalizing behavior was explained by the direct effects of negative reactivity of the child's temperament and maternal hassles. For both externalizing and internalizing behavior, a total of 54% of the variance in maternal hassles was explained by three variables: maternal psychiatric symptoms contributed 34%, major life events added 15%, and the intensity of the mother's temperament added an additional 5%. These three variables have a direct effect on maternal hassles and together had an indirect effect of .24 on child externalizing behavior through maternal hassles. Likewise, they have a direct effect on maternal hassles and together had an indirect effect of .31 on child internalizing behavior through maternal hassles.  (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Using the two broad-band groupings of Internalizing and Externalizing described by Achenbach et al. (1987), various models to estimate genetic and environmental parameters were fitted using LISREL 7. Model-fitting results showed that the genetic components to the observed phenotypical variation were small and not necessary in the model. Influences from the shared environment, however, could not be dropped from the model without a deterioration in fit. Parameter estimates were not significantly different in boys and girls.

AB Developmental differences in behavior and self-perception were examined in a group of 44 preschool and school-age children referred for evaluation of sexual abuse and 41 comparison children with no history of sexual abuse, matched on age and gender, and from a similar socioeconomic background. Children suspected of having been sexually abused were rated by their parents as having more internalizing and externalizing problems than comparison children. When children rated their self-competence and social acceptance, there were no group differences between children based on their abuse status; however, there was significant within-group variation among the children suspected of having been sexually abused. Preschool children had elevated scores of perceived competence and social acceptance, and school-age children had depressed scores. There were no age differences among the children in the comparison group. The results suggest that among children suspected of abuse, not only does their self-perception vary by their developmental level, but preschool children may respond with elevated perceptions of themselves. Focusing on individual differences in children's response to suspicions of sexual abuse enables us to identify risk and protective factors that contribute to the psychological outcomes of child sexual abuse.

AB The present study was designed to determine the utility of pretreatment data in predicting completion and dropout from adolescent substance abuse treatment. One hundred thirty-two consecutively admitted adolescents (mean age = 16.4 years; 93 male subjects, 39 female subjects) with significant substance abuse were-administered a battery of standardized substance abuse, psychopathology, and social questionnaires immediately after admission to an intensive, set-length substance abuse treatment program. Seventy-four adolescents completed the program. Using discriminant function analyses, five pretreatment measures were found to predict treatment completion in male subjects, including: greater severity of problems with alcohol; greater use of drugs other than alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco; higher degree of internalizing problems; and lower self-esteem. Significant predictors for completion by female subjects were not found. The role of treatment readiness and motivation for male subjects is examined, and the lack of significant findings for female subjects is discussed.

AB This study examined the connection between adolescents' expressions of negative affect and their attempts to meet the developmental task of establishing autonomy and relatedness in interactions with their parents.  Longitudinal, observational data were obtained by coding family interaction tasks administered to 96 adolescents at ages 14 and 16 and their one or two parents.  These were then related to observer-rated adolescent depressive affect in an interview at age 16 and to self-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 17.  Results revealed that difficulties establishing autonomy and relatedness with parents were linked to both depressed affect and externalizing behaviors.  However, depressed affect was more closely linked to difficulties establishing autonomy, whereas externalizing behaviors were more closely linked to difficulties maintaining relatedness.

AB The study focused on the intersection between internalizing and disruptive behavior problems.  Subjects were 890 inner-city boys who were enrolled in the fourth and seventh grades of public schools.  The boys were followed up with six assessments over the course of 3 years.  Based on earlier research, three developmental pathways toward serious disruptive behavior were considered:  an overt pathway, a covert pathway, and an authority conflict pathway.  The pathways had been formulated on the basis of the sequence of onset of different manifestations of disruptive child behavior as reported by the child and/or his parent.  Three forms of internalizing behaviors were the focus of the study:  stable depressed mood, stable anxiety, and stable withdrawal.  Boys with stable internalizing problems were defined as those who scored high on such a problem during 2 of the 3 years of the study.  Results demonstrated that internalizing problems were more associated with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder than with a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder.  In early adolescence, stable depressed mood occurred more often when boys advanced in either the overt or the covert pathways or when they were involved in multiple, rather than single, pathways.  In late adolescence, stable anxiety and stable withdrawal were more common in multiple than in the single pathways.  The importance of the interaction between internalizing and disruptive child behaviors is stressed.

AB Relationships were explored between measures of temperament and the social behavior patterns of empathy, guilt/shame, aggression, help-seeking, and negativity for a group of 6- to 7-year-old children. For a subset of the sample, predictions of these social behavior patterns from infant laboratory observations were also reported. Individual differences in surgency were found to be predictive of aggression, and relationships between effortful control and both empathy and guilt/shame. Negative affectivity appeared to be ubiquitous in its relationships with social traits. Additional analyses indicated, however, that whereas internalizing components of negative affectivity, such as fear and sadness, are related to prosocial traits, irritable components of negative affectivity, such as anger and discomfort, are related to anti-social traits. Predictions from laboratory observations of infant temperament to later social behavior patterns generally corroborated the results obtained from concurrent parent questionnaire ratings.

AB The school psychologist is uniquely positioned to provide services to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  School psychologists can readily utilize naturalistic methods of assessment; they have the potential to be highly effective in consulting with teachers by establishing effective, ongoing, working alliances with educators.  Although clinic-based professionals often have expertise in assessing and treating children with complex patterns of internalizing and externalizing behavior, they generally have difficulty acquiring naturalistic assessment data and collaborating with teachers on an ongoing basis.  The role of the school psychologist in managing services for children with ADHD is examined in relation to legal mandates and recent trends in ADHD research and the practice of school psychology.  The limitations of a school-based model are considered; the need for close collaboration between school- and clinic-based professionals is emphasized.

AB Children's social and emotional adjustment at age 8 were examined in relation to attachment security, parenting style, setting conditions, and social and emotional adjustment at age 4.  Seventy-nine children participated in videotaped interaction sessions with their mothers and with unfamiliar peers at the two ages.  Data were derived from videotape coding, mother questionnaires, and child sociometric ratings.  Results indicted that internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social engagement were related at the two ages.  After removing the variance due to the relationship between child behaviors at the two ages, a comparison of mother-child relationship predictors indicated that attachment security at age 4 was the strongest predictor of internalizing problems and social engagement/acceptance at age 8, while maternal style was the strongest predictor of externalizing difficulties.  Results point to the importance of both aspects of the mother-child relationship, and indicate that the nature of family and peer links may vary depending upon the specific social domain assessed.

AB This paper treats the externalizing and internalizing reactions of adolescents as two poles in the regulation of stress in precarious life situations. In recent years, the public discussion has focused increasingly on aggression as an externalizing form of reaction among adolescents. In contrast, internalizing forms of problem processing, which manifest in impairments of mental and physical well-being, have received less attention. A representative survey of adolescents compared these two forms of processing problems. The survey also ascertained the conditions on which the kind of problem processing depended. Particular attention was paid to the discrepancies between adolescents' increased expectations of being able to engage in autonomous and creative activities and the greater difficulties in fulfilling these expectations in the process of the status transition from school to work in everyday life.

AB For decades, the interplay between pubertal changes and psychosocial development was rarely a focus of research in German speaking countries. By contrast, in North America and Scandinavia, a large body of research evolved, especially addressing the role of biological processes in adolescents' development. Aspects of particular interest were individual differences in the timing and pace of pubertal changes. Recently, a shift in emphasis has taken place, focusing no longer on pubertal timing as an antecedent of changes in adolescents' behavior, but rather on the precursors of differences in pubertal timing itself. The latter are seen in stressful interactions between parents and offspring emerging over considerable periods of time during childhood. This review begins with a discussion of the methods used in the assessment of pubertal processes. We then present major conceptual issues and results of empirical investigations concerning the consequences of individual differences in pubertal timing on various aspects of the self-concept, on social relationships, and on internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Finally, results are discussed on the role of family strains and other risk factors in early maturation. In addition to a large number of studies from the international arena, some recent German investigations are highlighted.

AB A discussion of gender and conduct disorder must first answer the basic questions of whether or not there are any differences in prevalence, symptoms, and correlates of conduct disorder by sex. Several epidemiologic studies have found no difference in the prevalence of conduct disorder in adolescence by sex. Correlates of conduct disorder in girls are similar to those in boys (including aggression and internalizing disorders), once base rates of the correlates are accounted for. A major problem in studying conduct disorder in girls is the lack of appropriate criteria; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd ed., rev.) criteria are not appropriate for girls. A case is made for sex-specific criteria for conduct disorder that take into account known differences in male and female childhood cultures and base-rate differences in aggression and criminality. Until basic issues of diagnosis and prevalence are resolved, other issues such as risk factors and developmental pathways cannot be successfully addressed.

AB Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of depression, anxiety, and aggression. Teacher-child correspondence was significant for all three traits in the elementary school sample, yet only significant for aggression in the inpatient sample. However, the level or severity of depression and anxiety symptoms that the teachers reported for the inpatient sample was similar to that reported by the children themselves. In contrast, elementary school children reported significantly more internalizing symptoms than their teachers. Inpatient children reported more depression, but not significantly more anxiety and aggression than elementary school children. For all traits, teachers reported significantly more symptoms for inpatient children, after controlling for child self-report and socioeconomic status. The utility of teachers' ratings across samples, method variance and rater biases, and issues pertaining to self-report are discussed.

AB This article presents evaluative data on the use of the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R) to classify DSM-III-R disorders in the general population. Data for the analyses came from a probability sample (N = 251) of parent-child/adolescent dyads aged 6 to 16 separately administered the DICA-R on two occasions, 10- to 20 days apart, by trained lay interviewers and child psychiatrists. Data are presented on prevalence, test-retest reliability, parent-child/adolescent agreement, and trained lay interviewer-child psychiatrist agreement. High prevalences of oppositional defiant disorder derived from parent assessments and overanxious disorder and dysthymia derived from adolescent assessments suggest that these disorders may be overidentified. Interview data provided by 6- to 11-year olds to classify the internalizing disorders were too unreliable to be useful. Agreement between parent-child/adolescent dyads was generally low while agreement between trained lay interviewers-child psychiatrists was generally high.

AB Mother-blaming has been well documented in research related to the etiology and maintenance of child psychopathology and family dysfunction. However, there has been almost no research that investigates the differential attributions of maternal and paternal blame for different types of problems or attributions of responsibility for prosocial child behaviors. In the current study, young adult participants (primarily Caucasians from the middle class) were asked to rate their perceptions of mothers' and fathers' responsibility for children's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behavior. Mothers were rated as more responsible for their children's iternalizing behavior problems, and fathers were rated as more responsible for their children's externalizing behavior problems. Perceptions of mothers' and fathers' responsibility for their children's prosocial behaviors did not differ. Ramifications of mother-blaming and father-blaming are discussed.

AB Results are reported of a longitudinal study on how marital interaction affects children. Observational assessments of marital interaction during conflict resolution obtained when children were 5 years old predicted teachers' ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviors when the children were 8 years old. Two distinct and uncorrelated marital interaction patterns were related to specific forms of child outcomes. The Mutually Hostile pattern, which correlated with later marital dissolution, also predicted externalizing behavior patterns in children 3 years later. The Husband Angry and Withdrawn pattern predicted child internalizing behaviors. Marital satisfaction and child temperament did not relate to child outcomes, nor did they interact with marital patterns to produce deficits in child adjustment. The findings suggest that the specific behaviors couples use when resolving marital disputes may contribute differentially to the presence of externalizing and internalizing behavior patterns in children.

TI SHARED CARE FOR CHILDREN
SO THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Developmental psychologists have no adequate way of understanding shared care because their theories are rooted in a pedagogic concept of family upbringing with mother at home. This article shows how deeply developmental theories, concepts and research questions are anchored in the moral and social-political choices and problems of the middle class. Special attention is given to attachment theory as a pedagogic model for regulating emotions and behavior and for internalizing moral concepts. An analysis of research 'waves' into day care shows the impossibility of a universal answer to questions about quality. To produce knowledge which is based on the realities of the parents and children who make use of day care, psychologists have to relinquish their claim to superiority, and they have to work out new context-bound theories. The last part of the article notes new moves in day care research towards context-bound theories of the socio-emotional development of children.

AB We examined maternal and paternal characteristics at 1 month postpartum as risk and protective factors for children's internalizing and externalizing problems at 2-3 years of age. In a sample of 70 couples and their children, fathers' depressive symptoms at 1 month postpartum predicted children's internalizing and externalizing problems at 2-3 years of age, and the interaction of fathers' and mothers' depressive symptoms predicted subsequent internalizing problems. Mothers' postpartum symptoms did not predict either type of children's behavior problems at age 2-3. When entered in the regression equations, mothers' depressive symptoms when the children were age 2-3 years accounted for all of the effects of paternal and maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. No evidence was found for the protective effects of marital satisfaction or social support, or for low levels of depressive symptoms in a spouse. We highlight directions for future risk and resilience research related to parental postpartum depression.

The mean ratings differed significantly for the three sources and for the two samples, and there were a few significant interactions. Correlations of the scores between sources, especially parents and teachers, were in the moderate range and were not significantly different from one another. Informant correspondence was higher for externalizing than internalizing problems in both patient and nonpatient samples, and was higher for nonpatients than patients. In general, informant agreement was higher for cases characterized by lower family stress and higher child acceptance, among other clinical variables.

Significant mean score differences were found for both internalizing (affective disorder) and externalizing (disruptive behavior disorder) adolescents. Consistent with theory, internalizing adolescents reported significantly greater distress at both admission and discharge than externalizing adolescents. Finally, test-retest reliability coefficients were somewhat lower than those reported previously (Millon et al., 1982) for hospitalized adolescents.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether different behavioral subgroups of children with learning disabilities (LD) form different beliefs regarding the causes of their achievement-related successes and failures. The sample (n = 75) was composed of five carefully matched groups of 15 children: (a) nondisabled, non-behavior-disordered, nonreferred; (b) non-disabled; non-behavior-disordered clinic-referred; (c) LD, non-behavior-disordered; (d) LD exhibiting externalizing behaviors; and (e) LD exhibiting both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results suggest that the achievement attributions of children with LD are heterogeneous and are related to presence and type of behavior disorder. It appears that not all children with LD develop maladaptive beliefs. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for education and attribution retraining.

AB Forty-three adolescents qualifying for a DSM-III-R diagnosis of alcohol abuse/dependence were classified according to the internalizing-externalizing behavior dimension. Two clusters were identified. The majority of subjects clustered into a group characterized by behavioral dyscontrol and hypophoria (history of suicide attempts) (cluster 2), whereas the other group was primarily featured by negative affect (cluster 1). Cluster 2 subjects demonstrated more severe alcohol and drug use-related problems, behavioral disturbances, and general psychopathology; lower prevalence of depressive disorders; and less severe anxiety disorders. These results, implicating two variants of adolescent alcohol abuse/dependence, suggest the need to tailor differential treatments to adolescents with alcohol abuse/dependence based on personality characteristics and clinical presentation.

Comparisons by family type revealed significant differences in maternal depression, social support, life events and children's anxiety, depression and problem behaviors. Factor analysis and hierarchical multiple regression revealed that a maternal distress factor accounted for significant amounts of variance in child outcome variables in addition to that accounted for by fathers' alcohol dependence symptoms. Future studies of school-age children of alcohol-dependent men should routinely sample indices of maternal distress to improve assessments of children's developmental contexts.

Acceptable levels of internal consistency and low-to-moderate levels of parent-adolescent interrater agreement were indicated for the four factors of attentional deficit/hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, conduct disorder symptoms and avoidance behaviors. The externalizing childhood problems (i.e., attentional deficit/hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, conduct disorder) were associated significantly with both internalizing (depression) and externalizing (e.g., alcohol consumption, delinquent activity) adolescent problem behaviors, as well as with an earlier age of onset for substance use. Avoidant behaviors in childhood were associated specifically with depressive symptomatology in adolescence. Results are discussed with regard to the role of childhood problems as precursors to adolescent/adult disorders.

AB Poor children experience greater psychological distress than do nonpoor children. However, evidence for the relationship between poverty and children's distress is limited by the use of measures of poverty at a single point in time, by a failure to examine race or ethnic differences, and by a lack of concern with explanations for poverty's effects. Using data from the 1986 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data set, we explored the relationships among current poverty, length of time spent in poverty, maternal parenting behaviors, and children's mental health. Persistent poverty significantly predicts children's internalizing symptoms above and beyond the effect of current poverty, whereas only current poverty predicts externalizing symptoms. Mother's weak emotional responsiveness and frequent use of physical punishment explain the effect of current poverty on mental health, but not the effect of persistent poverty. The relationships among poverty, parenting behaviors, and children's mental health do not vary by race/ethnicity. These findings support theoretical developments calling for greater emphasis on family processes in studies of children's poverty. They also argue for greater attention to trajectories of socioeconomic status in analyses of the effects of status on mental health.

ID LIVE SUPERVISION; FAMILY-THERAPY; SYSTEMS; CRISIS
AB Training in systems therapy is itself a systems process that is influenced by the organizational context in which it occurs. Systems trainers need to apply their skills to the interface between them and the agency, otherwise they face the danger that their impact will be eroded by organizational difficulties in ''internalizing'' their approach. Furthermore, there is much to be gained by working in this domain, especially if the training stimulates and becomes intertwined with organizational development. This coevolutionary process then facilitates integration of the systems model by both the trainees and the agency. Three variables, important for working at this interface, are analyzed: the approach of the supervisor, the composition and dynamics of the training group, and the treatment philosophy and work patterns of the institution. The implementation of this approach is demonstrated through a 4-year project of training and program development with Israel's Youth Protection Authority.

AB Compared the self perceptions and attributions of attention deficit hyperactivity disordered (ADHD) and control boys. The ADHD boys viewed themselves as no worse than control boys on self-perceived competence and global self-worth, especially when internalizing symptomatology was taken into account statistically through covariance analyses. In terms of attributions, the ADHD boys were more likely to take responsibility for social successes and less likely to take responsibility for social failures than the control boys. Although the ADHD boys scored significantly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this difference was no longer significant when items dealing with behavior, school, and social problems were excluded The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding how the attributions and self-perceptions of ADHD boys may mediate their performance in challenging academic and social situations.

AB The present study reports on standardized behavioral ratings received by a large sample of hyperactive children meeting research diagnostic criteria (n = 108) and a community control sample of normal children (n = 61) who were followed prospectively over 8 years into adolescence. On some parent-report measures both groups declined in the severity of their behavior problems across time, while on other measures only the hyperactive group declined, but the hyperactives always remained more deviant than the controls at followup. The hyperactives and controls also differed on most teacher and self-report ratings at followup. The greatest degree of agreement between raters at adolescence was between parent and youth ratings. These results are consistent with previous research demonstrating more deviant scores for hyperactive children than controls on various rating scales at adolescent followup. They also are consistent with research showing significant longitudinal continuity of both internalizing and externalizing behavioral pathology.

AB The psychosocial functioning of children of unipolar depressed, bipolar, medically ill, and psychiatrically normal women was studied over a 2-year period. Ninety-six children aged 8-16 years were assessed at 6-month intervals on Child Behavior Checklist behavior problems, social competence, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, academic performance, and school behavior. The children of unipolar mothers showed significantly poorer functioning on all measures as compared with the other 3 groups of children, including bipolar offspring. A greater proportion of children in the unipolar group also had relatively chronic, clinically significant problems in psychosocial functioning. Children of bipolar women did not differ from children of psychiatrically normal women. Results are discussed in terms of the consequences of children's continuing exposure to maternal depression and attendant stressors, as well as the contribution of social and academic difficulties to a vicious cycle of maladjustment.

Internalizing types of behavior problems and diagnoses were the most frequent. Support was provided for a transactional stress and coping model in delineating the processes associated with child adjustment. In particular, maternal anxiety accounted for 16%-33% of the variance in mother-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, respectively, and child pain-coping strategies accounted for 21% of the variance in child-reported adjustment problems.

AB Two studies examined the relationship of depressive symptoms to perceptions of child behavior. Study 1 reports the perceptions of 95 female undergraduates and Study 2 reports the perceptions of 31 mothers of children with externalizing disorders. Videotapes of child actors portraying prosocial, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors were used to standardize the child behaviors being rated. In both studies, adult females rated the behavior of the boys in the videotapes and completed measures of depressive symptoms. In Study 1, female students with higher scores on a composite measure of depressive symptoms had less positive perceptions of the prosocial child behaviors, gave more negative global ratings for the externalizing behaviors, and showed a trend toward more negative global ratings of the internalizing behaviors. For the mothers in Study 2, depressive symptoms were positively correlated with perceptions of internalizing behaviors and of the deviance of the prosocial portrayal. The relationships between mothers' depressive symptoms and ratings of externalizing behaviors and the deviance of the internalizing portrayal approached significance. Finally, mothers' depressive symptoms correlated with more negative perceptions of internalizing behaviors in their own children. Teachers' ratings of these same children were correlated with mothers' ratings, but were uncorrelated with mothers' depressive symptoms. The results suggest that depressive symptoms may negatively influence adult perceptions of child behavior.

AB Clinical evidence suggests that various problem behaviors in adolescence can be expressions of dysphoria that have not reached threshold for the diagnosis of depressive disorders. Formulations of two major types of dysphoria distinguish between disruptions of interpersonal relatedness (e.g, feelings of loss or abandonment) and diminished self-esteem (e.g., feelings of self-criticism, failure, or guilt). Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Depression for Children (CES-DC). Even after level of depressive symptoms (CES-DC) was partialled out in hi-erarchical multiple regressions, interpersonal dysphoria significantly accounted for additional variance in predicting internalizing disorders, while self-critical dysphoria added significantly to the explained variance of both internalizing and externalizing disorders, specifically delinquency and aggression in both males and females.

AB Parent and clinician reports of behaviour problems among very low-birthweight (VLBW) children at 3 1/2 years of age were studied in relation to indicators of neonatal cerebral damage, cognition and social factors. VLBW children had more depressed behaviour and more internalizing problems by parent report, and also scored significantly more often within the clinical range on total problem scores, than children in the comparison group. Neither neonatal cerebral ultrasound nor neurological examinations were directly associated with behavioural outcome. Cerebral damage was related to cognitive development. Cognition directly influenced behaviour problems according to clinician report, while the home environment did so according to parent report. The authors suggest that depressed behaviour of preschool VLBW children might be associated with parental reactions to the birth of a VLBW child, and that their attention problems might be linked indirectly to brain damage via cognitive impairments.

AB Objective: This study presents two distinct profiles of female suicide attempters based on social-cognitive development and investigates the relationship of both developmental and suicide risk variables in these profiles. Method: The sample included 139 girls, aged 13-16, admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Patients were divided into four groups based on their suicidal status (attempter/nonsuicidal) and ego development (preconformist/conformist level). Results: Results support two developmental types of female suicide attempters that differed significantly on symptomatology, diagnoses, and defensive style. Preconformist attempters, the ''angry-defiant'' suicidal type, present with both depression and aggression as well as externalizing defense mechanisms. Conformist attempters, the ''self-blaming'' suicidal type, present with depression, and use more internalizing defenses to cope with conflict. Comparing suicide attempters and nonsuicidal girls, depression was found to be a risk factor for suicide at all developmental levels. Defense mechanisms were only associated with suicide at the preconformist developmental level. Conclusions: Social-cognitive development has an important impact on the expression of suicidal behavior in adolescent girls.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the psychiatric functioning of 61 sickle cell youth and their families with nondiseased sibling controls. Method: Functioning assessed by multiple informants included indices of behavioral, cognitive, and family/interpersonal functioning, self-esteem, life events, coping strategies, temperament, adaptive behavior, and parental psychopathology. Results: Key findings were that sickle cell patients evidenced more depressive symptoms and associated attributional style, and externalizing behavioral difficulties than did nondiseased siblings. With age, sickle cell youth evidence increasing adaptive behavior deficits and internalizing symptoms. Illness severity was related to symptoms of internalizing behavior and fewer daily living skills. Associations were found between maternal and child coping. Conclusions: It is recommended that psychiatric consultations rountinely be conducted with these children, particularly at times of family stress and developmental transitions. Psychiatric interventions should focus on ameliorating emotional difficulties via enhancing adaptive coping strategies.

AB Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parental psychopathology and psychosocial functioning of children in whom acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) has been diagnosed. Method: The sample consisted of 61 mother-child dyads. Twenty-one (34%) mothers met DSM-III-R criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder based on a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID). Results: Findings revealed that compared with children whose mothers did not meet DSM-III-R criteria for a psychiatric disorder, children with mothers who evidenced a psychiatric disorder self-reported more anxiety and a maladaptive attributional style and were reported by their mothers as evidencing more depression and a range of internalizing behavioral symptoms. Conclusions: Although our earlier research suggested that ALL children show relatively few symptoms of psychopathology, the present report reveals high rates of psychiatric difficulties in the mothers of ALL youth. These findings and their implications are discussed within a model that incorporates behavioral pediatrics and developmental psychopathology.

Results indicated that social goal values were related to diverse aspects of self-, teacher-, and peer-reported social and behavioral functioning, with a consistent association found between a range of delinquent, substance-using, and behavioral difficulties, and endorsement of high goal values for dominance and revenge and low goal values for affiliation. Results also indicated that teacher-identified aggressive boys differed from nonaggressive boys in the value they placed on social goals, with aggressive boys placing a higher value on goals of dominance and revenge, and lower value on goals for affiliation. Finally social goal choice had a clear relation to the social problem-solving differences of aggressive and nonaggressive boys.

AB A model delineating the relationship between homemakers' role experiences and toddler behavior was developed, and tested using path analysis. We proposed that the relationship between homemakers' role experiences (skill use, perceived financial equity, homemaking satisfaction, and role overload) and toddler's internalizing and externalizing behaviors is mediated by maternal psychological well-being (positive mood, negative mood, and cognitive difficulties) and parenting behavior (positive, punishing, and rejecting). Using confirmatory path analysis, the proposed model fit the data [Q = .73, W(34) = 47.4; p > .05] obtained from a sample of 187 homemakers. The results suggest that, as for employed mothers, it is important to understand how homemakers experience their role, because those experiences indirectly predict children's behavior.

AB Paediatricians are often asked to assess children with emotional and behavioural problems and are faced with the dilemma that reports about the children's behaviour obtained from the children, and from their parents and teachers, may differ. This study compares the number of childhood emotional and behavioural problems reported by children living in the community, with the number of problems reported by their parents and teachers. When describing both internalizing and externalizing problems, the children consistently reported that they had more problems than were reported by either their parents or teachers. This pattern was particularly evident with reports from older female children who reported many more internalizing problems than were reported by their parents and teachers. Possible reasons for the differences between reports from children and the other informants are discussed.

AB Evaluated the effectiveness of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for 24 mother-child dyads. Families received 14 weekly sessions of PCIT, with half receiving Child-Directed Interaction training first (CDI-First group) and half receiving Parent-Directed Interaction training first (PDI-First group). At midtreatment, the PDI training stage was more effective than the CDI stage for reducing noncompliance and disruptiveness. The groups were also compared at posttreatment to examine the impact of stage sequence. The PDI-First group was more improved on parent report of conduct problems, and mothers were more satisfied with therapy. The two groups were combined to examine overall treatment outcome. Families moved from outside normal limits to within normal limits on compliance, conduct problems, activity level, and maternal stress, and showed improvement in internalizing problems and child self-esteem. Gains were maintained at 6-week follow-up.

AB Investigated agreement between mothers, fathers, teachers, and children on equivalent forms of a standardized measure of behavioral and emotional problems. Ninety-eight children, age 13 years, completed the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991d). Their mothers and fathers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991b), and their teachers completed the Teacher Report Form (Achenbach, 1991c). Children generally reported the most problems and teachers the least. Agreement was highest between mothers and fathers on internalizing and externalizing problems, and lowest for rater pairs involving teachers on internalizing problems. Analyses of a multitrait-multimethod matrix for ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems indicated good convergent validity, large rater effects, and weaker discriminant validity. Conditional probabilities for agreement on deviant and nondeviant scores indicated that ratings by no informant could substitute for those of any other rater. Teacher ratings of externalizing problems were the best predictor of referral for mental health services.

AB This study investigated hospitalized adolescents (57 girls; 46 boys; mean age = 14 years, 8 months) and their fathers and mothers to ascertain the degree of correspondence (by gender of parent and child) on ratings of total symptoms and of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Parents (especially mothers) reported higher levels of symptom severity than their offspring; girls' ratings were more severe than boys'. Whereas interparent correspondence was essentially the same in ratings of daughters, mother-son convergence was generally higher than father-son correspondence. Boys and their parents did not differentiate internalizing from externalizing disorders; girls and parents were better able to discriminate between these types of psychopathology.

AB Objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the 6-year longitudinal course of psychiatric disorders in children from the general population commencing at age 4 to 11 years. Method: three groups of children were selected on the basis of Child Behavior Checklist ratings obtained at 2-year intervals: ''persisters,'' ''decreasers,'' and ''increasers.'' Selected subjects and their parents were clinically interviewed, and DSM-III-R diagnoses were derived. Results: the majority of children whose overall level of psychopathology persisted over time obtained lifetime DSM-III-R diagnoses classified as externalizing: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional disorder, or conduct disorder. The majority of children whose overall level of psychopathology decreased obtained lifetime DSM-III-R diagnoses classified as internalizing: anxiety disorders, major depression, or dysthymic disorder. Children with initial Child Behavior Checklist scores in the normal range whose problem scores increased received lifetime diagnoses that were neither predominantly externalizing or internalizing. Conclusions: this study showed that the majority of initially disordered children with the poorest outcome showed aggressive or antisocial behaviors, whereas disordered children whose functioning improved had problems reflecting fearful, inhibited, or depressive behavior. The findings also showed that retrospective information on the course of children's problem behaviors should be regarded with caution.

AB Objective: To clarify the relationship between scales and structured diagnostic interview diagnoses, the authors used a two-stage screening method to study 201 military families with one or more children ages 5 to 17. Method: Parents and children were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC 2. 1); parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) while the children completed other self-report symptom scales. Results: Results indicate only a modest ability of scales to discriminate among discrete DISC-derived DSM-III-diagnoses. Inclusion of diagnostic information from both parents and children resulted in more diagnoses than from either informant alone, and the additional diagnoses consisted mostly of internalizing disorders contributed by child-derived DISC information. In general, correlations were larger between scales and diagnoses within the same informant (regardless of diagnostic construct) than across informants (but within the same diagnostic construct). Child self-report measures tended to outperform the CBCL as screeners against the overall ''caseness'' criterion on the DISC. However, child self-report scales were relatively nonspecific and showed little ability to selectively identify internalizing disorders such as anxiety and/or depression. Compared with single informant diagnoses, combined-informant diagnoses were generally superior in demonstrating broader relationships to both parent and child symptom scales. Conclusions: Additional research is needed in order to build careful crosswalks between the various approaches to assessing childhood psychopathology, to decide on optimal rules for combining information to establish diagnoses, and to validate the currently available assessment alternatives.

AB We investigated risk factors in a population-based sample of alcoholic (father) and comparison families with 3-year-old sons. Alcoholic and comparison parents did not differ in socioeconomic status (SES), education, years married, family size, or cognitive functioning. Antisocial behavior and depression were significantly greater in alcoholic parents. High risk children were more impulsive than comparison children, but there were no differences in developmental age, IQ, or behavior problems. A higher percentage of high-risk children were rated in the extreme clinical range for behavior problems than were comparison children. For alcoholic families, mothers' ratings of their children's total behavior problems, externalizing behavior problems, and internalizing behavior problems were predicted by mothers' lifetime alcohol problems, current depression, and family SES. Father variables failed to predict children's behavior problems. Maternal variables were stronger predictors of their 3-year-old sons' problem behaviors than were paternal variables.

AB This article focuses on issues related to the continuity and specificity/ generality of inhibitory and disinhibitory behaviors from childhood to adolescence. Literature pertinent to the stability and predictive validity of inhibitory (internalizing) and disinhibitory (externalizing) behaviors is reviewed, in addition to selected comorbid subtypes, including a ''mixed'' subtype characterized by high levels of both inhibitory and disinhibitory behaviors. Whereas empirical support for prospective relations typically has been indicated for the continuity and predictive validity of disinhibitory behaviors, this review suggests that a budding literature supports prospective relations for inhibitory behaviors and, to some extent, for the behaviors of a mixed subtype. Data from a relatively large, nonclinical adolescent sample are used to further demonstrate the proposed prospective relations among childhood inhibitory, disinhibitory, and mixed subtypes, and the expression of serious internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence. Future research directions are proposed that emphasize prospective studies of multiple diagnostic subtypes with both treatment and nontreatment populations.

AB Three major epidemiological studies of psychological disorders in Irish children were reviewed.  These are the first systematic investigations to be conducted in Ireland and all have been completed within the last 5 years.  The studies were conducted in Dublin (N=2029), Clare (N=1361) and Cork (N=733).  In all three studies children were screened with the Rutter Teacher Questionnaire.  The prevalence rates of children with deviant scores were 17%, 11% and 15% for Dublin, Clare and Cork respectively.  Externalizing behavioural problems were three times more prevalent than internalizing problems in Dublin and Clare.  Data for Cork, on this variable, were unavailable.  In all three studies the prevalence of disorders was higher in boys, but this pattern was particularly marked in Dublin where 21% of boys had disorders compared to 12% of girls.  In Dublin and Clare, but not in Cork, lower intelligence and reading attainment difficulties were associated with the presence of a psychological disorder.  In Dublin (the only area for which data on family circumstances were available) family adversity was associated with psychological disorder.  In Dublin and Cork, screening by questionnaire was followed-up with an intensive interview study of cases and controls.  Estimated prevalence rates of psychological disorder based on interview data were 16% for Dublin and 10% for Cork.

AB Alternative mental health services for children such as parent training are expanding across the country. Yet the clinical picture of the children served in these programs is incomplete. In two studies we compare scores from standardized behavior problem inventories for groups of children from a parent training class with scores from groups of children from a clinic setting and a nonclinic setting. In study one we used the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), an instrument that primarily assesses externalizing problems. In study two, we used the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), an instrument that assesses both externalizing and internalizing problems. The results from both studies show the scores from the parent training groups were equivalent to scores from the clinic groups and were significantly higher than the scores from the nonclinic groups. These results suggest parent training classes do serve children with clinically significant problems.

AB A meta-analysis was based on published studies that compared the self-esteem or behavior problems of stepchildren to children in nuclear and single-parent households. Twenty-four studies produced 57 effect sizes. Results showed generalizable differences in self-esteem between children in stepfamilies and nuclear families but not between stepchildren and children in single-parent households. Stepchildren's internalizing and externalizing behaviors were slightly greater than nuclear family children, but not single-parent family children. Discussion focused on the interpretation of these results within the limitations of the designs employed in the studies.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify psychosocial risk factors uniquely associated with past suicide attempts. Data assessing a large number of variables were available from a representative sample of older adolescents (N = 1,710). Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after controlling for current depression level included externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, past psychiatric disorders, depressotypic cognitions, coping, school problems, health problems, and gender. The probability of having made an attempt increased dramatically as a function of the number of risk factors. Females had more risk factors and showed a greater vulnerability to the factors than did males.

AB The main aim of this research was to investigate the childhood predictors (age 8-10 years) of teenage antisocial behaviour (age 18 years) and adult social dysfunction (age 32 years). A sample of 411 London males was followed up from age 8 years to age 32 years. The most important childhood predictors of both outcomes (and of convictions) were measures of economic deprivation, poor parenting, an antisocial family and hyperactivity-impulsivity-attention deficit. However, childhood nervousness and social isolation were negatively related to teenage antisocial behaviour but positively related to adult social dysfunction. It was concluded that the development of adult social dysfunction depended not only on established causes of antisocial behaviour such as economic deprivation and poor parenting but also on causes of internalizing disorders such as childhood nervousness and social isolation.

AB Differential diagnosis of anxiety and depressive disorders in children has been an area of confusion and controversy. A prototypic model of classification, which allows for heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria, would seem more appropriate when studying these disorders. Consistent with this model, a heuristic procedure using conditional probabilities is presented to determine the most efficient inclusion and exclusion criteria for the differential diagnosis of depression and anxiety in children. A multistage selection procedure was used to identify subjects from an initial pool of 720 fourth through seventh graders. Ultimately, 34 students were diagnosed as depressed, 30 as anxious, and 70 students did not receive either diagnosis. Base rates, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power rates were derived from child interview data. Results indicated that four symptoms served as efficient inclusion (high PPPs) and exclusion (high NPPs) criteria for depressive disorders: feeling unloved, anhedonia, excessive guilt, and depressed mood. Symptoms describing worries served as the most efficient inclusion criteria for anxiety disorders, especially worries about future events and competence in academics. However, based on the PPP values, the anxiety symptoms were more efficient predictors of the depression diagnosis than the anxiety diagnosis. This heuristic procedure is presented as a model to establish the most efficient inclusion and exclusion criteria for the diagnoses of childhood internalizing disorders.

AB Comorbidity refers to the coexistence of two or more distinct disorders or syndromes in the same individual. Research findings are presented showing comorbidity of externalizing (aggression and delinquency), internalizing (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, and withdrawal), and attention problems. Comorbidity is discussed within the conceptual framework of the categorical classification system of DSM diagnoses and a quantitative taxonomy based on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF). High comorbidity rates are reported for DSM diagnoses of conduct disorders with oppositional disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and attention deficit disorders. High comorbidity also was found for paired combinations of the CBCL and TRF Aggressive Behavior, Delinquent Behavior, Anxious/Depressed, and Attention Problems syndromes. Implications of comorbidity are discussed for determining special education eligibility and designing school-based interventions.

AB Heightened activity level has been implicated in the liability for substance abuse, but no prior research has directly examined motor activity in a sample of prepubertal boys at high-risk for substance abuse. The magnitude of behavioral activity of 10-12 year-old sons of substance abusing fathers (SA + ) (n = 42) and controls (SA - ) (n = 60) was assessed using a microprocessor-based activity monitor during tasks that demanded significant concentration, effort, and constraint on motor activity, and when no such demands were present. Psychiatric status, measures of temperament traits, and measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors were also obtained on the boys. Although the groups did not differ during the lower demand task, SA + boys showed significantly greater motor activity than SA - boys during the tasks that required concerted effort, attention, and behavioral suppression. Multiple regression analysis indicated that under the low-demand condition, the presence of an anxiety disorder in the boy was the only significant predictor of activity level. However, under the conditions that demanded effort, concerted attention and behavioral suppression, SA + group membership, and having low rhythmicity (as a temperament trait) predicted heightened activity. Statistically controlling for rhythmicity, the SA + boys were estimated to have about 24% higher activity than control boys. The results suggest that heightened motor activity may be associated with susceptability to substance abuse.

AB Although a number of studies have reported a relation between abusive parental behavior and later aggressive behavior in the victim, many of these investigations have had methodological limitations that make precise interpretation of their results problematic. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether harsh parental discipline occurring early in life was associated with later aggression and internalizing behavior in children, using a prospective design with randomly selected samples to avoid some of these methodological difficulties. Structural equation modeling indicated a consistent relation between harsh discipline and aggression in 2 separate cohorts of children. This relation did not appear to be due to possible confounding factors such as child temperament, SES, and marital violence, although there was some indication in our data that the latter variables were related to child aggression. In addition, our analyses suggested that the effect of harsh discipline on child aggression may be mediated at least in part by maladaptive social information processing patterns that develop in response to the harsh discipline.

AB An epidemiological sample of 936 Dutch children originally aged 4-11 years was assessed at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) on all four occasions. Stability coefficients computed for eight CBCL syndromes, Internalizing and Externalizing dimensions, and total problems revealed considerable long-term stability. There was no significant difference in the 6-year stability of internalizing vs. externalizing scores. This finding was at odds with reports of considerably lower stability of internalizing behavior, and was consistent with findings suggesting that the stability of internalizing problems should not be underestimated. The magnitude and specificity of the long-term stability of internalizing and externalizing scores lends support to the validity of these behavioral dimensions as tapped by the CBCL. No significant sex or age differences in the stability of problem behaviors were found.

AB Examining 96 youth diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or sickle-cell syndromes (SCS), this study focused on attributional styles and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Disease/disability parameters, including duration of disease and age of disease onset, and demographic factors were examined to determine their relation to attributional style and psychopathology. Attributional style was an efficient predictor of the youths' self-reports of depressive symptoms, when controlling for demographic and disease-related variables. Additionally, disease onset was related to children's self-reports of depressive symptoms. Teachers rated youth with SCS as exhibiting more internalizing behavior. Within the context of a risk-resistance-adaptation model, recommendations are made for future research endeavors and for the assessment of functional capacities and interventions to enhance adaptive functioning in chronically ill youth.

Mixed internal and external behavior problem patterns and diagnoses of anxiety and oppositional disorder were most frequent. Support was provided for the hypothesized psychosocial/mediational roles of child perception of self-worth and maternal anxiety in child adjustment. Together, the variables of the transactional stress and coping model accounted for 39 and 43% of the variance in mother-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and for 68% of the variance in child-reported problems.

AB Objectives.  Unlike cognitive impairments associated with lead exposure, lead-associated child behavior problems have been difficult to specify, particularly in young children.
   Methods. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were used as the outcome and confounding variables, respectively, of major interest.  These measures were examined with respect to blood lead levels of 201 African-American children aged 2 through 5 years.
   Results. In comparison with the low exposed group, the high exposed group (two consecutive blood lead levels greater-than-or-equal-to 15 mug/dL) had a significantly higher mean CBCL Total Behavior Problem Score (TBPS) and Internalizing and Externalizing scores; when other factors, including maternal depressive symptomatology, were controlled for, regression procedures indicated a .18-point TBPS increase for each unit increase in lead and a 5.1-point higher TBPS in the high exposed group; children in this group were 2.7 times more likely to have a TBPS in the clinical range.
   Conclusions. Through its use of a standardized parent-report measure of behavior and its consideration of maternal morale in multiple linear and logistic regression procedures, this study provides further evidence of lead's detrimental effect on child behavior at levels typical of present-day exposure.

AB Numerous multivariate studies of child psychopathology converge on the conclusion that children's disorders can be reliably classified along two broad dimensions of internalizing (depression, social withdrawal) and externalizing (aggression, attention deficit). This volume offers a wide range of perspectives on the etiology and phenomenology of both kinds of dysfunction, from the genetic and neurological to the familial and even cultural. Thus it sheds much needed light on what appears to be a universal in child diagnostics. One major limitation is the relative lack of focus on therapeutic strategies that might serve to alter these patterns of dysfunction.

ID GRADE RETENTION; CHILDREN
AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether retention of kindergarten and first-grade children is associated with long-term beneficial effects. Thirty-one children who had been retained were compared to 31 children who had similar grades but had never been retained. The dependent measures were grade point average in the second through fifth grades and four teacher-assessed areas of functioning in the fourth and fifth grade: social competence, cognitive competence, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems. The results indicated that retention was not associated with long-term beneficial effects but rather, especially for White children, appeared to be associated with poorer academic and social functioning. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

ID ADOLESCENTS
AB This study describes to what extent Norwegian adolescents were aware of a campaign to combat the spread of AIDS, and their participation in the various components. The material comprised a nationwide representative sample of 3000 adolescents aged 17 through 19 years. Data were collected by means of self-administered, anonymous questionnaires. The response rate was 62.8%. The intention of the campaign was to mobilize the youth culture in the fight against AIDS with a view to internalizing existing knowledge about HIV and AIDS in the hope of improving consistency between knowledge and sexual behavior. The campaign included five elements connected to the use of media and activities in the adolescents' social environment. The campaign slogan-Talk about sex, about being in love and about love-was referred to AIDS only indirectly. The medium used to communicate the message was rock music. Over one quarter of the adolescents reported a general awareness of the campaign. Awareness of the different elements varied between 2.4% and 24.0%. Use of condoms was apparently no higher among adolescents who were generally aware of the campaign than among adolescents with no knowledge of it. The adolescents had not grasped any specific message from the campaign. The campaign would probably have been more successful if the message had been more direct and more specific to the context.

AB The purpose of the present study was to compare incarcerated juvenile sex offenders to incarcerated youth who committed confrontational but nonsex offenses, and to those youth who committed only nonconfrontational, nonsex offenses. Furthermore, comparisons were made between two subtypes of sex offenders: those youth convicted for rape or sodomy vs those convicted for child molestation. Eighty-three male juvenile delinquents served as participants. Teachers within the correctional facility completed an instrument which allowed the examination of the two areas of interest: externalizing problems and internalizing problems. The results indicated that sex offenders generally, and particularly those who had committed only sex offenses, were perceived as having fewer externalizing and internalizing problems. No differences emerged between the two subtypes of sex offenders. Implications, as well as limitations, of the findings are discussed.

AB This study was conducted to compare the parental assessments of problem behaviors, using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, among alleged sexual abuse victims (n - 81) and an age, race, and gender matched group of nonabused comparison subjects (n = 90). Alleged sexual abuse victims demonstrated significantly higher mean total behavior problem. internalizing and externalizing scores than the comparison sample. Subscale profiles were all in the direction consistent with withdrawal, impairment in social interaction, and sexual problems. Item comparison indicated that sexual abuse victims were more likely to be assessed as having some problem behaviors that have been reported as being indicative of sexual abuse. A significant difference was not obtained on several behaviors that have been previously reported as indicative of sexual abuse. These findings support concerns that sexual abuse victims do exhibit more problem behaviors, but caution must be exercised when interpreting individual behaviors because of their frequency in a nonabused sample.

Correlations between both informants' CBCL syndrome scores ranged from 0.27 to 0.56. Adolescents reported many more problems than their parents did about them. Discrepancies were larger for externalizing than for internalizing problems, were larger for girls than for boys and increased with age. The findings indicated that adolescents, especially as they grow older, are indispensable informants on their own problem behaviors.

ID INPATIENT CHILDREN; DEPRESSION
AB Conducted a principal-components analysis on an aggregate of measures deemed theoretically compatible with either the Internalizing or Externalizing scales of the Achenbach and Edelbrock (1987) Youth Self-Report (YSR). Assessments involving reading ability and possible self-report contaminants were also included in the analysis. The subjects were 102 adolescent inpatients (52 boys, 50 girls) with a mean age of 14 years, 7 months. Four factors were retained accounting for 71.9% of the variance. The obtained factor structure supports the construct validity of the YSR broadband scales in that Internalizing and Externalizing scores converged as expected with measures of other constructs. However, the convergence appeared limited to self-report data. The primary component included the YSR Externalizing scale. Loadings on this dimension suggest that responses to items involving impulsivity and antisocial behaviors may be influenced by social desirability and denial of symptoms. Inspection of separate intercorrelation matrices for girls and boys suggested greater social desirability responding for girls and stronger boy-parent measurement correspondence.

AB The 6-year developmental course of parent-reported problem behavior in an epidemiological sample of 936 children assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist at 2-year intervals was determined. Children who were scored in the deviant range of the total problem score at time 1 were nine times more likely to be scored deviant 6 years later than were children who were not deviant at time 1 (odds ratio 9.0). Of the deviant children at time 1, 33% were deviant at time 4. There was no difference in the persistence of externalizing versus internalizing problems. This underscores die notion that internalizing problems should not be disregarded. Although this study demonstrated moderate stability of problem behaviors across a 6-year interval, children's problem behaviors should not be regarded as static. Many children showed changes in their level of functioning across time. However, extreme changes were the exception rather than the rule.

AB Quantitative and categorical indices of psychopathology are reported for a nationally representative longitudinal sample assessed via eight empirically derived cross-informant syndromes, internalizing, externalizing, and total problems. Results showed medium to large stabilities for parents' ratings during a 3-year interval on all comparable scales.  Predictive correlations between time 1 parents' ratings and time 2 teacher and self-ratings were weaker than parent-to-parent correlations. Classification of children as deviant showed weaker predictive relations than did quantitative scores. Odds ratios showed that children classified as deviant by parents' time 1 ratings were much more likely to be deviant at time 2 on corresponding parent, teacher, and self-ratings than were children initially classified as nondeviant.

AB Children with asthma are at special risk for problems in psychological functioning, as are children with other chronic illnesses. We conducted a controlled trial of a combined education and stress management program among children ages 6 to 14 years with asthma. Eighty-one children were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group; 56 children completed data collection, 29 intervention and 27 control. Psychological status was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) before and after the intervention, as were children's knowledge of asthma, stress (as measured by children's life events), and functional status (as indicated by such activities as school attendance, time playing with friends, and daily chore performance).
   Children in the intervention group had a significant improvement in the total Behavior Problems score (p < .04) and Internalizing scale (p < .01) on the CBCL and a significant increase in daily chores (p < .04) compared with the control group. Before intervention, the two groups had statistically significant positive relationships between negative life events and behavior problem scores. After intervention, children in the control group still demonstrated a significant relationship between negative life events and total and Internalizing Behavior Problem scores, although participation in the intervention group negated that relationship. Children in the intervention group whose knowledge of asthma increased were more likely to report an increase in daily chores (p < .02).
   We conclude that the intervention had a beneficial effect on psychological status and on children's daily activities. The effect may have occurred in part by decreasing the likelihood that perceived stress from negative life events led to poorer adjustment.

AB The purpose of the current study was ta examine the co-occurrence of substance abuse and three other psychiatric disorders (conduct disorder, depression, anxiety) in an incarcerated juvenile delinquent sample. Diagnostic interviews were utilized to place participants in one of three groups: No substance abuse, alcohol/marijuana abuse, or polysubstance abuse. Frequency of diagnosis and number of symptoms of three psychiatric disorders were then examined. The results indicated that the diagnosis of conduct disorder increased significantly with the occurrence of substance abuse. Also, the number of symptoms for conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression increased with substance abuse. With polysubstance abuse the probability of having more than one of the other psychiatric diagnoses was above 50%. Potential explanations for the findings, focusing on the developmental trajectory for conduct problems and self-medication for internalizing disorders, are discussed.

AB Since input from children is essential in the assessment of their internalizing symptoms such as anxiety, development of new self-report instruments is an important challenge. The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety - Revised (VAA-R), designed for assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents with school refusal, offers the advantages of ease of administration, decreased Deed for verbal expression, and appropriateness for a wide range of developmental levels. Psychometric properties of the instrument in a clinic sample of school refusers (N = 86) and in a community sample (N = 918) are presented. Tests of internal consistency indicate good internal reliability of items. In the clinic sample, correlations with other anxiety instruments are adequate (r = .60 - .65), supporting the initial validation of the new instrument. Factor analysis identified three clinically meaningful factors: anticipatory/separation anxiety, performance anxiety, and affective response to anxiety.

AB This study examines the level of psychopathology in 53 African-American females who attempted suicide by ingestion. Parents completed a measure of adolescent psychopathology, and the youths completed measures of depression and psychopathology. Overall, the results suggested that these youths were not experiencing significant emotional distress. However, after classifying the youths into four groups by their self-reported level of depression, the incidence of parent- and youth-reported psychopathology varied. More significant levels of depression corresponded to significant internalizing difficulties, as reported by the adolescent, and myriad psychopathological difficulties, as reported by the parents. These results are discussed from a clinical perspective with a developmentally and culturally sensitive focus. Disposition decisions must consider the level of psychopathology reported by child and parent, the family's willingness to participate in outpatient treatment, and the degree to which the adolescent and her family acknowledge the significance of the suicide attempt.

AB The present study attempted to delineate factors that are associated with and may contribute to juvenile delinquency. Delinquents were compared to a matched control group of nonoffenders on a measure of mental health problems. Twenty-four male and female incarcerated juvenile offenders and 24 nonoffending adolescents were evaluated on the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist (RBPC). As expected, the offenders scored higher (an indication of more psychopathology) on the subscales of the RBPC which represent externalizing types of problems. The offenders also scored significantly higher on the subscales reflecting internalizing problems and psychotic behavior. The results of this study point to the importance of assessing and treating offenders, especially those who are incarcerated, for difficulties other than externalizing problems.

AB Investigated 45 children between the ages of 3 and 6 years-ranging widely in degree and type of problem behavior-via parent ratings, teacher ratings, and objective observations of social behavior in play groups. The goal was to ascertain cross-informant correspondence for preschool-aged children, with a separate examination of internalizing versus externalizing behavior patterns. Regarding internalizing behavior, parent ratings (but not teacher ratings) independently predicted observed isolation and withdrawal. As for externalizing behavior, however, teacher ratings were far more strongly associated with play group observations than were parent reports, only the teacher information independently predicted observed non-compliance and aggression. These differential patterns of cross-informant convergence across internalizing versus externalizing domains are discussed in light of the need for accurate identification of behavioral/emotional risk in preschoolers.

AB Sixty-one 12- to 18-year-olds were randomized to 8-10 sessions of behavior management training (n = 20), problem-solving and communication training (n = 21), or structural family therapy (n = 20). Families were assessed at pre- and posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. All treatments resulted in significant reductions in negative communication, conflicts, and anger during conflicts and improved ratings of school adjustment, reduced internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and decreased maternal depressive symptoms. Most outcomes remained stable between posttreatment and follow-up, and some continued to improve over this time. Despite group improvements, analyses of clinically significant change and clinical recovery within Ss showed that only 5-30% reliably improved from treatment and only 5-20% recovered following treatment. The three treatments did not differ in these rates.

AB This cross-sectional study, conducted in 1988, examines the association between hemoglobin level and behavior problems in 236 Hispanic children, ages 2 to 5 years, residing in low-income census tracts in the Los Angeles area. Venous blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and lead. Family and child data were obtained through a home interview with the child's mother or guardian. Behavior problems were assessed using questionnaires modeled after Child Behavior Checklists for children ages 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 years. A significant correlation between decreasing hemoglobin values and increasing total behavior problems scores was found for girls, 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 years old. These associations remained significant in both age groups after adjusting for maternal education and marital status. Statistically significant inverse correlations also were found between hemoglobin and social withdrawal, sleep problems, and depression (internalizing subscale behaviors) in 2- to 3-year-old girls, and between hemoglobin and aggression and hyperactivity (externalizing subscale behaviors) in 4- to 5-year-old girls. The potentially negative consequences of these anemia-related behavior problems on children's development, learning ability, and parent-child relationships warrant further investigation.

TI COGNITIVE-FUNCTIONING AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE AS PREDICTORS OF
   MALADJUSTMENT IN SEXUALLY ABUSED GIRLS
SO JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to explain some of the variability in the degree of maladjustment exhibited by sexually abused children, behavior problems, social competence and cognitive functioning were assessed in 53 abused Black girls aged 5 through 16 years. Internalizing dysfunction was positively related to three cognition-related variables: intellectual functioning, academic achievement, and age. Anxiety specifically about the abuse was positively related to age. Parent-reported self-blame for the abuse was associated with high scores on the intellectual, academic, and emotional distress measures. Thus cognitively advanced victims seemed to experience more emotional distress. Externalizing dysfunction was associated with low social competence. Sexual acting out was associated with emotional distress, overt behavior disturbance, and low social competence. These results suggest that internal, subject variables affect the degree of dysfunction exhibited by sexually abused children.

AB The stability of internalizing disorders was studied over a period of 15 months in a sample of three- to five-year-old children attending preschool (N = 280). Stability coeffcients for shyness/inhibition (r(T1-T2) = .65/.77), oversensitivity (r(T1-T2) = .49/.69) and dependency (r(T1-T2) = .43/.64) showed a high to moderate (normative) continuity during this stage of development. There were no sex differences but there were significant age variations: The stability of shyness/inhibition was about twice as high in the oldest cohort as in the youngest age group. Persistence of internalizing behavior dimensions was much stronger in a withdrawn-aggressive group than in a withdrawn-nonaggressive group. Peer status had some predictive utility, but for the sample as a whole there was only a low correlation between sociometric variables (T1) and internalizing scores (T2); the level of correlation was strongly dependent on the children's age and sex.

DT Article
DE LISREL; CHILDRENS BEHAVIOR; PARENTAL RATINGS; TWINS; HERITABILITY
ID STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; TWIN
AB A common procedure for assessing children's behavior is to obtain parental ratings of the child. Since the ratings obtained are a function of both parent and child, disentangling the child's phenotype from that of the rater becomes an important methodological problem. For the analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to children's behavior, solutions to this are available when multiple raters, eg., two parents, rate multiple children, eg., twins. This paper describes and illustrates simple LISREL models for the analysis of parental ratings of children's behavior. We show how the assumption that mothers and fathers are rating the same behavior in children can be contrasted with the weaker alternative that parents are rating correlated behaviors. Given the stronger assumption, which appears adequate for ratings of children's internalizing behavior problems, the contribution of rater bias and unreliability may be separated from the shared and nonshared environmental components of variation in a behavior genetic analysis.

This review surveys the internalizing disorders from the point of view of early intervention, for their prevalence, course, risk, early indicators, associated impairment, and responses to intervention. In general, the internalizing disorders have little effect on the community. When coupled with other disorders such as conduct disorder, or when dealing with suicide, the community's concern for these disorders increases and allocation of resources to target populations who are at risk becomes an important public health goal.

AB A 2-wave longitudinal design, with a 6-month interval between occasions of measurement, was used to study the interrelations between stressful life events, perceived social support from family and friends, and the internalizing (e.g., depressive symptoms) and externalizing (e.g., alcohol use and delinquent activity) of problems of a sample of 277 middle adolescents (mean age = 15.7 years). Although little support was found for the stress-buffering effects of either family or friend social support, the main effects of stressful life events and low family support were significant prospective predictors of problem behaviors for adolescent girls but not adolescent boys. Results are discussed with regard to mechanisms of differential gender socialization, such as the adolescent gender intensification hypothesis (Hill & Lynch, 1983).

AB The 4-year stability in problem behaviors assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and their predictive validity with regard to poor outcome variables was studied in 1052 4-12-year old children from a general population sample. Irrespective of sex and age, the scores on the CBCL of some 44% of the children remained above the 90th percentile over the 4-year time interval. Externalizing problem behavior tended to show somewhat greater stability than internalizing problem behavior. High initial levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems, and persistence of problems were predictive of referral to mental health services. Referral to special education was higher for younger boys with high initial attention problems and school problems. Police contacts occurred more often in older boys with high initial aggression scores.

AB This review summarizes research concerning the relation between paternal factors and child and adolescent psychopathology.  When compared with mothers, fathers continue to be dramatically underrepresented in developmental research on psychopathology.  However, findings from studies of children of clinically referred fathers and nonreferred samples of children and their fathers indicate that there is substantial association between paternal characteristics and child and adolescent psychopathology.  Findings from studies of fathers of clinically referred children are stronger for fathers' effects on children's externalizing than internalizing problems.  In most cases the degree of risk associated with paternal psychopathology is comparable to that associated with maternal psychopathology.  Evidence indicates that the presence of paternal psychopathology is a sufficient but not necessary condition for child or adolescent psychopathology.

AB Assessed the behavioral characteristics of 17 child victims of sexual abuse and a matched group of 17 nonabused, nonreferred community children.  The two groups were matched on age, sex, socioeconomic level, and child's living situation.  Measures included both global and specific indices of internalizing problems (e.g., depression, fearfulness, social withdrawal) as well as externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, sexual acting out) and utilized caretaker and self-report questionnaires.  Significant differences between sexually abused children and nonabused, nonreferred children from the community were found on self-report measures of depression and caretaker reports of externalizing and internalizing problems.  These findings suggest that sexual abuse has a negative effect on the functioning of children, which cannot be accounted for by the specific living situation or socioeconomic environment of the child.

AB Presents initial findings regarding the reliability and validity of a newly developed self-report coping measure for children.  The study also addresses several conceptual issues (e.g., stressor appraisals, cross-situational consistency in coping).  As per Roth and Cohen (1986), coping items were conceptualized as comprising approach strategies (i.e., Seeking Social Support, Problem Solving) and avoidance strategies (i.e., Distancing, Internalizing, Externalizing).  Fourth through sixth graders (N = 481) rated their use of 34 strategies in response to both an academic and a social stressor.  Factor analyses supported this conceptualization of the five coping strategies for each stressor.  Internal consistencies and test-retest reliabilities of the coping subscales were in the .6 to .8 range.  Initial evidence of validity included significant correlations with peer ratings of coping and other indices.

AB This study compared the pattern of reports describing childhood emotional and behavioural problems amongst children in the community with the pattern of reports describing children referred to mental health clinics.  Whereas children in the community reported more externalizing and internalizing problems than were reported by their parents, clinic-referred children reported fewer externalizing but more internalizing problems than their parents.  The results highlight potential limitations which may arise when reports describing the problems of clinic-referred children are used as the criterion for assessing the clinical significance of reports describing problems amongst children in the community.

AB Associations among sibling relations and the psychosocial and illness-specific adaptation of youths (N-66) with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were examined.  The findings suggest that sibling relations, especially sibling conflict, contribute an independent source of variance above and beyond that contributed by demographic characteristics, sibling constellation variables, and important dimensions of family relations in predicting the youths' adaptation.  High family-life stress and high sibling status/power contributed unique variance in predicting internalizing behaviors, and male gender and sibling conflict contributed independently to externalizing problems.  Sibling conflict also contributed unique variance to the youths' general self-esteem, along with social class and family cohesion, and to their adjustment to IDDM.  Data suggest that parent-child dyads and sibling dyads represent interrelated and independent subsystems within the family, and that both subsystems may influence the psychosocial functioning of youths with IDDM.

AB Investigated the impact of childhood chronic illness within a family context. We interviewed 30 mothers of 6- to 14-year-old children with asthma or diabetes and 30 mothers of healthy children of the same age and sex. Family functioning, extrafamilial social support available to mothers, and child life stress events were examined in relation to the children's psychological adjustment and illness events. The mothers of asthmatic children reported a greater number of internalizing behavior problems in their children, perceived their own social support as less adequate, and reported a greater number of stressful events. Regression analyses demonstrated that family functioning, maternal social support, and chronic illness were significantly related to the psychological adjustment of the child. The importance of family functioning and resources available to the family, such as social support, are discussed as protective influences in coping with childhood chronic illness.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the intergenerational influence of experiencing parental violence on the expression of violent behavior in adolescent males and to attempt to assess the importance of psychological mechanisms in this transmission. Sixty-five consecutive male admissions to a Young Offenders Unit and 25 male high school boys were administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory, an intelligence test, and a violence questionnaire. Violent behavior in adolescence was found to be associated with experiencing paternal violence. This transmission was also found to be associated with higher levels of psychotic symptomatology. Violent behavior in adolescence was not found to be associated with maternal violence experienced or parental violence witnessed or with low self-esteem, externalizing defences, or internalizing defences.

AB Neuropsychological and socio-emotional factors associated with specific-arithmetic disability were investigated in an unselected sample of New Zealand children. Subjects were 17 specific-arithmetic disabled, 27 specific-reading disabled, 63 generally disabled, and 50 nondisabled 13 year olds. Evidence was sought for an association between specific-arithmetic disability and the neuropsychological and socio-emotional correlates of Nonverbal Learning Disability syndrome (NLD). NLD is characterized by a pattern of nonverbal and verbal neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses, and appears to place individuals at greater risk for internalizing psychopathology, than other learning disabilities. Only specific-arithmetic disabled subjects were found to show a neuropsychological profile reminiscent of NLD. Evidence of poor socio-emotional adjustment was found across all three learning-disabled groups, and was greatest among generally disabled subjects. We found that the specific-arithmetic-disabled subjects exhibited the greatest degree of overlap between internalizing psychopathology and a NLD neuropsychological profile. The results are interpreted as providing some support for the idea that specific-arithmetic-disabled individuals may be at greater risk for the NLD syndrome than either generally disabled or specific-reading-disabled individuals.

AB Using a case analogue methodology, this study examined the acceptability of four alternative treatment procedures (positive reinforcement, self-instruction, time-out, and reprimands) as applied to one externalizing child problem, aggression, and one internalizing child problem, withdrawal. One hundred and three mothers served as raters and completed the Treatment Evaluation Inventory. The identity of the interventionist (parents/teachers vs. psychologist) and previous therapeutic effects (weak vs. no information) were manipulated. Results confirm previous reports that positive interventions are judged to be more acceptable than negative ones and this was shown as applied to withdrawal as well as aggression. In addition, self-instruction was found to be an acceptable intervention. No significant main or interaction effects for the Mediator or Previous Therapeutic Effects variables were found. The results are related to prior research, and limitations and future directions are discussed.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; ABUSIVE PARENTS; VICTIMS
AB Three questions about the effects of family violence on children are addressed in this study: (1) What is the path between a mother's exposure early in her own life to abuse and other severe stresses and the likelihood that her children will be abused?; (2) What is the relationship between different constellations of family violence and their effect on children's general behavioral disturbance?; and (3) Can we differentiate between types of child behavioral disturbance on the basis of different parameters of family violence? Two New York City samples of school children were studied, one comprised of 106 physically abused children identified from the New York State Register of indicated abuse cases, and the other comprised of 85 of their non-maltreated classmates. Results showed that the intergenerational transmission of family violence was best described in terms of indirect effects, that children show general behavioral disturbance as a result of different constellations of family violence, and that it is difficult to differentiate between internalizing and externalizing behavioral disturbance as a function of the family violence variables we studied, although both kinds of disturbance are characteristic of abused children.

LA English
DT Article
ID OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; DEFICIT
AB Tourette syndrome (TS), a neuropsychiatric disorder that presents in childhood and is characterized by recurrent tics, is often associated with a variety of psychological problems. Most studies of concomitant problems have focused on psychiatric comorbidity, with less attention paid to nonsyndrome-specific or subsyndromal emotional and behavioral difficulties. Moreover, little is known about the factors that influence the specificity or severity of psychological problems. We hypothesized that level and type of psychological problem would be influenced by both severity of illness and developmental period. Children with severe tics were predicted to show increased levels of externalizing (undercontrolled) behavior, whereas adolescents with severe tics were predicted to show increased levels of internalizing (overcontrolled) behavior. Forty-one boys with TS were rated by their parents for tic severity (simple and complex motor tics) and psychological symptoms (Connors Parent Symptom Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist). Results partially confirmed the hypothesis, indicating that greater illness severity was associated with greater psychological disturbance, but only in the younger subjects. Among the adolescents, even those with mild tics demonstrated relatively high levels of psychological symptoms. However, there was no indication that developmental period was related to the specific type of problem manifested. Regardless of age, patients with severe tics demonstrated high levels of externalizing behavior, and relatively high levels of internalizing behavior were also seen. Results are discussed in terms of the developmental factors that might influence the relationship between psychological and physical symptoms in children with TS.

AB Results are reported for a 3-year prospective longitudinal study of behavior problems in a group of children born at very low birthweight (< 1,500 g) and a full-term control. Behavior problems were assessed with the Behavior Screening Questionnaire (BSQ) at 3 years and with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the hyperactivity index from the Conners parent and teacher scales at 6 years. The findings indicate that the preterms manifested more behavior problems than full-terms at both ages and that the overall prevalence of clinically significant problems increased with age. Although cross-age continuity on parent rating scales was similar and modest for both groups (r = .24-.35), the persistence of significant problems was quite high (50%). Early BSQ scores predicted later externalizing problems, even after the effects of prematurity, socioeconomic status, and family stress were removed, but not later internalizing problems. The latter were more strongly influenced by low SES and family stress. Findings for the full-terms, who had received the CBCL as well as the BSQ at 3 years, suggest that these two instruments may tap somewhat different dimensions of behavior disturbance at age 3.

AB Although research into the continuity of disorder from childhood to adolescence is sparse, results from both longitudinal and cross sectional studies suggest that the prevalence of disorder increases for girls but may remain more stable for boys. In this paper, the methodologies of two assessment phases of the Dunedin longitudinal study have been equated to estimate the continuity of DSM-III disorder from ages 11 to 15. Although the overall prevalence of disorder doubled between the ages, this was primarily because of an increase in nonaggressive conduct disorder and major depressive episode. The sex ratios in disorder had largely reversed from a male predominance at 11 to a female predominance at 15. In terms of persistence, over 40% of those with disorder at age 11 were also identified at age 15. However, over 80% of those identified with disorder at 15 did not have a history of disorder at 11. Significant sex differences were also found in the continuity of internalizing and externalizing disorders, with externalizing disorders showing more continuity for boys, and internalizing for girls. Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the roles family background, academic and social competence, and early histories of behavior problems may play in the determination of disorder continuity.

AB This article reports the findings of a metanalytic review of self-control therapies for children with internalizing disorders with symptoms of clinically significant severity. A total of 22 studies testing four different types of self-control interventions were reviewed. Characteristics of the studies reviewed are presented and discussed. Self-control therapy was found to be effective with internalizing disorders in general, but to be more effective with disorders primarily affecting mood than with somatic disorders. Self-control therapy appeared to result in lasting, socially significant changes in behavior and was relatively inexpensive to administer. Factors which may impact the effectiveness of self-control therapy are (a) use of more than one self-control treatment per intervention, (b) group therapy as opposed to individual therapy, and (c) self-control therapy with older versus younger children. Limitations of the study are discussed and suggestions for areas of future research are made.

AB 2 studies were conducted to illustrate how measuring a specific aspect of marriage, namely, child-rearing disagreements, provides a better understanding of the link between marriage and boys' behavior. In Study 1, 200 mothers of 3-year-old boys completed unstandardized measures of marital functioning and child behavior. An index of child-rearing disagreements: (1) correlated with a greater variety of behavior problems than nonchild disagreements, and (2) improved upon the prediction of behavior problems after accounting for nonchild disagreements as well as after accounting for boys' exposure to marital conflict. In Study 2, 87 mothers with 4-6-year-old sons completed the index of child-rearing disagreements used in Study 1 as well as standard measures of marital functioning and child behavior. Child-rearing disagreements: (1) predicted a greater variety of behavior problems than global marital adjustment, and (2) improved upon the prediction of internalizing problems after controlling for global marital adjustment as well as after controlling for boys' exposure to marital conflict.

AB The behavioural characteristics of 40 children with Down's syndrome were studied using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist which was completed by both the children's parents and teachers. Statistically significant differences were observed between study and control groups on externalizing and total scores on responses obtained from both parents and teachers, but not on internalizing scores. Further analysis of the data on a subgroup of 28 children between the ages of 6 and 11 years revealed a 'hyperactive' profile pattern for both boys (n = 16) and girls (n = 12). This was primarily due to heavily weighted positive responses to such statements as 'acts too young', 'can't concentrate', 'impulsive', and 'speech problems'. About one half of the boys sometimes exhibited hyperactive behaviours. In addition, scores of children with Down's syndrome were significantly different from control children on the following items: 'trouble sleeping', 'demands a lot of attention', 'clings to adults', 'stubborn', 'prefers playing with younger children', and 'is disobedient at school and home'. In general, however, item analysis revealed that most behaviours of children with Down's syndrome as recorded on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist compare well with those of children in the control group.

AB Consistency between teachers' and parents' ratings of 229 children's prosocial and problem behaviors was investigated from kindergarten through grade two. Intrarater stability was also analyzed. Results indicated moderate but decreasing interrater agreement from kindergarten to grade two for boys on externalizing behaviors. Interrater agreement for the same behavior dimension for girls was moderate and stable, whereas it was low on internalizing behavior problems and prosocial behaviors, for both genders throughout the 3-year period. Moreover, difference between teachers' and parents' ratings of externalizing behaviors increased from kindergarten to grade two. Decreasing level of agreement through time appeared to be related to a reduction of teacher-rated externalizing behaviors not paralleled by a reduction in parent ratings. Analyses were also performed at the item level of the externalization scale to identify which specific behaviors were responsible for the increasing divergence in interrater agreement from kindergarten through grade two. Alternative interpretations were considered in order to account for present and past results. Implications for screening and assessment purposes were discussed.

AB The psychiatric functioning of 28 youths with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was examined.  Measures of psychological functioning were related to age at onset, duration of diabetes, and metabolic control, as assessed by HgbA1C.  Children diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus at a later age were considered by teachers to have more behavioral problems.  Children who had better metabolic control tended to hold themselves responsible for negative events.  It is worthwhile to develop interventions to teach diabetic children a realistic balance between taking appropriate responsibility for controllable negative events without taking undue blame for uncontrollable negative events associated with the disease.

When DSM-III-R diagnoses based on mother and youth Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children interviews were used prospectively to determine subsequent treatment seeking, it was found that consultation with mental health specialists, but not with pediatricians or general practitioners, was elevated in those with disorders.  The specific diagnoses most associated with treatment seeking were conduct disorder and oppositional/defiant disorder.  No compensation for differences in mental health service usage between children with internalizing disorders and those with externalizing disorders in the form of help from informal or other professional sources was present.

AB A large-scale, community-based survey was done to assess the frequency of a wide variety of sexual behaviors in normal preadolescent children and to measure the relationship of these behaviors to age, gender, and socioeconomic and family variables.  A sample of 880 2-through 12-year-old children screened to exclude those with a history of sexual abuse were rated by their mothers using several questionnaire measures.  The frequency of different behaviors varied widely, with more aggressive sexual behaviors and behaviors imitative of adults being rare.  Older children (both boys and girls) were less sexual than younger children.  Sexuality was found to be related to the level of general behavior problems, as measured by the Achenbach Internalizing and Externalizing T scores and to a measure of family nudity.  It was not related to socioeconomic variables.

From a sample of 132 14-year-old international adoptees and their parents, information was obtained via the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Youth Self-Report and the Teacher's Report Form, the Child Assessment Schedule, and the Graham and Rutter Parent Interview. Agreement between the CBCL and the clinical judgment of the severity of psychopathology was substantial. Assessment procedures providing data on the adolescents' functioning derived from different sources revealed less agreement than those derived from the same informant. Agreement was higher for externalizing than for internalizing behaviors. Data from different sources made unique contributions to clinicians' judgments of the severity of psychopathology.

AB RECENTLY, there has been an increase of research interest in the nature of the relationship between the concept of "competence" and mental health and disorder.  For a large sample of adolescents studied at ages 11 and 15 years, we developed indices of social competence at each age based on measures of social attachment and involvement in activities.  There was a significant association between competence and "externalizing" disorders at both ages.  Competence was related to "internalizing" disorder only at age 11.  Preadolescent social competence did not predict later disorder at age 15 in the sample as a whole.  However, externalizing disorder at age 15 was predicted by presence of disorder together with low social competence in preadolescence.

AB Alcohol, a potent teratogen, has been suggested as an etiologic agent in attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), which is often diagnosed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and in children of alcoholics. We studied attentional and behavioral factors associated with diagnosis of this disorder in children selected from a predominantly low-income, black population who were tested as part of a longitudinal follow-up of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-eight children with a mean age of 5 years 10 months, born to three groups of mothers, were assessed. These groups consisted of:  a) women who reported not drinking during pregnancy (n = 21), b) women who reported drinking throughout pregnancy (n = 25), and c) women who reported drinking an equivalent amount but who stopped drinking after educational intervention during the second trimester (n = 22). Dimensions assessed included factors related to attention on a computerized task, impulsivity, and the presence of psychiatrically significant internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In addition, free play and mother-child interactions were video-taped, and evidence of overactive and noncompliant behaviors was noted. Hyperactivity and impulsive behavior were not evident. Results indicated that children exposed throughout pregnancy showed deficits in the ability to sustain attention and were more often described by teachers, although not by their mothers, as showing attentional and behavioral problems. Problems in both internalizing and externalizing behaviors also were noted by teachers. However, when current drinking was controlled, only externalizing behaviors remained different by group. Noting the limitations of the present study, implications of these findings are discussed. These include identification of symptoms of ADHD in children of women who abuse alcohol as well as qualitative differences from clinically identified ADHD children.

DE SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSE; FIXATION TIME; NOVELTY; AUTISM
ID EARLY-ONSET PSYCHOSIS; ORIENTING RESPONSE; CHILDHOOD AUTISM
AB Skin conductance responses and eye-fixation behavior to visual stimuli were measured in high-functioning autistic children, normal children, children with externalizing disorders, and children with internalizing disorders.  Novelty, complexity, and subjective significance of the stimuli were manipulated.  Autistic children were electrodermally hyporesponsive to novel stimuli.  In all groups, manipulation of stimulus complexity only influenced fixation time.  Manipulation of subjective significance influenced fixation time as well as skin conductance response in all groups.  In the autistic group, adding subjective significance to a stimulus changed electrodermal nonresponders into responders, indicating that non-responsiveness or hyporesponsiveness in autistic children does not imply a loss of (novel) stimulus detection, filtering, or orientation reaction capability, per se.

AB Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 1991), when applied to the realm of education, is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a valuing of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes. These outcomes are manifestations of being intrinsically motivated and internalizing values and regulatory processes. Research suggests that these processes result in high-quality learning and conceptual understanding as well as enhanced personal growth and adjustment. In this article we also describe social-contextual factors that nurture intrinsic motivation and promote internalization, leading to the desired educational out comes.

AB CHILDREN with conduct disorder have long been known to be at high risk for developing externalizing disorders, alcohol and drug abuse, and antisocial personality.  Relationships of conduct disorder to other adult psychiatric disorders, on the other hand, have not been definitively shown.  Taking advantage of the large community sample (N = 19,482) interviewed in the NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program, the authors examined the effects of childhood conduct problems on ten DSM-III psychiatric disorders:  somatization, phobia, panic, obsessive-compulsive, depression, mania, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, schizophrenia and antisocial personality.  Each of the ten adult disorders showed an increase in prevalence with an increasing number of conduct problems, although effects were stronger for externalizing disorders.  The predictive power of conduct problems was similar for males and females.  The effect of conduct problems on nonexternalizing disorders was found to be largely mediated through externalizing disorders, particularly for men but direct effects also occurred for both sexes.  These findings raise questions about the conventional view of psychiatric disorders as divisible into externalizing and internalizing disorders.  They also suggest that the increasing rates of conduct problems in younger cohorts may be responsible in part for the rising rates of other disorders.  Thus, prevention of an early intervention with conduct disorder may hold promise for reducing rates of a broad range of disorders.

ID ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER; SELF-CONTROL; CHILDREN
AB Three parent-completed behavior rating scales, the Conners Abbreviated Rating Scale (ARS), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Self-Control Rating Scale (SCRS), were studied in boys with attention deficit disorder (ADD), psychiatric controls, and a normal comparison group.  The ability of the scales to discriminate these groups was determined via univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) and discriminant function analyses.  All three rating scales revealed group differences.  In discriminant function analyses, the ARS was the single best predictor of group membership, but it frequently misclassified psychiatric controls.  Externalizing behavior indexes from the SCRS and CBCL yielded similar results.  The addition of CBCL internalizing and social competence scales improved overall group classification, facilitating the identification of psychiatric controls.  Results encourage the use of multidimensional rating scales such as the CBCL in clinical differential diagnosis, but suggest that unidimensional scales such as the ARS are also useful for assessing change or treatment effects in ADD.

AB A preventive mental health intervention previously reported found positive effects in a parent-child interaction training program on attention deficit and internalizing symptoms of low-income preschool children as rated by parents.  Families were randomly assigned to a "minimal treatment" control group or a more extensive treatment experimental group.  The present study reports follow-up results measured approximately 1 year after the end of the intervention.  Parent ratings and child achievement test scores showed no differences between the two groups.  Teachers blind to the condition of the intervention, however, rated experimental children as significantly superior to control children with respect to attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms (preintervention ratings by teachers on the same variable were statistically controlled).  Composite teacher ratings of child behavior also significantly favored the experimental group.  Children's improvements in classroom behavior were significantly correlated with improvements parents had shown during the intervention in their behavior toward the children.

AB We compared parent-reported problems and competencies for national samples of 2,600 4-16-year-olds assessed at intake into mental health services and 2,600 demographically matched nonreferred children assessed in a home interview survey. Parents responded to the ACQ Behavior Checklist, which includes 23 competence items, three competence scales, 216 problem items, eight syndrome scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and total competence and problem scores. Most items and scales discriminated significantly (p < .01) between referred and nonreferred samples. There were important sex and age differences in problem patterns, but regional and ethnic differences were minimal. Somewhat more problems and fewer competencies were reported for lower- than upper-socioeconomic-status children. Referral rates were similar in the most urban and rural areas, but they were significantly higher in areas of intermediate urbanization.
   Correlations of problem scores with those obtained 10 years earlier in a regional survey and with surveys in other countries showed considerable consistency in the rank order of prevalence rates among specific problems. Apparently owing to its more differentiated response scales, the ACQ was susceptible to respondent characteristics that reduced its discriminative power below that of the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Comparisons of procedures for discriminating between the normal and the clinical range supported the value of a borderline category for children who are neither clearly normal nor clearly deviant. Interview data from the survey sample yielded significantly higher ACQ problem scores for children who had fewer related adults in their homes, those who had more unrelated adults in their homes, those whose biological parents were unmarried, separated, or divorced, those whose families received public assistance, and those whose household or family members had received mental health services. Children who scored higher on Externalizing than Internalizing problems tended to have unmarried, separated, or divorced parents and to come from families receiving public assistance. However, among children whose household or family members had received mental health services, there were greater proportions of both Externalizing and Internalizing patterns than among other children.
