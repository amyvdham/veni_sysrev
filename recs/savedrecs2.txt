AB The effects of spirituality and youth relationships with others on internalizing, externalizing, and adaptive outcomes were examined in a sample of 159 youth between the ages of 8 and 21 in foster or residential care. Indirect effects of direct coping and perceived social support on the relations between these factors and youth outcomes were examined. Preliminary analyses indicated a significant relation between youth spirituality and adaptive outcomes, with a significant indirect effect of perceived social support on these relations. However, these relations were nonsignificant when accounting for youth relationships with others. Final results indicated that youth relationships with others significantly affected youth adaptive functioning through both coping and perceived social support. Youth relationships also significantly affected youth internalizing symptoms, albeit only through youths' perceived levels of social support. These findings suggest that, while spiritual beliefs are potentially an important factor in affecting outcomes for foster youth, the strongest effects likely occur through youths' relationships with others, social support, and coping in relation to adaptive outcomes for these youth.

AB The effect of parental depression on children's adjustment has been well documented, with exposure during early childhood particularly detrimental. Most studies that examine links between parental depression and child behavior are confounded methodologically because they focus on parents raising children who are genetically related to them. Another limitation of most prior research is a tendency to focus only on the effects of maternal depression while ignoring the influence of fathers' depression. The purpose of this study was to examine whether infants' exposure to both parents' depressive symptoms, and inherited risk from birth mother internalizing symptoms, was related to school age children's externalizing and internalizing problems. Study data come from a longitudinal adoption study of 561 adoptive parents, biological mothers, and adopted children. Adoptive fathers' depressive symptoms during infancy contributed independent variance to the prediction of children's internalizing symptoms and also moderated associations between adoptive mothers' depressive symptoms and child externalizing symptoms.

AB PurposeAlthough parental criminal offending is a recognized risk factor for conduct problems among offspring, its impact on the continuity and discontinuity of children's behavioural and emotional difficulties during the early development is less well known. We used data from a large, population-based record-linkage project to examine the relationship between parental offending and the continuity and discontinuity of children's conduct, attentional, and emotional difficulties from early to middle childhood while also considering the role of timing of the parental offending exposure.MethodData for 19,208 children and their parents were drawn from the New South Wales Child Development Study. Multinomial regression analyses tested associations between mother's and father's history and timing of any and violent offending, and patterns of continuity or discontinuity in offspring emotional, conduct, and attentional difficulties between ages 5 and 11years.ResultsMaternal and paternal offending each conferred a significantly increased risk of all the patterns of developmental difficulties, including those limited to age 5 only (remitting problems), to age 11 only (incident problems), and to difficulties present at both ages 5 and 11years (persisting problems). Greatest odds were observed for persisting conduct problems. Paternal offending that continued through early and middle childhood had the greatest association with child difficulties, while the timing of maternal offending had a less prominent effect on child developmental difficulties.ConclusionParental offending is a strong risk factor for early and pervasive behavioural and emotional problems in offspring, and may be a key indicator of high risk for later antisocial behaviour.

AB This study examined whether adolescents' behavior in a support-seeking context helped to explain associations between increases in mother-adolescent conflict during early adolescence and changes in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. A sample of 194 adolescents aged 12 to 14 (51% female) and their mothers were followed over 1 year. Mother-adolescent pairs participated in a speech task introducing an external social stressor into the parent-child relationship. Using a latent difference score model, adolescents' observed attachment behavior and hostility were compared as potential explanatory processes. Analyses suggest specificity in the spillover process from conflict to adolescent behavior in a nonconflictual parent-child interaction context, with hostility uniquely linking increasing mother-adolescent conflict and externalizing problems, and disruptions in adolescent attachment behavior uniquely explaining the link with internalizing problems.

AB Internalizing difficulties in children and adolescents refer to inner-directed disordered mood and emotions. The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the reliability and validity of the internalizing subscale on the interRAl Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) in assessing broadband internalizing mental health symptoms. Data were collected from clinically-referred children/youths 4 to 18 years of age between 2015 and 2016 (N = 2536). After initial items relevant to internalizing disturbances underwent expert content validation, exploratory first-order and bifactor factor analyses and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) parameterizations were conducted to test the validity of the measurement model. The internalizing subscale demonstrated strong measurement properties for a three-factor structure (i.e., depression, anxiety, anhedonia) and MIRT analyses showed individual items had acceptable discrimination parameters across the latent continuum. A series of four competing models using confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in a separate sample of 1397 children/youth assessed in 2017 and the bifactor model showed superior fit compared to other models. Finally, concurrent validity of this measure was confirmed based on relationships with other established sub scales from criterion measures. The interRAl ChYMH internalizing subscale could be used to provide useful information for triaging and prioritizing referrals for children/youths.

AB Background Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia in up to 30% of individuals with the syndrome. Despite this, we know relatively little about trajectories and predictors of persistence of psychiatric disorders from middle childhood to early adulthood. Accordingly, we followed youth over four timepoints, every 3 years, to assess long-term trajectories of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, mood, and psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSDs), as well as medication usage. Methods Eighty-seven youth with 22q11DS and 65 controls between the ages of 9 and 15 years at the first timepoint (T1; mean age 11.88 +/- 2.1) were followed for 9 years (mean age of 21.22 +/- 2.01 years at T4). Baseline cognitive, clinical, and familial predictors of persistence were identified for each class of psychiatric disorders. Results Baseline age and parent-rated hyperactivity scores predicted ADHD persistence [area under curve (AUC) = 0.81]. The presence of family conflict predicted persistence of anxiety disorders (ADs) whereas parent ratings of child internalizing symptoms predicted persistence of both anxiety and mood disorders (MDs) (AUC = 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Baseline prodromal symptoms predicted persistent and emergent PSDs (AUC = 0.83). Parent-reported use of anti-depressants/anxiolytics increased significantly from T1 to T4. Conclusions Psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive functioning during late childhood and early adolescence successfully predicted children with 22q11DS who were at highest risk for persistent psychiatric illness in young adulthood. These findings emphasize the critical importance of early assessments and interventions in youth with 22q11DS.

AB Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder frequently experience social communication difficulties, executive functioning deficits, and anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are similar to the symptoms and correlates of sluggish cognitive tempo. Although sluggish cognitive tempo is related to, but distinct from, the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that commonly co-occur with autism spectrum disorder, few studies have examined sluggish cognitive tempo in autism spectrum disorder. We examined whether sluggish cognitive tempo and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were differentially associated with autism symptomatology, daily life executive functioning, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 51 adolescents (ages 13-18 years) with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Regression analyses controlling for age and IQ showed that sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms, but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, were associated with increased autism symptomatology and internalizing symptoms. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, but not sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms, were associated with increased externalizing behaviors and behavior regulation deficits. Both sluggish cognitive tempo and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were independently associated with increased metacognitive deficits. This study provides preliminary evidence that sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms are elevated in autism spectrum disorder and associated with key clinical correlates, with implications for the assessment and treatment in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.

AB Objective Bullying and its potential consequence for poor mental health constitutes a public health concern, yet there is a dearth of longitudinal studies examining the topic. This study examines the temporal relationship between childhood bullying behaviours (being a victim, being a bully, or being a bully and a victim) and physician-diagnosed internalizing disorders over a 7-year timespan.
   Methods Data from the 2003 Children's Lifestyle and School performance Study (CLASS), a population-based health survey of grade 5 students in Nova Scotia, Canada were linked to administrative health-care records to examine the relationship between bullying behaviours and services where a physician diagnosis of an internalizing disorder (ID) was received. Negative binomial regression analyses were conducted to examine this relationship.
   Results Of the 4694 participants, 33.3% reported being involved in some form of bullying behaviour and 24.1% had a service where a physician diagnosis of ID was given over a 7-year timespan. Compared with children who reported not being involved in bullying behaviours, children who reported being a victim of bullying had a higher rate of subsequent physician-diagnosed ID services (IRR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.70). Children who reported being a bully had a lower rate of ID services (IRR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.99), while there was no difference for those who reported between being a bully and a victim (bully-victim) with respect to ID services.
   Conclusion Bullying behaviours should be considered a serious public health issue due to their high prevalence in school environments and detrimental effects on the mental health of adolescents.

AB The present study reported an exploration of the association between covitality constructs and psychological adjustment-subjective wellbeing, academic achievement, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems-in adolescents. Participants of the study comprised of 547 adolescents, with 51.1% female and 48.9% male, ranging in age from 13 to 19 years (M = 15.57, SD = 1.13). Findings from the study indicated that higher levels of belief-in-others and engaged living were significant predictors of increased subjective wellbeing. Higher levels of belief-in-self, belief-in-others, and engaged living were also found the significant predictors of increased academic achievement. Thereafter, results from the predictive effect of covitality constructs on mental health problems revealed that higher levels of belief-in-self, belief-in-others, and engaged living were significant predictors of decreased internalizing behavior problems, whereas externalizing behavior problems were significantly predicted by belief-in-self and emotional competence in adolescents. What is more, the combined effect of each of the covitality constructs on adolescents' psychological adjustment indicators was greater than the effect of this each positive psychological domain individually. Taken together, these outcomes should contribute to the design of prevention and intervention services in order to promote mental health and wellbeing.

AB Guided by the ecological "technosystem," data was examined from 13,156 adolescents completing the CDC's 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) looking for associations between television, social media, depressive symptoms, suicidality, and sexual risk behaviors. Regression results indicate media use is not an important factor in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Social media and television are unlikely the contributors to both mental health and risky sexual behaviors. Findings from this research are important for future studies that focus on multi-systemic prevention and intervention efforts aimed at promoting adolescent resiliency, particularly among vulnerable youth who are most susceptible to media influences.

AB Children in family foster care have been disproportionately exposed to traumatic experiences, which contribute to the problems and specific needs they experience. Despite the growing interest in the stories of children in foster care, only a few studies have focused on their lived experiences regarding traumatic events and the resulting impact. The aim of this study was therefore to ask youth themselves how they experience the impact of traumas prior to living in a foster family. Episodic narrative interviews were conducted with 13 youth aged 15-23 (formerly) residing in family foster care in the Netherlands. The interviews were subjected to open coding and organized in themes and sub-themes using thematic analysis. The impact youth experienced from traumas in the past could be grouped in three themes: the experience of emotional and social problems (such as internalizing problems, anger, and loss of bonds), specific strategies to cope with trauma (avoidance, looking for answers, preserving sameness), and not always experiencing impact. The results highlight the clinical problems youth experience, related to posttraumatic stress symptoms and complex trauma. However, youth also indicate strategies they employ to cope with this impact. Interventions for children in foster care with complex trauma should be tailored to the interconnectedness of complex trauma and attachment, and stimulate children's helpful coping strategies.

AB Maltreatment increases risk for psychopathology in childhood and adulthood, thus identifying mechanisms that influence these associations is necessary for future prevention and intervention. Emotion dysregulation resulting from maltreatment is one potentially powerful mechanism explaining risk for psychopathology. This study tests a conceptual model that distinguishes deprivation and threat as distinct forms of exposure with different pathways to psychopathology. Here we operationalize threat as exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse and deprivation as exposure to neglect. We test the hypothesis that threat and deprivation differentially predict use of avoidant strategies and total regulation. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN study; N = 866), which followed high-risk children from age 4 to 18. At age 6, children and their parents reported on adversity exposure. Case records documented exposure to abuse and neglect. At 18, adolescents reported on regulation strategies and psychopathology. Regression analyses indicated that greater exposure to threat, but not deprivation, predicted greater use of avoidant strategies in adolescence. Moreover, avoidance partially mediated the longitudinal association between exposure to threat in early childhood and symptoms of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence. Results suggest that abuse and neglect differentially predict regulation strategy use and that regulation strategy use predicts psychopathology.

AB Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased risk for most forms of psychopathology. We examine emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking maltreatment with general psychopathology. A sample of 262 children and adolescents participated; 162 (61.8%) experienced abuse or exposure to domestic violence. We assessed four emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal, attention bias to threat, expressive suppression, and rumination) and emotional reactivity. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed concurrently and at a 2-year longitudinal follow-up. A general psychopathology factor (p factor), representing co-occurrence of psychopathology symptoms across multiple internalizing and externalizing domains, was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis. Maltreatment was associated with heightened emotional reactivity and greater use of expressive suppression and rumination. The association of maltreatment with attention bias varied across development, with maltreated children exhibiting a bias toward threat and adolescents a bias away from threat. Greater emotional reactivity and engagement in rumination mediated the longitudinal association between maltreatment and increased general psychopathology over time. Emotion dysregulation following childhood maltreatment occurs at multiple stages of the emotion generation process, in some cases varies across development, and serves as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking child maltreatment with general psychopathology.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with pervasive social deficits as well as marked emotion dysregulation across the life span. Decreased social motivation accounts in part for social difficulties, but factors moderating its influence are not fully understood. In this paper, we (a) characterize social and emotional functioning among children and adolescents with ASD, (b) explore contributions of social motivation and emotion dysregulation to social skill, and (c) consider biological sex and intellectual functioning as moderators of these associations. In a sample of 2,079 children and adolescents with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection, we document direct effects of social motivation, internalizing symptoms, aggression, attention problems, irritability, and self-injurious behavior on children's social skills. Furthermore, dysregulation in several domains moderated the association between social motivation and social skill, suggesting a blunting effect on social motivation in the context of emotional difficulties. Moreover, when considering only individuals with intellectual skills in the average range or higher, biological sex further moderated these associations. Findings add to our understanding of social-emotional processes in ASD, suggest emotion dysregulation as a target of intervention in the service of social skill improvements, and build on efforts to understand sources of individual difference that contribute to heterogeneity among individuals with ASD.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation can take many forms, including increased sensitivity to emotional cues and habitual use of maladaptive cognitive or behavioral regulation strategies. Despite extensive research on emotion regulation and youth adjustment, few studies integrate multiple measures of emotion regulation. The present study evaluated the underlying structure of emotion regulation processes in adolescence using both task- and survey-based measures and determined whether differences in these emotion regulation latent factors mediated the association between peer victimization and internalizing psychopathology. Adolescents aged 16-17 years (n = 287; 55% female; 42% White) recruited in three urban centers in the United States completed baseline and follow-up assessments 4 months apart. Three models of emotion regulation were evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor model fit the data best, including cognitive regulation, behavioral regulation, and emotional reactivity latent factors. Task-based measures did not load onto these latent factors. Difficulties with behavioral regulation mediated the association between peer victimization and depression symptoms, whereas cognitive regulation difficulties mediated the association with anxiety symptoms. Findings point to potential targets for intervention efforts to reduce risk for internalizing problems in adolescents following experiences of peer victimization.

AB While child poverty is a significant risk factor for poor mental health, the developmental pathways involved with these associations are poorly understood. To advance knowledge about these important linkages, the present study examined the developmental sequelae of childhood exposure to poverty in a multiyear longitudinal study. Here, we focused on exposure to poverty, neurobiological circuitry connected to emotion dysregulation, later exposure to stressful life events, and symptoms of psychopathology. We grounded our work in a biopsychosocial perspective, with a specific interest in "stress sensitization" and emotion dysregulation. Motivated by past work, we first tested whether exposure to poverty was related to changes in the resting-state coupling between two brain structures centrally involved with emotion processing and regulation (the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; vmPFC). As predicted, we found lower household income at age 10 was related to lower resting-state coupling between these areas at age 15. We then tested if variations in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity interacted with more contemporaneous stressors to predict challenges with mental health at age 16. In line with past reports showing risk for poor mental health is greatest in those exposed to early and then later, more contemporaneous stress, we predicted and found that lower vmPFC-amygdala coupling in the context of greater contemporaneous stress was related to higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. We believe these important interactions between neurobiology and life history are an additional vantage point for understanding risk and resiliency, and suggest avenues for prediction of psychopathology related to early life challenge.

AB Exposure to threat increases the risk for internalizing problems in adolescence. Deficits in integrating bodily cues into representations of emotion are thought to contribute to internalizing problems. Given the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating bodily responses and integrating them into representations of emotional states, coordination between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and autonomic nervous system responses may be influenced by past threat exposure with consequences for the emergence of internalizing problems. A sample of 179 Mexican-origin adolescents (88 female) reported on neighborhood and school crime, peer victimization, and discrimination when they were 10-16 years old. At age 17, participants underwent a functional neuroimaging scan during which they viewed pictures of emotional faces while respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses were measured. Adolescents also reported symptoms of internalizing problems. Greater exposure to threats across adolescence was associated with more internalizing problems. Threat exposure was also associated with stronger negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and RSA. Stronger negative ventromedial prefrontal cortex-RSA coupling was associated with fewer internalizing problems. These results suggest the degree of coordinated activity between the brain and parasympathetic nervous system is both enhanced by threat experiences and decreased in adolescents with more internalizing problems.

AB The deleterious effects of marital conflict on youth outcomes are well-documented in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. To date, longitudinal studies have focused on repeated measures of youths' outcomes and the temporal dynamics of marital conflict have largely been ignored. Marital conflict changes over time as contextual and relationship characteristics change, and these patterns of change may provide unique predictive power in accounting for differences in youth outcomes. This study provides a novel exploration of an old idea by focusing on dynamic patterns of marital conflict in predicting trajectories of adolescents' adjustment. All variables were measured at ages 16, 17, and 18 with 252 adolescents (53% female) enrolled in the longitudinal Family Stress and Youth Development Study. Latent growth curve models with latent variable interactions were used to determine whether marital conflict at age 16 (intercept), change over time in marital conflict (slope), and the intercept-slope interaction predicted change over time in adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms and levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 18. Youth exposed to high and increasing levels of marital conflict reported high and stable levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Adolescents exposed to low and decreasing levels of marital conflict had consistently fewer symptoms. Furthermore, exposure to initially low but increasing levels of marital conflict was associated with increases in problems across adolescence, which contrasted with findings for youth with initially high marital conflict exposure that decreased over time. Findings are discussed in relation to both conceptual and methodological advances.

AB Background A better understanding of the individual difficulties reported by adolescents presenting with anorexia nervosa seems like an interesting avenue to refine our understanding of their psychological functioning.
   Objective This study aimed to: (1) describe the behavioral and affective profile of difficulties of inpatient adolescent girls presenting a restricting type of anorexia (ANR); and (2) investigate the presence of a relationship between behavioral and affective problems and severity of the disorder.
   Methods The sample consisted of 52 inpatient adolescent girls presenting an ANR. The youth self report assessed the behavioral and emotional profile of difficulties of participants while the Eating Disorder Risk Composite of the Eating Disorder Inventory measured the symptomatology of the disorder. A ratio between body mass index at admission and at the end of the treatment served as an indicator of weight gain.
   Results The sample presented an internalized profile of problems. Individual differences were found and three profiles of difficulties were present in the sample: normative, pure internalizing and mixed (clinical on the internalizing and externalizing clusters).
   Conclusion This study provides information on the heterogeneity of this specific population otherwise quite similar and demonstrates how severity of the disorder can be associated with a wide range of other behavioral and affective difficulties.

AB This study investigated internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and polydrug use among African-American youth residing in high-poverty neighborhoods, and tested the potential protective effects of religiosity, parental monitoring, and neighborhood collective efficacy on life stress and behavioral health outcomes (N=576; 307 females; Mage=16years, SD=1.44years). A cumulative risk index reflected the combined effects of past year exposure to stressful life events, racial discrimination, and exposure to violence along with poor neighborhood ecology. Structural equation modeling revealed that cumulative risk significantly predicted internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and polydrug use. Interaction tests showed that the association of cumulative risk with internalizing problems was buffered by adolescent religiosity and neighborhood collective efficacy. The association of cumulative risk with externalizing problems was buffered by parental monitoring and collective efficacy. Adolescent sex further moderated these effects. The findings of the present study collectively highlight potential for protective factors to buffer effects of cumulative risk on behavioral health outcomes among youth residing in high-risk neighborhoods.

AB A randomized, 13-weeks, placebo-controlled double-blind study in 125 subjects aged 2-17.5years with Autism Spectrum Disorder or Smith-Magenis syndrome and insomnia demonstrated efficacy and safety of easily-swallowed prolonged-release melatonin mini-tablets (PedPRM; 2-5mg) in improving sleep duration and onset. Treatment effects on child behavior and caregiver's quality of life were evaluated. PedPRM treatment resulted in significant improvement in externalizing but not internalizing behavior (Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire; SDQ) compared to placebo (p=0.021) with clinically-relevant improvements in 53.7% of PedPRM-treated versus 27.6% of placebo-treated subjects (p=0.008). Caregivers' quality of life also improved with PedPRM versus placebo (p=0.010) and correlated with the change in total SDQ (p=0.0005). PedPRM alleviates insomnia-related difficulties, particularly externalizing behavior in the children, subsequently improving caregivers' quality of life.

AB Background The co-occurrence of internalizing disorders is a common form of psychiatric comorbidity, raising questions about the boundaries between these diagnostic categories. We employ network psychometrics in order to: (a) determine whether internalizing symptoms cluster in a manner reflecting DSM diagnostic criteria, (b) gauge how distinct these diagnostic clusters are and (c) examine whether this network structure changes from childhood to early and then late adolescence. Method Symptom-level data were obtained for service users in publicly funded mental health services in England between 2011 and 2015 (N = 37,162). A symptom network (i.e. Gaussian graphical model) was estimated, and a community detection algorithm was used to explore the clustering of symptoms. Results The estimated network was densely connected and characterized by a multitude of weak associations between symptoms. Six communities of symptoms were identified; however, they were weakly demarcated. Two of these communities corresponded to social phobia and panic disorder, and four did not clearly correspond with DSM diagnostic categories. The network structure was largely consistent by sex and across three age groups (8-11, 12-14 and 15-18 years). Symptom connectivity in the two older age groups was significantly greater compared to the youngest group and there were differences in centrality across the age groups, highlighting the age-specific relevance of certain symptoms. Conclusions These findings clearly demonstrate the interconnected nature of internalizing symptoms, challenging the view that such pathology takes the form of distinct disorders.

AB Despite the salience of the social media context to psychosocial development, little is known about social media use patterns and how they relate to psychological and social functioning over time during early adolescence. This longitudinal study, therefore, identified subgroups of early adolescents based on their social media use and examined whether these subgroups predicted psychosocial functioning. Adolescents (N=1205; 11-14 years; 51% female; 51% white) completed surveys at baseline and a six-month follow-up. There were three social media use subgroups at baseline: high overall social media use (8%); high Instagram/Snapchat use (53%); and low overall social media use (39%). The high social media use subgroup predicted higher depressive symptoms, panic disorder symptoms, delinquent behaviors, family conflict, as well as lower family and friend support, than the High-Instagram/Snapchat and low social media use subgroups. The high Instagram/Snapchat use subgroup predicted higher delinquent behaviors and school avoidance than the low social media use subgroup, but also higher close friendship competence and friend support as compared to both the high social media use and low social media use subgroups. Social media use patterns appear to differentially predict psychosocial adjustment during early adolescence, with high social media use being the most problematic and patterns of high Instagram/Snapchat use and low social media use having distinct developmental tradeoffs.

AB Youth's responses to stress are a central feature of risk and resilience across development. The current study examined whether youth coping and stress reactivity moderate the association of current maternal depressive symptoms with youth's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Mothers (M-age=41.58, SD=6.18) with a wide range of depressive symptoms and their children ages 9-15 (M-age=12.25, SD=1.89, 45.3% girls) completed measures of youth symptoms and coping and automatic responses to stress. Mothers also completed a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Youth's primary and secondary control coping, stress reactivity, and involuntary disengagement moderated the association between current maternal depressive symptoms and youth symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with youth's internalizing and externalizing symptoms when youth used low as opposed to high levels of primary and secondary control coping. Conversely, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with youth symptoms for youth with high levels of stress reactivity and involuntary disengagement. The findings suggest interventions focused on improving the use of primary and secondary control coping skills and reducing reactivity and involuntary disengagement to stress may benefit youth with mothers who are experiencing high levels of depressive symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND Turn 2 Us (T2U) is an elementary school-based mental health promotion and prevention program in New York City. It targets fourth- and fifth-grade students at risk for social/emotional and behavioral problems and provides a range of services to students, staff, and parents. The purpose of this study is to determine if T2U decreases internalizing and externalizing behaviors in participating students. METHODS Teachers measured students' symptoms before and after participation using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Change in the total SDQ score was analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric testing. We assessed the effects of covariates on the score change with linear regression models. RESULTS The 185 unique students who participated in the intervention showed a significant improvement in total SDQ score (Z = -4.107, p < .001). Students who were at higher risk prior to the intervention showed greatest improvement in behaviors. None of the covariates assessed affected the change in SDQ score. Regression models showed that higher initial SDQ scores predicted higher post-intervention SDQ scores (beta = 0.681, p < .001). CONCLUSION T2U significantly decreased internalizing and externalizing behaviors in participating students, with the greatest impact for highest risk students. This study helps validate T2U's unique and comprehensive approach.

AB Although global associations between language and behavioral development are well established, relations among components and subgroups within these disorders remain unclear. The primary aim of this study was to explore whether language components differed by behavioral subtypes: internalizing only, externalizing only, or both. To control for confounding factors identified in prior studies related to sampling and measurement, we conducted profile analyses of receptive, expressive, pragmatic, semantic, syntactic, or higher order language skills in 46 boys with emotional disturbance (ED) using one comprehensive language measure. On average, the internalizing-only group outperformed all other behavioral subgroups. Absence of interaction effects indicated similar patterns of performance, with all groups performing lowest in pragmatic language. We also report prevalence rates of language deficits in the sample and analyze results using two different grouping strategies. Discussion includes the importance of considering comorbidity and establishing independent behavioral subgroups in research, as well as implications for assessment and intervention in practice.

AB Risky sexual behavior is more prevalent in emerging adult populations and emerging adults engaging in risky sexual behavior also may be experiencing higher levels of internalizing problems. Parents and their relationships with their children maintain relevance in emerging adulthood and may decrease negative outcomes. Thus, the current study examined whether parent-child relationship quality decreased the likelihood of risky sexual behavior via internalizing problems and examined gender dyads between parents and children. Participants included 502 emerging adults (172 males and 330 females) ranging in age from 18 to 25 years. Structural equation modeling analyses were conducted and indicated that internalizing problems mediated the relationship between parent (both paternal and maternal)-child relationship quality and risky sexual behavior for both males and females. Maternal-child relationship quality predicted lower internalizing problems more strongly for males than for females, suggesting moderated mediation. Thus, both mothers' and fathers' relationship with their children may affect risky sexual behavior indirectly via internalizing problems.

AB The aim of this study was to predict alcohol inebriation and mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems plus well-being), and potential gender-specific patterns among young adolescents, by a biopsychosocial model of personality traits. Self-reported data from 853 adolescents (479 girls) in Sweden, aged 13-15 years, from the Longitudinal Research on Development In Adolescence (LoRDIA) program were used. Predictions from personality to inebriation and mediating effects of mental health were estimated by means of logistic regression and generalized structural equation modelling. Separated gender analyses were performed throughout the study to reveal potential gender-specific patterns. Externalizing problems, Novelty Seeking and Cooperativeness had independent effects on alcohol inebriation for both genders as well as Harm Avoidance among girls and Internalizing problems among boys. Novelty Seeking and Self-Directedness had indirect effects through externalizing problems and Harm Avoidance and Self-Directedness had indirect effects through internalizing problems for boys. Self-directedness showed an indirect effect through externalizing problems for girls. The combination of an immature character (low Self-directedness and Cooperativeness) with an extreme temperament profile (high Novelty Seeking and low Harm Avoidance) was a predictor of inebriation across gender, both directly and indirectly through mental health. This study contributes with valuable information about gender-specific considerations when developing and conducting preventative interventions targeting psychological risk and resilience factors for early alcohol inebriation among young adolescents.

AB This study aimed to determine the relationship between latent classes of adverse childhood experience (ACEs) and internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression) among US children. The 2016 National Survey of Children's Health data for children aged 6-17 was used. Latent class analysis was performed to identify distinct sub-types of ACE exposures and survey-weighted logistic regression models were employed to determine whether these classes were associated with any or comorbid childhood internalizing disorders, after controlling for meaningful covariates. Four latent classes were identified: income hardship, divorce, mental health or substance abuse exposure, and high ACEs overall. Children in three of the four classes were significantly more likely to have any childhood internalizing disorder when compared to children reporting no ACEs, while children in all classes were significantly more likely to have a comorbid history of anxiety and depression. Thus, children exposed to ACEs should receive necessary mental health screenings and treatments.

AB Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has often been characterized as an internalizing disorder, some children with OCD exhibit externalizing behaviors that are specific to their OCD. This study sought to demonstrate that parents perceive both internalizing and externalizing behaviors in childhood OCD by examining the factor structure of the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Externalizing/Internalizing Scale (COCEIS), a parent-report questionnaire intended to measure these constructs. This study also investigated clinical correlates of internalizing and externalizing factors in the COCEIS. A factor analysis of questionnaire responses from 122 parents of youth with OCD revealed both externalizing and internalizing factors in the COCEIS. Externalizing behaviors in childhood OCD were associated with other, co-occurring externalizing behavior problems, while both factors were positively correlated with OCD severity and co-occurring internalizing symptoms. They were positively associated with each other at a trend level, and neither showed a significant relationship with insight. Sixty-two percent of parents endorsed often or always to at least one externalizing item, though modal responses to items suggested that each individual feature captured by the COCEIS may be relatively uncommon. Mean responses were significantly greater for internalizing items. This study provides evidence for distinct but related externalizing and internalizing behaviors specific to childhood OCD. Treatment for children with OCD presenting with more externalizing behaviors may require a greater emphasis on behavioralparent training and motivational enhancement.

AB The purpose of the study was to analyze the connections between victimization and perpetration of face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying with self-perceived childhood stress and diverse emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) evaluated by parents. Participants were 1,993 students, aged 9-13 years, from the Basque Country (Spain) (49.8% females). The results of the analyses of variance (MANOVA-AN OVA) and correlational analyses showed that: (1) students who had higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had significantly high levels of stress and many EBPs; (2) participants who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization and perpetration of bullying obtained higher scores in all the dimensions of stress, while those who had higher scores in cyberaggression only showed higher school stress; (3) students who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization manifested internalizing and externalizing EBPs, whereas those who had higher scores in perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had fewer internalizing problems; and (4) children who obtained higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had received psychological counseling significantly more frequently in the past year than those who had lower scores in indicators of bullying/cyberbullying.

AB Current research supports a relationship between parenting style and children's mental health, yet this has been understudied in emerging adults. Moreover, even less research has included the role of parent-child relationship quality on these existing relationships, which has been demonstrated to be an important moderator, Thus, the current study examined the moderating effect of parent-child relationship quality on parenting style and emerging adult internalizing and externalizing problems. It was expected that higher parent-child relationship quality would buffer against negative effects of less adaptive parenting styles on emerging adult psychological problems. Participants included 2732 emerging adults attending college who reported on their own psychological problems, perceived parenting style, and parent-child relationship quality for both mothers and fathers. Results indicated that the lowest rates of emerging adult internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with higher parent-child relationship quality in same-sex parent-child dyads within the context of authoritative parenting. Higher quality father-daughter relationship was protective against the negative effects of permissive parenting style as evidenced by lower reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results emphasize the continuing influence of parenting style and parent-child relationship quality on emerging adult mental health, particularly for daughters.

AB To examine the contributions of maternal and paternal age on offspring externalizing and internalizing problems, this study analyzed problem behaviors at age 10-12 years from four Dutch population-based cohorts (N = 32,892) by a multiple informant design. Bayesian evidence synthesis was used to combine results across cohorts with 50% of the data analyzed for discovery and 50% for confirmation. There was evidence of a robust negative linear relation between parental age and externalizing problems as reported by parents. In teacher-reports, this relation was largely explained by parental socio-economic status. Parental age had limited to no association with internalizing problems. Thus, in this large population-based study, either a beneficial or no effect of advanced parenthood on child problem behavior was observed.

AB Parental involvement (PI) in their children's schools has been shown to have a positive influence on the children's behaviours and academic achievement. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of PI and relations of PI in schools to child externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Data were from the fifth-grade wave of the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, with 1354 fifth grade low-income children and parents. Results revealed that family conflict predicted child internalizing and externalizing and negatively predicted PI in schools. However, PI in schools partially reduced the negative effect of family conflict on both internalizing and externalizing. Parental warmth negatively predicted child externalizing behaviours, and positively predicted PI in school. Additionally, PI in schools further enhanced the positive effect of parental warmth in reducing externalizing behaviours. The study highlights home and parent characteristics that relate to low-income fifth-grade parents' involvement in their child's education and demonstrates the mediating role of PI in reducing behavioural problems of low-income children.

AB Research suggests major mental disorders co-occur at higher than chance levels. In adult samples, a two factor structure emerges when modeling the higher order structure of psychopathology. Specifically, disorders tend to co-aggregate into two dimensions: Internalizing (depression and anxiety) and Externalizing (acting out, impulsive, and addictive) disorders. Despite this large body of evidence, few studies have integrated problem gambling into this overall model. We used confirmatory factor analysis to model how the symptom count of gambling fits into the structure of psychopathology in a large, community based young adult twin sample of men and women (age 24; N = 1329). Twins were assessed via in-person, structured diagnostic interviews on disorders including: Major Depression, Phobias, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Anxiety Disorders (internalizing) and Substance Use Disorders, Gambling Problems (self-report), and Antisocial Behaviors (externalizing). The data were fit to a two-factor structure, with gambling symptoms loading most highly on externalizing, rather than internalizing. The problem gambling loadings did not differ by sex. Implications of these findings suggest that during emerging adulthood gambling problems are best classified and conceptualized in the realm of externalizing disorders for both males and females. Results also suggest prevention and intervention efforts be aimed at young adults who exhibit commonly co-occurring psychopathology.

AB Despite an emphasis on coping following childhood sexual abuse (CSA) to reduce trauma-related symptoms, very few studies have researched the associations between sexually abused children's coping and trauma-related difficulties, and perceived coping efficacy has been largely overlooked. The current study investigated whether children's use and perceived efficacy of avoidant, internalized, angry, and active/social coping strategies were associated with caregiver- and child-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms among 202 sexually abused children (8-12 years; M = 10.47 years, SD = 1.70 years). Children reported using approximately eight types of coping strategies (M = 8.29, SD =2.50). Regression models indicated that internalized and angry coping were associated with child-reported PTSS. In contrast to expectations, none of the types of coping strategies were linked with caregiver's reports of PTSS or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interestingly, perceived efficacy of coping was largely unrelated to symptoms, with only perceived efficacy of avoidant coping inversely related to child-reported PTSS. Perceived efficacy was not tied to caregiver's reports of children's symptoms. Coping strategies may be associated with children's, but not caregiver's, reports of children's trauma-related difficulties. Furthermore, perceived efficacy of coping strategies may also be largely unrelated to children's symptoms, or children may have limited insight regarding the efficacy of their coping strategies. To further inform trauma-focused interventions that support effective long-term coping, future research should investigate which coping strategies children perceive to be efficacious, as well as potential reasons why.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) provides valid and well-established measures of emotional, behavioral, and social problems in children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to verify whether emotional, behavioral, and social problems were modulated by ASD symptom severity, cognitive development, gender, and age by analyzing the CBCL in a large group of children and adolescents with ASD. The results show that around 30% of participants with ASD exhibited internalizing problems and only 6% externalizing problems, with males exhibiting more internalizing problems than females. No correlation was found between CBCL scores and indices of ASD severity. However, higher CBCL Total Problems scores were found in older children and in children with lower cognitive abilities. The detection of behavioral and emotional problems allows children with ASD to undergo specific and individualized treatment that takes into account their psychopathological problems.

AB Longitudinal studies of the long-term psychological impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) on parents and their children have been limited. The current study aimed to monitor parents' post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and behavioral problems among their children over time and to analyze their long-term associations among the survivors of the GEJE. We used data from the GEJE Follow-up for Children study, which recruited 4- to 6-year-old children and those children's parents immediately after the GEJE in March 2011, with ongoing follow-up. Children's total, internalizing, and externalizing behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and parental probable PTSD was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-R (IES-R), in 2012 (baseline) and 2014 (follow-up). Parental PTSD symptoms and children's behavioral problems declined slightly over time, and both showed a significant correlation between the surveys (r = 0.55-0.77, P < 0.001). The association between parental PTSD symptoms and children's behavioral problems was investigated using multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for baseline children's behavioral problems and other potential confounders. Cross-sectionally, while no significant association was detected in 2012, all types of children's behavioral problems exhibited significant positive associations with parental PTSD symptoms in multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.03, 3.30, and 5.34 for total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems, respectively. Maternal educational attainment level (higher than high school education) showed a significant negative association with children's total and externalizing behavioral problems (AOR = 0.30 and 0.13, respectively) in 2014. Longitudinally, parental PTSD symptoms in 2012 showed a significant association with children's internalizing behavioral problems in 2014 after adjusting for children's behavioral problems in 2012 and parental PTSD symptoms in 2014 (AOR = 4.62). These results suggest that the effect of the GEJE on parental PTSD symptoms and children's behavioral problems was long-term, lasting for at least 3 years. These possibilities should be carefully considered in mental health support for parents and their offspring in areas affected by the GEJE.

AB The overarching aim of this study was to develop and validate a new scale (i.e., the Praise, Indulgence, and Status Parenting Scale [PISPS]) to measure modern parenting practices and behaviors consistent with instilling ideals of specialness (i.e., the notion that one is special), self-esteem, and status in children. In 2 studies on emerging adults (Study 1: N = 582, M-age = 19.46; Study 2: N = 464, M-age = 19.58), the PISPS was developed and validated using classical test theory (Study 1) and further refined using item-response theory (Study 2). Results from both studies indicated a 3-factor structure with factors differentially linked with correlates of interest including parenting strategies, self-esteem, narcissism, entitlement, and internalizing symptoms. Study 3 further validated the PISPS in a sample of parents (N = 638, M-age = 35.79) reporting on their parenting and their child's emotion regulation and symptoms of psychopathology. Overall, findings support the PISPS, its psychometric properties, and its unique contribution to child symptoms.

AB Current literature has documented the detrimental effects of cyberbullying which include a range of internalizing and externalizing problems for those involved. Although critical, this research can sometimes ignore social-ecological aspects of a child's life that can potentially 'buffer' the negative psychological effects of such involvement. With this in mind, this cross-sectional investigation of 12-16 year olds [M(SD): 13.5(1) years] in Ireland focused on the role of friendship quality and gender in association with cyberbullying involvement and psychological well-being (N = 2410). The Cyberbullying and Online Aggression Scale was used to measure cyber perpetration and victimization. A modified version of the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire was included to investigate peer friendship quality. Finally, the Moods and Feeling Questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were chosen to provide a measurement of psychological well-being. Prevalence rates for various types of cyberbullying roles (cyber bullies, victims and bully/victims) are presented, as well as differences for psychological well-being, friendship quality and cyberbullying involvement. In addition, regression models were used to determine the associations between gender, age, friendship quality and involvement in cyberbullying with psychological well-being. The results are considered in terms of the current literature and directions for future research are suggested.

AB Background and Objectives: Super Skills for Life (SSL) is a transdiagnostic protocol based on cognitive-behavioral therapy designed for children with internalizing problems. The present study examined for the first time the impact of the Spanish-adapted version of SSL in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in Spanish-speaking children. Design: A quasi-experimental design with one group, pre- and posttest, and 1-year follow-up was conducted. Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Methods: Participants were 119 children (42.9% female; 8-12 years) recruited from nine schools. Children completed assessments of anxiety, depression, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and the extent to which anxiety interfered with life before and after receiving the 8-session SSL, and 12-months post-intervention. Results: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly reduced at post-test and 12-month follow-up assessments. SSL also had positive impact on other symptoms assessed (e.g., interference of anxiety with children's life, peer problems, conduct problems). Overall, the long-term benefits of SSL appeared to be greater than the short-term benefits. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that SSL may be useful in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and a broad range of other issues, in Spanish children.

AB Adolescence is a time of unique sensitivity to socially salient stimuli such as social rewards. This period overlaps with the onset of psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In the current studies, we examined behavioral and neural patterns of dysregulation to social rewards and threats, and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths. In study 1, we used a social Go/NoGo cognitive control task using peer faces to test for age-related behavioral differences in inhibitory failures in adolescents (N = 53, M-age = 13.37 years), and adults (N = 51, M-age = 43.71 years). In study 2, an independent adolescent sample (N = 51, M-age = 13.98 years) completed a similar social Go/NoGo cognitive control task during fMRI. Results show that adolescents had greater inhibitory failures - as measured by false alarm rate - to both social reward and threat cues than adults, and more so to social reward than threat cues. Greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues were associated with greater internalizing symptoms, but were not significantly related to externalizing symptoms. At the neural level, greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues as well as greater internalizing symptoms were both associated with heightened amygdala-ventral striatum connectivity. Our findings indicate that subcortico-subcortical connectivity, which is deemed to occur chronologically earlier and thus necessary for subcortico-cortical circuits, may serve as an early biomarker for emotion dysregulation and a risk factor for internalizing symptoms.

AB Objectives Childhood psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) increase risk for concurrent and future psychiatric disorders but are common in the population. Strategies are needed to identify vulnerable individuals who may benefit from monitoring or targeted intervention. This study aimed to delineate profiles of childhood PLEs that might be differentially associated with other psychopathologies, and multiple psychopathology. Design Cross-sectional, online self-report survey. Methods Participants were 27,000 Australian children from a population cohort (13,416 girls; mean age 11.91 years) who completed an online self-report questionnaire assessing PLEs (hallucinations and delusions) and Emotional, Peer Relationship, Conduct, and Hyperactivity-Inattention psychopathology. Latent class analysis differentiated classes of children showing different patterns of PLE responses, and multinomial logistic regression determined the association between the PLE classes and the various psychopathologies, adjusted for demographic covariates and the other psychopathologies. Results Five latent profiles of PLE responses were characterized as follows: None (27.4% of children), Minor (29.7%), Moderate (11.8%), Hallucinatory (21.0%), and Strong (10.2%). These classes showed distinct associations with other psychopathologies (odds ratios between 1.27 and 4.58), and dose-response relationships indicated increasing likelihood of multiple psychopathology for the Hallucinatory and Strong classes (odds ratio = 21.87 for >= 3 psychopathologies in the Strong class). Conclusions Tailored interventions that address the particular needs of these different classes of individuals may be warranted. Practitioner points
   Children aged 11-12 years who report psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) can be classified into five different PLE profiles based on self-reported questionnaire responses, which may reflect different pathological processes. These PLE profiles show different patterns and magnitudes of increased risk for other types of psychopathology, and multiple psychopathology, suggesting that they present different treatment needs. Cross-sectional investigation of the associations between PLE profiles and other psychopathologies limits any conclusions as to the causal direction of these relationships. Multi-informant reports of psychopathology were unavailable.

AB Objective: This study explored manual-based personalized intervention for mothers of children with SLD and/or ADHD, as possibly contributing to (a) mothers' parenting-related emotional/coping resources, (b) family functioning, and (c) child adjustment, compared with a control group of mothers. Method: Participants were 73 mothers of a child formally diagnosed with SLD and/or ADHD ages 7-17. Mothers were assigned to an experimental (n=40) or control (n=33) group. Short-term intervention utilized a three-stage emotion-cognition-behavior model. Pre-post assessments included maternal affective resources (positive/negative affect, parenting stress), maternal coping resources (general coping strategies, coping specifically with diagnosed child's negative emotions), family cohesion/adaptability, and diagnosed child's externalizing/internalizing syndromes. Results: Significant interactions emerged between group (experimental/control) and time (pre/post) for most study variables. Conclusion: Findings clearly revealed the intervention's significant impact. Only the trained mothers demonstrated significant gains over time for most of the maternal, family, and child indices, whereas the untrained mothers did not.

AB Objective: Findings from extant studies of the relationship between ADHD-related emotion regulation and working memory deficits have been equivocal, and their correlational designs preclude inferences about the functional relationship between working memory demands and emotion regulation. This study aimed to experimentally examine the functional relationship between varying working memory demands and ADHD-related emotion regulation deficits. Method: Overt emotion regulation behaviors were coded while children with and without ADHD completed experimental tasks that manipulated low and high working memory demands. Results: Compared with typically developing children, children with ADHD exhibited large-magnitude overall emotion expression deficits, disproportionately greater self-criticism during high working memory conditions, and disproportionately greater positive emotion expression during low working memory demand conditions. Conclusion: These findings suggest that working memory demands are functionally related to emotion regulation deficits exhibited by children with ADHD and may explicate variability of emotion regulation difficulties related to environmental demands.

AB Background: We aimed to examine psychiatric symptoms in adults born preterm with very low birthweight or born at term small for gestational age compared with normal birthweight peers, and examine associations with perinatal factors and childhood motor and cognitive function.
   Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, one preterm born group with very low birthweight (VLBW: birthweight <= 1500g), one term-born Small for Gestational Age (SGA: birthweight <10th percentile) group and one term-born non-SGA control group, were assessed at 26 years of age. Primary outcomes were scores on self-reported questionnaires: Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment - Adult Self-Report, The Autism-Spectrum Quotient and Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Exposure variables were perinatal data, while childhood motor and cognitive function were examined as possible early markers.
   Results: Both the preterm VLBW and the term SGA group reported higher levels of attention, internalizing and externalizing problems compared to the control group. In addition, the VLBW participants reported more critical items and a higher proportion had intermediate level autistic traits, while the SGA participants reported more intrusive behavior. Increasing length of respiratory support and hospital stay in the neonatal period, and motor problems in early adolescence, were associated with adult psychiatric symptoms in the VLBW group.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric symptoms were frequent in the preterm VLBW group and also in the term-born SGA group. Those who were sickest as babies were most at risk. Motor problems can possibly serve as an early marker of adult psychiatric symptoms in low birthweight individuals.

AB Identifying factors that predict the maintenance of depression and loneliness in children is important for intervention design. Whilst emotional intelligence (EI) has been identified as a predictor of mental health, research examining how both trait and ability EI contribute to long-term patterns of symptomatology in children is markedly absent. We examined the impact of both TEI and AEI on the maintenance of loneliness and depressive symptoms over 1 year in children aged 9-11 years. Two hundred and thirteen children (54% male) completed the TEIQue-CF and the MSCEIT-YV at the first time point of the study, and the Child Depression Inventory and the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents at Time 1 and, again, 1 year later. Findings indicate that emotional skills (AEI) are important for predicting the maintenance of depressive symptoms and loneliness in children over 1 year; emotional self-competency (TEI) is less influential, only contributing to long-term loneliness in girls. Moreover, whilst deficiencies in the ability to perceive and understand emotions were predictive of prolonged symptomatology, so, too, were proficiencies in using emotion to facilitate thinking and emotion management. Those findings carry important implications for EI theory and future research. They also indicate that EI interventions tailored to groups of "at risk" school children may be useful for reducing specific profiles of internalizing symptoms. Programs targeting AEI skills may be universally helpful for reducing the likelihood that depressive symptoms and loneliness will be maintained over time in middle childhood; girls at risk for prolonged loneliness would additionally benefit from opportunities to bolster TEI.

AB Objective Research evidence suggests the need to identify treatments based on a more precise characterization of psychopathology and psychiatric comorbidity in anorexia nervosa. Network analysis provides a new method to conceptualize psychopathology. We use this approach to investigate the relationships between eating disorder and general psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Methods Four-hundred and five adolescents with anorexia nervosa and illness duration less than 3 years were consecutively recruited from those admitted to inpatient treatment. They completed the following questionnaires: the Eating Disorder Inventory-3, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the Youth Self Report. A network analysis was conducted, including eating psychopathology measures, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress problems. We employ a novel approach, the bridge function, to identify symptom clusters. Results Depression symptoms and personal alienation were the nodes with the highest centrality in the network, followed by asceticism, post-traumatic stress problems, drive to thinness, low self-esteem, and anxiety physical symptoms. Three symptom clusters (relative to eating disorder psychopathology, self-esteem problems, and internalizing difficulties) were identified. Depression symptoms, personal alienation, low self-esteem, and interoceptive deficits showed the highest bridge centrality. Besides eating disorder core symptoms, negative affect and internalizing symptoms seem to contribute to anorexia nervosa psychopathology independently from illness duration effects. Discussion These findings suggest that anorexia nervosa is characterized by a broad psychopathological spectrum rather than the mere eating disorder core symptoms, confirm the need to re-conceptualize psychiatric comorbidity in this disorder, and provide intriguing diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

AB Background: Internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems were frequently reported in profoundly hearing-impaired (HI) children with hearing aids. Due to the positive effect of cochlear implants (CIs) on hearing and language development, a positive effect on behavioral problems was expected. However, there is no consensus about the frequency of behavioral problems in CI children, and studies are often based on one informant with the risk of missing behavioral problems in other contexts.
   Aims: The first aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of behavioral problems in children with CIs as compared to a hearing normative sample. The second aim was to measure the agreement between the parents' and teachers' rates on the behavioral problem scales. And the third aim was to investigate the relation between speech perception, language skills and the frequencies of reported behavioral problems.
   Methods: Of 71 CI children, 51% were girls and 49% were boys, and the mean age was 8.6 (SD = 3.3). Behavior was reported by parents using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and by teachers using the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Frequencies of behavioral problems of CI children (6-16 years) were compared to a normative sample with the chi square test. Parent-teacher agreement was measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1). Next CI children were divided into four ability level categories regarding speech perception and language skills. Frequencies of behavioral problems were compared between the categories with the chi square test.
   Results: Parents and teachers of CI children reported similar frequencies of behavioral problems to the normative sample. Fair to low parent-teacher agreements were found on the behavioral problem scales. A significantly higher frequency of behavioral problems was reported in children with low speech perception and receptive vocabulary at school.
   Conclusion: Parents and teachers report similar frequencies of behavioral problems children with CIs compared to a hearing normative sample. Children with lower speech perception and language levels are more at risk of developing behavioral problems at school. Adequate speech perception and language levels are found to be protective factors for the development of behavior.

AB The current study investigated the relationship between gratitude, internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, along with the mediating roles of positive and negative coping styles therein. A sample of 589 Chinese adolescents completed the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), the Irritability, Depression, and Anxiety Scale (IDAS), and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Results of structural equation modeling showed that (1) the total effects of gratitude on both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were all significant and (2) both positive and negative coping styles mediated the links between gratitude and two types of problem behaviors. Thus, cultivating gratitude and developing adaptive coping style may help adolescents rectify problem behaviors.

AB Objectives Task characteristics can alter motivation. Understanding how individuals respond to these characteristics is important in understanding how to adapt tasks to increase engagement of individuals with mental health problems. We describe the development of a self-report questionnaire quantifying individual differences in task-related motivation-The Child and Adolescent Motivational Profile (CHAMP). We explore the association with externalizing/internalizing problems. Methods A 64-item prototype scale was designed to measure how children and adolescents perceive the motivational significance of a range of task characteristics (n = 688; age range: 8-16 years). Parents completed the "Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire" measuring externalizing and internalizing problems (Van Widenfelt, Goedhart, Treffers & Goodman, 2003). Results Exploratory factor analysis identified eight distinct task characteristics that affected motivation: (a) requiring focus, (b) predictable, (c) marked/graded, (d) rewarded, (e) socially evaluated, (f) cognitively challenging, (g) competitive, and (h) collaborative. A 32-item scale based on these factors was constructed. Internal consistency of each factor was high (Cronbach's alpha: .79-.91), and test-retest reliability was acceptable (SBC = .43-.65). Externalizing and internalizing problems were associated with a distinct motivational profile. Conclusion These results highlight the multidimensional nature of children and adolescents' task-related motivation for tasks and the differential links to internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Previous studies have established the relationship between behavioral problems and specific learning disorders (SLD); however, the exact mechanism by which behavioral disorders impact SLD remains unclear. This longitudinal study used the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to investigate how parents' judgment of children's behavioral problems changed from kindergarten to fifth grade in children diagnosed with or without specific learning disorders in reading and spelling (SLDrs) (N = 196). Growth component model analyses showed differential development of behavior problems between children with and without SLDrs. The groups did not differ before school entrance in externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior or any sub-scale of the CBCL. Parents reported their children with SLDrs as having higher overall levels of behavioral problems after school entrance, especially in first and fourth grade. Comorbid ADHD appears to be the explanatory factor of differential problem behavior ratings between children with and without SLDrs.

AB Dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions seem to play an important role in adjustment after traumatic experiences. However, little research has been done on maltreated children and adolescents. Furthermore, possible causal associations between cognitions, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing problems have rarely been investigated. In the current study, 263 maltreated children and adolescents (8-17 years of age) were assessed at baseline and again at time points 6 and either 12 or 18 months later. Cross-lagged panel analyses were used to gain a better understanding of the course of and associations among dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Ratings of all variables significantly decreased over time. Moderate to strong autoregressive paths emerged for all variables, denoting stability. Furthermore, the variables showed moderate to high correlations at every assessment. Posttraumatic stress symptoms moderately predicted dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions as well as internalizing and externalizing problems 6 months after baseline. Cross-lagged paths from the cognitions as well as from internalizing and externalizing problems to all other variables were not significant. Age, gender, and maltreatment characteristics did not play a relevant role in these cross-lagged associations when they were included as covariates. Our results underline the cognitive scar model, in which preceding posttraumatic stress symptoms adversely impact cognitions. Posttraumatic stress symptoms appear to be an important target for treatment as their reduction may help decrease internalizing and externalizing problems as well.

AB A large body of research has shown that exposure to community violence is common for many children across the world. However, less is known about exposure in particular subgroups such as those children with developmental disorders. To address this research gap, the aim of this study was to examine community violence exposure (CVE) in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and the role of gender in this association. Data were analyzed from 2,782 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years from Arkhangelsk, Russia that were collected during the Social and Health Assessment (SAHA). ADHD status was assessed with the hyperactivity/inattention scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Information was obtained on past-year witnessing and violence victimization in the community. Results showed that CVE was more prevalent in children with ADHD symptoms. Specifically, 75.1% of children with ADHD symptoms had been exposed to any violence versus 62.3% in the non-ADHD group (chi(2) = 18.65, p < .001). Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) revealed that CVE was significantly higher for adolescents with ADHD symptoms for both witnessing and victimization, while exposure was significantly higher for ADHD boys compared with girls. The findings of this study suggest that CVE may be elevated in adolescents with higher ADHD symptoms. Given that CVE has been associated with a variety of negative social and psychological outcomes in typically developing children, an important task for future research is to determine what factors are associated with CVE in adolescents with ADHD symptoms including those relating to such phenomena as comorbid psychopathology, the family, and peer relations, so that interventions can be designed and implemented to reduce CVE and its detrimental effects in this population.

AB For the young adult, entering tertiary education brings inevitable pressures and stresses. Faced with these stressors, students are vulnerable to internalizing problems. Both the social cognitive theory of self-regulation and hot/cool system theory suggest that while self-control plays a crucial role in protecting against internalizing problems in college students, such internalizing problems can also impair self-control. To test this idea, the present study used a two-wave longitudinal design, spanning 6 months apart, to investigate the predictive effect of self-control on subsequent internalizing problems and, conversely, the effect of internalizing problems on later self-control among college freshmen. As predicted, the results of cross-lagged model supported a bidirectional association between self-control and internalizing problems. Theoretically, these findings suggest a spiral development of self-control in relation to internalizing problems during emerging adulthood. Practically, intervention programs may target both issues of self-control and internalizing problems to optimize the psychological health of college freshmen.

AB Based on the temporal framework of transition experiences, this study tested time-graded patterns of family resource effects on children's and early adolescents' psychological adjustment during a time of multiple transitions. Using data of a longitudinal study including 2,020 German children covering the age span between 8 and 12 (n(boys) = 1,035, n(girls) = 985), internalizing and externalizing problems were predicted by parent-child relationship and family's educational background in a multi-group structural equation model, applying time-lagged autoregressive models. The results showed positive resource effects especially through parent-child relationship. The gender-specific effect patterns over time supported the assumption of stronger resource effects when early puberty onset and secondary school transition co-occurred. Thus, it is important to provide support for this vulnerable group during times of multiple transitions.

AB The purpose of this invited article is to present multicultural norms and related international findings obtained with the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) by indigenous researchers in over 50 societies. The article describes ASEBA instruments for which multicultural norms are available, plus procedures for constructing the multicultural norms. It presents applications to clinical services, including use of multi-informant data for assessing children and their parents. The Multicultural Family Assessment Module (MFAM) enables mental health providers to view side-by-side bar graphs of child and parent scores on syndromes, DSM-oriented scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Evidence-based assessment of progress and outcomes is facilitated by the Progress & Outcomes App (P&O App). Research applications are outlined, including longitudinal and outcomes research. Applications to training mental health providers include having trainees study standardized multi-informant assessment data prior to interviewing children and their parents. Trainees can also sharpen their clinical skills by completing assessment forms to describe children and their parents, and then using ASEBA software to compare their ratings with ratings by children, parents, and other informants. Practical evidence-based assessment instruments with multicultural norms enable mental health providers, researchers, and trainees to perform intake, progress, and outcome assessments of children and their parents in terms of a standardized international clinical data language.

AB Research suggests that irritability and defiance are distinct dimensions of youth oppositionality that are differentially associated with internalizing and conduct problems, respectively. Because much of this evidence has emerged with limited psychometric evaluation, we conducted the first multi-informant examination of selected Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR) items for measuring irritability and defiance in a large clinical sample. Clinically referred youths (N= 1,030; ages 6-15; 43% female, 42% ethnic minority) were assessed prior to treatment using multi-informant rating scales and diagnostic interviews. Analyses examined factor structure, invariance, internal consistency, multi-informant patterns, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity with internalizing and externalizing problems/disorders. A correlated 2-factor model of irritability (stubborn/sullen/irritable, mood, temper) and defiance (argues, disobeys-home, disobeysschool) fit well for both informants. Adequate measurement invariance and scale consistency was consistently found for parent-report but not youth-report. With both informants, all hypothesized convergent and discriminant validity associations were supported: irritability and defiance with internalizing and conduct scales, respectively. However, hypothesized criterion validity associations were largely found only by parent-report: irritability with anxiety and depressive disorders, defiance with conduct disorder, and both with oppositional defiant disorder. Results consistently supported the reliability and validity of the CBCL irritability and defiance scales, with somewhat less consistent support for the YSR scales. Thus, CBCL items may provide psychometrically sound assessment of irritability and defiance, whereas further research is needed to advance youth-report and multi-informant strategies. Results also provide further support for a two subdimension model of oppositional defiant disorder symptoms that includes irritability and defiance.

AB Emotional awareness is an important variable for children's and adolescents' social and emotional development. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties (e.g., factor structure, internal consistencies) of scores on the German translation of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (EAQ; Rieffe, Oosterveld, Miers, Meerum Terwogt, & Ly, 2008). Furthermore, to examine the concurrent validity, associations of the six subscales (Differentiating Emotions, Verbal Sharing of Emotions, Not Hiding Emotions, Bodily Unawareness, Attending to Others' Emotions, Analyses of Emotions) with emotion regulation, internalizing and externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior were investigated. Questionnaire data of 1,018 adolescents aged between 11 and 18 were analyzed. The proposed six-factor structure was replicated and internal consistencies were satisfactory. Meaningful associations of the six EAQ subscales with emotion regulation and psychosocial adjustment were found, proving the concurrent validity of this questionnaire. In general, higher emotional awareness was associated with more functional emotion regulation and prosocial behavior, and less dysfunctional emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing problems. Significant gender differences were detected and are discussed. Overall, the findings suggest that the German EAQ is a useful instrument to assess children's and adolescents' emotional awareness.

AB This study used a person-centered approach to generate profiles of males' sexual abuse characteristics and then link profiles to other types of childhood maltreatment and adversity, and adult outcomes. Data were drawn from 215 North American males (86% Caucasian) aged 17-61 years recruited from websites offering support for sexual abuse. Latent profile analysis identified three profiles, ranging from 1-2 instances of fondling by an unfamiliar extrafamilial perpetrator to chronic, penetrative abuse by individuals within and outside the family. Profiles were labeled Severe (26%), More Severe (33%), and Most Severe (41%). Chi-squares and analysis of variance showed that men in the Most Severe profile were more likely to experience childhood emotional and physical abuse, and a greater number of non-victimization adversities, than men in the other two profiles. After controlling for multiple victimization and adversity, men in the More Severe and Most Severe profiles reported significantly greater internalizing problems than men in the Severe profile, and men in the Most Severe profile reported significantly more trauma symptoms than men in the Severe profile. While these results require replication, they suggest that treatment should be tailored to the individual needs of male survivors.

AB The goal of this study was to explore links among shyness, receptive vocabulary, and indices of socioemotional functioning in a sample of young children in mainland urban China. In particular, we sought to examine the potential moderating role of receptive language in these relations. Participants were N =360 young children (200 boys, 160 girls, M-age=4.72years, SD=0.63) attending preschool/kindergartens in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Multisource assessments were employed, including maternal ratings (child shyness), standardized tests (receptive vocabulary), child self-reports collected during individual interviews (loneliness), teacher ratings (child internalizing problems), and peer nominations (peer liking). Results indicated that receptive vocabulary moderated (buffering effect) the relations between shyness and several indices of socioemotional functioning. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of language skills for early school adjustment of young shy Chinese children.

AB The mechanism by which sleep problems adversely impacts adolescent health is poorly understood. Distress tolerance-a multifactorial trait indicative of one's ability to withstand negative emotions and persist toward long-term goals-is implicated in numerous emotional psychopathologies and an important target for research and practice. We hypothesized that the adverse psychobiological effects of sleep problems could disrupt the development of distress tolerance during adolescence. This longitudinal study examined whether sleep problems predicted changes in four facets of distress tolerance during adolescence: (1) absorption-feeling attention is captured by negative emotions, (2) appraisal-experiencing distress as unacceptable, (3) regulation-engaging in behaviors to terminate distress, and (4) tolerance-low perceived ability to tolerate distress. High school students (M baseline age = 15.5 years, N = 2,309, 56.1% female), completed self-report measures of sleep problems and distress tolerance at baseline and 1-year follow-up. In linear regression models adjusting for baseline distress tolerance, sleep problems predicted poorer distress tolerance at 1-year follow-up for each distress tolerance facet (beta s = -0.10 to -0.24, ps <= 0.02). After additionally controlling for sociodemographics and emotional psychopathology, sleep problems were associated with poorer distress tolerance for absorption (beta = -0.13, p = 0.004) and appraisal (beta = -0.09, p = 0.049) facets, but not regulation or tolerance (ps >= 0.35) facets. Interventions targeting healthy sleep habits warrant consideration for improving adolescent development of certain facets of distress tolerance, and in turn various positive health outcomes improved by distress tolerance.

AB This study is a post-adoption follow-up of social-emotional interventions in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation Baby Homes (BHs). Children previously resided in BHs and received Care as Usual (CAU, N = 220), Training Only (TO, N = 94), or Training plus Structural Changes (T + SC, N = 45). This study examined intervention effects 0-6.5 years post-adoption to the United States, at age 9 months to 7 years old. Adoptive parents completed questionnaires on their child's social and behavioral development. Intervention graduates had better attachment security, less indiscriminate friendliness, and fewer behavior problems than CAU graduates. Children who had longer exposure to intervention conditions had better attachment security, but poorer executive function, externalizing and internalizing problems, and competence. Thus, although postinstitutionalized children were generally functioning in the normal range in early childhood and effect sizes were small, a social-emotional intervention in institutions is associated with modest benefits to attachment and behavior problems and apparent decrements to executive function.

AB SYNOPSISObjective. Oppositional parent-child conflict interactions and inconsistent parenting practices have each been associated with more negative socioemotional outcomes for children. The current study aimed to identify groups of mother-child dyads based on average levels and variability in collaborative and oppositional conflict characteristics during a typical week. We also examined relations between conflict groups and child behaviors, maternal behaviors, and family demographic characteristics. Design. In a sample of 142 mothers of 5- to 8-year-old children, we assessed qualities of daily conflict interactions over one week via online parent reports. Results. Based on average levels of conflict collaboration and opposition, and variability in these qualities from one interaction to the next, we identified three mother-child conflict groups using latent profile analysis: temperate stable, negative volatile, and moderate. Temperate stable dyads included children who were older and displayed the least internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and included mothers who reported the least parenting distress. Conclusions. Distinct information was provided by variable-centered and person-centered analyses and inconsistencies in conflict characteristics - whether negative or positive - tended to co-occur in families.

We assessed 330 children through child's and parents'measures. Fifty-one (15.5%) children were possible cases of ARFID based on their symptom's presentation. There were no association between sex and possible cases of ARFID, and no significant differences between possible cases of ARFID and nonpossible cases of ARFID regarding age. Lower BMI z-score and anxiety/depression were associated with possible cases of ARFID.

AB Loneliness has potentially adverse effects on health and is often connected with depression, while maternal depression has been shown to have a harmful effect on many indicators of children's socioemotional outcomes. The prevalence of loneliness among first-time mothers and its associations with depressive symptoms, background factors, and child outcomes in middle childhood and adolescence were investigated in this longitudinal study. A sample of 122 mother-child dyads was collected from maternal health clinics in Tampere, Finland. The mothers reported their feelings of loneliness at three time points: during pregnancy and when their firstborn child was 8-9 and 16-17years old. Maternal depressive symptoms were screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the same time points. The children's internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaires. Some 34-38% of the mothers reported loneliness at the different study points. Maternal loneliness showed associations with dissatisfaction with life and the pair relationship, and with the presence of depressive symptoms. The mother's prenatal loneliness predicted the child's internalizing problems in adolescence. Interventions aimed at relieving loneliness should be provided for mothers at all stages of motherhood.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 29 years. Specifically, the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology is related to increased risk for suicide at these ages. Few studies have analyzed the relations between these symptoms and their role as mediators in predicting suicide behavior. This study aimed to examine the relation between internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and suicide behaviors through a longitudinal study. The sample consisted of 238 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. The data were analyzed via the PROCESS Statistical Package. The main results showed that previous depression symptoms had a significant indirect effect, through previous suicide behaviors and current depression symptoms, on current suicide behaviors, accounting for 61% of the total variance explained. Additionally, being a girl increased this risk. Therefore, the implementation of early identification and intervention programs to address youth symptoms of depression and suicidal behaviors could significantly reduce the risk for future suicidal behaviors in adolescence.

AB Victims of bullying and cyberbullying present internalizing problems, such as anxiety, psychosomatic and depressive symptoms, and are at higher risk of considering or attempting suicide. Researchers have put great effort into developing interventions able to stop bullying and cyberbullying, and thus buffering possible negative consequences. Despite this, only a few of them have investigated the effects of these programs on the psychological suffering of the victims. The NoTrap! program is an Italian evidence-based intervention able to reduce victimization, bullying, cybervictimization and cyberbullying. The aim of the present study is to analyze whether the NoTrap! program can reduce internalizing symptoms through the decrease in both victimization and cybervictimization. Participants were 622 adolescents, enrolled in the 9th grade of eight high schools in Tuscany (experimental group: N = 451; control group: N = 171). We collected data at three time points: pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Using latent growth curve models, we found that the program significantly predicted the change in internalizing symptoms over time. Furthermore, the mediation model showed that only the indirect effect via cybervictimization was significant. In summary, the program reduced internalizing symptoms within the experimental group successfully, through the decrease in cybervictimization more so than through the mediational effect of decreasing victimization.

The sample consisted of 145 patients of both sexes.The Mexican validated official international Hispanic version of the Youth Self Report/ 11-18 (YSR/ 11-18) was used; it measures psychopathology and individual characteristics associated with positive adaptation, called Positive Qualities. Results. The positive quality most commonly reported was related to the positive social behavior, without mean differences between girls and boys. Girls showed the highest level of internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusions. Adolescents with psychopathology in clinical settings also show positive qualities. It is important to identify and enhance these characteristics as protective factors in adolescents living in high -risk contexts. Girls showed higher psychopathology levels, implying gender differences in preventive intervention.

AB Objective.To identify possible changes in the frequency of psychopathological syndromes in Mexican children population over a 15 -year period using the Brief Screening and Diagnostic Questionnaire (CBTD in Spanish). Materials and methods. Information gathered from different studies on the general population, schools and medical general practice are analyzed. Results from the Mexico City study were used as base rates for comparisons. Results. Higher prevalence of externalizing syndromes such as attention deficit and hyperactivity, oppositional and explosive conduct were very evident. Also, anxiety and depressive syndromes showed a notable increase. Prevalence of abnormal language and probable epilepsy were also increased on different age -groups. Conclusions. Findings are discussed in light of longitudinal reports in the literature as well as on reports in adolescent population in Mexico.

AB Internalizing disorders represent a substantial public health burden in the United States, and recent studies have focused on identifying factors related to internalizing symptoms (IS) in emerging adults (EA). The current study utilizes Structural Equation Modeling to examine the associations between parental psychopathology, recalled parent emotion socialization (ES), EA perception of social connectedness (SC), and EA IS in a comprehensive model with a single informant EA sample (N = 249). The current investigation considers the impact of parent gender on the models predicting EA IS. Results suggest that parental psychopathology is associated with specific ES behaviors, and SC serves as a mediator of the relation between some parental ES responses (i.e., paternal neglect) and EA IS. By incorporating these important elements in a parsimonious model, this study has identified potentially malleable factors related to EA IS, which have important implications for intervention and prevention programming in the family context.

AB This study tested the specificity of associations between childhood multi-trajectories of shyness, anxiety and depression symptoms and adolescent social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, as well as functional impairment. A population sample of 1596 singletons was followed over 15 years. Mothers rated child shyness, anxiety and depression between 11/2 and 8 years-old. Adolescents self-reported symptoms of social phobia, GAD and depression at 15 years-old. Multi-trajectories of childhood internalizing symptoms showed developmental heterogeneity. Controlling for perinatal risk factors, low anxiety and depression in childhood were associated with lower GAD, depression and impairment in adolescence. Higher childhood shyness was associated with adolescent social phobia. Higher shyness in girls was a protective factor for GAD, depression and impairment due to depression, while low shyness in boys was linked to higher risk for GAD and impairment due to depression. Our results underline the importance of distinguishing between shyness and different internalizing symptoms.

TI Decreased Amygdala Reactivity to Parent Cues Protects Against Anxiety

AB BACKGROUND: The human brain remains highly plastic for a protracted developmental period. Thus, although early caregiving adversities that alter amygdala development can result in enduring emotion regulation difficulties, these trajectories should respond to subsequent enriched caregiving. Exposure to high-quality parenting can regulate (i.e., decrease) children's amygdala reactivity, a process that, over the long term, is hypothesized to enhance emotion regulation. We tested the hypothesis that even following adversity, the parent-child relationship would be associated with decreases in amygdala reactivity to parent cues, which would in turn predict lower future anxiety.
   METHODS: Participants were 102 children (6-10 years of age) and adolescents (11-17 years of age), for whom data were collected at one or two time points and who either had experienced institutional care before adoption (n = 45) or had lived always with their biological parents (comparison; n = 57). We examined how amygdala reactivity to visual cues of the parent at time 1 predicted longitudinal change (from time 1 to time 2) in parent-reported child anxiety across 3 years.
   RESULTS: At time 1, on average, amygdala reactivity decrements to parent cues were not seen in children who had received institutional care but were seen in children in the comparison group. However, some children who previously experienced institutional care did show decreased amygdala reactivity to parent cues (similar to 40%), which was associated with greater child-reported feelings of security with their parent. Amygdala decreases at time 1 were followed by steeper anxiety reductions from time 1 to time 2 (i.e., 3 years).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a neurobiological mechanism by which the parent-child relationship can increase resilience, even in children at significant risk for anxiety symptoms.

AB The present study investigated the influence of a school-based mental health counseling intervention (SBMHCI) on elementary school students' (N = 49) behavioral and emotional problems and school attendance at two Title I elementary schools. The study used a single-group, pretest-posttest design to examine change in the participants' scores after participating in the five-week SBMHCI. The results identified that participants' internalizing and total problem scores exhibited significant improvement over time, per parent report. In addition, participants' school attendance significantly improved over time, from the previous academic year, following the SBMHCI.

AB Background: Exergaming is technology-driven physical activity (PA) which, unlike traditional video game play, requires that participants be physically active to play the game. Exergaming may have potential to increase PA and decrease sedentary behavior in youth, but little is known about sustained exergaming.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to describe the frequency, correlates, and predictors of sustained exergaming.
   Methods: Data were available in AdoQuest (2005-11), a longitudinal investigation of 1843 grade 5 students in Montreal, Canada. This analysis used data from grade 9 (2008-09) and 11 (2010-11). Participants at Time 1 (T1; mean age 14 years, SD 0.8) who reported past-week exergaming (n=186, 19.1% of AdoQuest sample) completed mailed self-report questionnaires at Time 2 (T2; mean age 16 years, SD 0.8). Independent sociodemographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates (from T2)/predictors (from T1 or earlier) were identified using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Of 186 exergamers at T1, 81 (44%) reported exergaming at T2. Being female and having higher introjected regulation (ie, a type of PA motivation indicative of internalizing PA as a behavior) were independent correlates. None of the predictors investigated were associated with sustained exergaming.
   Conclusions: Almost half of grade 9 exergamers sustained exergaming for 2 years. Exergaming may be a viable approach to help adolescents engage in and sustain PA during adolescence. Sex and PA motivation may be important in the sustainability of exergaming.

AB Objective: We sought to show that the adjustment of young women who witnessed mutual intimate partner violence (IPV) as children is influenced by their current perceptions of relations with their parents.
   Method: Our sample comprised 793 young female French university students, 623 of whom had been exposed to IPV during childhood. Of these, 289 had witnessed severe violence and 334 minor violence. All participants completed an online battery assessing perceived IPV (CTS2-CA), perceived parent-child relations (QERPE), predisposition to aggression (Aggression Questionnaire), and anxious and depressive symptomatology (HADS).
   Results: Results revealed that young women with IPV exposure exhibited a higher level of anxiety than those with no such exposure, and perceived their relations with their parents more negatively. Those who had witnessed severe, as opposed to minor, violence displayed higher levels of anxiety, depression and aggression. They also had more negative perceptions of their relations with their parents. More generally, perceived maternal rejection was a decisive factor for the presence of internalizing and/or externalizing problems among participants with IPV exposure.
   Conclusion: Where there is a history of mutual IPV, the quality of parent-child relations has a major impact on young women's adjustment. We discuss the study's limitations, as well as prospects for future research.

AB Objective: Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important risk factor for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Various SES parameters are included in research efforts.This paper investigates the predictive value of different individual SES measures and the combination thereof regarding internalizing and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents. Method: We used data from N = 381 8- to 14-yearolds who had been recruited in child and adolescent psychiatric facilities and in the general population. Based oun a diagnostic parent interview (K-SADS-PL), we divided the sample into internalizing and externalizing groups and a healthy control group. The SES data of both parents were collected. Education, occupational status, and income were integrated as single factors as well as combined factor to form the SES index. Additionally, we assessed unemployment. Results: Using multivariate analyses, we controlled for age and sex. All single factors turned out to be significant risk factors for internalizing and externalizing disorders. Occupational status was the most important single factor. The explained variance for the SES index was as high as for occupational status. Unemployment was not predictive when examined simultaneously with the SES index. Conclusion: Future studies should integrate the SES as risk factor and use the SES index or occupational status as single factor.The integration of unemployment is not necessarily needed.

AB Introduction: This systematic literature review provides evidence concerning the association of school race/ethnic composition in mental health outcomes among adolescents (ages 11-17 years). A range of mental health outcomes were assessed (e.g., internalizing behaviors, psychotic symptoms) in order to broadly capture the relationship between school context on mental health and psychological wellbeing. Methods: A search across six databases from 1990 to 2018 resulted in 13 articles from three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) that met inclusion criteria following a two step review of titles/abstracts and full-text. Results: The existing research on school race/ethnic composition and mental health point to two distinct measures of school composition: density-the proportion of one race/ethnic group enrolled in a school, and diversity-an index capturing the range and size of all race/ethnic groups enrolled in a school. Overall, higher same race/ethnic peer density was associated with better mental health for all adolescents. In contrast, there was no overall strong evidence of mental health advantage in schools with increased diversity. Conclusions: Theoretical and methodological considerations for future research towards strengthening causal inference, and implications for policies and practices concerning the mental health of adolescent-aged students are discussed.

AB Objective: To systematically appraise the literature on the prevalence, types, and predictors of sleep-wake disturbances (SWD), and on the relationship between SWD, fatigue, depression, and quality of life in children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched, reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched for relevant articles, and study methods were evaluated for risk of bias. Results: Of the 620 articles assessed, 16 met inclusion criteria. Sleep-wake disturbances were common in childhood TBI. The most common types of SWD reported were insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with mild TBI participants showing a trend toward more sleep maintenance insomnia, while sleep-onset insomnia was typical in those with moderate-severe TBI. Predictors of SWD reported in studies involving mild TBI participants included TBI severity, male sex, preexisting SWD, high body weight, and depression; while injury severity and internalizing problems were associated with SWD in moderate-severe TBI participants. Sleep-wake disturbances were also associated with fatigue and poor quality of life following TBI. Conclusion: Sleep-wake disturbances are highly prevalent in childhood TBI, regardless of injury severity. Routine assessments of SWD in survivors of childhood TBI are recommended.

AB An impact of vitamin D in neurocognitive function has been theorized but it remains unknown whether vitamin-D insufficiency (VDI) is associated with worse socio-emotional adjustment (SEA) in vulnerable early school-aged children. This study examines the thesis that deficits in SEA are related to VDI using longitudinal data from 254 children that are perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV), exposed-uninfected (HEU), or unexposed-uninfected (HUU). In utero/peripartum antiretroviral (IPA) exposure was established per medical record documentation of biological mother's ART regimen in pregnancy. Four caregiver-reported age- and sex-standardized measures of SEA were obtained at months 0, 6, and 12 for dependent children aged 6-10 years: externalizing problems (EPC), internalizing problems (IPC), behavioral symptoms index (BSI), and adaptive skills index (ASI). VDI was highly prevalent (74%, n = 188), and its association with change in SEA measures over 12 months varied by HIV-status (VDI*HIV, all p-values < 0.03). There was further variation in relationship of vitamin-D to SEA by IPA among PHIV (for ASI, BSI, and EPC, vitamin-D*IPA, p-value <= 0.01) and HEU (for BSI and EPC, vitamin-D*IPA, p-value <= 0.04). Among HUU, BSI (beta = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.50, -0.13), IPC (beta = -0.28, 95% CI: -0.47, -0.09), and EPC (beta = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.37, -0.02) all declined moderately per quartile increment in VD. Among PHIV, on the one hand higher vitamin D predicted ASI gains (moderate vs. low VD, beta = 0.52, p = 0.002), but this protective association was absent for BSI, EPC, and IPC (beta = 0.36-0.77, p < 0.05). In absence of IPA-exposure, increasing vitamin-D predicted declines in BSI and EPC (moderate vs. low Vitamin D, beta = -0.56 to -0.71, p <= 0.02) among HEU. However, given IPA exposure among HEU, higher VDI predicted moderate elevation in BSI (beta = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.78) and IPC (beta = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.92). Interaction between VD and IPA exposure for SEA outcomes among HEU and PHIV children warrants further investigation. The vitamin-D associated SEA improvement among HUU and HEU without IPA exposure suggests vitamin-D supplementation may remediate behavioral and adaptive deficits in this groups.

AB Background/AimNegative postoperative changes in children are frequent and have been described for decades. However, there is currently no theoretical framework, nor any consensual operational criteria for identifying them. This study aims at characterizing the many dimensions involved in postoperative behavioral disturbances in early childhood, using a qualitative analysis applied for the first time to these symptoms.
   MethodFifty-seven parents of preschool children (1-5years old; 38 boys), who underwent general anesthesia, were interviewed 10days after surgery. Semi-structured interviews investigated behavioral disturbances classically described in preschool children. Qualitative analysis of the transcripts allied both deductive and inductive reasoning, and inductive coding was carried out using constant comparison method with dedicated qualitative software.
   ResultsParents reported both positive and negative postoperative changes. Negative changes were classified in four main categories: (a) Externalizing and (b) Internalizing problems behaviors, (c) Feeding sleeping disruption and (d) Somatic problems, each comprising different sub-categories. Importantly within these categories, the symptoms distribution changed in 5years old children, compared to younger children. Finally, our method allowed defining whether these (negative or positive) changes were significant or not, that is, the importance of postoperative behavioral changes.
   ConclusionThe results of this study highlight the heterogeneity of postoperative disturbances in preschool children. These results are of primary importance for the definition and measurement of postoperative behavioral disturbances.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:During adolescence, mental health problems may increase the risk of initiating combustible cigarette use. However, it is unknown if this association extends to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). We examined whether internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with initiation of e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, and dual-product use among adolescents.METHODS:Participants were drawn from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of US adolescents followed from 2013 to 2015. The study sample included 7702 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who at baseline reported no lifetime use of tobacco products. We examined the respective associations between baseline internalizing and externalizing problems and initiating use of e-cigarettes, combustible cigarettes, or both at 1-year follow-up.RESULTS:Compared with adolescents with low externalizing problems, adolescents with high externalizing problems were significantly more likely to initiate use of e-cigarettes (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-4.40), combustible cigarettes (aRRR = 5.59; 95% CI: 2.63-11.90), and both products (aRRR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.15-4.31). Adolescents with high internalizing problems were at increased risk of initiating use of e-cigarettes (aRRR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.12-2.33) but not combustible cigarettes or both products.CONCLUSIONS:Mental health problems are associated with increased risk for initiating e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, and dual-product use in adolescence. This association is more consistent for externalizing problems than internalizing problems. Addressing mental health problems could be a promising target for preventing initiation of nicotine- and/or tobacco-product use by adolescents.

AB ImportanceObesity and internalizing mental illness begin in childhood, have common risk factors, and are leading causes of disease burden. ObjectivesTo examine the comorbidity, codevelopment, and temporal precedence in body mass index (BMI) and internalizing symptoms from early childhood to midadolescence and to investigate the sex differences and socioeconomic confounding in their association. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis longitudinal study used data on individuals from the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative, prospective birth cohort study in the United Kingdom of more than 19000 individuals born from September 1, 2000, to January 11, 2002, who were assessed to date at the ages of 9 months and 3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 years. Data from 17215 participants (88.21% of full cohort sample) with socioeconomic information in early childhood and BMI or internalizing symptoms during at least 1 assessment from 3 to 14 years of age were included in the present study. Data analysis was performed from May to November 2018. Main Outcomes and MeasuresOutcomes were BMI estimated from objectively measured height and weight and internalizing symptoms assessed using parental reports. Three measures of socioeconomic position were controlled for: parent educational level, occupational status, and equivalized family income. ResultsAmong the 17 215 participants (8394 [48.8%] female), obesity and internalizing problems were not more likely to co-occur in early childhood (odds ratio [OR] at 3 years, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69-1.50), whereas at 11 and 14 years of age, they were more likely to co-occur (OR at 11 years, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.38-2.05; OR at 14 years, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.83). Piecewise latent growth models revealed no codevelopment of BMI and internalizing symptoms from 3 to 7 years of age (r=0.01), whereas their slopes were associated between 7 and 14 years of age (r=0.23). Initial level and rate of change in each domain in early childhood was not associated with rate of change in the other domain at older ages. Cross-lagged models indicated no cross-domain pathways before 7 years of age, with some weak cross-domain pathways emerging between 7 and 14 years of age. Socioeconomic position attenuated some of these associations, leaving a BMI-to-internalizing symptoms pathway in later childhood and an internalizing symptoms-to-BMI pathway in early adolescence. Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings suggest that BMI and internalizing symptoms become more associated and reciprocal as children get older and that some of their temporal associations can be attributed to socioeconomic factors. The emergence of cross-domain temporal pathways in middle childhood suggests that social, physiologic, and psychological processes begin to play an increasingly important role in these health outcomes. Prevention and early intervention efforts may benefit from targeting both health outcomes in childhood.

ID LONGITUDINAL DEVELOPMENT CHILD; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY
AB Objectives: Primary: examine associations between meeting the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years and behavioral and emotional problems in a large sample of 3-year-old children. Secondary: determine the proportion of children meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: Participants were 3-year olds (n = 539) from the Edmonton site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort. Physical activity and sleep duration were accelerometerderived while screen time was parent-reported. Meeting the overall guidelines was defined as: (1) >= 180 min/day of total physical activity, including 60 min/day of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, (2) <= 1 h/day of screen time, and (3) 10-13 h of sleep per 24-hour period. Externalizing, internalizing, and total problem scores (lower scores representing fewer problems) were calculated from the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Descriptive statistics and linear regression models were completed.
   Results: Only 5% of children met the overall guidelines (all three recommendations), with 19.3%, 50.5%, and 83.1% meeting the physical activity, screen time, and sleep recommendations, respectively. Meeting more recommendations was associated with lower scores for total (B = -1.78, 95%CI: -3.03, -0.54), externalizing (B = -1.51, 95%CI: -2.80, -0.22) and internalizing (B= -1.35, 95%CI: -2.60, -0.01) problems. Similar findings were also observed for the specific combinations of: (1) physical activity and screen time and (2) sleep duration and screen time.
   Conclusions: Meeting more recommendations within the 24-hour Movement Guidelines was associated with fewer behavioral and emotional problems at 3-years. Few 3-year-olds met the overall guidelines. Findings support an integrated approach for healthy growth and development. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence in humans and rodents suggests that perinatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants can have serious long-term consequences in offspring exposed in utero or infancy via breast milk. In spite of this, there is limited knowledge of how perinatal SSRI exposure impacts brain development and adult behaviour. Children exposed to SSRIs in utero exhibit increased internalizing behaviour and abnormal social behaviour between the ages of 3 and 6, and increased risk of depression in adolescence; however, the neurobiological changes underlying this behaviour are poorly understood. In rodents, perinatal SSRI exposure perturbs hippocampal gene expression and alters adult emotional behaviour (including increased depression-like behaviour). The present study demonstrates that perinatal exposure to the SSRI paroxetine leads to DNA hypomethylation and reduces DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) mRNA expression in the hippocampus during the second and third weeks of life. Next-generation sequencing identified numerous differentially methylated genomic regions, including altered methylation and transcription of several dendritogenesis-related genes. We then tested the hypothesis that transiently decreasing Dnmt3a expression in the early postnatal hippocampus would mimic the behavioural effects of perinatal SSRI exposure. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dnmt3a in the dentate gyrus during the second to third week of life produced greater depression-like behaviour in adult female (but not male) offspring, akin to the behavioural consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure. Overall, these data suggest that perinatal SSRI exposure may increase depression-like behaviours, at least in part, through reduced Dnmt3a expression in the developing hippocampus.

AB Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have shown an increased risk for violence and victimization. However, research on exposure to multiple forms of victimization in different contexts are scarce. Hence, the current aim is to review the evidence about polyvictimization among children with ASD or ADHD. PsycInfo, ERIC, ERC, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched until 12 March 2019 to identify empirical studies with reported prevalence rates of at least four forms of victimization among children with ASD or ADHD. A total of 6/1300 articles were included in the review, ranging in sample sizes from 92 to 4114. The reported prevalence rates for polyvictimization were 1.8% and 23.1% for children with ASD and 7.3% for children with ADHD. The results emphasize the high prevalence of violence and victimization, including polyvictimization, among children with ASD or ADHD. Polyvictimization among children with ASD or ADHD is a highly under researched area. Significant knowledge gaps and important methodological considerations that provide important implications for future research include lack of information on cyber bullying, frequency or intensity of victimization, and the failure to include children as informants and to report health outcomes associated with polyvictimization.

AB Depression and acculturative stress are common among Latina mothers, yet little is known about how these variables are related to parenting practices and in turn, to the mental health functioning of their young children. The present study used a sample of Mexican-origin mothers of 3- to 6-year-old children (N = 175) to test a model of maternal depression and acculturative stress as predictors of child internalizing and externalizing problems, mediated by authoritarian and authoritative parenting practices. Results showed that maternal depressive symptoms and acculturative stress were associated with child internalizing, but not externalizing, problems. Only authoritarian practices mediated these associations. Results highlight the importance of considering sociocultural context in the study of child mental health in Mexican-origin populations.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are commonly used as plasticizers and flame retardants in consumer products, and exposure is relatively ubiquitous in most populations studied. This may be of concern as some OPEs may be neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting, and interfere with behavioral development; however, observational evidence is limited. We used data from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study, a prospective birth cohort study, to investigate associations between maternal OPE metabolite concentrations during pregnancy and behavioral development in offspring. Women provided a urine sample during pregnancy that was analyzed for concentrations of OPE metabolites, including diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate) (BDCIPP), isopropyl-phenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP), and 1-hydroxyl-2-propyl bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPHIPP). Offspring's behavioral development was assessed by the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (2nd Edition) (BASC-2) at approximately 36 months. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between tertiles in specific gravity-corrected OPE metabolite concentrations and children's scores on the BASC-2, adjusted for maternal age, maternal BMI, maternal race, maternal education, familial income, maternal depression, quality of the home environment, and sex. Higher BDCIPP concentrations were associated with higher scores on the Behavioral Symptoms Index (1st vs. 3rd tertile: beta = 3.03; 95% CI = 0.40, 5.67) and Externalizing Problems (1st vs. 3rd tertile: beta = 2.49; 95% CI: -0.12, 5.10) composites. Among BASC-2 scales, BDCIPP was most strongly associated with Withdrawal, Attention Problems, Depression, Hyperactivity, and Aggression. DPHP concentrations were also associated with higher scores on the Externalizing Problems and Behavioral Symptoms Index composites, but not as strongly as BDCIPP. Conversely, higher concentrations of ip-PPP were associated with fewer adverse behavioral symptoms, including an inverse association with the Internalizing Problems composite (1st vs. 3rd tertile: beta = -3.74; 95% CI = -6.75, -0.74) and constituent scales. BCIPHIPP was not strongly associated with any measured behavioral outcomes. Our results suggest that greater maternal exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate) (TDCIPP, parent compound of BDCIPP) and, to a lesser degree, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP, parent compound of DPHP) during pregnancy is associated with adverse behavioral development in children. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence pertaining to adverse developmental effects of prenatal OPE exposure and highlights the need for further research to characterize risks associated with this ubiquitous family of chemicals.

AB Comorbidity is pervasive across psychopathological symptoms, diagnoses, and domains. Network analysis is a method for investigating symptom-level associations that underlie comorbidity, particularly through bridge symptoms connecting diagnostic syndromes. We applied network analyses of comorbidity to data from a population-based sample of adolescents (N = 849). We implemented a method for assessing nonparametric moderation of psychopathology networks to evaluate differences in network structure across levels of intelligence and emotional control. Symptoms generally clustered by clinical diagnoses, but specific between-cluster bridge connections emerged. Internalizing symptoms demonstrated unique connections with aggression symptoms of interpersonal irritability, whereas externalizing symptoms showed more diffuse interconnections. Aggression symptoms identified as bridge nodes in the cross-sectional network were enriched for longitudinal associations with internalizing symptoms. Cross-domain connections did not significantly vary across intelligence but were weaker at lower emotional control. Our findings highlight transdiagnostic symptom relationships that may underlie co-occurrence of clinical diagnoses or higher-order factors of psychopathology.

AB Background: Peer violence and depressive symptoms are increasingly prevalent among adolescents, and for many, use the emergency department (ED) as their primary source of healthcare. Brief in-person interventions and longitudinal text-message-based interventions are feasible, acceptable, and may be effective in reducing peer violence and depressive symptoms when delivered in the ED setting. This paper presents the study design and protocol for an in-ED brief intervention (BI) and text messaging program (Text).
   Methods: This study will be conducted in a pediatric ED which serves over 50,000 pediatric patients per year. Recruitment of study participants began in August 2018 and anticipated to continue until October 2021. The study will enroll 800 adolescents (ages13-17) presenting to the ED for any reason who self-report past-year physical peer violence and past-two week mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. The study will use a factorial randomized trial to test both overall intervention efficacy and determine the optimal combination of intervention components. A full 2 x 2 factorial design randomizes patients at baseline to 1) BI or no BI; and 2) Text or no Text. Peer violence and depressive symptoms improvements will be measured at 2, 4, and 8 months through self-report and medical record review.
   Discussion: This study has important implications for the progress of the greater field of mobile health interventions, as well as for adolescent violence and depression prevention in general. This proposal has high clinical and public health significance with high potential scalability, acceptability, and impact.

AB One-to-one instruction is a critical component of evidence-based instruction for students with autism spectrum disorder, but is not used as often as recommended. Student characteristics may affect teachers' decisions to select a treatment and/or implement it. This study examined the associations between students' clinical and demographic characteristics and teachers' reported use of discrete trial training (DTT) and pivotal response training (PRT). Children's higher sensory symptoms, lower social approach, lower verbal skills and higher self-regulation difficulties were associated with more frequent 1:1 DTT and PRT. Results suggest that teachers give more frequent 1:1 instruction to children with more observable impairments, do not match children to type of 1:1 intervention, and may inadvertently neglect other students for whom individualized intervention may still be beneficial.

AB BackgroundNon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) prospectively predicts suicidal thoughts and behaviors in civilian populations. Despite high rates of suicide among US military members, little is known about the prevalence and course of NSSI, or how NSSI relates to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, in military personnel.MethodsWe conducted secondary analyses of two representative surveys of active-duty soldiers (N = 21 449) and newly enlisted soldiers (N = 38 507) from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS).ResultsThe lifetime prevalence of NSSI is 6.3% (1.2% 12-month prevalence) in active-duty soldiers and 7.9% (1.3% 12-month prevalence) in new soldiers. Demographic risk factors for lifetime NSSI include female sex, younger age, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, never having married, and lower educational attainment. The association of NSSI with temporally primary internalizing and externalizing disorders varies by service history (new v. active-duty soldiers) and gender (men v. women). In both active-duty and new soldiers, NSSI is associated with increased odds of subsequent onset of suicidal ideation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.66-1.81] and suicide attempts (adjusted OR = 2.02-2.43), although not with the transition from ideation to attempt (adjusted OR = 0.92-1.36). Soldiers with a history of NSSI are more likely to have made multiple suicide attempts, compared with soldiers without NSSI.ConclusionsNSSI is prevalent among US Army soldiers and is associated with significantly increased odds of later suicidal thoughts and behaviors, even after NSSI has resolved. Suicide risk assessments in military populations should screen for history of NSSI.

AB Background: Alexithymia reflects a difficulty with identifying and expressing emotions. This experience has been proposed as having an association with suicide ideation and behaviour. This review aimed to synthesise the evidence to establish the bivariate and multivariate relationships between alexithymia, and its subcomponents, with suicide ideation and behaviour.
   Methods: Search terms related to alexithymia and suicide ideation and behaviour were searched across nine prominent databases in May 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported original empirical quantitative findings from adult samples, used a validated measure of alexithymia, and any measure of suicide ideation or behaviour.
   Results: Thirty-four studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The review found a large effect size for the relationship between alexithymia and suicide ideation (r = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.65) and a small effect size for the relationship between alexithymia and suicide behaviour (r = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.16-0.34). Limitations: A high level of heterogeneity was found in the meta-analysis meaning that results should be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusion: A positive association was found between alexithymia and suicide ideation and, to a lesser extent, behaviour across a range of clinical and general population samples. This review has potentially important clinical implications, and promotes the need for suicide prevention to focus on emotion regulation skills.

AB The aim of this study was to explore how some temperamentally inhibited young children and not others in the general population develop anxiety disorders and broader clinical-level internalizing (anxious/depressive) problems, with a focus on the family. A brief screening tool for inhibition was universally distributed to parents of children in their year before starting school across eight socioeconomically diverse government areas in Melbourne, Australia (307 preschool services). Screening identified 11% of all children as inhibited. We invited all parents of inhibited children to participate in a longitudinal prevention study. Participants were 545 parents of inhibited pre-schoolers (78% uptake) of whom 498 (91%) completed assessment one year later and 469 (86%) two years later. Parents completed questionnaires to assess parenting practices, parent wellbeing, and child internalizing problems. Parents also engaged in structured diagnostic interviews to assess child anxiety disorders. During the follow up period close to half of the inhibited young children had anxiety disorders and one in seven had clinical-level internalizing problems, with girls perhaps at higher risk. The family variables significantly predicted inhibited children's anxiety disorders and broader internalizing problems. For child anxiety disorders, overinvolved/protective parenting was particularly important for girls and boys, and poorer parent wellbeing contributed. For child anxious/depressive problems, harsh discipline was a consistent predictor for girls and boys, and poorer parent wellbeing again contributed. These etiological findings support early intervention for temperamentally inhibited young children that focuses on the family environment to prevent the development of mental health problems.

AB Emotion socialization by parents contributes to children's trajectories of healthy and unhealthy emotional development, but there has been little research into the determinants and development of parental emotion socialization. We examined whether young children's anxious characteristics, including expressed anxiety with peers and low basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), predicted changes in mothers' and fathers' emotion socialization over the subsequent year. Using regression and regions of significance analyses, we observed that children's expressed anxiety moderated the stability of mothers' and fathers' supportive and unsupportive emotion socialization, primarily in ways that would be likely to maintain or exacerbate children's social anxiety. For example, mothers' highly fretful and less supportive responses were more stable when children had been more anxious with peers. Basal RSA moderated the stability of fathers' punitive responses to children's anxious and sad emotions, and directly predicted changes in mothers' neglect of children's anxious and sad emotions, and negative and positive feelings about children's social withdrawal. These effects of children's characteristics on parents' emotions and behaviors support bidirectional and transactional models of the socialization of children's anxiety and internalizing problems, and identify aspects of emotion socialization by parents that could be amenable to intervention.

AB PurposeAfter treatment, pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) face emotional and behavioral challenges, perhaps due to tumor or treatment-related changes in brain structures involved in emotion regulation, including those with fronto-limbic connections. We hypothesized that relative to healthy controls (HCs), PBTS would exhibit greater difficulties with behavior and emotional functioning, and display reduced mean fractional anisotropy (mFA) in white matter tracts with fronto-limbic connections including the cingulum bundle (CB), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus(IFOF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF). We further predicted that mFA would account for variance in the relationship between group and emotional/behavioral outcome.MethodsEleven 8-16year old PBTS and 14 HCs underwent MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter microstructure. Tractography quantified mFA of selected tracts. Parents rated children's emotional and behavioral functioning.ResultsCompared to HCs, caregivers of PBTS reported poorer behavioral regulation and greater internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Relative to HCs, PBTS had lower mFA within the bilateral CB, IFOF, and UF (ds=0.59-1.15). Across groups, several medium-to-large correlations linked tract mFA and increased internalizing, externalizing, and poor behavioral regulation. Tract mFA also accounted for significant variance in the group-outcome association.ConclusionsReduced mFA in fronto-limbic associated tracts may be associated with reduced behavioral regulation following pediatric brain tumor. PBTS with treatment known to impact white matter may be most susceptible. Research with larger, longitudinal samples should clarify this relationship, allow for multiple mediators across time, and consider factors like tumor and treatment type.

AB Background: Investigations have found mothers' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) confer an intergenerational risk to their children's outcomes. However, mechanisms underlying this transmission have only been partially explained by maternal mental health. Adult attachment insecurity has been shown to mediate the association of ACEs and mental health outcomes, yet an extension of this research to children's behavioral problems has not been examined.
   Objective: To examine the cascade from maternal ACEs to risk for child behavioral problems at five years of age, via mothers' attachment insecurity and mental health.
   Participants and setting: Participants in the current study were 1994 mother-child dyads from a prospective longitudinal cohort collected from January 2011 to October 2014.
   Methods: Mothers retrospectively reported their ACEs when children were 36 months of age. When children were 60 months of age, mothers completed measures of their attachment style, depression and anxiety symptoms, and their children's behavior problems.
   Results: Path analysis demonstrated maternal ACEs were associated with children's internalizing problems indirectly via maternal attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and depression symptoms, but not directly (beta = .05, 95% CI [-.001, .10]). Maternal ACEs indirectly predicted children's externalizing problems via maternal attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and depression. A direct effect was also observed from maternal ACEs to child externalizing problems (beta = .06, 95% CI [.01, .11]).
   Conclusions: Maternal ACEs influenced children's risk for poor behavioral outcomes via direct and indirect intermediary pathways. Addressing maternal insecure attachment style and depression symptoms as intervention targets for mothers with histories of ACEs may help to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of risk.

AB Background: Long-term follow-up studies of interventions for children exposed to intimate partner violence are few, and the sustainability of their outcomes often remains unexplored and uncertain. Current research including follow-up assessment suggests that treatment gains may be maintained or continue post termination. In addition some children may show increased levels of symptoms.
   Objective: The present effectiveness study investigated the long-term outcomes of two established group interventions for children exposed to intimate partner violence and their non-offending parent.
   Participants and Setting: The study included 50 children, 24 girls and 26 boys, aged 4 to 13 years attending a psychotherapeutic child and adolescent mental health service intervention and a psychoeducative community-based intervention.
   Methods: Background information, child and parental mental health problems, trauma symptoms, and exposure to violence were assessed pre- and post treatment and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up.
   Results: Sustained treatment gains and late improvements in children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and in symptoms of traumatic stress were recorded from post treatment to the follow-up assessments (p = .004- .044; d = 0.29-0.67). No significant increase in symptoms was reported. Additionally, very little continued or renewed child exposure to violence was reported.
   Conclusions: The results of the study indicate that the children did benefit from the two interventions studied and that the outcomes of reduced child symptoms and protection from exposure to violence were sustainable. Children with severe trauma symptoms benefited the most, though maternal psychological problems may for some have hindered recovery. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Background: Black caregivers may be more likely to have negative experiences with mental health services/providers and lack knowledge of psychopathology and mental health services relative to White caregivers. These perceptual and informational barriers could influence the likelihood that Black caregivers utilize psychological counseling and support services for their adolescents compared to White caregivers. The current study examined differences between Black and White caregivers in the associations between their adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems and their perceptions of need for and utilization of psychological counseling and support services. Method: Data for the present study were collected from 741 diverse caregivers (63% Black, 37% non-Hispanic White) about their adolescents. Caregivers reported their adolescent's psychopathology and their perceptions of their adolescent's need for and utilization of psychological counseling. parenting classes, and youth mentoring programs. Results: Caregivers who reported that their adolescents had clinically elevated psychopathology were more likely to report a need for psychological counseling or support services in general. However, they were only more likely to report that their adolescents received psychological counseling services. Black caregivers were significantly less likely than White caregivers to report that their adolescent needed psychological counseling and were more likely than White caregivers to report that their adolescents needed a youth mentoring program if they had clinically elevated externalizing problems. Conclusions: Black caregivers may perceive mentoring programs as a less stigmatizing and more culturally congruent support service for addressing externalizing problems. Integration and dissemination of evidence-based intervention strategies to underserved populations using culturally acceptable intervention modalities is needed.

AB Associations between parent critical attitudes (a component of the Expressed Emotion construct) and behavior problems have been relatively well established in adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder, but use of systems adapted for children with autism spectrum disorder and additional investigations with younger samples are needed. This study examined parental criticism, derived from a population-specific coding system, as related to behavior problems in children with autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 4 and 11 years, and considered parental warmth and children's psychophysiological reactivity as statistical moderators of these associations. In all, 40 children with autism spectrum disorder and their primary caregivers attended a visit involving collection of child electrodermal activity, parent-child interaction, a parent interview from which critical attitudes and warmth were coded, and parent report of child behavior problems. Criticism was directly related to higher child externalizing but not internalizing problems. Parental criticism interacted with warmth in the prediction of internalizing problems such that criticism was only associated with more problems in the context of moderate but not high warmth. Criticism was positively associated with externalizing problems under conditions of moderate and high, but not low, child electrodermal activity reactivity. Implications for conceptualizations of parental criticism in autism spectrum disorder, for understanding comorbid behavior problems in this population, and for intervention are discussed.

AB Emotion regulation impairments are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder and are believed to often underlie commonly seen problems with aggression, depression, and anxiety. The Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement program was developed to reduce emotion regulation impairment and thereby improve behavioral disturbance, via mindfulness. Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement consists of a 16-week individual therapy treatment targeting emotion regulation impairments among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. We describe the conceptual framework and development of the program and present data on feasibility and preliminary efficacy from a pilot trial. The Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement manual was developed using a participatory action framework, based on emotion regulation research specific to autism spectrum disorder and input from individuals with autism spectrum disorder, therapists, and parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement was piloted in a two-site open trial with 20 participants with autism spectrum disorder (12-17 years old, confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, IQ > 80).Outcome data support program feasibility and acceptability to participants, as well as significant improvement in emotion regulation impairments and related concerns.Findings offer preliminary support for both the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of the Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement program.

AB BACKGROUND: Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) during childhood are associated with greater risk of developing a psychotic disorder (and other mental disorders), highlighting the importance of identifying neural correlates of childhood PLEs. Three major cortical networks-the cingulo-opercular network (CON), default mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal network-are consistently implicated in psychosis and PLEs in adults. However, it is unclear whether variation in functional connectivity is associated with PLEs in school-aged children.
   METHODS: Using hierarchical linear models, we examined the relationships between childhood PLEs and resting-state functional connectivity of the CON, DMN, and frontoparietal network, as well as the other networks, using an a priori network parcellation, using data from 9- to 11-year-olds (n = 3434) in the ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) study. We examined within-network, between-network, and subcortical connectivity.
   RESULTS: Decreased CON and DMN connectivity, as well as cinguloparietal (CPAR) network connectivity, were associated with greater PLEs, even after accounting for family history of psychotic disorders, internalizing symptoms, and cognitive performance. Decreased DMN connectivity was more strongly associated with increased delusional ideation, whereas decreased CON connectivity was more strongly associated with increased perceptual distortions. Increased CON-cerebellar and decreased CPAR-cerebellar connectivity were also associated with increased PLEs, and CPAR-cerebellar connectivity was more strongly associated with increased perceptual distortions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with hypotheses about the dimensionality of psychosis, our results provide novel evidence that neural correlates of PLEs, such as reduced functional connectivity of higher-order cognitive networks, are present even in school-aged children. The results provide further validation for continuity of PLEs across the life span.

AB Background: Child psychopathology involves inappropriate or biased attributions of others' mental states (mentalizing), and parents' assessment of their children's mentalizing significantly predicts the latter's psychosocial outcomes. Behavioral difficulties are frequent in children with epilepsy (CWE) yet biased mentalizing and parental accuracy in understanding their child's mental states reasoning have not been addressed.
   Methods: This study compared the performance of 34 CWE aged 9 to 16 years with 67 language age-matched controls on a biased mentalizing task. The task required children to infer on the mental states of peers in stories involving social scenarios. Responses were scored as positive, negative, or rational mentalizing attributions. To measure parental accuracy, a parent version was administered in the patient group that required a parent to identify their child's responses correctly. Relationships with the child's cognitive, behavioral, and epilepsy-related factors were examined.
   Results: Patients made greater negative mental states attributions compared with control children. This negative mentalizing bias was accurately identified by parents and was associated with children's behavioral problems. Parental accuracy was reduced for patients with lower cognitive abilities. Parents did not accurately identify an overly positive (OP) bias in their child's mental states attributions. Children's positive response bias correlated with their lower executive function (EF) skills. Epilepsy factors predicted cognitive deficits but not biased mentalizing or behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Biased mentalizing characterizes social cognition in CWE with behavioral problems. Further investigation of the mentalizing biases and parental awareness of children's mental states reasoning is required to fully understand the greater psychosocial and behavioral difficulties found in CWE.

AB The current study compared differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between youth with new-onset epilepsy with and without elevated psychological symptoms at time of epilepsy diagnosis within an integrated behavioral health and epilepsy service. Patients received both behavioral health and epilepsy care during clinic visits. A retrospective chart review was conducted between July 2011 and December 2015. Caregivers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2: Parent Rating Scale (BASC-2: PRS) to assess psychological symptoms at the diagnostic visit, along with completing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL (TM) 4.0) at the diagnostic visit and each subsequent epilepsy dinic visit during the first year of treatment. Latent growth curve modeling was used to identify HRQOL changes over the first year of treatment. Health-related quality of life was significantly lower for youth with elevated psychological symptoms at diagnosis and over the first year of treatment compared with those without psychological symptoms. For those with elevated internalizing, inattention, withdrawal, and atypical symptoms at diagnosis, greater HRQOL improvements were detected over the first year of treatment compared with those without elevated psychological symptoms at the diagnostic visit. Within integrated behavioral health and epilepsy routine care, targeted psychological interventions can improve HRQOL over the first year of treatment, particularly for those with premorbid psychological symptoms.

AB Objective: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in youth with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the risk factors for poor glycemic control and DKA hospitalizations is crucial for the refinement and development of prevention and treatment efforts. Method: Based on a conceptual framework, this study used path analysis to evaluate individual and family characteristics, psychosocial responses, and individual and family responses that prospectively predict the number of DKA hospitalizations and HbA1c approximately 1 year after assessment, accounting for sociodemographics. A total of 174 youth 12-18 years old with T1D (M = 14.68, SD = 1.77) and their caregivers completed measures assessing demographics, internalizing symptoms, diabetes stress, diabetes-related family conflict, and adherence. Medical records were reviewed to obtain the number of episodes of DKA and the HbA1c at 1-year follow-up. Results: Thirty-one participants had at least 1 episode of DKA based on chart review. Greater duration of diabetes, higher baseline HbA1c, lower income, identifying as non-Hispanic White, and higher youth report of internalizing symptoms were significant predictors of DKA at follow-up (p <.05). Identifying as Black-African American, a younger age, and higher baseline HbA1c significantly predicted higher HbA1c at follow-up (p <.05). Conclusions: Future studies should assess the utility and accuracy of using screeners for internalizing symptoms in pediatric endocrinology clinics to identify youth at risk for DKA hospitalizations.

AB Background Childhood maltreatment is one of the most potent predictors of future psychopathology, including internalizing disorders. It remains unclear whether heightened amygdala reactivity to threat and elevated stress exposure may be implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of internalizing disorders among individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment. Methods Using data from a sample of 1,144 young adults, we investigated the contribution of baseline threat-related amygdala reactivity and prospective major stressful life events to internalizing symptoms severity 1 year later (on average) in individuals with a history of maltreatment (n = 100) and propensity score matched nonmaltreated peers (n = 96). Results Even after stringently matching for several potentially confounding variables - including baseline internalizing symptoms, socioeconomic status and IQ - childhood maltreatment status predicted increased amygdala reactivity at baseline, elevated post-baseline exposure to major stressful life events and internalizing symptoms at follow-up. We also showed, for the first time, that amygdala reactivity at baseline and also post-baseline exposure to major stressful life events mediated the association between a history of maltreatment and future internalizing symptoms. Conclusions These findings provide support for the view that maltreatment is a potent developmental insult leading to long-lasting neurocognitive recalibrations of the threat processing system. It is possible that such alterations, over time, may impact mental health functioning by compromising the ability to effectively negotiate everyday challenges (stress susceptibility). These alterations were not, however, found to sensitize an individual to the impact of major stressful life events. The results of this study also lend compelling support to the view that increased psychiatric risk, in the context of childhood maltreatment, follows from an increased propensity to experience major stressful life events (stress generation).

AB Objective To determine the efficacy of a hospital-based intervention that transitions into existing community support, in enhancing developmental outcomes at 2 years of corrected age in infants born at less than 32 weeks.
   Study design In total, 323 families of 384 infants born <32 weeks were randomized to receive intervention or careas-usual. The intervention teaches parents coping skills, partner support, and effective parenting strategies over 4 hospital-based and 4 home-phone sessions. At 2 years of corrected age maternally reported child behavior was assessed by the Infant and Toddler Social Emotional Adjustment Scale. Observed child behavior was coded with the Revised Family Observation Schedule. Cognitive, language, and motor skills were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III.
   Results Mean gestational age of infants was 28.5 weeks (SD = 2.1), and mothers' mean age was 30.6 years (SD = 5.8). A total of 162 families (n = 196 infants) were allocated to intervention and 161 families (n = 188 infants) received care-as-usual. There was no significant adjusted difference between treatment groups on dysregulation (0.2; 95% CI 2.5 to 3.0, P = .9) externalizing (0.3; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2, P = .8), internalizing (-1.5; 95% CI 4.3 to 1.3, P = .3), observed aversive (0.00; -0.04 to 0.04, P = .9), or nonaversive behavior (-0.01; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03, P = .7). Intervention children scored significantly higher on cognition (3.5; 95% CI 0.2-6.8, P = .04) and motor skill (5.5; 95% CI 2.5-8.4, P < .001), and approached significance on language (3.8; 95% CI 0.3 to 7.9, P = .07).
   Conclusions Baby Triple P for Preterm Infants increases cognitive and motor skills but does not impact behavior. The results are evidence that hospital-based interventions can improve some developmental outcomes for infants <32 weeks.

AB Objective To assess internalizing and externalizing symptoms as risk factors for suicidal behaviour and suicide among adolescents and young adults. Method We conducted a systematic review of articles published until January 2017. We identified 26 883 potential papers; 1701 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 1479 were excluded because of methodological reasons. Diverse meta-analyses were performed for each group of symptoms. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) or beta coefficients for categorical variables, and effect size (ES) were calculated for continuous variables. Results Finally, 41 studies were included, involving participants aged 12-26 years for a systematic review, and 24 articles were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that youths with any internalizing (ES = 0.93) or externalizing symptoms (ES = 0.76 and OR = 2.59) were more likely to attempt suicide in future. This effect was also seen in depression symptoms (OR = 6.58 and ES = 1.00), legal problems (OR = 3.36), and anxiety (ES = 0.65). Conclusion Reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms are predictors of suicide behaviour in young people; therefore, the detection and management of these symptoms in young populations could be a crucial strategy for preventing suicidality in this group.

AB Although early life experiences of language and parenting are critical for children's development, large home observation studies of both domains are scarce in the psychological literature, presumably because of their considerable costs to the participants and researchers. Here, we used digital audio-recorders to unobtrusively observe 107 children, aged 2.03 to 3.99 years (M = 2.77, SD = 0.55), and their families over 3 days (M = 15.06 hr per day, SD = 1.87). The recording software estimated the total number of words that a child heard over the course of a day. In addition, we transcribed six 5-min excerpts per family (i.e., 30 min overall) to extract estimates of children's and their parents' lexical diversity, positive and critical parenting, and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We found that home language input (i.e., number of words and lexical diversity) was positively associated with children's cognitive ability and lexical diversity but not with their behaviors. In addition, we observed that home language input varied as much within as between families across days (intraclass correlation = .47). By comparison, parenting predicted children's behavioral outcomes but was not related to their cognitive or lexical ability. Overall, our findings suggest that home language input affects child development in cognition and language, while positive and parenting informs their behavioral development. Furthermore, we demonstrated that digital audio-recordings are useful tools for home observation studies that seek to disentangle the complex relationships between early life home environments and child development.

AB Social relationships are of vital importance for children's and adolescents' development, and disruptions in these relationships can have serious implications. Such disruptions play a central role in both loneliness and social anxiety. Although both phenomena are closely related, they have largely been studied separately, and important questions have remained unanswered concerning how both go together within and across time. Multilevel meta-analyses were performed on 102 cross-sectional studies, published between 1981 and 2016, including 41,776 participants (39% males) with a mean age of 15.59 years. Longitudinal associations were examined in 10 studies, including 3,995 participants (46% males), using a novel technique that enables the examination of such associations even when these were not reported in the original empirical studies. Results indicated a strong, positive cross-sectional association between loneliness and social anxiety symptoms. This associations did not systematically differ in strength across childhood and adolescence. Moreover, results showed that loneliness and social anxiety symptoms were reciprocally associated over time. To conclude, loneliness and social anxiety symptoms are positively associated both within and across time, and across childhood and adolescence. Breaking this vicious cycle is of great importance, as both phenomena may be associated with profound problems in multiple domains of youth development. Moreover, failing to pay attention to both loneliness and social anxiety symptoms might substantially reduce the effectiveness of intervention programs focusing on either of the two.

AB Body dissatisfaction is a significant mental health symptom present in adolescent girls and boys. However, it is often either disregarded in adolescent boys or examined using assessments that may not resonate with males. The present study addresses these issues, examining the manifestation, etiology, and correlates of 3 facets of body dissatisfaction in adolescent boys. Adolescent male twins aged 16- to 17-years-old from the Swedish Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development were included along with a female comparison group: 915 monozygotic and 671 dizygotic same-sex twins. Body dissatisfaction was defined using measures of height dissatisfaction, muscle dissatisfaction, and the body dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-BD). We examined the prevalence of body dissatisfaction, whether the facets of body dissatisfaction were phenotypically and etiologically distinct, and associations with specific externalizing and internalizing symptoms. For boys, muscle dissatisfaction scores were greater than height dissatisfaction scores. Results also indicated that height and muscle dissatisfaction were phenotypically and etiologically distinct from the EDI-BD. Unique associations were observed with externalizing and internalizing symptoms: muscle dissatisfaction with symptoms of bulimia nervosa and the EDI-BD with internalizing symptoms, body mass index, and drive for thinness. The facets of body dissatisfaction were also largely distinct in girls and unique between-sex associations with externalizing and internalizing symptoms emerged. Overall, male-oriented aspects of body dissatisfaction are distinct from female-oriented aspects of body dissatisfaction. To capture the full picture of male body dissatisfaction, multiple facets must be addressed.

DT Article
DE Firearms; Adolescents; Youth violence; Mental health
ID RISK; COMORBIDITY; COMMUNITIES
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine multiple ways youth may access firearms among a sample of urban, mountain west youth, and explore whether youth reporting various types of violence involvement and other behavioral or mental health factors have differential access to firearms compared with youth who do not report these issues.
   Methods: A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted among adolescents aged 10-17 years and one of their parents. The main outcomes were youth firearm access and possession and associated violence and behavioral and mental health factors. Bivariate and binomial logistic regression, controlling for demographic factors, was used to determine associations and predictors.
   Results: One thousand one hundred youth and 730 parents participated. Nearly half of youth were male; 58.2% were Hispanic, 24.7% non-Hispanic black, 10.5% multiracial, 3.9% other, and 2.5% white. About 20% were categorized as having potential access to firearms (i.e., youth knows how and/or where to access firearms); 1.9% possessed a firearm. Analyses revealed that being physically aggressive (odds ratio [OR] 2.7), risk for future violence perpetration (OR 2.6), using alcohol (OR 2.0), having internalizing symptoms (OR 1.9), peer problems (OR 1.9), and older age (OR 1.26) predicted youth's possible access to firearms. Marijuana use (OR 9.9), parental gun ownership (OR 6.5), and reported delinquency (OR 8.3) predicted youth's firearm possession.
   Conclusions: Youth with potential firearm access demonstrate more violence risk and involvement, and other behavioral or mental health issues than youth without potential firearm access. Parental firearm ownership predicts youth firearm possession. It is important for both health-care providers and parents to recognize these potentially lethal associations to provide appropriate counseling. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Purpose: Emerging scientific evidence and media accounts document an association between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and deleterious mental health outcomes in adulthood. This study focuses on exploring the relationship between mTBI and increased risk for psychopathology in a sample of adolescent youth.
   Methods: Longitudinal data from adolescent youth aged 10-18 years (n = 1,827) from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods are analyzed. Multivariate negative binomial regression models are calculated to examine the relationship between mTBI and aggressive behavior, anxiety/depression, attention problems, somatic symptoms, and delinquency.
   Results: Participants with a mTBI were significantly more likely to demonstrate an increase in symptoms of aggressive behavior, anxiety/depression, and delinquency while controlling for several confounders and prior levels of psychopathology.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that mTBI is an important environmental risk factor for increases in psychopathology during adolescence. Health professionals should begin to consider screening children for mTBI to better address the influence of this type of victimization experience on the emergence of symptoms for internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence.

AB Objective: This study investigated therapeutic alliance (TA) trajectories, their demographic and symptomatic predictors, and associations with outcome in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. Method: The sample included 89 Turkish children (M-age = 6.87, SD = 2.11. 46% girls) with internalizing (37.11%), externalizing (21.14%). and comorbid (38.20%) problems; 12% of the children were in the nonclinical range. Independent raters coded 328 sessions from different phases of treatment using the Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance Scale. Outcome measures were collected at intake and termination (Children's Behavior Checklist and Teacher Rating Form). Results: Multilevel growth curve modeling indicated that TA showed a quadratic trend (high-low-high) over the course of treatment. The shape-of-change methodology indicated three subgroups following a stable pattern, a slow and an accelerated quadratic TA trajectory. Externalizing problems (teacher report) negatively predicted average TA strength. Boys and children with internalizing problems showed a declining TA trajectory, whereas children with externalizing problems (teacher report) showed an upward TA trajectory. Multivariate multiple regression analyses showed that the average TA (i.e., intercept) and the positive quadratic slope (the high-low-high pattern) positively predicted changes in internalizing and externalizing problems (teacher report). Discussion: This study was the first to show the course of TA development in psychodynamic child psychotherapy, identify a number of child characteristics that facilitate and impede TA. Investigating both the strength and patterns of TA development when examining associations with outcome is important.

AB To test reciprocal associations among internalizing symptoms (depression and social anxiety), using alcohol and cannabis to cope. and use-related problems. Method: The study utilized a community sample (N = 387, 55% female; majority non-Hispanic Caucasian (83.1%) or African American (9.1%) and a longitudinal design that spanned 17 to 20 years of age, and distinguished within- and between-person associations using latent curve models with structured residuals. Results: Reciprocal prospective within-person associations were supported for alcohol, such that elevated depression symptoms were associated with increased alcohol coping motivates 1 year later, which, in turn. was associated with subsequent increased depression symptoms. Bidirectional associations were not supported for social anxiety, although high levels of social anxiety were associated with elevated levels of coping drinking 1 year later. Cannabis coping motives were associated with exacerbation of depression. but not social anxiety symptoms, 1 year later. Between- and within-person contemporaneous associations suggested that depression and social anxiety were more strongly associated with coping than social/enhancement motives, and that coping motives were associated with use-related problems. Conclusion: Findings suggest that alcohol coping motivates exacerbate rather than ameliorate depression symptoms, which, in turn. leads to greater reliance on alcohol to cope. There was more consistent support for associations with substance use-related problems for depression than for social anxiety. Both between- and within-person associations may be useful for identifying targets and timing of coping-oriented interventions.

AB Background: Previous studies indicate that youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have abnormal activation in brain regions important for emotion processing. It is unknown whether symptom improvement is accompanied by normative changes in these regions. This study identified neural changes associated with symptom improvement with the long-term goal of identifying malleable targets for interventions.
   Methods: A total of 80 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were collected, including 20 adolescents with PTSD (ages 9-17) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects, each scanned before and after a 5-month period. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy was provided to the PTSD group to ensure improvement in symptoms. Whole brain voxel-wise activation and region of interest analyses of facial expression task data were conducted to identify abnormalities in the PTSD group versus HC at baseline (BL), and neural changes correlated with symptom improvement from BL to EOS of study (EOS).
   Results: At BL, the PTSD group had abnormally elevated activation in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and medial frontal cortex compared to HC. From BL to EOS, PTSD symptoms improved an average of 39%. Longitudinal improvement in symptoms of PTSD was associated with decreasing activation in posterior cingulate, mid-cingulate, and hippocampus, while improvement in dissociative symptoms was correlated with decreasing activation in the amygdala.
   Conclusions: Abnormalities in emotion-processing brain networks in youth with PTSD normalize when symptoms improve, demonstrating neural plasticity of these regions in young patients and the importance of early intervention.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently experience comorbid internalizing symptoms. The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales-Parent Version (RCADS-P) is a frequently used measure of anxiety and depression in children, though its psychometric properties remain unexamined in children referred for ADHD specifically. The present study evaluated the RCADS-P in 372 children (age 7-12 years; 68% male) referred for evaluation at an ADHD specialty clinic (89% met criteria for ADHD). In addition to the RCADS-P, parents completed the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale and Child Behavior Checklist and were administered the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children semistructured diagnostic interview. Teacher ratings were available for approximately half of the sample. Factor structure, reliability, convergent/discriminant validity, and sensitivity/specificity were examined. Results supported the six-factor structure of the RCADS-P. The RCADS-P demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity with other parent ratings and, to a somewhat lesser extent, teacher ratings. Children with an internalizing diagnosis had higher RCADS-P scores than children without an internalizing diagnosis. Finally, the RCADS-P had good-to-excellent diagnostic efficiency, and a total sum score of 25 had excellent sensitivity and fair specificity. Findings provide psychometric support for the RCADS-P in children with ADHD.

AB Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) causes a broad spectrum of disease. This study aims to explore the developmental, behavioral, and social-emotional aspects of preschool-aged children with PCD. Fourteen PCD, 17 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and 15 healthy subjects were enrolled. Developmental features of the participants were evaluated with Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Parents of participants filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The number of children screened positive for developmental delay was statistically higher in the PCD group. Higher numbers of children with PCD were screened positive for developmental delay in communication and problem-solving domains. Delay in fine motor skill domain was more common in children with PCD and CF compared to healthy subjects. There was no difference among the three groups in terms of gross motor and personal-social development. None of the children in all three groups was shown to have social-emotional problems. In CBCL, patients with CF had higher internalizing problem scores. Externalizing and total problem scores did not differ between the three groups. However, among PCD patients, children with developmental delay on more than one domain had higher externalizing and total problem scores.Conclusion: The current study revealed that positive screening for developmental delay is more common in preschool-aged PCD patients compared to patients with CF and healthy children.

AB The German adaptation of the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children - IV (WISC-IV) is widely used to assess cognitive abilities in children and youth. To date, the psychometric properties of the WISC-IV have rarely been studied in clinical settings. This study aimed at providing data on the reliability and validity of the German WISC-IV in routine psychological assessment in German centers of social pediatrics (Sozialpddiatrische Zentren) that offer interdisciplinary assessment and intervention for children and youth with developmental disorders, disabilities, and psychological problems. In total, 649 children aged 6-13 years were tested with the WISC-IV core tests. Sociodemographic data, ICD-10 diagnoses, and - for subsamples - the results of further intelligence tests (K-ABC, SON-R 21/2-7) and behavior ratings (CBCL/4-18) were collected from clinical records. Most common diagnoses were specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills (F81.x; 44%), specific developmental disorders of speech and language (F80.x; 34%), and hyperkinetic disorders (F90.x; 27 %). The WISC-IV was used in clinical settings for a wide variety of clinical groups and levels of cognitive development. IQ (M = 92.5, SD = 15.9, range 46 - 136) was significantly lower than in the standardization sample (p < .01, d = -0.47). The profile of index scores was characterized by tower values for Working Memory and Processing Speed (small effect). Mean differences from pairwise comparisons of index scores were comparable to the data provided in the manual. The split-half reliability of core tests ranged from .75 to .96. The reliability of the indices Verbal Comprehension (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning (PRI), and Working Memory (WMI) was >.91 for all age groups. Full-scale IQ was significantly correlated with the K-ABC Mental Processing Composite (r = .80) and the Total Score of the SON-R 21/2-7 (r = .63). Mean differences were not significant. Divergent validity was supported by nonsignificant correlations with the CBCU4-18 Total Score and Externalizing and Internalizing Problem Scores. In summary, most psychometric properties reported in the German WISC-IV manual could be confirmed under routine conditions of clinical assessment in centers of social pediatrics. When selecting a test of intelligence for clinical purposes, the limitations of the WISC-IV (e. g., high linguistic and cultural demand) should nevertheless be taken into account. Generalization of the results is limited by the highly selected nature of the sample.

AB Consistent evidence links neighborhood socioeconomic status with children's development outcomes. However, it is less clear precisely whether or when neighborhoods are most strongly associated with children's socioemotional functioning and achievement. Couched in bioecological and developmental theory, this study tests two models of neighborhood effects: childhood and adolescent exposure. We used the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, a longitudinal, multi-cohort study of children in Chicago in the 1990s and 2000s. We examined two cohorts of children, early childhood and adolescence, to compare the relative associations between neighborhood socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage, as measured by U.S. Census data. We conducted multilevel latent growth models (MLGMs), investigating children's initial status and growth in reading, internalizing and externalizing behaviors across the three developmental periods by neighborhood characteristics, controlling for a rich set of childand family-level covariates. Results provided some support for the childhood and adolescent exposure models, but not precisely as hypothesized.

AB Undocumented immigrants concentrate in ethnic enclaves, but little is known about the implications of living in such neighborhoods for children of undocumented immigrants. Using data on Mexican-origin children from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey and the decennial census, this paper examines the influence of co-ethnic concentrated neighborhoods on children's behavioral functioning, and the extent to which parental nativity and documentation status moderate the neighborhood effects. Multilevel linear regression models show that the proportion of co-ethnics in the neighborhood apparently has no influence on Mexican-origin children. However, cross-level interactions reveal that the neighborhood context has differential effects by parental documentation status. The higher the percentage of co-ethnics in the neighborhood, the lower (better) the externalizing scores for children of undocumented immigrants, a pattern not observed for children of US-born or documented parents. The mechanism through which co-ethnic enclaves benefit children of undocumented Mexican immigrants deserves future research.

AB Objectives: Internalizing mental health issues co-occur with pediatric chronic pain at high rates and are linked to worse pain and functioning. Although the field has prioritized anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, little is known about co-occurring depression and chronic pain in youth, despite its high prevalence. The purpose of this narrative review was to examine the existing literature on the co-occurrence of pediatric chronic pain and depressive disorders and symptoms and propose a conceptual model of mutual maintenance to guide future research. Methods: The literature from both fields of pediatric pain and developmental psychology were searched to review the evidence for the co-occurrence of pediatric chronic pain and depression. Conceptual models of co-occurring mental health issues and chronic pain, as well as child depression, were reviewed. From both literatures, we provide evidence for a number of proposed child, parent, and neurobiological factors that may serve to mutually maintain both conditions over time. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a conceptual model of mutual maintenance and highlight several areas for future research in this area. Results: Evidence was found for the prevalence of depression in pediatric chronic pain as well as the co-occurrence of both conditions. The key mutually maintaining factors identified and proposed included neurobiological, intrapersonal (eg, cognitive biases, sleep disturbances, emotion regulation, and behavioral inactivation), and interpersonal (eg, parent mental health and pain, genes, and parenting) factors. Discussion: Given the dearth of research on mutual maintenance in this area, this review and conceptual model could drive future research in this area. We argue for the development of tailored treatments for this unique population of youth to improve outcomes.

AB Although the effects of peer substance use on adolescent substance use are well documented, little is known about whether internalizing behaviors-anxiety and depression-exacerbate or attenuate the link between peer substance use and substance use. The present study uses data from the 12- and 15-year-old cohorts from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) and multivariate generalized regression models to examine whether anxiety and/or depression moderate peer effects on adolescent substance use. Results indicate that adolescents who exhibited high anxiety and depressive symptoms are uninfluenced by their peers' substance use, but those who exhibit lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms use substances more when they have more substance using peers. Our findings support social learning and peer contagion explanations of substance use, but suggest these processes are contingent on current emotional states. Interventions should consider the differential effects of peers given one's level of anxiety and depression.

AB Family factors and adolescent life satisfaction have profound effects on later behavior. The present study examined the effects of family cohesion and life satisfaction on internalizing (depression and self-esteem) and externalizing (deviance) outcomes among adolescents. Moreover, this study also viewed internalizing outcomes as conduits that channeled the effects of family cohesion and life satisfaction on later adolescent deviance. Using the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP), results indicated that the family cohesion and life satisfaction of Taiwanese adolescents declined with time, and this, in turn, led to negative life outcomes, such as higher levels of depression and deviance, and lower levels of self-esteem. In addition to the direct relationship between family cohesion and adolescent outcomes, family cohesion also had indirect effects on self-esteem and depression through change in life satisfaction. Also, initial life satisfaction is indirectly related to later deviance through change in family cohesion. Limitations and implications are also discussed.

AB Background Comorbid conditions are very common in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can affect school performance, adaptive skills and peer relationships. Comorbid conditions place strain on the family as well as the individual with ASD. This project aimed to determine the affect of comorbid conditions over and above child and family characteristics. Methods The present authors examined 3,055 cases of children with ASD who had varying numbers of comorbid conditions (i.e., ADHD, depression, anxiety or behaviour problems). Results Multiple comorbid conditions did have a unique impact on difficulties accessing services. A greater number of comorbid conditions impacted daily activity participation, but not a family's receipt of mental health care or respite, work changes or number of weekly hours dedicated to caring for a child with ASD. Conclusions Families, practitioners, paraprofessionals and educators of children with autism should address comorbid conditions to ensure both child and family well-being.

AB ObjectivesTo examine the relationship between grandparenting styles and grandchildren's emotions and behaviors, while controlling for parenting styles, and to compare the effects of grandparenting styles and parenting styles on children's behavioral problems in China.MethodsA sample of 765 children, with a mean age of 12.02 years (SD=0.38), participated in this cross-sectional study in Jintan city, Jiangsu province, China. All participants completed the self-report measures of emotions and behaviors, grandparenting styles, and sociodemographic variables.ResultsResults showed that the well-recognized parenting styles (Care, Indifference, Overprotection, and Autonomy), when implemented by grandparents (grandparenting styles) and parents (parenting styles), had different patterns of effects on children's emotional and behavioral problems. Grandparenting styles, especially grandparental Care and Overprotection, were positively related to emotional and behavioral problems, while parental Care was negatively related to children's externalizing behaviors.ConclusionsThese results highlight the importance of grandparenting styles in grandchildren's development. Practitioners working with grandparents and grandchildren need to recognize the complexity of grandparent-grandchild relationships and implement suitable interventions to meet the family needs.

AB Previous studies have reported altered fear circuitry function during fear conditioning in highly anxious individuals and in adults with a history of severe childhood adversity; less is known regarding younger populations and more common forms of adversity. We investigated fear circuitry functioning in healthy youths with histories of high (HH) or low (LH) chronic harsh parenting and high (HA) or low (LA) anxiety levels. 84 youths aged 13-16 performed an fMRI fear conditioning task. HH displayed decreased selective medial temporal lobe de-activations to CS + > CS - relative to LH. In addition, we found less amygdala-insula connectivity in HH vs LH. Interestingly, we observed distinct patterns of anxiety differences in amygdala-rostral ACC connectivity and subjective fear ratings depending on harsh parenting levels, suggesting a history of harsh parenting is linked with unique neural and behavioral anxious manifestations, which are different from anxiety manifestations in a context of low adversity.

AB The current study examines the continuity in comorbidity between substance use and internalizing mental health problems from adolescence to adulthood and investigates the general and specific predictors of comorbidity across development. Participants were drawn from the Seattle Social Development Project (N=808), a gender-balanced, ethnically diverse longitudinal panel. Structural equation modeling was used to examine risk factors for comorbid substance use and internalizing problems in family and peer social environments; substance use- and mental health-specific social environments (family tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use; family history of depression); and individual risk factors (behavioral disinhibition). Latent factors were created for comorbid substance use and mental health problems at ages 13-14 and comorbidity of substance abuse and dependence symptoms and mental health disorder symptoms at ages 30-33 and included indicators of anxiety, depression, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana problems. Comorbid problems in adolescence predicted later comorbidity of disorders in adulthood. In addition, family tobacco environment and behavioral disinhibition predicted adolescent comorbidity, while family history of depression was associated with adult comorbidity. Finally, family and peer substance use in adolescence predicted substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana) both in adolescence and adulthood. The pattern of results suggests that comorbidity in adolescence continues into adulthood and is predicted by both general and behavior-specific environmental experiences during adolescence. Findings clarify the etiology of comorbid internalizing and substance use problems and suggest potential preventive intervention targets in adolescence to curb the development of comorbidity in adulthood.

AB Background: Neighborhood greenness appears to be beneficial to human health. However, there are few studies on the relationship between greenness of children's residential communities and their neurobehavioral health.
   Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between neighborhood greenness of children's residential area and their neurobehavioral health.
   Methods: We used a population-representative sample of school children (n = 1817) from 2012 and 2013 in South Korea. Parents or guardians of children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their children's neurobehavioral health. As a measurement for greenness, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) at a 30-m resolution was retrieved from the Landsat satellite data operated by NASA. The MSAVI values were categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, high greenness) and each child was assigned the mean MSAVI within a 1.6-km radius of residence. We applied survey regressions of the CBCL transformed scores on the 3 levels of greenness, controlling for age, sex, physical activity, monthly family income, exposure to second-hand smoke, exposure to NO2, and blood lead level.
   Results: High greenness was associated with a lower Total CBCL score compared to low greenness ( -2.33, 95% CI, -4.10 to -0.56). Externalizing Behavior showed a slightly stronger association with greenness than did Internalizing Behavior. The inverse relationship with greenness was strongest for Attention Problems (-1.32; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.06). The magnitudes of the association were strongest when the buffer distance was 1600 m.
   Conclusions: Greenness of residential neighborhood was associated with lower problematic behavior scores in children, especially aggressive behaviors and attention problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated whether bullying victimization and parental involvement were associated with internalizing distress, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and substance use in Jamaican adolescents as well as whether parental involvement moderated the relation between bullying victimization and measures of psychological and behavioral distress. Analyses were based on a sample of 1,595 adolescents who were participating in the 2010 Global School-Based Student Health Survey. Data were collected using a complex survey design. Regression models were estimated using weighted data, which allowed us to draw conclusions about the population of Jamaican adolescents. Consistent with findings from international studies, bullying victimization was uniquely and positively associated with feelings of loneliness, sleep difficulties due to worry, smoking frequency, and suicidality for both male and female adolescents as well as with alcohol use frequency for female adolescents. Our pattern of findings also suggested that parental involvement is a more robust correlate of psychological and behavioral adjustment for female adolescents. Female adolescents who reported higher levels of parental involvement were less lonely and less likely to consider or plan suicide. For boys, parental involvement was only negatively related to loneliness. Finally, we found evidence that parental involvement moderated the relation between bullying victimization and cigarette use and considering suicide, although the latter finding was at the level of a nonsignificant trend. Our findings suggest parental involvement may attenuate the relation between bullying victimization and considering suicide but may strengthen the relation between bullying victimization and smoking. We discuss our findings in the context of Jamaican cultural socialization and with an appreciation for the social challenges faced by adolescents experiencing bullying victimization.

AB Few studies have examined the longitudinal association between sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms and internalizing symptoms, and no study has examined the potentially bidirectional associations between SCT and internalizing symptoms. The present study used a short-term longitudinal design to examine the directionality of the associations between SCT, depressive, and anxious symptoms in children. Teachers of 188 children in 1st to 6th grades (6-13years of age; 47% boys) provided ratings of children's SCT, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the fall school semester (T1) and again 6 months later (T2). Children in 3rd to 6th grades (n =133) provided ratings of anxiety and depressive symptoms at both time points. Cross-lagged panel models examining the longitudinal associations between SCT, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were conducted controlling for sex and grade, with separate models for teacher- and child-reported internalizing symptoms. SCT symptoms at Time 1 (T1) predicted increased depressive symptoms at T2, with findings consistent across teacher-rated depression and child-rated depression. Depression at T1 did not predict SCT at T2. SCT symptoms at T1 also predicted increased teacher-rated anxiety at T2 but not child-rated anxiety. Finally, child-rated anxiety at T1 predicted increased SCT at T2. Findings from this study provide the first evidence that SCT symptoms predict subsequent depressive symptoms and not the reverse. Associations between SCT and anxiety are more nuanced, with results differing based on the informant. Additional studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings across longer developmental periods with more time points and to examine mechanisms of the associations between SCT and internalizing symptoms in children.

AB Purpose: This study examined a developmental model that links affect-regulation difficulties in childhood with three dimensions of alexithymia in adolescence (difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and externally oriented thinking) and substance use and depression in adulthood, while accounting for cumulative contextual risk in childhood, and testing potential gender moderation. Methods: Multiple group path analyses were conducted using data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (N = 6963). Analyses used data collected during prenatal/birth, childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood periods. Results: Our examination of early precursors for alexithymia indicated that the associations of affect-regulation problems in childhood with alexithymia were stronger for girls, potentially putting girls with affect-regulation difficulties in childhood at higher risk for developing alexithymia in adolescence. The associations of cumulative contextual risk in childhood with alexithymia, substance use disorder, and depression diagnosis in adulthood were significant for both girls and boys. Our findings in regard to substance use and depression disorders revealed that alexithymia in adolescence predicted depression diagnosis in adulthood, particularly due to a contribution from the alexithymia domain of 'difficulties identifying feelings.' However, none of the alexithymia domains was directly associated with substance use disorder in adulthood. Conclusions: Our study contributes to research that links alexithymia with difficulties in affect regulation and cumulative contextual risk in childhood, yielding findings that may be relevant for preventive interventions.

AB Background: Many children 4 to 6 years old exhibit compulsive-like behavior, often with comorbid Tourette symptoms, making this age group critical for investigating the effects of having comorbid Tourette symptoms with compulsive-like behavior. However, these effects have not yet been elucidated: it is unclear whether having comorbid tics with compulsive-like behavior leads to lower quality of life. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the effect of comorbid Tourette symptoms on distress caused by compulsive-like behavior in very young children.
   Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to guardians of children aged 4 to 6 attending any of the 59 public preschools in a certain ward in Tokyo, Japan. The questionnaire contained questions on the presence of Tourette symptoms, the presence of specific motor and vocal tics, frequency/intensity of compulsive-like behavior, and the distress caused by compulsive-like behavior, which was rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Additionally, questions on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits, internalizing behavior traits, and externalizing behavior traits were included in the questionnaire as possible confounders of distress caused by compulsive-like behavior. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were conducted to compare the distress caused by compulsive-like behavior and frequency/intensity of compulsive-like behavior between children in the Tourette symptoms group and the non-Tourette symptoms group. Furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the effects of the independent variables on distress caused by compulsive-like behavior. Another stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between distress caused by compulsive-like behavior and the presence of five specific motor and vocal tics.
   Results: Of the 675 eligible participants, distress due to compulsive-like behavior was significantly higher in children in the Tourette symptoms group compared to the non-Tourette symptoms group (2.00 vs 1.00, P < 0.001). Stepwise regression analysis showed that frequency/intensity of compulsive-like behavior, being in the Tourette symptoms group, ASD traits, and internalizing behavior traits were predictors of distress due to compulsive-like behavior. Two specific tics, repetitive noises and sounds and repetitive neck, shoulder, or trunk movements, were significant predictors of distress due to compulsive-like behavior.
   Conclusions: Comorbid Tourette symptoms may worsen distress caused by compulsive-like behavior in children 4 to 6 years old, and specific motor and vocal tics may lead to greater distress.

AB Effective peer interaction is fundamental to social development, cognitive development, and academic success. Young children's early exposure to and development of social competence begins in the home and is further developed upon entry into early childhood programmes. In the United States, where early childhood programmes serve increasingly diverse families, discrepancies between families and teachers in relation to the social competencies valued may exist. This study compares parent and teacher perspectives of children's social competence (i.e. social skills and problem behaviours) and whether similarities and differences in perspectives are associated with children's classification as an emergent bilingual or monolingual native English speaker. Findings indicate statistically significant differences in parent and teacher ratings on the empathy, externalizing, and hyperactivity subscales for bilingual children and on the empathy, self-control, internalizing, externalizing, and hyperactivity subscales for monolingual English-speaking children. Recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB The study of aggression in juvenile offenders, a high priority from clinical and public health standpoints, depends on properly measuring and modeling aggression. The Aggressive Behaviors scale from the Youth Self-Report (YSR-AB) has been widely used to measure youth aggression, often functioning as a stand-alone scale in analyses (of note, even when analyzed alone, the YSR-AB must be administered as part of the full YSR to retain its integrity). However, knowledge of its factor analytic structure among juvenile offenders is lacking. We addressed this gap. Factor analyses of YSR-AB data from 310 probation youth (M age = 16 years, 90% African American, 66% male) supported a hierarchical structure, with 2 lower order factors distinguishing aggression targeting others (e.g., physical attack) from related symptoms (e.g., mood swings). The targeted aggression items showed significantly stronger associations with other externalizing symptoms than did the related symptom items; the opposite pattern emerged for internalizing symptoms. In further support of the convergent and discriminant validity of these subscales, the related symptoms were differentially linked to gender, with females reporting significantly higher levels than males. The hierarchical solution appeared to be stable over 1 year. Implications for interpreting past findings and conducting future research with the YSR-AB are discussed.

AB Adolescents living in rural regions of the United States face substantial barriers to accessing mental health services, creating needs for more accessible, nonstigmatizing, briefer interventions. Research suggests that single-session "growth mind-set" interventions (GM-SSIs)-which teach the belief that personal traits are malleable through effort-may reduce internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. However, GM-SSIs have not been evaluated among rural youth, and their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems have not been assessed within a single trial, rendering their relative benefits for different problem types unclear. We examined whether a computerized GM-SSI could reduce depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problems in female adolescents from rural areas of the United States. Tenth-grade female adolescents (N= 222, M age = 15.2, 38% White, 25% Black, 29% Hispanic) from 4 rural, low-income high schools in the southeastern United States were randomized to receive a 45-min GM-SSI or a computer-based active control program, teaching healthy sexual behaviors. Young women self-reported depression symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problem behaviors at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Relative to the female students in the control group, the students receiving the GM-SSI reported modest but significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms (d = .23) and likelihood of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (d = .29) from baseline to follow-up. GM-SSI effects were nonsignificant for social anxiety symptoms, although a small effect size emerged in the hypothesized direction (d = .21), and nonsignificant for change in conduct problems (d = .01). A free-of-charge 45-min GM-SSI may help reduce internalizing distress, especially depression-but not conduct problems-in rural female adolescents.

AB The negative effects of institutionalization on children's wellbeing and psychological adjustment have been extensively documented. Throughout the world, particularly in developing countries, many children in residential child care institutions known as orphanages have parents, and it is not clear how this situation affects the psychological adjustment of institutionalized children. This study aimed at investigating specifically whether institutionalization impacts negatively children's psychological adjustment defined in terms of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and self-esteem and whether having living parents or not has an additional influence. Children were recruited in Rwanda from seven registered institutions and six primary schools. Ninety-six institutionalized children (48 orphans, who lost at least one parent, and 46 non-orphans, who had both parents living) and 84 non-institutionalized children, who lived in a family (28 orphans and 56 non-orphans) aged 9 to 16 participated. The caregivers or parents assessed externalizing and internalizing behavior problems using the Child Behavior Checklist. Children completed the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Controlling for gender, age, and residential area, analyses of covariance revealed that institutionalized children had significantly more externalizing behavior problems than had non-institutionalized children. In addition, non-orphans had more externalizing behavior problems than had orphans, regardless of whether they lived in an institution or not. There were no group differences in internalizing behavior problems, but there was a significant main effect of the parental living status (orphans vs. non-orphans) and a significant interaction effect between parental living status and institutionalization on self-esteem. Self-esteem of non-orphans in families was significantly higher than self-esteem of the other groups. This should be considered when making the decision to place a child in an institution, especially when her or his parents are still living, and when developing supportive programs for children without adequate parental care.

AB This study aimed to analyze the levels of personal aggression and victimization, ethnic-cultural aggression and victimization, self-esteem, empathy, social skills and gender in adolescents as potential predictors of bullying in Spain and Ecuador. The wide pluricultural sample comprised secondary education students from both countries (N = 25,190, average age = 13.92, SD = 1.306; N-spain = 14,437; N-Ecuador = 10,753), who took part in the study by filling in a self-report. The results revealed that predictive models of bullying for both countries explain 50-70% of variance. A transnational predictive pattern of personal victimization can be observed based on the levels of ethnic-cultural victimization, ethnic-cultural aggression, personal aggression, self-deprecation, and affective empathy. A transnational predictive pattern of personal aggression is evidenced depending on the levels of ethnic-cultural aggression, personal victimization, self-deprecation, ethnic-cultural victimization, and the fact of being female. We concluded that bullying can largely be predicted by involvement in ethnic-cultural discrimination. These results are discussed, and educational inferences are drawn for prevention.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) frequently serve as antecedents to severe negative behaviors, particularly non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and the development of pathological personality traits (PPTs) during adolescence. We explored the impact of childhood adversity on non-suicidal self-harm as mediated by pathological personality traits among 782 Filipino adolescents from 18 to 24 years old studying in Metro Manila. Participants completed a battery of tests designed to measure ACEs, NSSI and PPTs. Findings showed that the association between ACEs and NSSI is partially mediated by PPTs. The correlation between ACEs and NSSI remained significant even after controlling for PPTs. This suggests that both ACEs and PPTs may be viewed as proximal causes of NSSI, and that clinical interventions for NSSIs should focus on both the continuing trauma of ACEs and the influence of PPTs.

AB BackgroundMaternal mental health is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children, and the risk is partly explained by the negative impact of maternal depression on caregiving. The role of mental health in other family members, who in many contexts also provide substantial caregiving, has received far less attention. We examined the impact of grandmothers' emotional symptoms, whose role in child care is increasing across the world, on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in grandchildren from a three-generation birth cohort study.MethodsProspective data from three generations in two birth cohorts 22years apart (1982 and 2004) in Pelotas, Brazil, were used (n=92). Mental health in grandmothers and parents was assessed using the Self-Reported Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Grandchildren were members of the 2004 birth cohort, and behavioural and emotional problems were measured using the Child-Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) at age 4years.ResultsGrandmothers' symptoms were associated with more emotional and behavioural problems in grandchildren after adjustment for confounding factors. The size of the associations between grandmothers' and grandchildren mental health symptoms was comparable to the associations between maternal emotional symptoms and children emotional and behavioural problems. There was no evidence for associations with paternal symptoms. These effects were substantially stronger for maternal compared to paternal grandmothers.ConclusionsIn some contexts, grandmothers' mental health may be as important to grandchild emotional and behavioural development as maternal mental health. Interventions to improve the mental health of grandmothers, as well as parents, may be important to child mental health.

AB Little is known about the predictors of outcome from intensive residential treatment of OCD. This study aimed to examine age, gender, and baseline OCD severity, as well as measures of comorbid anxiety and depressive, internalizing/externalizing, and inattention symptoms, as predictors of treatment outcome in adolescents receiving intensive residential treatment for OCD. The sample comprised 314 adolescents aged 13-17 years with treatment-resistant OCD and a Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Self-Report (CY-BOCS-SR) total score >= 16. Bivariate and multiple regression models were used to evaluate the predictors of continuous OCD severity outcome and treatment response. Results of the bivariate regression analyses of predictors demonstrated that length of treatment, pre-treatment OCD severity, and symptoms of anxiety and depression significantly predicted post-treatment OCD severity, while only symptoms of depression and anxiety predicted treatment response. When including all predictors in the same model, only baseline OCD severity remained a significant predictor of post-treatment OCD severity, and none of the assessed variables significantly predicted treatment response. Results indicate that low pre-treatment OCD severity predicts lower OCD severity following treatment, although it did not predict treatment response.

AB Beginning at puberty, prevalence of depression in females rises dramatically. The physical changes of puberty coincide with a period of social flux, during which relationships become less stable and more prone to conflict. While this social upheaval is normatively distressing for girls, it may be especially so for girls with cognitive styles that leave them more susceptible to depression. The present study investigated depressive symptoms at two time points during early pubertal maturation. N = 110 girls (M-age = 11.57, SD = 0.98) reported on depressive symptomology, pubertal maturation, ruminative coping style, frequency of peer conflict, and rejection sensitivity. Multivariate analyses suggest more advanced pubertal development and greater rejection sensitivity at Time 1 predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at Time 2, after accounting for baseline levels of depressive symptoms and all other social and cognitive correlates of depression. This effect was also found in early maturing girls. Menarche status was not significant. Since menarche occurs toward the end of puberty, results suggest that risk for worsening depression is not associated with completing puberty, or with menstruation itself. Rather, increases in depressive symptoms seem to be associated with physical changes that emerge early in the pubertal transition, especially for early maturing girls, paired with anticipatory concerns about social rejection.

AB Background: Among the most persistent public health problems in the United States is the gap between adolescents who need therapy for a substance use (SU) disorder and those who seek therapy. The role of parental factors (e.g., impressions of the adolescent's symptoms, sociodemographic factors) has been well documented in work examining adolescent help-seeking from professionals and paraprofessionals but has not been evaluated in studies of therapy-seeking for adolescents with SU. This study's primary objective was to identify parental sociodemographic and parent-reported clinical factors associated with therapy-seeking among parents concerned about their adolescent's SU. A secondary objective was to explore reasons why parents reported not seeking therapy and whether these reasons were associated with sociodemographic and clinical variables. Methods: We conducted a survey of 411 parents of adolescents (age 12-19) who reported elevated concern about their adolescent's SU. Parents were asked whether their adolescent had a history of therapy, and those who reported no history were asked an open-ended question about reasons why they had not sought therapy. Responses were rated by 2 independent coders and used to sort parents into 3 groups: "treaters" (those who had sought therapy), "acknowledgers" (those who acknowledged their adolescent had SU problems but did not seek therapy), and "deniers" (those who denied their adolescent had SU problems). Multinomial logistic regression examined the relationship between sociodemographic and clinical factors and group membership. Results: Multivariate analyses revealed that parent-reported SU severity, internalizing distress, and externalizing behavior problems were all associated with therapy-seeking behavior, with internationalizing distress emerging as the strongest predictor. Additionally, non-Hispanic white parents were more likely to seek therapy than minority parents. Conclusions: Parent report of symptoms, especially internalizing distress, and parental race were associated with therapy-seeking behavior, highlighting opportunities for targeted outreach to engage parents in therapy.

AB Previous research has identified experiential avoidance (EA) as related to a host of adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as borderline personality disorder, suggesting that it is a crosscutting factor for adolescent psychopathology. It remains unclear whether EA differs among adolescents with BPD compared to adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and healthy adolescents. The aims of this study were to 1) examine EA in adolescents with BPD compared to non-BPD inpatient adolescents and healthy adolescents, and 2) to evaluate whether EA has a unique relationship to borderline pathology over and above internalizing and externalizing. Self-report measures of BPD features, EA, and psychopathology were completed by 692 adolescents (64.5% female, M-age= 15.20). This sample included a group of psychiatric inpatient youth (n = 197 BPD; n = 403 non-BPD) and a group of healthy adolescents (n = 92). Results revealed that EA differed significantly across all three groups, with the highest level of EA evidenced in adolescents who had BPD. Furthermore, there was a significant, unique association between BPD symptoms and EA over afnd above internalizing and externalizing pathology. These findings pinpoint EA as an important risk marker and possible target of prevention or intervention for adolescent BPD.

AB Mindfulness has been widely linked with psychological well-being in general population. There are emerging studies supporting the relationship between adolescents' mindfulness and their mental health. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness may influence adolescents' psychological distress have only recently been explored, and more related research is still needed. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents' dispositional mindfulness and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The mediating variables were also explored in perspective of two common emotion regulation theories, which were measured through Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). DERS has been used as a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation difficulties. ERQ is also widely accepted to measure the emotion regulation process including dimensions of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Measures assessing mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological distress were administered to 1067 adolescents in mainland China. The results confirmed that adolescents' dispositional mindfulness was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. DERS, especially the sub-dimensions of Acceptance and Strategies, significantly mediated the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Whereas, ERQ including subscales of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression exerted limited mediating effect. These findings provided insights for the potential underlying mechanism between adolescents' mindfulness and psychological distress, demonstrating that DERS might be more pervasive than ERQ. Further research was suggested to explore other mediating variables underlying mindfulness and psychological distress among adolescents and develop mindfulness-based programs to improve adolescents' mindfulness and emotion regulation ability.

AB BackgroundAdolescence is a period of elevated stress sensitivity, which places adolescents at increased risk of developing mental health problems such as burnout, depression, anxiety, and externalizing problems. Early intervention of psychological needs and low-threshold care addressing such needs may prevent this dysfunctional development. Schools may provide an important environment to identify and address psychological needs. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of low-threshold school-based skills-training programs promoting the mental health of adolescents and to examine moderators of the effectiveness.MethodsA Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of two school-based skills-training programs aiming to promote mental health by improving either skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills. A multi-informant (i.e., students, parents, and trainers) and multi-method (i.e., questionnaires and physiological measurements) approach will be used to assess program targets (skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills), direct program outcomes (performance or social anxiety) and mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, internalizing and externalizing problems, self-esteem and well-being), as well as specific moderators (i.e., student, parent and program characteristics, social support, perfectionism, stressful life events, perceived parental pressure, positive parenting behavior, treatment alliance and program integrity).DiscussionThe current study will provide information on the effectiveness of school-based skills-training programs. It is of crucial importance that the school environment can provide students with effective, low-threshold intervention programs to promote adolescents' daily functioning and well-being and prevent the emergence of mental health problems that negatively affect school performance.Trial registrationDutch Trial Register number NL7438.

AB The current study is an examination of contributions of parenting styles and qualities of parent-child relationship (PCR) to Turkish children's externalizing and internalizing behaviours, with a specific focus on the moderating role of PCR (closeness and conflict) on parenting styles (authoritarian and democratic/authoritative) when predicting children's externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Participants were 94 children (56 boys) with the mean age of 7.05 years (SD = 0.88) in a suburban district in Turkey. Mothers reported on their parenting styles and relationships with their children as well as children's externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Results from regression analyses showed that parent-child closeness significantly moderated the association between authoritarian parenting and children's externalizing behaviours. Parent-child conflict significantly moderated the association between authoritarian parenting and children's internalizing behaviours. The parent-child conflict was positively associated with children's externalizing behaviour and authoritarian parenting was positively associated with internalizing behaviour. Limitations and future directions of the current study are discussed.

AB Background: The psychological well-being of parents and children is compromised in families characterized by greater parenting stress. As parental mindfulness is associated with lower parenting stress, a growing number of studies have investigated whether mindfulness interventions can improve outcomes for families. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions for parents, in reducing parenting stress and improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Methods: A literature search for peer-reviewed articles and dissertations was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in the PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses databases. Studies were included if they reported on a mindfulness-based intervention delivered in person to parents with the primary aim of reducing parenting stress or improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Results: Twenty-five independent studies were included in the review. Eighteen studies used a single group design and six were randomized controlled trials. Within-groups, meta-analysis indicated a small, post-intervention reduction in parenting stress (g = 0.34), growing to a moderate reduction at 2 month follow-up (g = 0.53). Overall, there was a small improvement in youth outcomes (g = 0.27). Neither youth age or clinical status, nor time in mindfulness training, moderated parenting stress or overall youth outcome effects. Youth outcomes were not moderated by intervention group attendees. Change in parenting stress predicted change in youth externalizing and cognitive effects, but not internalizing effects. In controlled studies, parenting stress reduced more in mindfulness groups than control groups (g = 0.44). Overall, risk of bias was assessed as serious.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions for parents may reduce parenting stress and improve youth psychological functioning. While improvements in youth externalizing and cognitive outcomes may be explained by reductions in parenting stress, it appears that other parenting factors may contribute to improvements in youth internalizing outcomes. Methodological weaknesses in the reviewed literature prevent firm conclusions from being drawn regarding effectiveness. Future research should address these methodological issues before mindfulness interventions for parents are recommended as an effective treatment option for parents or their children.

TI Impact of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics on

SO PLOS ONE

AB Many women experience anxiety or sleep disorders during pregnancy and require pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines (BZDs) or z-hypnotics. Limited information is currently available on how prenatal exposure to these medications affects behavioral problems in children over the long term. Therefore, from a public health perspective, this issue is highly important. The present study aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to BZDs and z-hypnotics affected externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children at age 5 years. This study was based on The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The final study population included data for 36 401 children, from questionnaires completed by the mothers throughout the 5-year follow up. Children's behaviors were measured at age 5, based on parental responses to The Child Behavior Checklist. Children T-scores of 63 or above were considered to indicate clinically relevant behavior problems. We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with censoring weights to account for loss during follow-up. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main results. The final sample included 273 (0.75%) children that were exposed to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics during pregnancy. The main, IPTW and censoring weighted analyses showed that prenatal exposure to BZD and/or z-hypnotics increased the risks of internalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.73-2.49) and externalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.86-2.64). However, based on sensitivity analyses, we concluded that the risks of displaying externalizing and internalizing problems at 5 years of age did not significantly increase after prenatal exposure to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics. Instead, the sensitivity analyses suggested that residual confounding and selection bias might explain the increased risks observed in the main analyses.

AB Background
   In recent years, researchers have begun to explore the implications of shyness for the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents, exploring its association with internalizing problems. Research in an Italian context is hindered by the lack of a validated self-report measure of shyness. We report two studies aimed to assess the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Children's Shyness Questionnaire (CSQ-it) and investigate its correlations with convergent and divergent constructs. The first study aimed to examine associations between CSQ-it and self-report measures of anxiety and somatic symptoms and attachment with parents and peers. The second study aimed to investigate its relations to internet addiction.
   Methods
   The self-report measures were completed by 550 participants in the first study and 131 participants in the second study. Parents provided information on their child's problems. Psychometric properties were assessed by Cronbach's alpha in both studies and by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1. The relations between shyness and measures of internalizing problems and attachments were analyzed by correlational methods. In Study 2 a moderated mediation model tested the hypothesis that the relationship between shyness and internet addiction is mediated by somatic symptoms and that shyness moderates the relationship between somatic symptoms and internet addiction.
   Results
   The reliability and validity of the Italian Version of the Children's Shyness Questionnaire were satisfactory. Results from confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the single-factor model of the questionnaire previously identified in North American and Chinese studies. There were significant correlations between shyness, anxious and somatic symptomatology, impaired psychosocial functioning and specific components of attachment relationships. In Study 2 the indirect effect of shyness on internet addiction through somatic symptoms was significant as well as significantly moderated for high shyness scores but not for low levels of shyness.
   Conclusion
   To our knowledge this is the first study that explored the psychometric proprieties of the Children's Shyness Questionnaire in the Italian context. Findings demonstrated that this self-reported measure of shyness has sound psychometric properties and can be used as a sensitive and appropriate instrument for the assessment of shyness in children and adolescents.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief, widely used instrument to screen for mental health problems in children and adolescents. The SDQ predictive algorithms developed for the SDQ, synthesize information from multiple informants regarding psychiatric symptoms and their impact on daily life. This study aimed to explore the validity of the SDQ predictive algorithms used in preschool age to predict mental disorders in preadolescence. The study population comprises 1176 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 (CCC2000) assessed at age 5-7 years by the SDQ and reassessed at 11-12 years with the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA) for evaluation of ICD-10 mental disorders. Odds Ratios (ORs), sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated for the SDQ predictive algorithms regarding ICD-10 diagnoses of hyperkinetic-inattentive-, behavioural-and emotional disorders. Significant ORs ranging from 2.3-36.5 were found for the SDQ predictive algorithms in relation to the corresponding diagnoses. The highest ORs were found for hyperkinetic and inattentive disorders, and the lowest for emotional disorders. Sensitivities ranging from 4.5-47.4, specificities ranging from 83.0-99.5, PPVs ranging from 5.0-45.5 and NPVs ranging from 90.6-99.0 were found for the SDQ predictive algorithms in relation to the diagnoses. The results support that the SDQ predictive algorithms are useful for screening at preschool-age to identify children at an increased risk of mental disorders in preadolescence. However, early screening with the SDQ predictive algorithms cannot stand alone, and repeated assessments of children are needed to identify, especially internalizing, mental health problems.

AB Parental depression has a negative effect on child development including mental and physical health, language and development, and externalizing and internalizing behavior. This quantitative research study examined the relationship between paternal self-efficacy (PSE) and parenting behaviors often associated with paternal depression. Data from the Survey of Contemporary Fathers were used and responses from self-identified fathers (n = 1,156) on paternal involvement, warmth, harsh parenting practices, and parenting self-efficacy were analyzed to assess the association between depression and PSE on fathering behavior. Ordinary least squares regression analysis indicated that depression was associated with harsh parenting and parenting warmth, while parenting self-efficacy was associated with warmth. PSE moderated the relationship between depression and warmth, indicating a potential resilience factor for neglectful parenting practices in fathers who are depressed. Parenting self-efficacy did not moderate the relationship between depression and harsh parenting, indicating that it may serve well as a resilience factor for fathers with low engagement rather than for fathers with high negativity.

AB Objective: Emotion regulation difficulties (ERD) such as anger, irritability and frustration intolerance leading to severe functional losses may be observed in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this study was to compare children and adults diagnosed with ADHD and a healthy control group in terms of emotion regulation characteristics and to examine factors potentially associated with ERD.
   Methods: The study was performed with 72 children/adults aged 6-18 diagnosed with ADHD based on DSM-V diagnostic criteria at the Namik Kemal University Medical School of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Polyclinic, Turkey, and 30 healthy controls. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), a semi-structured interview form, was used to determine comorbidities. ERD scores (ERD=attention+anxiety/depression+aggression sub scales) were determined using the Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Mean ERD scores were 189.45 +/- 19.33 in the ADHD group and 164.13 +/- 9.94 in the healthy control group. A significant difference was determined in ERD scores between the two groups (p<0.001**). When the ADHD group was evaluated in terms of clinical characteristics, comorbid psychiatric disorders were not associated with ERD, but combined type ADHD characteristics emerged as significant predictors for ERD (p=0.011*).
   Conclusions: The results of this research revealed significantly greater ERD in individuals diagnosed with ADHD compared to healthy controls, and that combined type ADHD is a predictor for ERD. Since ERD accompanying ADHD lead to greater function loss in the individual and are associated with persistence of the disorder in adulthood, these are important clinical characteristics also requiring evaluation during the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.

AB Objectives This study used a multi-informant approach to examine differences in types and rates of technology used by adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), associations between technology use and sleep/daytime sleepiness, and whether technology use was differentially related to sleep/daytime sleepiness in adolescents with and without ADHD. Methods Eighth graders with (n = 162) and without (n = 140) ADHD were recruited. Adolescents completed questionnaires assessing time spent using technology, sleep-wake problems, school-night time in bed, and daytime sleepiness. Parents and teachers reported on adolescents' technology use and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Results Adolescents with ADHD had significantly greater total technology, television/movie viewing, video game, and phone/video chatting use than adolescents without ADHD. Adolescents with ADHD engaged in twice as much daily video game use compared to those without ADHD (61 vs. 31 min). Controlling for medication use, ADHD status, pubertal development, sex, and internalizing symptoms, greater parent- and adolescent-reported technology use was associated with more sleep-wake problems and less time in bed. ADHD status did not moderate the relations between technology use and these sleep parameters. In contrast, ADHD status moderated the association between parent-reported technology use and teacher-reported daytime sleepiness, such that this association was significant only for adolescents with ADHD. Conclusions Technology use, although more prevalent in adolescents with ADHD, is linked with more sleep problems and reduced school-night sleep duration regardless of ADHD status. Technology use is associated with teacher-rated daytime sleepiness only in adolescents with ADHD. Clinicians should consider technology usage when assessing and treating sleep problems.

AB Objectives: Psychosocial challenges associated with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) infection are well known, yet many children infected with HIV since birth demonstrate positive outcomes, referred to as resilience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate emotional-behavioral development and identify salient predictors of resilience among long-term survivors of PHIV.
   Design: Prospective investigation of children with PHIV compared with demographically similar perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) and HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) children, all from Thailand and Cambodia.
   Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; parent version) was administered at baseline and annual follow-up visits (median follow-up of 3 years) to children age 6-14. Resilience was defined as consistent CBCL scores on the Internalizing, Externalizing or Total Problem T scales within normative ranges (T-scores <60) at every time point. Generalized estimating equations examined CBCL scores over time and logistic models examined demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural predictors of resilience.
   Results: Participants included 448 children (236 PHIV, 98 PHEU, 114 HUU), with median (interquartile range) age at first evaluation of 7 (6-9) years. Children with PHIV exhibited similar rates of resilience as PHEU and HUU on the Externalizing and Total Problems scales. Resilience on the Internalizing scale was more likely in PHEU (71%) compared with PHIV (59%) or HUU (56%), P = 0.049. Factors associated with resilience in adjusted models included: HIV-exposed but uninfected status, higher household income, Cambodian nationality, female sex, and caregiver type.
   Conclusion: Despite biopsychosocial risks, resilience is observed among PHIV and PHEU children. Further study is needed to understand mechanisms underlying associated factors and intervention priorities. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To describe (a) the observed cognitive, emotional, and behavioral phenotype in a cohort of male children with 47,XYY syndrome and (b) stress levels in their parents.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 11 boys diagnosed with 47,XYY syndrome and compared them with 11 age-matched boys with normal karyotype (46,XY). The participants performed standardized assessments of cognitive function, emotional state, and behavioral features; the parents completed a questionnaire evaluating parental stress. All data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods.
   Results: All of the boys exhibited a normal cognitive profile. However, emotional-behavioral profiling revealed that internalizing and externalizing problems were more prevalent in the 47,XYY group. In addition, the stress levels of the parents of the 47,XYY group were reportedly higher than those of the parents of the 46, XY group. We also found that the time of the diagnosis had an effect on the mothers' stress levels; that is, postnatal fetal 47,XYY diagnosis was associated with higher maternal stress, whereas prenatal fetal 47,XYY diagnosis was not.
   Conclusions: Generally, 47,XYY syndrome is associated with certain cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features. High stress levels have been reported by the mothers of 47,XYY boys who had been diagnosed postnatally because of unexpected developmental delay and/or learning difficulties. The present study highlights the need to better define the neuropsychiatric phenotype of 47,XYY children; namely, the effect of the chromosomal abnormality on their cognitive function and emotional-behavioral (internalizing and externalizing) features. This study could improve prenatal counseling and pediatric surveillance.

AB Objectives: Socio-emotion has important implications for child development. Language ability is closely related with socio-emotional development. This paper reviews studies of the relationship between language ability and socio-emotional development, and investigates the correlations between them and between their sub domains. Language ability is composed of receptive and expressive language and emergent literacy. Socio-emotional development includes externalizing and internalizing behaviors, social skills, and self-regulation. Methods: Twelve studies which meet the inclusive criteria were selected from 9 electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, PsycINFO, ERIC, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, ScienceDirect, RISS, DBpia, Kyobo Scholar). A systematic review of literature was carried out using meta-analysis (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2 [CMA2]). Effect sizes were calculated using Fisher' Z. Results: There was a significant correlation between the two variables as a whole. In particular, there were significant correlations between receptive language and self-regulation, between expressive language and internalizing behavior, and between emergent literacy and self-regulation. However no significant correlation was found between all sub domains of language ability and externalizing behavior. Conclusion: These results suggest that language intervention methods need to be developed in order to decrease negative socio-emotions and to enhance positive ones.

AB Evidence suggests that the timing of sleep (chronotype) impacts mental health in young people, but previous studies have not accounted for sleep duration or school start time in this association, or examined a broad range of mental outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between chronotype and mental health in a representative sample of adolescents from the 2014 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey (29,635 students, 362 schools). We examined positive and negative aspects of mental health, using scores for emotional problems (range 0-33), emotional well-being (0-22), behavioural problems (0-28) and prosocial behaviours (0-25). We estimated chronotype using the time of mid-sleep on weekends and examined the associations using multilevel regressions, adjusted for sleep duration, school start time, individual, family and geographic characteristics. The average time of mid-sleep (chronotype) was 04:11hr. An hour delay in mid-sleep time was associated with more emotional problems (0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.23, 0.45] point higher score), more behavioural problems (2.0% [95% confidence interval 1.4%, 2.6%] higher score), less emotional well-being (0.19 [95% confidence interval 0.09, 0.20] point lower score), and fewer prosocial behaviours (0.18 [95% confidence interval 0.08, 0.29] point lower score). A later chronotype was associated with poorer mental health, independent of sleep duration and school start time, and across internalizing and externalizing mental health domains. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this association. The timing of sleep, and not just its duration, may be an additional consideration for youth mental health.

AB Background: In the literature, several studies have proposed that children and adolescents with social anxiety had experienced previously victimization from peers and siblings. The aim of this review was to contribute to the updating of recent findings about the relationship between peer victimization and onset of social anxiety in children and adolescents. Methods: A selective review of literature published between 2011 and 2018 on Social Anxiety Disorder in children and adolescents that experienced peer victimization during childhood and adolescence. Results: Seventeen studies are included. All studies showed that peer victimization is positively correlated to the presence of social anxiety. Moreover, the perpetration of peer victimization may contribute to the maintenance and the exacerbation of social anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: In children and adolescents with Social Anxiety Disorder, it is necessary to evaluate firstly the presence of peer victimization experiences. Subsequently, therapeutics programs targeted to elaborate these experiences and to reduce the anticipatory anxiety and the avoidance that characterized these children and adolescents can be proposed.

AB Objective: The first purpose of the current study was to examine the typology of intimate partner violence experiences of community sample women via two-step cluster analysis. The second purpose was to investigate how difficulties in emotion regulation, separation anxiety, and impulsivity would predict the clusters of intimate partner violence including both victim and perpetrator roles.
   Method: A total of 253 female participants who were married/in a relationship currently or during the past year were included in the statistical analyses. Participants completed online a Demographic Information Form, the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale-2, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Adult Separation Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Short Form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.
   Results: The two-step clustering method indicated that violence experiences of women in the community who were mostly victims of psychological violence fell into two different clusters of low and moderate violence experiences. The total scores of difficulties in emotion regulation and separation anxiety symptoms increased the likelihood of being in the moderate violence cluster while the total score of impulsivity was not related to violence clusters.
   Conclusion: Violence experience of women in the community is a complex phenomenon that simultaneously includes victim and perpetrator roles and is experienced at different levels. Findings underlined the role of women's affect-regulation difficulties and their feelings towards significant others and intimate relationships in their violence experiences.

AB Objective: Substance use disorders (SUDs) include a pathological pattern of behaviors related with the effects of the drug used and are associated with substance-induced psychosis (SIP). Individuals with lower levels of self-control are particularly predisposed to develop SUDs and SIP. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether childhood sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT), which is a problem distinct from but related with ADHD, is associated with SUDs and SIP.
   Method: Fifty-seven SUD patients who had childhood ADHD symptoms and at least one SIP attack were enrolled the study. Patients were evaluated by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and SCT Scale.
   Results: The rate of childhood SCT comorbidity was 63.8%. The total BPRS and conceptual disorganization, motor retardation, unusual thought content, blunted affect, excitement, and disorientation scores were higher in the childhood SCT group. SCT and WURS scores were positively correlated with BPRS scores but WURS scores were correlated with more psychotic symptoms and the correlations were stronger in WURS than SCT except "conceptual disorganization," "motor retardation." and "blunted affect." Using linear regression analysis, we found that both childhood SCT and WURS scores significantly predicted the BPRS total, motor retardation, unusual thought content, blunted affect and excitement scores. Finally, the results of multivariate stepwise regression analyses indicated that tension and guilt significantly predicted WURS while blunted affect and conceptual disorganization predicted SCT scores.
   Conclusion: Approximately, 7 in 10 patients in this group seem to have had childhood SCT. SCT patients showed more proneness to psychotic symptoms when compared with others. In addition, there was a relationship between blunted affect, conceptual disorganization, and SCT.

AB It is not known whether alterations to temperamental characteristics associated with prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) exposure account for the development of childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing behaviors and anxiety symptoms). The QF2011 Queensland flood study examined whether (1) toddler temperamental characteristics explained the association between PNMS exposure and childhood anxiety symptomatology; and (2) whether effects were dependent upon child sex or the timing of gestational exposure to PNMS. We investigated the effects of various aspects of flood-related stress in pregnancy (objective hardship, cognitive appraisal, subjective distress) on maternal report of 16-month toddler temperament (attentional control, shy-inhibition, negative reactivity), 4-year maternal-reported childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing and anxiety symptoms; N = 104), and teacher reports of internalizing behaviors (N = 77). Severity of maternal objective hardship during pregnancy and shy-inhibited behaviors were uniquely associated with 4-year child anxiety symptoms. Mediation analyses found that higher levels of 16-month negative reactivity accounted, in part, for the relationship between increased maternal objective flood-related hardship and greater internalizing behaviors (maternal but not teacher report). Neither child sex nor gestational timing of exposure moderated the hypothesized mediations. Our findings highlight several pathways through which varying aspects of disaster-related PNMS may influence early childhood anxiety symptomatology.

AB Objectives: We investigated physical activity as amoderator of relations between sleep duration and quality and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Design: The study used a cross-sectional design.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from small towns and semi-urban communities in Alabama.
   Participants: The sample was comprised of 235 adolescents (M-age=15.78 years, SD=9.60 months) whowere diverse in sex (53% female), race/ethnicity (34% Black/African American, 66% White), and socioeconomic status.
   Measurements: Sleep duration (actual sleep minutes), efficiency (minutes/total sleep period), and latency (minutes from sleep attempt to onset) were examinedwith actigraphs for 1week. Youth reported on their physical activity levels and internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results: Interactions between sleep and physical activity emerged in the prediction of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Supportive ofmoderation effects, adolescents with shorter or poorer-quality sleep in conjunctionwith less physical activity showed the highest levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Demonstrative of protective effects, adolescents with more physical activity had lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problems regardless of their sleep duration or quality.
   Conclusions: Findings illustrate that not all youth are at equal risk for adjustment problems when they experience short or poor-quality sleep, suggesting the importance of examining both bioregulatory and environmental factors in understanding adolescent adjustment.

AB Using data from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (PYD), we employed a cross-lagged model to examine the temporal order of the relationship between PYD and youths' spirituality. Our sample consisted of 1,842 youth from 32 states in the continental United States. Mean age across the two waves of data used in this study was 15.5 and 16.6, respectively. The cross-lagged model allowed us to test the model suggesting that youth must develop certain abilities (e.g., Cs of PYD) prior to constructing and internalizing abstract notions of spirituality. Findings supported this argument, with relations varying across conceptions of spirituality. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and processes linking youths' spirituality and PYD, highlighting several important implications for research and practice.

AB Despite increasing anti-Muslim sentiments, the implications of religious discrimination for Muslim-American adolescents' well-being remain understudied. Drawing on the rejection identification and disidentification models, we examined the mediating role of multiple group identities (i.e., religious and national) in the cross-sectional associations between individual-level religious discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems among 13- to 18-year-old (M = 16.7 years, SD = 1.6) Muslim-American adolescents with immigrant backgrounds. Moreover, building on the attributional ambiguity perspective, we examined the moderating role of group-level religious discrimination in the form of Islamophobia. Religious identity did not mediate the relations between individual-level discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems, and these relations did not depend on youths' perceptions of Islamophobia. However, individual-level discrimination was associated with American identity, depending on perceptions of Islamophobia. In turn, adolescents' Muslim and American identities were linked to less internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications of our findings for the development of programs and policies are discussed.

AB Objective: High co-occurrence of externalizing and internalizing problems could underlie inconsistent findings regarding the relation between heart rate (HR) and psychopathology. In this study, HR measures were examined in relation to a general dysregulation profile studied from variable- and person-centered approaches.
   Method: The sample (N = 182) consisted of 8- to 12-year-old children referred for externalizing behaviors and typically developing children (mean age 9.70, SD 1.26; 75.8% boys). Resting HR (HRrest) was assessed during a 3-minute resting period. HR reactivity (HRreactivity) was assessed during an emotionally evoking go/no-go task.
   Results: From a variable-centered approach, a bifactor model was fitted with a general factor of dysregulation underlying symptoms of anxiety/depression, aggression, and attention problems. HRrest was positively associated with dysregulation and specific aggression. From a person-centered approach, a latent profile analysis was used to identify different psychopathology classes: normative (n = 92), predominantly aggressive (n = 69), and dysregulated (n = 14). The latter was characterized by co-occurring increased levels of anxiety/depression, aggression, and attention problems. HRrest was increased in the predominantly aggressive class and HRreactivity was increased in the dysregulated class.
   Conclusion: High HR(rest,)or (trait-like) over-arousal, seems to be associated with dysregulation rather than uniquely associated with low externalizing or high internalizing symptomatology. In addition, HRrest predicted greater aggression and HRrest was increased in the predominantly aggressive class. High HRreactivity, or enhanced emotional reactivity, might be characteristic for a clinically relevant dysregulated subgroup. Assessment of HR could provide additional knowledge on individual differences that can help refine diagnostics and intervention efforts.

AB Childhood exposure to parental threatening behaviors places adolescents at greater risk for depression. However, the association between parental threatening behaviors and depressive symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient youth, and potential factors that exacerbate the harmful effects of such parenting, have remained unexplored. One factor that may contribute to depression is low emotional clarity, which is characterized by difficulties recognizing and understanding ones emotions. The current investigation examined the interactive effects of childhood exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and emotional clarity deficits in relation to depressive symptoms among inpatient psychiatric youth who had been exposed to a potentially traumatic event (i.e., exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence). Participants (N = 50, M-age = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51, range 12-17) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, childhood exposure to maternal threatening behavior, and depressive symptoms. A significant interaction was found between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and deficits in emotional clarity in relation to depressive symptom severity. Greater exposure to maternal threatening behaviors was related to more severe depressive symptoms, yet only among children with greater deficits in emotional clarity. Findings underscore the need for interventions that target emotional clarity among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threats.

AB The occurrence of stressful life events is a risk factor for psychopathology in adolescence. Depression is a problem of notable clinical importance that has a negative psychosocial impact on adolescents and which has considerable social, educational, and economic costs. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptomatology in adolescence, taking into account the effect that attachment representations may have on this relation. Participants were 1653 adolescents (951 girls) aged between 13 and 18 years. The sample was selected by means of a random sampling procedure based on the availability of schools to participate. Data were collected at two time points: attachment and stressful life events were assessed first, and symptoms of depression were evaluated eight to nine months later. Two time points were used in order to better analyze the mediating role of attachment security. Stressful life events were recorded using the Inventory of Stressful Life Events, attachment was evaluated by the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (mother, father, and peer versions), and depressive symptomatology was assessed through the Children's Depression Scale. In all cases, the Basque version of these scales was used. The results indicated that attachment to parents was a mediating variable in the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptomatology. Contrary to what we expected, the results indicate that stressful life events did not have a negative effect on peer attachment, and neither did the latter variable act as a mediator of the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptoms. It can be concluded that attachment-based interventions may be especially useful for reducing depression symptoms among adolescents. The findings also suggest a role for interventions that target parent-child attachment relationships.

AB Background: Children exposed to substance use in their families are vulnerable to multiple risk factors in their development and at increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems. The aims of the study were as follows 1) estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among children aged 6-11 years old, living with addicted family members in a low-income urban community of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil; 2) evaluate the children's exposure to family psychosocial stressors and substance use; and 3) investigate the factors related to the increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems and substance use.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 101 children aged 6-11 years old (M = 9.16 years, SD = 1.61). The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Psychosocial Stress Factors (PSF).
   Results: High prevalence of problems was found for this sample: the CBCL showed 26.7% of clinical scores for Internalizing Problems, 40.6% for Externalizing Problems, and 40.6% for Total Problems. Exposure to family psychosocial stressors was also high, including severe disease (33%), physical aggression (28.9%), death (27.8%), psychiatric hospitalization (16.7%), suicide attempts (15.5%), and suicide (9.3%). Exposure to these family stressors was associated with an increase of two to four times in the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Children exposed to substance abusers have more mental health problems than general population, even when compared to peers living in similar low-income areas. This is a group that should be target of a selective preventive intervention.

AB Background: Perceptions of security toward parents are related with internalized and externalized problems among victims of child sexual abuse (CSA). Alexithymia, which is difficulty in identifying and expressing feelings, is associated with the quality of parent-child relationships (Oskis et al., 2013) and behavior problems in children (Di Trani et al., 2013).
   Objective: The current study tested the mediational role of alexithymia in the relationship between perceptions of security toward parents and behavior problems among CSA victims.
   Participants and method: Using a short-term multi-informant prospective design, 263 victims of CSA aged 6-12 years completed the Kerns Security Scale (Kerns, Klepac, & Cole, 1996), which evaluates perceived attachment security to mothers and fathers. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) at Time 1 to provide baseline scores of behavior problems and again four months later. At Time 2, parents also assessed the children's alexithymia using the Children's Alexithymia Measure (Way et al., 2010).
   Results: Perceptions of security were both associated with alexithymia, as well as with internalizing and externalizing problems (p < .05). A mediational model showed that perception of security toward fathers outweighed the mother-child relationship in predicting children's alexithymia. Path analysis revealed that the father-child relationship predicted decreased behavioral problems at Time 2 through a lower level of alexithymia. The model explained 46.9% of internalizing problems and 56.1% of externalizing problems (p < .05).
   Conclusions: The findings support the relevance of alexithymia as an intervention target for CSA victims and underscore the importance of the father-child relationship.

AB Functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex underlies socioemotional functioning, a core domain of impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although frontoamygdala circuitry undergoes dynamic changes throughout development, little is known about age-related changes in frontoamygdala networks in ASD. Here we characterize frontoamygdala resting-state FC in a cross-sectional sample (ages 7-25) of 58 typically developing (TD) individuals and 53 individuals with ASD. Contrary to hypotheses, individuals with ASD did not show different age-related patterns of frontoamygdala FC compared with TD individuals. However, overall group differences in frontoamygdala FC were observed. Specifically, relative to TD individuals, individuals with ASD showed weaker frontoamygdala FC between the right baso-lateral (BL) amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). These findings extend prior work to a broader developmental range in ASD, and indicate ASD-related differences in frontoamygdala FC that may underlie core socioemotional impairments in children and adolescents with ASD.

AB Connectivity between the amygdala, insula (Amygdala-aI) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (AmygdalavmPFC) have been implicated in individual variability in fear and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. However, it is currently unknown to what extent connectivity between these regions in the newborn period is relevant for the development of fear and other aspects of negative emotionality (NE), such as sadness. Here, we investigate newborn Am-Ins and Am-vmPFC resting state functional connectivity in relation to developmental trajectories of fear and sadness over the first two years of life using data from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R) and Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) (N=62). Stronger newborn amygdala connectivity predicts higher fear and sadness at 6-months-of-age and less change from 6 to 24-months-of-age. Interestingly, Am-Ins connectivity was specifically relevant for fear and not sadness, while Am-vmPFC was associated only with sadness. Associations remained consistent after considering variation in maternal sensitivity and maternal postnatal depressive symptomology. Already by the time of birth, individual differences in amygdala connectivity are relevant for the expression of fear over the first two-years-of-life. Additionally, specificity is observed, such that connections relevant for fear development are distinct from those predicting sadness trajectories.

AB Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for childhood disruptive behavior disorders, such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), have limited availability in community settings. Recent research highlights the importance of implementation support models to ensure full adoption and sustainability of an EBT. Although other EBT protocols have been disseminated using the learning collaborative (LC) model, these methods are only now being applied to PCIT. This paper will describe the first PCIT learning collaborative conducted in the US. Community clinicians successfully completing the program demonstrated high levels of treatment fidelity and coding reliability, and families who completed treatment through the program reported significant improvements in child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and parenting behaviors and stress. These preliminary results suggest community clinicians are successful in implementing PCIT with the support of the LC.

AB Authoritative parenting is typically considered the gold-standard parenting approach based on studies with largely European American (EA) samples. The current study evaluated a novel, "no-nonsense" parenting style in Mexican American (MA) and EA families, not captured by traditional classifications. Parenting styles of mothers and fathers, cultural values, and youth internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed in 179 MA (n = 84) and EA (n = 95) parents and adolescents across 2 years (seventh to ninth grade). MA families showed a higher proportion of "no-nonsense" parenting, characterized by high levels of acceptance as well as harsh discipline and rejection, compared with EA families. Cultural values influenced the link between parenting styles and youth outcomes across ethnicity such that when parents endorsed low adherence to familismo values, authoritative parenting predicted lower youth internalizing and externalizing problems compared with the "no-nonsense" parenting. Yet when parents endorsed strong adherence to familismo values, the authoritative and no-nonsense parenting functioned similarly. Findings have implications for the development of culturally competent parenting interventions that may lead to positive outcomes in youth from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

AB Introduction: Early life trauma is at the core of many psychopathologies, including compulsive sexual behavior (CSB). The intermediate processes linking early life trauma and CSB have been less well studied.
   Aims: To investigate whether impulsiveness, internalizing symptoms, sensation-seeking, and self-criticism mediate the links between early life trauma and CSB.
   Methods: The sample comprised 65 Sexaholics Anonymous members and 47 healthy volunteers who completed self-report measures assessing CSB, early life trauma, and the mediating variables.
   Main Outcomes Measures: The main outcome measures were severity of CSB symptoms, impulsiveness, internalizing symptoms, sensation-seeking, self-criticism, and early life trauma.
   Results: The analysis indicated that the total effect of early life trauma on CSB was significant, with more prevalent and severe trauma relating to higher CSB. The analysis also revealed that this effect was significantly mediated by 3 mediation paths-greater sensation-seeking, internalizing symptoms, and self-criticism-and that these measures in turn were associated with higher CSB.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide an opportunity for researchers to gain a better insight into the effect of early life trauma on CSB. Copyright (C) 2019, International Society for Sexual Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose An emerging body of work suggests a link between childhood maltreatment and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, research examining the role of maltreatment in the early course of the disorder lacks robust evidence from longitudinal studies. Our aim was to examine concurrent and prospective associations between maltreatment experiences and ADHD diagnosis and sex differences, and to estimate the association between repetitive maltreatment exposure and ADHD through childhood and adolescence.
   Methods Data were obtained from the Boricua Youth Study, a longitudinal study of 2480 children and adolescents of Puerto Rican background. Neglect, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, and foster placement were regressed on ADHD diagnosis measured at each of three waves using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV. Multilevel regressions estimated the effects of exposure on ADHD, adjusted by age, sex, income, household education, parental psychopathology, comorbidity and ADHD medication status.
   Results Emotional abuse and foster placement had robust associations with ADHD diagnosis. For girls, physical abuse had a threefold increase in the odds of having ADHD diagnosis; for boys, associations were observed only for emotional abuse. Prospective models examining the risk of ADHD following maltreatment provided initial evidence for the effects of physical abuse on ADHD, and a linear trend for repetitive exposure suggested increased probability for disorder persistence.
   Conclusions Associations between early maltreatment and ADHD were robust. Different categories of maltreatment increase the likelihood of ADHD for girls and boys. Increased exposure to maltreatment may predict symptom persistence. Interventions addressing ADHD must consider the effects of both sex and family environment.

AB This study examines interactions of heritable influences, prenatal substance use, and postnatal parental warmth and hostility on the development of conduct problems in middle childhood for boys and girls. Participants are 561 linked families, collected in 2 cohorts, including birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children. Heritable influences on internalizing and externalizing (including substance use) problems were derived from birth mothers' and fathers' symptoms, diagnoses, and age of onset from diagnostic interviews, and the proportion of first-degree relatives with the same type of problems. Smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and alcohol use during pregnancy were assessed retrospectively from birth mothers at 5 months postpartum. Earlier externalizing problems and parental warmth and hostility and were assessed at 1 assessment prior to the outcome (Cohort II: 4.5 years; Cohort I: 7 years). Conduct problems were symptoms from a diagnostic interview assessed at age 6 (Cohort II) or 8 (Cohort I). Findings from regression analyses suggest that (a) SDP plays an important role for the development of conduct problems, (b) some relatively well-accepted effects (e.g., parental hostility) were less important when simultaneously considering multiple factors influencing the development of conduct problems, and (c) main effects of genetic risk and SDP, and interactions among genetic risk and postnatal warmth, SDP and postnatal warmth, and genetic risk, SDP, and postnatal hostility for conduct problems were important for boys' but not girls' conduct problems. Replication is needed, but the current results provide preliminary but empirically grounded hypotheses for future research testing complex developmental models of conduct problems.

AB The present study examined bidirectional effects between maternal and paternal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and infant temperament (negative affect, orienting/regulatory capacity, surgency) in a diverse sample of 201 mothers and 151 fathers. Using 3 waves of longitudinal data (prenatal, 6 months, and 18 months), this study examined (a) whether maternal and paternal parenting styles prospectively predicted infant temperament; (b) whether mother-and father-reported infant temperament domains predicted parenting styles at 18 months; and (c) whether infant temperament and parenting styles at 6 months predicted parent-reported externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors at 18 months. Mothers and fathers reported on their expected parenting styles at all three waves, infant temperament at 6 months, and their toddler's emerging internalizing and externalizing problems at 18 months. Prospective parenting style effects revealed that maternal authoritative and permissive parenting style predicted infant orienting/regulatory capacity. Child evocative effects indicated infant orienting/regulatory capacity and negative affect predicted greater maternal permissive parenting style. Significant prospective parenting style effects on infant temperament and child evocative effects on paternal parenting style were largely not observed. Several parenting styles and infant temperament domains at 6 months predicted toddlers' externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors but results differed by parent. Findings suggest maternal prenatal perceptions of parenting style predict infant temperament, but temperament can also affect subsequent parenting. More research is needed to identify fathers' bidirectional effects including how fathering is affected by their children's characteristics.

AB Past research on emotional clarity (EC), the ability to identify and label one's own emotions, has illustrated an association between EC deficits and poor psychosocial outcomes during the adolescent years. Although past research has connected EC to psychosocial outcomes during adolescence in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, no studies have traced the trajectory of EC over time to determine the developmental course of the construct during adolescence. Thus, this study investigated how EC developed over five years during adolescence and what factors were associated with the developmental trajectory of emotional clarity. Participants included a diverse sample of 640 adolescents (M age at Time 1 = 12.55 years; 53.0% female; 52.2% African American; 48.0% eligible for free school lunch). Results indicated that EC tended to decrease over adolescence, and females, on average, had a steeper decline of EC over time than males. The trajectory of EC predicted psychosocial outcomes, including depression and well-being. Results are discussed with the ultimate goal of informing novel prevention and intervention programs to promote adaptive emotional functioning during an influential time in human development.

AB Objective: This study aimed to characterize parenting behaviors of mothers of adolescent daughters who engage in repetitive self-inflicted injury (SII) and to test hypothesized associations between parenting behaviors and adolescent psychopathology. Method: Participants were mothers and their 14- to 18-year-old daughters (N = 51 dyads), including 24 (47%) adolescents with a history of SII and 27 (53%) with no history of SII. Dyads completed questionnaires assessing perceived maternal validation and invalidation and participated in face-to-face interactions, which were later rated for parenting behaviors. Results: The two groups did not significantly differ on validation and invalidation across all informants and methods of assessment. For the sample as a whole, adolescent perceptions of maternal parenting behaviors interacted to predict adolescent psychopathology. In particular, adolescent perceptions of high maternal invalidation in interaction with perceptions of low validation were associated with higher levels of self-reported borderline pathology and externalizing problems and mother-reported adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusions: We failed to find support for the hypothesized parenting deficits in mothers of female adolescents engaging in SII. Adolescent perceptions of their mothers' high levels of invalidation and low levels of validation were associated with higher levels of adolescent psychopathology.

AB Ethnic minority adolescents receive not only less formal mental health services than their ethnic majority peers but also less school-based mental health services. Little is known about the extent to which adolescents indicate their teachers help them with their mental health problems. The aim of the current study was to investigate ethnic differences in teacher-provided informal help for adolescents' internalizing problems, and whether these could be explained by differences in teacher-reported internalizing problems and teacher-adolescent relationship quality. A sample of adolescents at risk of internalizing problems and their teachers participated in the study (n = 229). Adolescents originated from four ethnic groups in the Netherlands: three ethnic minority groups (Surinamese Dutch, Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch) and the ethnic majority (native Dutch). Results showed that only Moroccan Dutch adolescents reported considerably less informal help from their teachers for their internalizing problems than native Dutch adolescents, whereas Turkish Dutch and Surinamese Dutch adolescents were not found to differ from native Dutch adolescents. Teacher-student relationship quality and teacher-reported internalizing problems could not explain the differences in informal help between Moroccan Dutch and Dutch adolescents. Teachers reported significantly higher levels of conflict in their relationships with Moroccan Dutch than native Dutch adolescents, and for Moroccan Dutch adolescents, higher levels of conflict were associated with lower levels of informal help by the teacher.

AB Universal screening serves to identify students at risk for emotional and behavioral difficulties while their behavior is still amenable to treatment. However, there are few universal screeners available for middle school students who may be at heightened risk for developing emotional and behavioral difficulties due to major academic and social challenges. The Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD), often considered the gold standard for behavior screeners, was recently validated for use in middle schools. However, there is little research on the reliability and validity of the SSBD for screening middle school students and the differences among teachers of different academic subjects. The purpose of this study was to extend the previous research validating the SSBD assessing its technical adequacy and sensitivity in middle school students among teachers of different academic subjects. Results indicated that the SSBD provided reliable and valid evidence for identifying at-risk middle school students. This study provided evidence that the SSBD identified internalizing and externalizing students with a similar degree of accuracy.

AB Background and Aims The interrelationship between alcohol consumption and depression is complex, and the direction of the association is unclear. We investigated whether alcohol consumption influences the risk of depression while accounting for this potential bidirectionality. Methods A total of 10 441 individuals participated in the PART study in 1998-2000, 8622 in 2001-2003, and 5228 in 2010. Participants answered questions on their alcohol consumption, symptoms of depression, childhood adversity, and sociodemographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. A total of 5087 participants provided repeated information on alcohol consumption. We used marginal structural models to analyze the association between alcohol consumption and depression while controlling for previous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms and other time-varying confounders. Results Non-drinkers had a higher depression risk than light drinkers (<= 7 drinks/week) (risk ratio: 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.1). Consumers of seven-fourteen drinks/week had a depression risk similar to that of light drinkers. Hazardous drinking was associated with a higher risk of depression than non-hazardous alcohol consumption (risk ratio: 1.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-2.4). Conclusion Light and moderate alcohol consumption and non-hazardous drinking were associated with the lowest risk of subsequent depression after accounting for potential bidirectional effects. Hazardous drinking increased the risk of depression.

AB The purpose of this study was to adapt and validate a measure of HIV-related shame, the Shame Questionnaire (SQ), among Ugandan youth living with HIV. Culturally relevant, reliable and valid measurement is critical in the accurate assessment of HIV-related shame (a painful internalized emotion encompassing feelings that the self is damaged and defective) on psychosocial functioning, as well as the determination of the efficacy of interventions among youth living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We utilized qualitative (i.e., cognitive interviews; N=31) and quantitative (i.e., classical test theory and item response theory; N=150) methods to establish, content, criterion and construct validity of the SQ. Cognitive interviews resulted in the revision in the wording of 2 out of 8 SQ items. Participants who endorsed having shame had statistically significant higher SQ scores than participants who did not endorse having shame (p<0.001), suggesting criterion validity. We found a statistically significant positive relationship between SQ scores and average trauma symptom scores among participants (p<0.001), also suggesting criterion validity. Finally, we found construct validity with discrimination parameters of the graded response IRT model all in the high range with a wide range of difficulty parameters across the 8 items of the SQ. Overall our results suggest that the SQ is a contextually relevant, valid and reliable assessment tool among Ugandan youth living with HIV. Findings provide support for the utilization of qualitative and quantitative methods in the adaptation of measures for cross-cultural use in order to maintain validity and contextual relevance.

AB Background Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often present with additional psychiatric conditions. Comorbidity is associated with poorer long-term outcomes, highlighting the need for effective assessment and intervention. However, self-perceptual biases may mask the presence of symptoms for a subgroup of children with ADHD. This study examined the role of social self-perceptual biases in children with ADHD versus control children on self-reports of loneliness, and depressive and anxious symptoms. Methods The research question was examined in two samples. Sample 1 consisted of 7.7-12.8-year-old boys with ADHD (n = 199) and control boys (n = 74); Sample 2 consisted of 7.7-11.4-year-old boys and girls with ADHD (n = 178) and control children (n = 86). Across samples, children reported social competence and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Child-reported loneliness was examined in Sample 1. A social competence discrepancy score (difference between self-report and teacher-report) was used as an indicator of social self-perceptual bias. Results Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested social self-perceptual bias as a suppressor variable. The magnitude of the associations between ADHD and self-reported feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness was greater when social self-perceptual bias was included in models as compared to models that did not include social self-perceptual bias (Delta R(2)s range = 0.04-0.19). Conclusions Findings across both samples suggest that social self-perceptual biases may mask internalizing symptom severity on self-reports for individuals who overestimate their social competence. More research is needed to determine the best approach to assessing internalizing problems among children with ADHD.

AB Objectives This study examined associations between maternal psychologically controlling parenting and adolescents' responses to rule-setting as well as the link between both study variables and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Method Both clinical and nonclinical adolescents reported upon maternal psychological control, responses to rule-setting (i.e., oppositional defiance, submissive compliance, negotiation, and accommodation) and both adolescents and mothers reported upon adolescents' problems. Results Perceived psychological control related positively to adolescents' oppositional defiance and submissive compliance and negatively to negotiation and accommodation. Further, an integrated path model indicated that psychological control related to externalizing problems via oppositional defiance and internalizing problems via submissive compliance. Conclusions Psychological control relates to different types of problem behaviors via diverse responses to maternal rule-setting. The discussion emphasizes the importance of future prevention and intervention programs to focus on both parenting and on adolescents' active contribution to their socialization process.

AB Objectives We aimed to test whether negative emotion regulation difficulties and self-compassion mediate the relationship between early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) and symptoms of psychopathology and life satisfaction. Methods Data were collected from 296 adults (179 females, 117 males), whose age ranged from 17 to 52 years. The mediating roles of self-compassion and negative emotion regulation were examined via Hayes' procedure (PROCESS) for multiple mediation. Results Negative emotion regulation was the only mediator to psychopathological symptoms, with no additional role for self-compassion, whereas self-compassion mediated only to life satisfaction, with no additional role for negative emotion regulation. Conclusions The results provide evidence for unique mediating roles of negative emotion regulation and self-compassion, depending on the outcome variable. That helps to understand how problems that may be identified in terms of positive and negative domains are related to EMSs, and allows to put forward potential strategies within the frame of schema therapy.

AB Within family sibling clustering of internalizing problems is examined during the early childhood period. Sibling clustering, the ongoing sibling similarity in internalizing problems, may be a result of heritability of internalizing problems, as well as shared environmental effects. Clustering may also result from the time-varying influence of sibling socialization, where 1 sibling is teaching or modeling internalizing problems to the other sibling. We compared a traditional cross-lagged panel model with a recently developed multilevel statistical model that differentiates the 2 mechanisms. Sibling clustering was operationalized as the family level, time-invariant variance in internalizing problems, and differentiated from sibling socialization, the cross-lagged (time-varying) association between earlier child behavior and later sibling behavior. A 3-wave longitudinal study tracked 916 children (age M = 3.46, SD = 2.23) in 397 families using a 2-parent composite score of internalizing problems. Results suggest the importance of accounting for sibling clustering in the context of a panel study, as its inclusion in the model eliminated the identified time-varying, sibling socialization effects.

AB Research on the health benefits and consequences of close relationships has suggested the linkage in daily emotions (i.e., coregulation) between close partners is an important relationship dynamic. While the coupling of daily emotions among family members (parent-child and marital dyads) has been widely documented, research examining emotional coregulation among ethnic minority youth during adolescence, a period marked by heightened emotion and risk for psychopathology, remains an important area in need of exploration. This study examined correlates of emotional coregulation in a sample of Mexican-origin adolescents (M-age=15.02, SD=.83) and their parents (M-age=41.93, SD=6.70). Dyads reported on daily levels of distress and happiness for 14 consecutive days across two waves of data collection a year apart (n(wave1)=428 dyads, n(wave2)=336 dyads). Dyads who reported getting along were more likely to coregulate their daily happiness. Importantly, coregulation of distress was only present in older adolescents who reported above average levels of internalizing symptoms. The results suggest coregulation of distress may shape or be shaped by poor mental health during the later years of adolescence, a time when youth may be establishing a degree of emotional autonomy from parents.

AB Parental absence, a consequence of parents' rural-to-urban migration, exerts negative influences on their left-behind adolescents in rural China. Existing studies are limited by their focus on the isolated developmental outcomes of left-behind adolescents and by a dearth of work focused on naturally occurring patterns of their developmental outcomes. The present study used a person-centered approach to identify adolescents' adaptation profiles based on internalizing indicators (i.e., depressive symptoms, loneliness, subjective happiness, life satisfaction), externalizing indicators (i.e., rule-breaking behavior, aggressive behavior, prosocial behavior) and academic achievement and to relate these profiles to left-behind status, characteristics of parent-adolescent separation and gender. The study included 2102 adolescents (M-age=13.48 +/- 1.10 years, 46.8% girls) in junior high schools in rural China. A latent profile analysis identified 3 profiles: an adequate adaptation profile, an internalizing problem profile and an externalizing problem profile. These profiles were linked to left-behind status, to characteristics of parent-adolescent separation (i.e., separation duration, interval of long-distance communication and face-to-face communication) and to gender. These findings provide significant implications for future research and the development of interventions.

AB Quantitative models of mental illness, such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP), aim to optimize clinical assessment, which conventionally follows categorical diagnostic rubrics. The evidence base for these models is robust, but also uniform; available data come mostly from structured diagnostic interviews in nationally representative samples. It remains to be seen whether HiTOP adequately reflects mental illness as evaluated in routine clinical care, where diagnosis is often unsystematic and incomplete, relative to controlled research conditions. To test the generalizability of a quantitative nosology to real-world assessment contexts, we fit the HiTOP model to diagnoses in a large sample (N = 25,002) of treatment-seeking university students who were seen by health professionals in everyday practice. We then examined the criterion validity of model components in relation to clinically relevant outcomes (i.e., suicide attempts, self-injury, and binge drinking). Three related structures fit the data well: a correlated-factor model with internalizing, externalizing, and eating pathology dimensions; a higher-order model that added a general factor of psychopathology that spanned these 3 first-order factors; and a bifactor model that partitioned diagnostic (co)variance across a general factor and 3 orthogonal group factors. The first-order factors had expected patterns of criterion validity, and the general factor was a strong predictor of suicidality and self-injury, paralleling past research. Bifactor model group factors had interpretative problems, however. Across models, categorical diagnoses consistently offered minimal incremental validity relative to the transdiagnostic factors. We conclude that HiTOP is ecologically valid-explaining comorbidity patterns among diagnoses assigned "in the field"-and is poised to enhance clinical assessment and decision-making in routine care.

AB Trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been linked to aspects of diurnal cortisol secretion in adolescents, but little is known about gender differences in these associations. A school-based sample of Sri Lankan adolescents aged 13-16 years took part in this study 4.5 years after the 2004 tsunami had impacted many of their lives to varying degrees. Saliva samples were obtained 4 times a day for 3 days in 84 participants, who also completed measures of lifetime trauma, current stressors, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). We used multilevel regression to estimate effects of trauma exposure and symptoms on cortisol level, diurnal slope, and awakening response (CAR). Results indicated higher cortisol in girls and older adolescents. Although trauma, PTSS, and recent PTSD had non-significant main effects, these three variables interacted with gender, with higher cortisol in girls than in similarly traumatized or symptomatic boys. Co-occurrence of internalizing symptoms and PTSS was also associated with higher cortisol. The 28 adolescents with recent PTSD displayed flatter diurnal slopes, reflecting relatively low morning cortisol. Among the 56 trauma-exposed participants, negative trauma appraisals were associated with higher cortisol. Girls were more likely than boys to display elevated cortisol in relation to re-experiencing and hyperarousal symptoms. In contrast to significant findings for cortisol level and diurnal slope, the CAR showed no association with either trauma or PTSS, irrespective of gender. Findings, viewed in light of normative gender differences in HPA activity during adolescence, can contribute to understanding heightened female vulnerability to posttraumatic stress disorder.

AB Due to early onset and rising prevalence rates, there is an established need for early identification of youth demonstrating symptoms of internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression). Accordingly, calls have been made for the use of universal screening tools to identify internalizing behavior risk. Current research has spoken to the adequacy of individual screeners, but researchers have yet to quantitatively synthesize the broader internalizing screening literature. The purpose of the current study was to systematically review the literature and conduct a reliability and validity generalization meta-analysis of available psychometric evidence. This meta-analysis identified 40 studies in which 18 distinct internalizing behavior screeners were examined. Of interest were both (a) broadband screeners, which included internalizing items along with items specific to other areas (e.g., externalizing problems), and (b) narrowband screeners, which included internalizing items alone. Across examined studies, mean coefficient alpha reliability estimates were equal to .84 for broadband screeners and .78 for narrowband screeners. For broadband screeners, mean validity correlation coefficients were equal to .66 when predicting other internalizing measures and .51 when predicting other criteria (e.g., extant academic and behavioral data). For narrowband screeners, mean validity coefficients were equal to .45 when predicting other internalizing measures and .26 when predicting other criteria. Interestingly, moderator analyses indicated neither reliability nor validity was moderated by any study or measurement characteristics. Taken together, results supported the psychometric defensibility of both broadband and narrowband internalizing screeners. Limitations of the study and implications for research are discussed, including recommendations for additional diagnostic accuracy research.

AB Identifying youth with mental health concerns and connecting them to effective intervention is important because poor mental health is related to lower educational achievements, substance abuse, violence, compromised health, and reduced life satisfaction. This study examined the ability of teachers (n=153) to accurately identify mental health concerns among elementary children using vignettes scenarios depicting children with severe and moderate externalizing or internalizing behavior problems. Teachers were asked to rate the seriousness of the problem, their concern for the child's well-being, and whether they felt the student needed school-based or community mental health services. Findings indicated that teachers can accurately identify students with severe externalizing and internalizing problems. However, they were less accurate and less likely to think students with moderate or subclinical symptoms needed services. Additionally, teachers perceived externalizing problems to be more serious and more concerning, than internalizing problems. In most cases, teachers' concern for the child's well-being, but not their perceived seriousness of the problem, predicted endorsement of referral to school and/or community-based mental health professionals, even when controlling for the child's gender. Implications for practice and future research areas are discussed.

AB Despite the prevalence and negative consequences of depressive disorders among youth, as well as the need for schools to adopt and implement a continuum of mental health services to address depressive disorders, school mental health providers receive very limited guidance in the selection and application of appropriate evidence-based depression prevention and intervention programs for use within a school-based multi-tiered system of support (MTSS). With the goal of supporting school-based mental health providers in the delivery of evidence-based practices targeting depressive symptoms among youth within a MTSS framework, the following study sought to conduct a critical review of the existing school-based prevention and intervention programming for depressive disorders for youth. A systematic, four-stage review was performed from which 119 studies examining 57 unique programs were identified. A review of the studies, including presentation of various participant (e.g., age, grade, ethnicity), study (e.g., control group, randomization), and program (e.g., primary focus, findings, MTSS tier) characteristics, is included. Implementation considerations review and future directions for research are discussed.

AB A critical component of multi-tiered systems of support is the incorporation of formative assessment, which supports school personnel in making data-based decisions about students' responsiveness to interventions. Although a variety of assessments exist for monitoring the progress of students' academic and behavioral functioning, the literature supporting progress monitoring of symptoms related to internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, is less robust. Accordingly, the need for progress monitoring measures for internalizing symptoms for use within a school-based multi-tiered framework has been underscored. Thus, the purpose of this three-stage systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature was to (1) identify assessments that have been used to progress monitor the symptoms of children' internalizing symptoms; (2) analyze their psychometric properties and basic characteristics; (3) and review their appropriateness for use as progress monitoring measures within a school setting. The results of the review identified 15 unique assessments that have been used to progress monitor internalizing symptoms in children, with eight of those assessments deemed practical for frequent use within a school setting. Implications of the results, limitations of the review, and future directions for research are discussed.

AB Background and Aims Despite a wealth of literature, the relationship between anxiety and alcohol use remains unclear. We examined whether (a) child and adolescent anxiety is positively or negatively associated with later alcohol use and disorders and (b) study characteristics explain inconsistencies in findings. Design and Setting We conducted a systematic review of 51 prospective cohort studies from 11 countries. Three studies contributed to a meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases, and studies were included if they met the following criteria: English language publication, human participants, anxiety exposure (predictor variable) in childhood or adolescence and alcohol outcome at least 6 months later. Participants Study sample sizes ranged from 110 to 11 157 participants. Anxiety exposure ages ranged from 3 to 24 years, and alcohol outcome ages ranged from 11 to 42 years. Measurements Ninety-seven associations across 51 studies were categorized by anxiety exposure (generalized anxiety disorder, internalizing disorders, miscellaneous anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobias) and alcohol use outcome (drinking frequency/quantity, binge drinking and alcohol use disorders). Findings The narrative synthesis revealed some evidence for a positive association between anxiety and later alcohol use disorders. Associations of anxiety with later drinking frequency/quantity and binge drinking were inconsistent. Type and developmental period of anxiety, follow-up duration, sample size and confounders considered did not appear to explain the discrepant findings. The meta-analysis also showed no clear evidence of a relationship between generalized anxiety disorder and later alcohol use disorder (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval = 0.47-1.87). Conclusions Evidence to date is suggestive, but far from conclusive of a positive association between anxiety during childhood and adolescence and subsequent alcohol use disorder.

AB Background and aims Hazardous drinking (i.e. alcohol consumption that places drinkers at risk for adverse health outcomes) during pregnancy is associated with adverse child outcomes. To address whether the associations are causal, we aimed to estimate the effect of maternal hazardous drinking during the first trimester on offspring emotional and behavioural problems throughout the pre-school age. We adjusted for: (1) measured confounding (e.g. smoking), (2) familial risk factors by sibling control design and (3) non-shared environmental risk factors by using hazardous drinking the 3 months before pregnancy as an instrumental variable. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants were recruited between 1999 and 2009 at ultrasound examination offered to all pregnant women in Norway. Data were collected during the 17th and the 30th weeks of gestation, and when the children were aged 1.5, 3 and 5 years. Setting Norway, 1999-2015. Participants The sample consisted of 14 639 mothers with 25 744 offspring siblings from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Measurements Respondents self-reported on: alcohol consumption, children's emotional problems (i.e. emotional reactive, anxiety/depression, somatic complaints) and children's behavioural problems (i.e. attention and aggressive behaviour) throughout pre-school age. We used longitudinal latent growth curve models to estimate the effect of maternal drinking during the first trimester on offspring emotional and behavioural problems. Findings Most associations were strongly reduced after controlling for both familial and measured environmental risk factors. After adjustment, exposed children were more emotionally reactive [beta = 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13-4.53] and had more somatic complaints (beta = 1.93; 95% CI = 0.09-3.77) at age 3, but not at age 5. Exposed children were less aggressive than unexposed siblings at age 5 (beta = -2.27; 95% CI = -4.02 to -0.52). Conclusions Children exposed to their mothers' hazardous drinking during the first trimester appear to be more emotionally reactive and have more somatic complaints at age 3, but not at age 5, and are less aggressive at age 5 compared with unexposed siblings.

AB BackgroundThe developmental-ecological model highlights the contextual environments that influence children's emotional and behavioral adjustment. No previous research considers neighborhood characteristics when examining the influence of extended family members.ObjectiveThis study investigates the characteristics of neighborhoods where extended family households reside, and the confounding and moderating effects of extended family household structure and the neighborhood influences of income and co-ethnic concentration levels.MethodData come from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study and the decennial census. The analytical sample includes 1553 children between the ages of 3 and 11years, clustered in 1191 households in 65 census tracts. This study uses multilevel linear regression modeling.ResultsExtended family households are more likely than nuclear families to live in lower-income neighborhoods, but with similar proportions of co-ethnics. Children in extended family households show higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors compared to children in nuclear families, an effect not explained by their neighborhood environments. Extended family members moderate the neighborhood effects, boosting advantages within co-ethnic concentrated neighborhoods. With a higher proportion of co-ethnics in their neighborhoods, children in extended families show lower levels of externalizing behaviors compared to children in nuclear families.ConclusionCo-resident extended family members not only predict child internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems but also moderate their neighborhood environments. This study provides policy implications, highlighting the potential of extended members to promote child development.

AB North American Indigenous (i.e., American Indian and Canadian First Nations) youth experience inequities in rates of substance abuse and dependence. Despite this, few longitudinal studies examine the developmental course of substance use disorders (SUD) among community-based samples of Indigenous youth. The purpose of the study was to examine onset and predictors of nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorders, marijuana use disorders, any SUD, and multiple SUDs across the entire span of adolescence among a longitudinal sample (N=744) of reservation/reserve Indigenous youth in the upper-Midwest of the United States and Ontario, Canada. Using discrete time survival analysis, the results show that rates of meeting criteria for SUDs by late adolescence were 22% for nicotine, 43% for alcohol, and 35% for marijuana. Peak periods of risk for new nicotine dependence and marijuana use disorder cases occurred around 14years of age, whereas peak periods of risk for new alcohol use disorder cases emerged slightly later around 16years of age. We found high rates of SUD comorbidity, and the cumulative probability of developing two or more SUDs during adolescence was 31%. Internalizing disorders increased the odds of nicotine dependence and multiple SUDs, while externalizing disorders increased the odds of all outcomes except nicotine dependence. Gender, age, and per capita family income were inconsistently associated with SUD onset. The findings are embedded within broader substance use patterns identified among Indigenous youth, and prevention, intervention, and treatment implications are discussed.

AB Objectives Prenatal maternal metabolic problems such as pre-pregnancy adiposity, excess gestational weight gain, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are associated with an increased risk of psychopathology in offspring. We examined whether these exposures were linked to symptoms of emotional and behavioral problems in offspring at 2years of age, or if associations were due to confounding variables. Methods Data from 815 mother-child pairs enrolled at the Edmonton site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development cohort were used to examine associations between gestational metabolic complications and scores on the externalizing and internalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-11/2 to 5) at age two. Associations between maternal metabolic complications and offspring psychopathology were assessed before and after adjustment for gestational diet, socioeconomic status (SES), postpartum depression (PPD), prenatal smoking and breastfeeding. Results Pre-pregnancy body mass index and GDM, but not gestational weight gain, predicted more offspring externalizing and internalizing problems. However, after adjustment for confounding variables, these associations were no longer statistically significant. Post-hoc analyses revealed that gestational diet accounted for unique variance in both externalizing (semi-partial r(diet)=-0.20, p<0.001) and internalizing (semi-partial r(diet)=-0.16, p=0.01) problems. PPD and SES also accounted for a similar amount of variance for both externalizing (semi-partial r(PPD)=0.17, p<0.001; r(ses)=-0.11, p=0.03) and internalizing problems (semi-partial r(PPD)=0.21, p<0.001; r(ses)=-0.14, p=0.004). Conclusions for Practice Since the confounding effect of gestational diet persisted after adjustment for, and was similar in magnitude to, SES and PPD, future research should consider the impact of unhealthy prenatal diets on offspring neurodevelopment.

AB Objective We investigated the effect of maternal preconception fasting plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) on psychological problems in children aged 6 years from normal pregnancies. Design A longitudinal study was carried out from preconception, throughout each trimester of pregnancy, until 6 years of age in the offspring. Fasting blood samples at 2-10 weeks preconception and non-fasting samples at birth were collected. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and teachers the Inattention-Overactivity with Aggression (IOWA) scale for the 6-year-old children. Setting Elevated tHcy during pregnancy has been associated with several adverse outcomes and with neurodevelopmental impairment in the offspring. Participants The initial sample consisted of 139 healthy non-pregnant women who were planning on becoming pregnant. Eighty-one mother-child dyads were followed from preconception until 6 years of age. Results After adjusting for covariables, multiple linear regression models showed that higher preconception tHcy was associated with higher scores in internalizing dimension (beta=0.289; P=0.028), specifically in withdrawn behaviour (beta=0.349; P=0.009), anxiety/depression (beta=0.303; P=0.019) and social problems (beta=0.372; P=0.009). Aggressive behaviour in the school setting was higher in children whose mothers had higher preconception tHcy (beta=0.351; P=0.014). Conclusions Moderately elevated preconception tHcy may increase the risk of psychological problems in offspring during childhood. These findings add to the evidence that maternal nutritional status, even before being pregnant, can affect later offspring health and may be important to consider when developing future public health policy.

AB The understanding of the complex relations between parent and child psychopathology would be enhanced if common patterns of parental problem types or particular parent dyads were identified. The current study used latent profile analysis to allow for a person-centered approach to the examination of which parental psychopathology subgroups based on their perceived depressive, anxiety, and antisocial problems are both most common and most strongly associated with emerging adult psychopathology. Participants included 2204 emerging adults enrolled in a Southern United States university who reported on their perceptions of their parents' and their own current psychological problems. A 5-profile solution for perceived parental psychopathology was identified and represented anticipated groups (e.g., low problems, high problems, high internalizing only, high externalizing only). The largest effects of these profiles were found for emerging adult antisocial problems, and paternal profiles demonstrated larger effect sizes relative to maternal profiles. When both parents were perceived as having elevated problems, emerging adults also generally reported the highest rates of their own psychological problems. Results also suggest that perceiving as having low problems may protect against the negative effects of the other parent's antisocial problems or depressive/anxiety problems, but may not be sufficient when a parent has elevated problems across domains. Findings indicate the importance of considering varying levels of psychopathology.

AB This study examines the prevalence of trauma exposure and its association with psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and sexual activity among First-Time Offending, Court-Involved Non-Incarcerated (FTO-CINI) Latinx youth. Latinx youth (N=181), ages 12-18, were recruited from a family court in the Northeastern region of the United States as part of a longitudinal cohort study of 423 FTO-CINI youth. Baseline data on trauma exposure and symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, substance use (alcohol/marijuana), and sexual activity among the Latinx sample were analyzed by age, gender, and offense type (status versus delinquent). Almost three-quarters of Latinx FTO-CINI youth reported lifetime trauma exposure. Almost half of Latinx youth reported lifetime marijuana use, 30% reported lifetime alcohol use, and 33% reported lifetime sexual activity. Females reported higher rates of internalizing symptoms and greater affect dysregulation. Trauma-exposed youth were more likely than their non-exposed peers to have reported more externalizing symptoms; trauma-exposed females compared to trauma-exposed males reported more severe internalizing symptoms. Latinx FTO-CINI females may have different behavioral health needs than their male counterparts. Court-based screening and assessment practices should attend to the specific behavioral needs of this unique, underserved population.

AB The literature on typically developing siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD-Sibs) provides inconsistent results, with some studies reporting ASD-Sibs are more likely to have negative outcomes than comparison groups, and others reporting no significant differences. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to meta-analytically aggregate study effect sizes to more accurately calculate the degree to which ASD-Sibs function similarly or differently compared to siblings of people who do not have ASD. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had a sample of ASD-Sibs older than 5; reported on emotional, psychological, behavioral, or social functioning; and provided information necessary for calculating relevant effect sizes. Results from 69 independent samples indicated that ASD-Sibs have significantly more negative outcomes than comparison groups overall (g=-0.26); specific areas of functioning in which ASD-Sibs fared worse include internalizing behavior problems, psychological functioning, beliefs, social functioning, and the sibling relationship, but no significant differences in adjustment, attention/hyperactivity, externalizing behavior problems, coping, or family functioning. Noteworthy sub-areas of functioning in which ASD-Sibs also fared worse included beliefs about disability (g=-0.56), anxiety symptoms (g=-0.25), and depression symptoms (g=-0.36). In terms of comparison group, ASD-Sibs had significantly lower functioning than siblings of individuals with other intellectual and developmental disabilities (g=-0.31), including Down syndrome (g=-0.40) and siblings of individuals without any disabilities (g=-0.31). Clinicians and service providers should work to ensure that ASD-Sibs are included in family interventions and support strategies, and researchers should further explore individual differences that may relate to enhanced or impaired functioning in ASD-Sibs.

AB This short-term longitudinal study examined the differential pathways from relational and physical victimization to internalizing and externalizing problems and academic achievement as well as the roles of friendships and friendship quality in these pathways with a Taiwanese sample (N = 471; 53.3% boys; mean age = 9.95 years). A multi-informant approach was used to collect the data. Relational and physical victimization and the number of friendships were assessed via peer nominations. Adjustment problems, achievement, and friendship quality were measured by mother, teacher, and child reports, respectively. Results of Structural Equation Modeling showed that the paths from relational victimization to adjustment problems were indirectly influenced by positive or negative friendship quality. Specifically, relational victimization was associated with negative friendship quality indexed by high levels of exclusivity and conflict, which in turn resulted in more severe internalizing and externalizing adjustment problems 6 months later. Lower levels of relational victimization were linked to positive friendship quality indexed by high levels of companionship, help, closeness, and intimacy, which in sequence contributed to better academic achievement. These indirect effects were not evidenced for the number of friendships or the paths from physical victimization to adjustment problems and achievement. There were no gender differences in the measurement or structural part of the model. These findings are discussed from developmental, social, and cultural perspectives.

AB School absenteeism is a serious problem among youths, varying in etiology and presentation. Youths presenting high levels of absence have previously been linked to mental health problems, academic difficulties and dropout, highlighting the need for early identification and intervention. The aim of this study is twofold: first, to identify profiles among a community sample of secondary school students based on school absence, internalizing and externalizing behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-YSR). Second, to examine the relationship between profiles regarding mental health problems based on the dimensions of the CBCL-YSR, the function of their school absence using the School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS) and school refusal using the SChool REfusal EvaluatioN (SCREEN). The profiles are compared on demographic variables, family characteristics, school performance and bullying. A community sample of 469 youths (10-16 year, M=12.1 years, SD=1.2) from six French secondary publics schools participated in this study. Using cluster analysis, four distinct profiles were identified. The clusters differed significantly on school absence, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, dimensions of the CBCL-YSR, and their function of absence on the SRAS. Clusters differed significantly on several demographic variables, school level, grade, repetition and bullying. The distinctions between the four profiles and their relevance are discussed.

AB Introduction: Self-compassion, a trait that involves responding to one's difficulties with care and concern, may offer unique stress coping benefits during the challenges of adolescence.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data from a large adolescent sample within two U.S. school settings (N = 1057; 65% female; 68% white; mean age 14.7 years) to examine whether self-compassion buffers the impact of perceived stress on internalizing symptoms, and secondarily, if these relationships differ by gender.
   Results: Regression analysis revealed self-compassion is inversely related to internalizing symptoms. Moreover, the relationship between stress and depression and anxiety symptoms differed by level of self-compassion. This moderation effect was similar between genders for depressive symptoms, but slightly greater in males compared to females for anxiety.
   Conclusions: These results add to our understanding of self-compassion as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy with potential benefits for youth experiencing stress. Further research is needed to confirm if moderation effects for anxiety differ by gender.

AB Previous research has found that insecure attachment is associated with depression. In the present study, we use an accelerated longitudinal cohort design to examine how the association between attachment and depression develops during childhood and adolescence. Specifically, 690 children from 3 distinct cohorts (grades 3, 6, and 9) completed self-report measures of attachment and depressive symptoms 3 times over 3 years. Growth curve analyses indicated that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were uniquely related to depressive symptoms. Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms over time. Additionally, changes in attachment security were associated with changes in depressive symptoms. The analyses suggest that insecure attachment and depressive symptoms co-vary and that these dynamics are evident in childhood and adolescence.

AB Background. Involving parents in the prevention of mental health problems in children is prudent given their fundamental role in supporting their child's development. However, few measures encapsulate the range of risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depression that parents can potentially modify. The Parenting to Reduce Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (PaRCADS) was developed as a criterion-referenced measure to assess parenting against a set of evidence-based parenting guidelines for the prevention of child anxiety and depressive disorders.
   Methods. In Study 1,355 parents of children 8-11 years old across Australia completed the PaRCADS and measures of parenting, general family functioning, child anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent and child health-related quality of life. Their children completed measures of parenting, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life. In Study 2, six subject-experts independently evaluated the PaRCADS items for item-objective congruence and item-relevance. Item analysis was conducted by examining item-total point-biserial correlation, difficulty index, B-index, and expert-rated content validity indices. Reliability (or dependability) was assessed by agreement coefficients for single administration. Construct validity was examined by correlational analyses with other measures.
   Results. Four items were removed to yield a 79-item, 10-subscale PaRCADS. Reliability estimates for the subscale and total score range from .74 to .94. Convergent validity was indicated by moderate to strong correlations with other parenting and family functioning measures, and discriminant validity was supported by small to moderate correlations with a measure of parents' health-related quality of life. Higher scores on the PaRCADS were associated with fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms and better health-related quality of life in the child. PaRCADS total score was associated with parental age, parent reported child's history of mental health diagnosis and child's current mental health problem.
   Discussion. Results showed that the PaRCADS demonstrates adequate psychometric properties that provide initial support for its use as a measure of parenting risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depression. The scale may be used for intervention and evaluative purposes in preventive programs and research.

AB Sociometrically neglected children are not often liked and not often disliked by their peers. This kind of social information is known as social status. Evidence concerning internalizing behaviour of neglected children is as yet equivocal. Contradictory research results could possibly be attributed to methodological issues of social status classification methods. Therefore, we will paradigmatically emphasize insufficiencies of one social status classification method. Since arbitrary cutoffs (sociometric data) provide the basis for the categorical classification of social status groups, the classification approach lacks precision and consistency. Furthermore, social status classification discounts the multidimensional nature of a child's social status (social status group affiliation is mutually exclusive), disregards between-peer-group differences in the sociometric data, and offers a peer-group-norm-referenced interpretation. By contrast, we will highlight some advantages of the newly introduced social status extreme points procedure, which describes a child's social status in terms of the child's adaptation to sociometric extreme points. The continuous social status extreme points variables offer a criterion-referenced interpretation (multidimensionality: degree of adaptation to each and every sociometric extreme point). The performance and agreement of both methods will be demonstrated using empirical data (N = 316 children within 22 school classes).

AB School transitions require students to adapt to new challenges and situations and can increase the risk of externalizing and internalizing psychological symptoms. The teacher-student relationship seems to be a protective factor for the risk of developing psychological symptoms during school transitions. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the quality of the teacher-student relationship predicts the decrease of internalizing and externalizing symptoms during three school transitions, namely: from kindergarten to primary school (T1), from primary to middle school (T2), and from middle to high school (T3). We recruited 127 kindergarten students (mean age = 5.40, SD = 0.49), 113 fifth grade primary school students (mean age = 10.64, SD = 0.54), and 240 eighth grade students (mean age = 13.88, SD = 0.37) and their teachers (response rate = 95%). Data were collected from 2016 to 2018. Teachers filled out an anonymous survey, acting as informants for the students, reporting demographic details (age, gender), psychological symptoms, and quality of the teacher-student relationship. The data show that a positive teacher-student relationship quality tends to be associated with a reduction of psychological symptoms. A stable, low-conflict teacher-student relationship was confirmed as a protective factor from increased internalizing and externalizing symptoms during all normative school transitions. Furthermore, we see that an increase in teacher-student conflict during the transitions from primary to middle school, and from middle to high school is linked to an exacerbation in students' externalizing symptoms during the first year of attendance of the new school. Our study confirms the importance of the teacher-student relationship in reducing psychological symptoms associated with school transitions, in every type of transition, favoring an improved psychological adjustment to the new environment. A positive teacher-student relationship represents a protective factor for the development of students. Study limitations are discussed.

AB While many scholars acknowledge that there are collateral consequences of mass incarceration, there remains considerable work to be done in understanding the nuanced way in which paternal incarceration influences child development. A growing body of research has begun examining the specific mechanisms through which a father's time in jail or prison might influence child behavior. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this study examines maternal depression, maternal parenting stress, paternal involvement, and spanking as potential mediators in the relationship between paternal incarceration and child behavior problems. Results indicate that paternal incarceration exerts a persistent direct effect on child externalizing behaviors (i.e., aggression, rule-breaking), and an indirect effect on both externalizing and internalizing behaviors (i.e., withdrawal, anxiety, and somatic disorders) via parenting mechanisms, even after controlling for pre-incarceration levels of mechanisms and child behavior problems. The limitations of this study and directions for future research are discussed.

AB BackgroundSpecific phobia (SP) is a relatively common disorder associated with high levels of psychiatric comorbidity. Because of its early onset, SP may be a useful early marker of internalizing psychopathology, especially if generalized to multiple situations. This study aimed to evaluate the association of childhood generalized SP with comorbid internalizing disorders.MethodsWe conducted retrospective analyses of the cross-sectional population-based World Mental Health Surveys using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Outcomes were lifetime prevalence, age of onset, and persistence of internalizing disorders; past-month disability; lifetime suicidality; and 12-month serious mental illness. Logistic and linear regressions were used to assess the association of these outcomes with the number of subtypes of childhood-onset (<13years) SP.ResultsAmong 123,628 respondents from 25 countries, retrospectively reported prevalence of childhood SP was 5.9%, 56% of whom reported one, 25% two, 10% three, and 8% four or more subtypes. Lifetime prevalence of internalizing disorders increased from 18.2% among those without childhood SP to 46.3% among those with one and 75.6% those with 4+ subtypes (OR=2.4, 95% CI 2.3-2.5, p<0.001). Twelve-month persistence of lifetime internalizing comorbidity at interview increased from 47.9% among those without childhood SP to 59.0% and 79.1% among those with 1 and 4+ subtypes (OR=1.4, 95% CI 1.4-1.5, p<0.001). Respondents with 4+ subtypes also reported significantly more disability (3.5days out of role in the past month) than those without childhood SP (1.1days) or with only 1 subtype (1.8days) (B=0.56, SE 0.06, p<0.001) and a much higher rate of lifetime suicide attempts (16.8%) than those without childhood SP (2.0%) or with only 1 subtype (6.5%) (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.7-1.8, p<0.001).ConclusionsThis large international study shows that childhood-onset generalized SP is related to adverse outcomes in the internalizing domain throughout the life course. Comorbidity, persistence, and severity of internalizing disorders all increased with the number of childhood SP subtypes. Although our study cannot establish whether SP is causally associated with these poor outcomes or whether other factors, such as a shared underlying vulnerability, explain the association, our findings clearly show that childhood generalized SP identifies an important target group for early intervention.

AB The present study examined the potential moderating role respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) plays in the relationship between parental marital conflict and adolescents' internalizing problems. To examine this issue, data were collected from 330 adolescents (13-14 years, 182 boys). The Chinese version of the Achenbach Youth Self-Report-2001 and the Chinese version of the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict were used to assess the adolescents' internalizing problems and their perceptions of parental marital conflict. To obtain RSA data, electrocardiogram monitoring was performed on the adolescents at baseline and during a series of stress tasks (watching a film clip depicting marital conflict, a mental arithmetic task, and a speech task). The results indicated that baseline RSA and RSA reactivity to the film clip moderated the relationship between parental marital conflict and internalizing problems in early adolescents. The moderating effect of baseline RSA supported the BSCT hypothesis. Specifically, adolescents with low baseline RSA have both the highest and lowest levels of internalizing problems, depending on the level of marital conflict. In contrast, adolescents with high levels of baseline RSA have moderate levels in internalizing problems, regardless of the level of marital conflict they experience. Similarly, high marital conflict was related to internalizing problems for adolescents with less RSA suppression or RSA augmentation but not for those with greater RSA suppression. This effect was specific to stress related to marital conflict, as RSA reactivity to the mental arithmetic task and speech task did not moderate the relationship between marital conflict and internalizing problems. These findings suggest that certain profile of parasympathetic nervous activity is a risk factor for internalizing problems particularly for those who experience high-conflict environments.

AB Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) have in some studies been associated with cognitive and socioemotional outcomes in children, but results are inconsistent possibly due to the use of different tests and potential gender-specific effects. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to explore overall patterns in neuropsychological scores as well as correlations between scores within specific domains, and to examine potential gender differences and consistency in associations with n-3 LCPUFA status. In 199 Danish 8-9 year-old children, we performed a large battery of tests and questionnaires on attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory, and socioemotional traits, and measured erythrocyte fatty acid composition. Principal component analyses (PCA) showed that most of the variation in both cognitive performance and socioemotional traits was explained by overall performance, followed by speed-accuracy trade off and externalizing vs. internalizing problems, respectively. Boys had higher speed, lower attention and higher externalizing problem scores than girls. Measures of performance within both processing speed and attention domains correlated moderately, whereas no correlations were found for measures of executive functions apart from some weak correlations for impulsivity. Parent-rated scores for both externalizing and internalizing problems correlated strongly, whereas correlations with child-rated scores were weak. Scores within specific domains did not consistently associate with n-3 LCPUFA, except for processing speed measures which all pointed to faster processing with increased n-3 LCPUFA status. Gender differences in the associations were observed for attention and impulsivity. Child-but not parent-rated internalizing and social problems tended to associate directly with n-3 LCPUFA, supported by increased internalizing problems measured by the PCA component. In conclusion, measures of speed and attention seem to represent these domains in general, whereas single measures of more complex cognitive functions should be interpreted with caution. One approach could be to use multiple tests and create multivariate scores to guide interpretations. Furthermore, the results indicate a need to consider both parent- and child-rated socioemotional scores and gender differences in neuropsychological functions e.g. in investigations of n-3 LCPUFA effects.

AB Objective: To determine whether visual-spatial processing style is associated with psychopathology in a large sample of adolescents with critical congenital heart disease (CHD). Local (part-oriented) style was hypothesized to increase risk for internalizing (but not externalizing) forms of psychopathology. Method: Participants included 278 adolescents with critical CHD (dextro-transposition of the great arteries = 134, tetralogy of Fallot = 58, single-ventricle cardiac anatomy requiring the Fontan procedure = 86). Visual-spatial processing style was indexed using Copy Style Ratings from the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure-Developmental Scoring System. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children-Present & Lifetime Version was used to determine presence/absence of diagnosable DSM-IV psychiatric disorder(s). Processing style and psychopathology were assessed concurrently. Results: Thirty-three percent of the sample had a part-oriented processing style. In multivariable binary logistic regression models, part-orientation was associated with more than twice the odds of having an anxiety disorder (lifetime: OR = 2.2, p = .02, 95% CI = 1.1-4.1; current: OR = 2.7, p = .03, 95% CI = 1.1-6.5) but was not associated with an increased risk for ADHD, disruptive behavior, or mood disorders (ps > .05). Conclusions: Adolescents with critical CHD who approach complex visual-spatial materials in a local, part-oriented fashion are more likely to meet criteria for an anxiety disorder than those who approach complexity more holistically. Part-orientation may make it more difficult for individuals to judge the relative importance of isolated details and engage in more adaptive perspective-taking.

AB Background: Epidemiological studies worldwide indicate that teenagers are at risk of internalizing and externalizing problems that persist into adulthood. In our country, there are few epidemiological studies on adolescents internalizing and externalizing problems. These studies, however, were not conducted in all of Italy. The aim of this study, promoted by the Italian Society of Paediatrician (SIP), was to investigate: a) the lifestyle and the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems in Italian teenagers and b) the risk and protective factors in family and social contexts. A further aim was to analyse gender differences in the above-mentioned variables.
   Methods: 11,527 adolescents aged 13 to 21years were recruited among students of Italian high schools. Participants were contacted by school authorities inviting them to participate in an internet survey on youth health and lifestyle. If they agreed to participate, the adolescents filled out an on-line anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire was composed of 60 multiple choice items to investigate nutrition, body perception and lifestyle, internet exposure and sexual behaviour, externalizing and internalizing problems, family context and social context. Participation in the study was completely voluntary. The statistical significance of gender differences was tested by means of Chi-square analyses. Results displayed that Italian female adolescents are at risk of internalizing problems while males are at higher risk of externalizing problems. Moreover, several risk factors emerged from the family context in terms of violence, physical and psychological abuse.
   Conclusions: It is critical to make paediatricians and schools aware of the main points to improve prevention and healthcare in the teenage population. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the Italian context to enrol more than 11,000 adolescents.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate whether childhood levels of parental warmth buffer the relationship between parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression and behavioural and emotional adjustment (violent offending, substance use, depression and anxiety) among adolescent boys and girls. Data were drawn from a large self-report school survey conducted among 9th graders in Lower Saxony, Germany (n = 7423). Controlling for socio-demographic factors and risk-seeking, results showed that parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression were related to increased externalizing and internalizing behaviour, while parental warmth was related to decreased anxiety and depression. Perceived parental warmth during childhood buffered effects of parent-to-child verbal aggression on later violent offending. More specifically, the strongest relationship between parent-to-child verbal aggression and externalizing behaviour was found in individuals with low parental warmth. Child and parent gender did not qualify the moderating effect of warmth. Results underscore the need for programmes and policies that promote stable family environments particularly marked by the absence of parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression.

AB Background: Previous research on the hormone-symptom relationship in children suggests that certain hormone patterns may be associated with symptoms, but only under certain circumstances. Having a parent with a history of depression may be one circumstance under which dysregulated hormone patterns are especially associated with emotional and behavioral symptoms in children. The current study sought to explore these relationships in a community sample of 389 9-year-old children.
   Methods: Children's salivary cortisol and testosterone levels were collected at home over three consecutive days; parental psychiatric histories were assessed using semi-structured diagnostic interviews; and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms were rated by the child's mother.
   Results: Having two parents with a history of depression moderated the associations of reduced total daily cortisol output with higher externalizing scores, as well as the association of reduced testosterone with higher internalizing scores. A maternal history of depression, on the other hand, moderated the relationship between higher cortisol awakening response and higher internalizing scores. Furthermore, lower daily cortisol output was associated with higher internalizing scores among girls, but not boys, with two parents with a history depression.
   Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the current analyses, as well as the limited racial, ethnic, and geographical diversity of the sample.
   Conclusions: Taken together, the current results suggest that the relationship between hormones and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children may vary as a function of parental depression and child sex, knowledge that may inform intervention efforts aimed at preventing psychopathology in children whose parents have a history of depression.

AB Introduction: The amygdala is a brain structure involved in emotional regulation. Studies have shown that larger amygdala volumes are associated with behavioral disorders. Prenatal maternal depression is associated with structural changes in the amygdala, which in turn, is predictive of an increase in behavioral problems. Girls may be particularly vulnerable. However, it is not known whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), or which aspect of the maternal stress experience (i.e., objective hardship, subjective distress, and cognitive appraisal), influences amygdala volumes. Nor is it known whether amygdala volumes mediate the effect of PNMS on behavioral problems in girls and boys.
   Aims: To assess whether aspects of PNMS are associated with amygdala volume, to determine whether timing of exposure moderates the effect, and to test whether amygdala volume mediates the association between PNMS and internalizing and externalizing problems in 111/2 year old children exposed in utero, to varying levels of disaster-related PNMS.
   Methods: Bilateral amygdala volumes (AGV) and total brain volume (TBV) were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging, from 35 boys and 33 girls whose mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. The mothers' disaster-related stress was assessed in June 1998. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at 111/2 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Hierarchical regression analyses and mediation analyses were conducted on boys and girls separately, controlling for perinatal and postnatal factors.
   Results: In boys, subjective distress was associated with larger right AGV/TBV when mothers where exposed during late pregnancy, which in turn explained higher levels of externalizing behavior. However, when adjusting for postnatal factors, the effect was no longer significant. In girls, later gestational exposure to the ice storm was associated with larger AGV/TBV, but here, higher levels of objective PNMS were associated with more externalizing problems, which was, in part, mediated by larger AGV/TBV. No effects were detected on internalizing behaviors.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the effects of PNMS on amygdala development and externalizing symptoms, as assessed in boys and girls in early adolescence, can be influenced by the timing of the stress in pregnancy, and the particular aspect of the mother's stress experience.

AB Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate associations, unique and interactive, between mothers' and children's histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and children's psychiatric outcomes using an intergenerational perspective. Further, we were particularly interested in examining whether maternal reflective functioning about their own trauma (T-RF) was associated with a lower likelihood of children's abuse exposure (among children of CSA-exposed mothers).
   Methods: One hundred and eleven children (M-age = 9.53 years; 43 sexual abuse victims) and their mothers (M-age = 37.99; 63 sexual abuse victims) participated in this study. Mothers completed the Parent Development Interview (PDI), which yielded assessments of RF regarding their own experiences of abuse, and also reported on their children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: Children of CSA-exposed mothers were more likely to have experienced CSA. A key result was that among CSA-exposed mothers, higher maternal T-RF regarding their own abuse was associated with lower likelihood of child CSA-exposure. Mothers' and children's CSA histories predicted children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms, such that CSA exposure for mother or child was associated with greater symptomatology in children.
   Conclusion: The findings show that the presence of either maternal or child CSA is associated with more child psychological difficulties. Importantly in terms of identifying potential protective factors, maternal T-RF is associated with lower likelihood of CSA exposure in children of CSA-exposed mothers. We discuss these findings in the context of the need for treatments focusing on increasing T-RF in mothers and children in the context of abuse to facilitate adaptation and reduce the intergenerational risk.

AB Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has been a controversial entity with various opinions about its clinical relevance as an independent mental disorder. This debate has also included discussions about the relationships between problematic gaming, various psychiatric disorders, and personality traits and dimensions. This paper outlines a developmental-theory based model of Internet gaming misuse inspired by the treatment of two adolescent inpatients. The two clinical vignettes illustrate distinct developmental pathways: an "internalized pathway" via the development of social anxiety, emotional and behavioral avoidance; and an "externalized pathway" with a low level of emotional regulation strategies and impulsivity. In both clinical cases, attachment issues played a key role to understand the specific associations of risk and maintaining factors for IGD, and gaming behaviors may be seen as specific forms of maladaptive self-regulatory strategies for these two youths. These clinical observations support the assumption that gaming use problematic in adolescents should be viewed with a developmental approach, including key aspects of emotional development that represent significant targets for therapeutic interventions.

AB This study employed latent class analysis utilizing an array of features of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in order to identify distinct subgroups of self-injurers. Participants were 359 undergraduates with NSSI history. Indicator variables were lifetime and last year frequency rates, number of methods, scarring, pain during self-injury, and functions of NSSI. Analyses yielded mild/experimental NSSI, moderate NSSI, moderate multiple functions NSSI, and severe NSSI groups, endorsing low, moderate, moderate multiple functions, and high frequencies of self-injury and presence of functions, respectively. Following class assignment, groups differed on self-esteem, social support and belongingness, internalizing symptoms, suicidal ideation and behaviors, and additional NSSI constructs. These subtype analyses emphasize matching phenotypes of NSSI to specific interventions considering dimensions of clinical functioning.

AB Objectives: Reduced reward responsiveness, as measured by the event-related potential (ERP) component, the reward positivity (RewP), has been shown to play a role in the development of internalizing disorders, but implications for treatment remain unclear. In adult patients with anxiety and/or depression, reduced RewP has emerged as a predictor of greater change in symptoms following cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. The objectives of this preliminary study were to extend these findings to children and adolescents with anxiety disorders by evaluating RewP to reward as a predictor of change in anxiety severity or depressive symptoms following treatment with CBT or SSRI and to explore whether RewP differentially predicts response to one type of treatment. Methods: Patients (7-19 years old) with social and/or generalized anxiety disorder (N=27) completed baseline measures of anxiety severity and depressive symptoms, as well as an ERP monetary reward anticipation and feedback task. RewP was measured in response to reward and breaking even feedback. Patients were then randomly assigned to CBT or SSRI treatment, and completed measures of anxiety and depressive symptom severity at the last treatment session. Results: Reduced reward responsiveness, as measured by RewP to rewards, predicted greater change in depressive symptoms following treatment, adjusting for baseline symptoms, age, and RewP to breaking even. RewP was not a significant predictor of change in anxiety symptoms. Although preliminary, exploratory analyses suggested that among anxious youth, RewP specifically predicted change in depressive symptoms following CBT, rather than SSRI. Conclusion: Results provide preliminary support for the utility of ERP measures of reward responsiveness in predicting treatment response in youth. With further research and standardization, ERP assessments could potentially be implemented in clinical settings to inform prognosis and treatment planning for youth with internalizing disorders.

AB Distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity may differentiate among internalizing disorders, though few studies have examined differential associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms while adjusting for their intercorrelation. In an adolescent genetic epidemiological sample (ages 15-21), the present study (N= 848, 56.97% female) examined concurrent associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress) at baseline and prospective, predictive associations of baseline distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology at 2-year follow-up. In addition, the present study assessed distress tolerance with two laboratory-based tasks, a carbon dioxide challenge and the mirror-tracing task, to distinguish between tolerance of physiological and cognitive distress, respectively. Elevated anxiety sensitivity was broadly associated with elevated symptoms of internalizing psychopathology at baseline and prospectively predicted elevated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 2-year follow-up. Higher tolerance of cognitive distress was associated with lower concurrent anxiety symptoms but not with anxiety symptoms at follow-up. The present results clarify previously mixed findings; during adolescence, anxiety sensitivity showed broad concurrent and prospective associations with internalizing disorder risk whereas distress tolerance, specifically regarding cognitive distress, was associated with only elevated concurrent anxiety symptoms.

AB The current study tested whether emotion dysregulation predicts suicidal ideation over the course of 6 months. Community members (N = 298) with elevated suicide risk completed a clinical interview and self-report questionnaires at baseline and month-6 follow-up appointments. Elevated general emotion dysregulation but not subscales significantly predicted increases in suicidal ideation at month-6 follow-up after accounting for initial suicidal ideation, treatment condition, and negative affectivity. Furthermore, general emotion dysregulation as well as lack of awareness and lack of clarity subscales were significantly associated with prior suicide attempts at baseline after accounting for negative affectivity. Findings support the establishment of emotion dysregulation as a risk factor for suicidal ideation and provide evidence for a role in suicide attempts. Findings call for the development of interventions targeting emotion dysregulation in effectively predicting and preventing suicidality.

AB Recent meta-analyses have reported significant effects of attachment quality on social competence, mostly using observational assessments of attachment behavior to assess security. We analyze the associations between attachment security - assessed as a secure base script, and social competence with peers - measured by teachers' ratings on two self-report instruments, in a Portuguese sample of 82 preschool children (34 boys and 48 girls). We also tested the association between children's secure base script scores and teacher ratings for externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. Results show significant sex differences. Girls had higher scores on secure base script and were rated by teachers as more socially competent, while boys received higher ratings for aggressive/externalizing behaviors. Nonetheless, when the effect of child sex was controlled, attachment representations were positively associated with child social competence and negatively associated with ratings of externalizing behaviors.

AB Background: Adolescent cannabis use is associated with increased risk for psychological problems, with evidence for more severe problems among youth who use cannabis in combination with other substances (i.e., polysubstance use). Juvenile offenders engage in both cannabis use and polysubstance use at higher rates than the general adolescent population. Yet, limited research has examined the relationship between cannabis poly-use (e.g., cannabis and alcohol use) and functional or psychological problems among juvenile offenders. Objectives: The current study addresses this gap by examining the association of polysubstance use of cannabis compared to cannabis only use with cognitive functioning, psychological distress, and substance-related problems among juvenile detainees. Methods: Participants were 238 detained youth ages 12-18 (80.4 % male, 77.3% non-White) who completed assessments of substance use, intellectual functioning, psychological symptoms, and substance-related problems. Youth were also assessed by a clinical psychologist for substance use disorder. Results: Four cannabis-use typologies were identified; cannabis and alcohol use was the largest class, followed by cannabis only use, cannabis, alcohol and other drug use, then cannabis and other drug use. Polysubstance use was associated with lower scores on measures of intellectual functioning, more externalizing and internalizing symptomology, and more substance-related problems relative to cannabis only use. However, the relationship between polysubstance use and problems varied by typology. Conclusions: Findings suggest that justice-involved youth engaged in polysubstance use may be at greater need for concurrent academic, affective, and behavioral support in their rehabilitation and transition back to the community.

AB Background: Research has demonstrated that problem behavior has been associated with substance use, but knowledge is lacking on such associations in a low-income country like Nepal. Aims: This study aimed to find associations between emotional and behavioral problems and substance use among Nepalese adolescents. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the end of 2011, with participants from three schools in the Province 4 of Nepal. We selected 408 adolescents aged 12 to 18 (mean 15.2 years, 54% boys) at one urban and two rural schools. The data were collected using the Youth Self-Report and Adolescents' Substance Use Measurement. Results: Higher scores on withdrawn/depressed symptoms, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent or aggressive behavior or internalizing or externalizing problems were associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol or other substances. In the broadband scales, only internalizing problems predicted the use of intoxicants. Higher scores for attention problems predicted the use of tobacco, any intoxicants, and high-risk user. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that problem behavior among Nepalese adolescents was associated with substance use. Future studies should explore the association between problem behavior and substance use, including causal factors, so that risky behavior among Nepalese adolescents can be prevented.

AB Background: Many pregnant women in the United States have suboptimal vitamin D, but the impact on infant development is unclear. Moreover, no pregnancy-specific vitamin D recommendations have been widely accepted. Aims: Given the ubiquitous expression of vitamin D receptors in the brain, we investigated the association between early prenatal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and children's social and emotional development in the Newborn Epigenetic Study, a prospective study of pregnancies from 2009 to 2011 in Durham, North Carolina. Methods: We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in first or second trimester plasma samples and categorized 25(OH)D concentrations into quartiles. Covariates were derived from maternal questionnaires. Mothers completed the Infant Toddler Social-Emotional Development Assessment when children were 12-24 months of age. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate associations between 25(OH)D and specific behavior scores, adjusted for season of blood draw, maternal age, education, parity, smoking, marital status, prepregnancy BMI, and infant gender. We investigated effect-measure modification by race/ethnicity. Results: Of the 218 mother-infant pairs with complete data, Black mothers had much lower 25(OH)D concentrations as compared to White and Hispanic mothers. After adjustment, lower prenatal 25(OH)D was associated with slightly higher (less favorable) Internalizing scores among White children, but lower (more favorable) Internalizing scores among Black and Hispanic children. Lower prenatal 25(OH)D also appears to be associated with higher (less favorable) dysregulation scores, though only among White and Hispanic children. Conclusions: Though imprecise, preliminary results warrant further investigation regarding a role for prenatal vitamin D on children's early social and emotional development.

   preterms
SO PLOS ONE

   PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES; AUTISM; PREDICTORS; CHILDHOOD
AB Objective
   To assess which factors, including maternal, lifestyle, pregnancy-and delivery-related, fetal and neonatal factors adjusted for socio-economic status, are related to emotional and behavioral problems in moderately-late preterm born children (MLPs; gestational age 32.0-35.9 weeks) at 4 years of age. MLPs are at greater risk of emotional and behavioral problems than full-term born children. Especially for MLPs, knowledge about factors that increase or decrease the risk of emotional and behavioral problems is scarce.
   Design and setting
   We assessed emotional and behavioral problems in 809 MLPs between ages 41 and 49 months from the prospective community-based Longitudinal Preterm Outcome Project (LOLLIPOP), using the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We collected potential risk factors from hospital records and parental questionnaires. Univariable and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied.
   Main outcome measures
   (Sub) clinical CBCL scores.
   Results
   Perinatal infection increased the risk of CBCL total problem scores with an OR 2.22 (p<0.01). Perinatal infection, maternal smoking, and male gender increased the risk of CBCL externalizing problem scores with ORs between 1.64 and 2.46 (all p<0.05). Multiple birth decreased the risk of CBCL internalizing problem scores with an OR 0.63 (p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   Risk factors for behavioral problems in MLPs are male gender, perinatal infection and maternal smoking, the latter two being potentially modifiable. Multiple birth is a protective factor for emotional problems in MLPs. These results suggest potential factors for targeting preventive intervention in MLPs, comprising the large majority of all preterm born children.

AB The current 6-wave longitudinal study tested the family stress model among 204 Mexican-origin families in which an adolescent pregnancy had occurred. Wave 1 (W1) occurred when adolescents (M age = 16.80 years, SD = 1.00) were pregnant. and the last wave (W6) occurred when children were 5 years of age. In the current study, the family stress model was expanded to include parenting relations among adolescent mothers and fathers, and among adolescent mothers and grandmothers. In support of the family stress model. findings indicated that W1 family income was negatively associated with W6 child internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors via increased W2 economic pressure, increased W3 maternal depressive symptoms, increased W4 mother-grandmother coparenting conflict, and increased W5 maternal parenting hassles. Additionally, W4 mother- father coparenting conflict was positively associated with W6 child internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors via W5 maternal parenting hassles. Findings are discussed with attention to the processes by which family income informs child problem behaviors over time.

AB Aims: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are highly disabling neuropsychiatric conditions. Although evidence suggests a high burden of AUDs in young adults, few studies have investigated their life course predictors. It is crucial to assess factors that may influence these disorders from early life through adolescence to deter AUDs in early adulthood by tailoring prevention and intervention strategies. This review aims to assess temporal links between childhood and adolescent predictors of clinically diagnosed AUDs in young adults.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase databases for longitudinally assessed predictors of AUDs in young adults. Data were extracted and assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment tool for cohort studies. We performed our analysis by grouping predictors under six main domains.
   Results and Conclusion: Twenty two studies met the eligibility criteria. The outcome in all studies was measured according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Our review suggests strong links between externalizing symptoms in adolescence and AUDs in young adulthood, as well as when externalizing symptoms co-occur with illicit drug use. Findings on the role of internalizing symptoms and early drinking onset were inconclusive. Environmental factors were influential but changed over time. In earlier years, maternal drinking predicted early adult AUD while parental monitoring and school engagement were protective. Both peer and parental influences waned in adulthood. Further high-quality large longitudinal studies that identify distinctive developmental pathways on the aetiology of AUDs and assess the role of early internalizing symptoms and early drinking onset are warranted.

AB Objective Household food insecurity is common among U.S. families, and adolescents are almost twice as likely as school-aged children to be food insecure. However, little is known about how household food insecurity relates to adolescent behavioral outcomes over time. The purpose of this study was to examine whether food security status in early adolescence is associated with behavioral problems over a 6-year period in an ethnically diverse sample of teenagers from low-income households. Methods The study examined longitudinal data from the Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study. A total of 1,049 primary caregivers completed measures of child/adolescent behavioral problems and household food insecurity during the past year. Data were collected across three waves, when focal children were between 10 and 14 years old, 11 and 16 years old, and 16 and 18 years old, respectively. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess initial household food insecurity as a time-invariant effect on adolescent behavioral problems over time. Results Baseline household food insecurity in pre- or early adolescence was significantly associated with greater internalizing problems and total behavioral problems over time. Conclusions These findings indicate that household food insecurity is associated with behavioral problems throughout adolescence. This suggests the need for health providers to screen for household food insecurity during scheduled health visits and highlight the need for integration of psychosocial services into pediatric care and expansions in current federal assistance programs.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Mental illnesses affect >15% of Canadian adolescents. New preventive strategies are critically needed. We examined the associations of meeting established recommendations for diet, physical activity, sleep, and sedentary behavior in childhood with mental illness in adolescence.METHODS:Population-based prospective study (n = 3436) linking 2011 health behavior survey data of 10- to 11-year-olds with administrative health data from 2011 to 2014. Lifestyle behaviors were measured with the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire and self- and parental-proxy reports, expressed as meeting recommendations for vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives, added sugar, saturated fat, sleep, screen time, and physical activity. Mental illness was defined by physician-diagnosed internalizing, externalizing, and other psychiatric conditions. Negative binomial regression was used to determine the independent and cumulative associations of meeting lifestyle recommendations with physician visits for mental illnesses.RESULTS:Of all participants, 12%, 67%, and 21% met 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9 recommendations, respectively, and 15% had a mental illness diagnosis during follow-up. Compared with meeting 1 to 3 recommendations, meeting 7 to 9 recommendations was associated with 56% (95% confidence interval: 38%-69%) fewer physician visits for mental illness during follow-up. Every additional recommendation met was associated with 15% fewer physician visits for mental illnesses (95% confidence interval: 9%-21%).CONCLUSIONS:Mental illness in adolescence is associated with compliance to lifestyle recommendations in childhood, with stronger associations seen when more recommendations are met. Emphasizing lifestyle recommendations in pediatric practice may reduce the future burden of mental illness.

AB Objective: High rates of childhood trauma and adult suicidality have been reported in patients who have schizophrenia. This study sought to explore mediators between childhood trauma and suicidality in adulthood to help determine therapeutic approaches.
   Methods: This study included 314 adult patients with early psychosis who were participants in the Korean Early Psychosis Cohort Study, which was a prospective naturalistic observational cohort study started in December 2014. DSM-5 criteria were used to assign the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Cross-sectional data obtained at baseline were used for analysis. The Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale were employed to collect data on childhood trauma and suicidal ideation and attempts. Other measures were used to evaluate depression, empathy, psychopathology, and rumination.
   Results: A total of 90.1% of the participants experienced at least 1 childhood traumatic event. The rates of significant` physical punishment, emotional abuse, and sexual events were 37.3%, 35.6%, and 6.4%, respectively. The rates of recent suicidal ideation and attempts were 32.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Independent predictors of recent suicidal ideation included depression, negative schema, and rumination. Furthermore, negative schema and rumination played partial or full mediating roles in the relationship between childhood trauma and recent suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of performing careful evaluations of childhood trauma and suicidality and of developing effective strategies to reduce mediating factors that may be amenable to psychosocial approaches.

AB This paper examines the relationship between exposure to neighborhood crime and child mental health. We merge restricted contextual data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study with the National Neighborhood Crime Study, a nationally representative neighborhood sample containing tract-level Uniform Crime Report data for large U.S. cities and clustered OLS regression models to examine how objective measures of robbery or burglary rates at or around birth influence the health and behavior of 566 girls and 646 boys in urban neighborhoods. Findings demonstrate that living in a high crime neighborhood is associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems for preschool-aged boys and girls. However, these patterns differ for boys and girls and across measures of violent (robbery) and property crime (burglary).

AB We investigated potential crossover from mothers' and fathers' work-family conflict to their own and their partner's perception of inter-parental conflict and parenting irritability, and subsequent influences on children's and adolescents' mental health. Using a representative sample of Australian children (N = 3061), an auto-regressive model tested four mediation paths for mother-reported child internalizing and externalizing problems (4-5 to 14-15 years), and a second model tested two mediation paths for adolescent-reported problems (8-9 to 14-15 years). Findings indicated that mothers' and fathers' parenting irritability (6-7 years) mediated the association between mothers' work-family conflict (4-5 years) and mother-reported child externalizing problems (8-9 years); and mothers' parenting irritability (12-13 years) mediated the association between fathers' work-family conflict (10-11 years) and mother- and adolescent-reported externalizing problems (14-15 years). Findings demonstrate the potential for work-family conflict to cross over to parenting, thus influencing long-term child mental health.

AB The aim of this 8-year longitudinal study was to predict children's (n = 96) level of self-reported victimization at age 9 and their development of victimization from age 9 to 13 from parent-reported and teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 5. We also examined whether ego-resiliency was a protective factor in these associations. Findings revealed that early childhood externalizing behavior was positively related to chronic experiences of peer victimization from age 9 to 13, especially among children with low levels of ego-resiliency. Internalizing behavior in early childhood was not related to peer victimization throughout middle childhood and adolescence. Suggestions for further research and practical implications for early prevention of peer victimization were discussed.

AB Evidence suggests that early pubertal timing may operate as a transdiagnostic risk factor (i.e., shared across syndromes of psychopathology) for both genders. The current study examined associations between pubertal timing and dimensional psychopathology, structured across different levels of three organizational models: (a) DSM-based syndrome model, (b) traditional model of internalizing and externalizing factors, and (c) bifactor (p factor) model, which includes a general psychopathology factor as well as internalizing- and externalizing-specific factors. For study analyses, 567 youth-parent pairs completed psychopathology measures when youths (55.5% female) were 13.58 years old (SD = 2.37, range = 9-17 years). Findings across all models revealed that early pubertal timing served as a transdiagnostic risk factor and also displayed some syndrome-specific associations. Gender did not moderate any relationships between pubertal timing and psychopathology. Study findings reinforce the importance of examining risk across different levels of psychopathology conceptualization and analysis.

AB Objective: Longitudinal studies on neurobehavioral development in relation to prenatal and postnatal exposure to phthalates in school-age children and adolescents are limited. We investigated the association of prenatal and childhood phthalate exposure with the development of behavioral syndromes in 8-14-year-old children.
   Method: We recruited 430 pregnant women from 2000 to 2001 and followed their children at the ages of 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years, yielding 153 mother-child pairs in total. Urine samples from pregnant women in the third trimester and from children at 2-8 years of age were analyzed for the concentrations of seven urinary phthalate metabolites: monomethyl phthalate, monoethyl phthalate, monobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, namely mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate. Behavioral syndromes in children aged 8-14 years were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist. We constructed mixed models to examine these associations after adjustments for potential covariates.
   Results: Maternal urinary MEHP levels were associated with higher scores for internalizing problems ((beta = 0.028, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0004, 0.055) and externalizing problems (beta = 0.040, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.066). Associations of the maternal urinary sum of DEHP metabolite levels with delinquent behavior scores and externalizing problems scores were positive (beta = 0.035, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.057 for delinquent behavior; beta = 0.026, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.050 for externalizing problems). Furthermore, children's urinary MBzP levels were associated with higher scores for social problems (beta = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.035). Similar patterns were observed for borderline and clinical ranges.
   Conclusion: Early-life exposure to phthalates may influence behavioral syndrome development in children. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings, and efforts to reduce exposures to phthalates during critical early life stages may be warranted.

AB Background The prenatal exposure to maternal n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) might influence the development of social competence and internalizing and externalizing behaviours of the child, because of the numerous functions of PUFAs within the nervous system.
   Methods: To analyse the association of selected maternal PUFAs (i.e., AA, EPA, DHA, total n-6, total n-3, and the n-6:n-3 ratio) measured during gestation with childhood social competence and problem behaviours, we examined 311 mother-child pairs from the Maastricht Essential Fatty Acid Birth (MEFAB) cohort. For each woman, PUFA-specific changes in relative concentrations were calculated by identifying the best-fitting curve of PUFA concentration by linear splines of gestational age. The associations of changes in maternal PUFAs in early and late pregnancy with childhood social competence, total problems, internalizing and externalizing behaviours, measured with the Child Behaviour Checklist 4/18 at age 7, were investigated with linear regression analyses adjusted for maternal and children's socio-demographic characteristics.
   Results: In late gestation (i.e., from gestational week 30), an increase in AA was associated with higher social competence, while a decrease in total n-6 was associated with lower externalizing behaviours. No other significant associations were found.
   Discussion: In this prospective study, increasing maternal AA and decreasing total n-6 were associated with improved social competence and externalizing behaviours, respectively, in 7-year old children. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of the identified associations is modest and further investigations are warranted to clarify the relationship between maternal AA and total n-6 during pregnancy and childhood social and behavioural development.

AB Minors' mental health is a subject of high global concern. Understanding the factors that influence their mental health is essential to improving the health of future generations. In this study, an analysis of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire's usefulness is carried out, as a validated tool, recognized in Spain and internationally, for the measurement of minors' mental health. In turn, the influence of the variables of gender, age, and physical health, along with the occupational social class of parents on Spanish minors' mental health, has been analyzed. Spanish minors with good physical health and of parents with middle and higher education, as well as in an occupational social class, are less likely to suffer mental health problems. On the other hand, it seems that internalizing symptoms are more likely in girls, and externalizing symptoms are more likely in boys. However, when a global measure of mental health is made without specific subscales, the effects of gender and age diverge greatly, according to the studies. Although there are examples of current research using the same measurement tool, there is still a need for many more international studies that are coordinated using the same methodology. This study identifies the factors which the international and Spanish scientific literature has revealed as being determinants in minors' mental health. Finally, it is essential that the influence of these factors be assessed in the areas of primary care and mental health to facilitate better detection, intervention, or prevention of mental health problems in today's children, as well as the children of future generations.

AB Objectives: This paper set out to contribute to the literature by linking research into offending pathways with the study of longitudinal effects and intergenerational transmission of mental health.
   Methods: Data was used from two generations of the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, a longitudinal study of 411 men from London and their children who were followed since 1961-62.
   Results: Findings from this study (1) indicate that symptoms of depression and anxiety were highest among those who commenced offending in adulthood and (2) demonstrated familial continuity of mental health: poor offspring mental health was related to father's criminality, but not to their offender group.
   Conclusions: A thorough understanding of the heterogeneity of offenders is essential for policy and practice. It is suggested that future research further examines individuals who only commence offending in adulthood, since they have been shown to not only face a variety of adverse outcomes themselves, but are also likely to have children with distinct patterns of internalizing problems.

AB Purpose: Crime, depression, and substance abuse, often co-occur. This study examined competing models considering each problem domain individually as a driving mechanism for the other problems to better understand etiology and inform prevention efforts. Gender differences were also examined.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Seattle Social Development Project, a multiethnic and gender-balanced urban panel of 808 participants constituted in 1985. Cross-lagged models examined prospective assessments of early (grades 7 & 8) and late (grades 9-12) adolescent internalizing problems, substance use, and delinquency, as well as measures of depression, substance dependence, and crime at early adulthood (ages 21-24) and later adulthood (ages 27-30).
   Results: Comparisons of nested models by gender showed (a) continuity in internalizing behaviors/depression, substance use/dependence, and delinquency/crime for both women and men; (b) accounting for continuity, depression did not consistently drive other problems for either women or men; (c) among women, both substance abuse and crime appeared to be important driving mechanisms; and (d) among men, crime emerged as the most pertinent driving mechanism.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that externalizing problems may be more important driving mechanisms for depression than vice versa. Preventing crime and substance abuse may have the important added benefit of reducing early adult depression.

AB Purpose: Reciprocal prospective associations between adolescent antisocial behavior and depressive symptoms were examined.
   Methods: Seventh grade students (average age 13 years; N = 2314/2348) were surveyed (T1), and then followed-up 12 (T2) and 24 months (T3) later, using the same methods in Washington State, United States and Victoria, Australia.
   Results: Negative binomial regressions showed antisocial behavior (T1, T2) did not prospectively predict depressive symptoms (T2, T3). T1 multivariate predictors for T2 depressive symptoms included female gender (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.70), prior depressive symptoms (IRR = 1.06), alcohol use (IRR = 1.13), family conflict (IRR = 1.13), antisocial peers (IRR = 1.08) and bullying victimization (IRR = 1.06). Depressive symptoms (T1, T2) did not predict antisocial behavior (T2, T3). T1 multivariate predictors for T2 antisocial behavior included female gender (IRR = 0.96), age (IRR = 0.97), prior antisocial behavior (IRR = 1.32), alcohol use (IRR = 1.04), antisocial peers (IRR = 1.11) and academic failure (IRR = 1.03).
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and antisocial behaviors showed considerable predictive stability in early adolescence but were not reciprocally related. Prevention and intervention strategies in adolescence may benefit by targeting common predictors such as alcohol, peer interactions and early symptoms for depression and antisocial behavior.

AB The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) is one of the most widely used screening tools for schizotypy in adults. The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Child version (SPQ-C) was recently developed to assess schizotypy in children and has a similar three-factor structure to the adult SPQ (i.e., Cognitive-Perceptual, Interpersonal-Affective, and Disorganization). However, few studies to date have reported on the psychometric properties and the usefulness of the SPQ-C in Eastern populations, including Mainland China. This study presents the first psychometric assessment of the Chinese SPQ-C in Mainland China. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to assess the factor structure of the SPQ-C in 1668 children (M = 12.10, SD = 0.60 years) from the China Jintan Child Cohort Study. Our findings document a three-factor structure and partial measurement invariance across residential location and gender, replicating the psychometric properties of the SPQ-C in English. The Chinese SPQ-C further correlates with standard behavioral problems (i.e., Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report and Teacher Report Form), demonstrating construct validity and utility as a child psychopathology assessment tool. Our findings provide the first robust psychometric evidence for a three factor structure of the Chinese SPQ-C in a large Mainland Chinese sample, and suggest that the SPQ-C is suitable as a screening tool for schizotypy in community children who may be at risk for behavioral problems and later psychosis.

AB Limited research has examined sleep-related problems (SRPs) among children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The present study addresses this gap by investigating preliminary associations between SRPs, demographic factors (gender and age), family variables (family accommodation and parental stress), and clinical factors (medication status, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, OCD severity, OCD-related impairment), and treatment outcomes in a sample of 103 youth (aged 7 to 17 years; 53% female) with a primary diagnosis of OCD. Clinician, parent, and child measures were used to assess demographic, family, and clinical predictors. SRPs were assessed using an 8-item measure comprising items of the Child Behaviour Checklist, Child Depression Inventory, and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children as used in previous studies. Results showed that SRPs were highly prevalent among this sample and that more SRPs were associated with younger age, internalizing problems, and functional impairment. However, SRPs were not an independent predictor of OCD severity, impairment, or treatment response. Preliminary findings suggest that SRPs among youth with OCD may be more strongly associated with broader internalizing symptoms than with OCD itself. Future longitudinal research is warranted to further explore the complexity of SRPs when co-occurring with pediatric OCD.

AB The Parent Management Training - Oregon model (PMTO) and the adaption of PMTO, the Brief Parent Training (BPT), are two versions of parent management training, proven effective to reduce emerging or present child conduct problems through modifying child-parent interaction. Research, however, indicates substantial co morbidity between high levels of conduct problems, low social competence, and depression/anxiety. The aim of this study was to examine to what extent PMTO and BPT have treatment effects beyond conduct problems, that is, additionally reduce the level of depression/anxiety and increase social competence. We investigated cross domain effects in two independent randomized-controlled samples, receiving either PMTO or BPT, which differed with regard to treatment mode, intensity, and target groups. Participants (BPT: N = 216, PMTO: N = 137) were Norwegian parents of children (age 3-12) with emerging or present conduct problems, randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition. Results showed that both BPT and PMTO reduced conduct problems and increased social competence, but only BPT reduced the level of depression/anxiety. Implications and limitations of the results are discussed.

AB This study used a structural equation mixture model to examine associations between child maltreatment, polygenic risk, and indices of adaptive functioning. Children aged 6 to 13 years (N = 1,004), half maltreated, half nonmaltreated, were recruited to attend a research day camp. Multi-informant indicators of prosocial behavior, antisocial behavior, withdrawn behavior, and depression were collected and used in a latent class analysis. Four classes emerged, characterizing well-adjusted, externalizing, internalizing, and socially dominant groups. Twelve genetic variants, previously reported in the Gene x Environment literature, were modeled as one weighted polygenic risk score. Large main effects between maltreatment and adaptive functioning were observed (Wald = 35.3, df = 3, p < .0001), along with evidence of a small Gene x Environment effect (Wald = 13.5, df = 3, p = .004), adjusting for sex, age, and covariate interaction effects.

AB According to the developmental psychopathology framework, adverse childhood experiences, including child sexual abuse (CSA), may alter the course of normal development in children. Attachment security has been identified as a protective factor against psychopathology and may thus play a critical role in predicting victims' adaptation. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the mediating effect of attachment representations in the relation between CSA and behavior problems over a 1-year period. The sample consisted of 391 children (251 sexually abused) aged 3.5 to 6 years. The Attachment Story Completion Task and the Child Behavior Checklist were used. Disorganized attachment partially mediated the relation between CSA and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems 1 year following the initial assessment. This mediation effect was not found for ambivalent nor secure attachment dimensions. Child gender was found to moderate the association between CSA and disorganization, with larger effects of CSA among boys. These findings underscore the importance of considering attachment representations in treatment programs for preschool victims. Evidence-based practice focusing on trauma could be combined with an attachment-based intervention targeting the parent-child relationship. Moreover, interventions should be gender sensitive, as CSA appears to affect boys and girls differently.

   ALLOSTATIC OVERLOAD
AB Research suggests that early adversity places individuals at risk for psychopathology across the life span. Guided by concepts of allostasis and allostatic load, the present study examined whether early adversity contributes to the development of subsequent internalizing symptoms through its association with traitlike individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. Early adolescent girls (n = 113; M age = 12.30 years) provided saliva samples at waking, 30 min postwaking, and bedtime over 3 days (later assayed for cortisol). Objective contextual stress interviews with adolescents and their mothers were used to assess the accumulation of nine types of early adversity within the family environment. Greater early adversity predicted subsequent increases in internalizing symptoms through lower levels of latent trait cortisol. Traitlike individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity may be among the mechanisms through which early adversity confers risk for the development of psychopathology.

AB Recent proposals suggest early adversity sets in motion particularly chronic and neurobiologically distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms. However, few prospective studies in high-risk samples delineate distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms from preschool age onward. We examined trajectories in a high-risk cohort, oversampled for internalizing symptoms, several preschool risk/maintenance factors, and school-age outcomes. Parents of 325 children completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire on up to four waves of data collection from preschool (3-5 years) to school age (8-9 years) and Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interviews at both ages. Multi-informant data were collected on risk factors and symptoms. Growth mixture modelling identified four trajectory classes of internalizing symptoms with stable low, rising low-to-moderate, stable moderate, and stable high symptoms. Children in the stable high symptom trajectory manifested clinically relevant internalizing symptoms, mainly diagnosed with anxiety disorders/depression at preschool and school age. Trajectories differed regarding loss/separation experience, maltreatment, maternal psychopathology, temperament, and stress-hormone regulation with loss/separation, temperament, maternal psychopathology, and stress-hormone regulation (trend) significantly contributing to explained variance. At school age, trajectories continued to differ on symptoms, disorders, and impairment. Our study is among the first to show that severe early adversity may trigger a chronic and neurobiologically distinct internalizing trajectory from preschool age onward.

AB In an upper-middle class setting, we explored associations between students' peer reputation in Grades 6 and 7 with adjustment at Grade 12. With a sample of 209 students, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of peer reputation dimensions supported a 4-factor model (i.e., popular, prosocial, aggressive, isolated). Structural equation models were used to examine prospective links between middle school peer reputation and diverse Grade 12 adjustment indices, including academic achievement (Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and grade point average), internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Prosocial reputation was connected to higher academic achievement levels and fewer externalizing symptoms. Both prosocial and isolated reputations were negatively associated with dimensions of substance use, whereas popularity was positively associated. Implications for future research and interventions are discussed.

AB Children of alcoholics (COAs) are at risk for elevated internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Yet, little is known about the familial and behavioral adjustments of COAs following parental separation. Using an ecological-transactional framework, we examined how multiple risk factors contributed to the formation of different alcoholic family structures and how living in heterogeneous family structures affected COAs' behavioral problems. The Michigan Longitudinal Study, a multiwave study on initially intact alcoholic and control families with preschool-age children (n = 503), was used to evaluate outcomes of offspring, when families either remained intact or were separated when the child was aged 12-14. Alcoholic families who later transitioned into stepfamilies were characterized with higher paternal antisociality, marital aggression, and serious family crises than alcoholic families that remained intact. COAs in stepfamilies (but not in single-parent families) exhibited higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in preadolescence compared with those in alcoholic intact families, in part because of elevated behavioral risk at age 3. Structural equation modeling indicated that the aggregated risk of stepfamily residence directly related to COAs' internalizing and indirectly related to COAs' externalizing problems, partially mediated by family stressors. Findings suggest targeting COAs in separated families for early intervention.

AB Psychological symptoms that arise in early childhood can follow a multitude of patterns into adolescence, including homotypic continuity (i.e., similar symptoms over time) and heterotypic continuity (i.e., a shift in symptoms over time). However, we know very little about the factors that distinguish homotypic vs. heterotypic continuity of early internalizing and externalizing symptoms over development. In a separate line of research, diurnal cortisol has been shown to predict later internalizing and externalizing problems. In the current study, we tested whether diurnal cortisol patterns moderated the course of internalizing and externalizing symptoms from preschool to early adolescence. 554 children (54% male) and parents participated in a longitudinal study. Parents reported on their children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms at ages 3 and 12, and children collected diurnal saliva samples at age 9. Results showed that a steeper cortisol decline at age 9 combined with high internalizing or externalizing problems at age 3 predicted higher internalizing problems at age 12. A more blunted cortisol decline combined with early internalizing or externalizing problems predicted higher externalizing problems in early adolescence. These results illustrate the moderating role of stress system functioning in homotypic and heterotypic patterns of psychopathology from preschool to early adolescence.

AB Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine whether mothers with epilepsy experience family problems and to investigate the possible mediating role of distinct family factors in the relationship between maternal epilepsy and child behavioral problems, in which it is also investigated whether more proximal family factors mediate the more distal family factors.
   Methods: In an observational study, with children identified from the European Registry of Antiepileptic Drugs and Pregnancy database in the Netherlands (EURAP-NL), parents completed questionnaires on maternal epilepsy, family factors (proximal, distal, contextual, global), and child behavior. Hierarchical multilevel regression analyses were performed to examine the relative contribution of epilepsy-related and family factors on child internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results: Between January 2015 and March 2018, the questionnaires were completed for 175 children. Mothers with epilepsy showed significantly more parenting stress and problems with parenting than mothers from the general population. Family factors were significantly associated with child behavioral problems. For internalizing problems, maternal epilepsy, global, contextual, and distal family factors were each found to have significant added value. Distal family factors contributed most to internalizing problems and showed a mediating role for epilepsy-related factors and previous added family factors in the model. Global, contextual, distal, and proximal factors were all found to be significant contributors to externalizing problems, with the factor most proximal to the child (quality of parent-child interaction) showing the largest effect.
   Discussion: Including family factors in research regarding children of mothers with epilepsy is important as they can have a contribution additional to the teratogenic risks of prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Family factors, in particular distal and proximal family factors, can weaken or strengthen child development and may provide starting points for interventions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB While many psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk for suicidal behaviors (SB) in children and adolescents, a few studies have explored the role of clinical symptoms based on a dimensional approach. Irritability is seen as a marker, a general psychopathology, and a symptom of both externalizing and internalizing disorders. In this review, we are interested in determining whether and how irritability can predict SB in youth. First, we reviewed consistencies and variation in the literature linking irritability to suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA). Second, based on the available models, we proposed specific mechanistic pathways, whereby irritability may modulate the risk for SB. Irritability has been found associated with SB both in cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies. The relation is consistent in different settings (i.e., general population and clinical settings) and across psychiatric disorders. The association is reduced but persists after adjusting for psychiatric disorder, including depression. On one hand, irritability constitutes a risk factor for SI via the onset of internalized disorder. On the other hand, irritable youth may be more prone to attempt suicide when experiencing SI. The measures for irritability were heterogeneous. A limited number of studies were designed to explore the role of mediators and/or moderators. Recognizing irritability in children and adolescents is a key issue with regards to suicide prevention.

AB Our goal in conducting this study was to examine whether children with somatic symptom disorders (SSD) and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) have higher rates of insecure or disorganized attachment and difficulties in mentalizing (operationalized as reflective functioning) as compared to a control group. Participants were 131 children (8-15 years) spanning two groups-a clinical group (n = 85), comprised of children fitting the criteria of our target diagnostic classifications (SSD: N = 45; DBD: N = 40), as well as a comparison group of healthy control children (n = 46). Children completed the Child Attachment Interview, which was later coded by reliable raters for attachment security and reflective functioning (RF). Consistent with our predictions, children in the clinical group had significantly lower RF and were significantly more likely to have insecure (over 80%) and disorganized attachment (over 40%) than children in the comparison group. In addition, RF was significantly lower in children with DBD than children with SSD. Furthermore, in the SSD group, children's RF regarding self was significantly lower than RF regarding others. Finally, consistent with prior studies, RF and attachment were associated. The findings indicate that school-aged children with SSD and DBD have higher rates of insecure and disorganized attachment. Consistent with theory, RF and attachment were loosely coupled, but RF alone differentiated among the diagnostic subgroups. Implications for treatment and prevention are discussed.

The current study examined bidirectional effects between parenting stress and three domains of child functioning (ASD symptoms, internalizing behavior problems, and externalizing behavior problems) across four time points in 188 families of children with ASD (ages 5-12 years). Mother and father reports of parenting stress and child functioning were used in cross-lag models to examine bidirectional associations between parenting stress and child functioning. Results indicated parent-driven effects for child internalizing behavior problems, while child externalizing behavior problems and ASD symptoms evidenced both parent-driven and child-driven effects, in different ways for mothers versus fathers. Overall, findings have important implications for interventions for families of children with ASD.

AB Objectives: Although there is agreement that childhood disability is both a risk and result of maltreatment, the extent of disability in the child welfare system remains unclear. Our objective is to determine the prevalence and severity of child impairment in a national sample of child abuse and neglect investigations in the United States. Methods: We used data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II, a study of 2644 children older than 3 years who were subjects of child abuse and neglect investigations. Groups of children were identified by latent profile analysis using continuous standardized measures of intelligence, emotional or behavioral impairments, adaptive behaviors, and social skills. Results: Whether the child remained in home or was removed to foster care after an investigation, 3 classes of children were identified: (1) slightly over one-tenth were in an intellectual disability subgroup characterized by marked intellectual impairments alongside delays in daily living functioning, (2) over one-third were in an emotional or behavioral impairment subgroup characterized by both frequent and severe internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and (3) slightly over half were in a typically developing subgroup. Conclusion: When using standardized measures of disability, nearly half of the children investigated by child protection in the United States are not typically developing. These findings suggest that those working for the child welfare system need to be attentive to the complex needs of children with intellectual disabilities and emotional or behavioral impairments and their families, many of whom are under significant stress.

AB For more than a century, research on psychopathology has focused on categorical diagnoses. Although this work has produced major discoveries, growing evidence points to the superiority of a dimensional approach to the science of mental illness. Here we outline one such dimensional system-the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)-that is based on empirical patterns of co-occurrence among psychological symptoms. We highlight key ways in which this framework can advance mental-health research, and we provide some heuristics for using HiTOP to test theories of psychopathology. We then review emerging evidence that supports the value of a hierarchical, dimensional model of mental illness across diverse research areas in psychological science. These new data suggest that the HiTOP system has the potential to accelerate and improve research on mental-health problems as well as efforts to more effectively assess, prevent, and treat mental illness.

AB Low resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is observed in many mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and nonsuicidal self-injury, among others. Findings for RSA reactivity are more mixed. We evaluate associations between RSA reactivity and empirically derived structural categories of psychopathologyincluding internalizing, externalizing, and thought problemsamong physically healthy adults. We searched multiple electronic databases for studies of RSA among participants who were assessed either dimensionally using well-validated measures or diagnostically using structured interviews. Strict inclusion criteria were used to screen 3,605 published reports, which yielded 37 studies including 2,347 participants and 76 effect sizes. We performed a meta-analysis, with meta-analytic regressions of potential moderators, including psychopathology subtypes. The sample-wide meta-analytic association between RSA reactivity and psychopathology was quite small, but heterogeneity was considerable. Moderation analyses revealed significant RSA reactivity (withdrawal) specifically in externalizing samples. Additional moderators included (a) stimulus conditions used to elicit RSA reactivity (only negative emotion inductions were effective), (b) sex (women showed greater RSA reactivity than men), and (c) adherence to established methodological guidelines (e.g., higher electrocardiographic sampling rates yielded greater RSA reactivity). These findings indicate that associations between RSA reactivity and psychopathology are complex and suggest that future studies should include more standardized RSA assessments to increase external validity and decrease measurement error.
   Although low resting heart rate variability, indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), marks several forms of psychopathology, links between RSA reactivity and psychopathology are less clear. A meta-analysis of existing literature across empirically based structural categories of psychopathology revealed significant RSA reactivity only in externalizing disordersnot in internalizing or thought disorders. Moderator analyses revealed (a) significant RSA withdrawal specifically to negative mood inductions, (b) greater RSA withdrawal among women than men, and (c) larger effects when higher ECG sampling rates were used and established methodological guidelines were followed. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB Life course models of the impact of discrimination on health and mental health outcomes posit that the pernicious effects of discrimination may not be immediate, but instead may become apparent at later stages in development. This study tests whether peer discrimination changes at particular transition points (i.e., transition to middle and high school) predict subsequent internalizing symptoms in Mexican-origin youth. In a sample of 674 Mexican-origin youth (50% female), this study used a latent change score framework to model changes in peer discrimination across time and to test whether changes in peer discrimination at 7th and 9th grades predicted greater depressive and anxiety symptoms in 12th grade controlling for 5th grade symptoms. Irrespective of longitudinal changes, greater peer discrimination in 5th grade predicted greater depressive and anxiety symptoms in 12th grade. Further, significant increases in peer discrimination from 7th to 8th grade and in 9th to 10th grade uniquely predicted greater anxiety symptoms in 12th grade. These findings suggest that longitudinal research on peer discrimination needs to take into account unique periods of risk. Future research implications are discussed.

AB Research documents that lability in parent-child relationships-fluctuations up and down in parent-child relationships-is normative during adolescence and is associated with increased risk for negative outcomes for youth. Yet little is known about factors that predict lability in parenting. This study evaluated whether children's behaviors predicted lability in parent-child relationships. Specifically this study tested whether youth maladjustment (delinquency, substance use, internalizing problems) in Grade 6 was associated with greater lability (e.g., more fluctuations) in parents' warmth and hostility towards their children across Grades 6-8. The study also tested whether the associations between youth maladjustment and lability in parents' warmth and hostility were moderated by parents' internalizing problems. The sample included youth and their parents in two parent families who resided in rural communities and small towns (N=618; 52% girls, 90% Caucasian). Findings suggest that parents' internalizing problems moderated the associations between child maladjustment and parenting lability. Among parents with high levels of internalizing problems, higher levels of youth maladjustment were associated with greater lability in parents' warmth. Among parents with low in internalizing problems, higher levels of youth maladjustment were associated with less lability in parents' warmth. The discussion focuses on how and why parent internalizing problems may affect parental reactivity to youth problem behavior and intervention implications.

AB Objective: Substantial literature has indicated that witnessing partner violence (WPV) is correlated with poor emotional, behavioral, and functional outcomes and is often associated with exposure to other potentially traumatic events. Young children are often overrepresented in the WPV group. This study fills an important gap in the literature by examining the association between WPV and other co-occurring trauma types and the association of early exposure to WPV with polyexposure. symptoms, and functional impairment. Method: Data from 8,446 youth presenting for clinical evaluation at a National Child Traumatic Stress Network Center were analyzed to examine (a) the association of WPV with polyexposure (defined as 4 or more trauma types); (b) the specific contribution of WPV in the context of polyexposure to posttraumatic stress. internalizing and externalizing symptoms. comorbid psychiatric conditions, functional impairment, and service utilization; and (c) the consequences of early exposure to WPV. Results: Youth with WPV were more likely to experience polyexposure than were youth without WPV (OR = 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.11, 2.62]). When polyexposure was included in regression models. WPV was significantly associated with higher mean scores of functional impairment. Moreover, WPV before age 2 resulted in significantly greater risk of polyexposure than did WPV at age 7 or older (OR = 1.54, 95% CI [1.27. 1.86]. for ages 7-10 and OR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.08, 1.72], for ages 11 and older). Conclusion: Early screening and intervention for WPV is needed to prevent polyexposure as well as impairments associated with both WPV and polyexposure.

AB Background: Given the ethical limitations of exposing children to experimentally manipulated adverse experiences, evidence of the effects of parent-child separation on subsequent psychopathology are based mostly on animal studies. Left-behind children phenomenon resulting from rural-urban mobility in China offers unique "natural experiments" to explore the long-term physical and mental health consequences of parent-child separation in childhood.
   Objective: To test the associations between parent-child separation with telomere length (TL) and psychopathology during adolescence.
   Method: A total of 710 adolescents (age: M = 16.86, SD = 1.52) were recruited from local schools in rural area of Fuyang, one of the top inland areas for outward migration in Anhui province, China. Parent-child separation was collected through face to face interview. The MacArthur Health & Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ) was used to assess internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure buccal TL.
   Results: Nearly 60% (399/695) of the participants experienced separation from both parents. Childhood or persistent separation from parents was associated with increased internalizing symptoms (childhood: beta = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.23; persistent: beta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.31), increased externalizing symptoms (childhood: beta = 0.17, 95% CI: -0.03, -0.32; persistent: beta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.35) and shorter telomere length (childhood: beta = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.26, -0.05; persistent: beta = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.03). Shortened TL was estimated to explain 15.2% and 12.7% of the total effect of separation on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, while internalizing and externalizing symptoms explained 23.4% and 12.3% of the effect of separation on shortened TL.
   Conclusion: Childhood and persistent parent-child separation, as experienced by rural left-behind children in China, associates with increased vulnerability for psychopathological symptoms and makers of cellular aging. The challenge for future research is to determine whether short telomere length is in fact a long-term consequence or an underlying vulnerability factor for future mental disorders.

AB Influential theories propose an important role for the autonomic nervous system in social behaviour and emotion regulation. Difficulties with these capabilities occur in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation technique that stimulates autonomic pathways by means of an electrode implanted around the left vagus nerve in the neck. It is a licenced treatment for epilepsy and depression. This study searches the literature for evidence of VNS effects on behaviour in ASD. A literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers using Embase, Medline, Psyclnfo and Cochrane using relevant search terms following the principals of the PRISMA guidance. The search strategy utilised a combination of text words and thesaurus terms to retrieve records relating to autism/pervasive developmental disorder and vagus nerve stimulation. No limits were applied. Supplementary searches were carried out on trials registers, and using backwards and forwards citation searching. A pre designed inclusion and exclusion criteria was administered to the identified results. From the 242 results identified search strategy 11 were found to satisfy the full search criteria and used to discuss the hypothesis. Eight studies were case series and three case reports. There is some evidence that VNS, when performed for epilepsy, may improve behaviour in people with ASD. There are indications that this occurs independently of its effects on seizure frequency and mood, although more rigorous studies are required. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Youth aged 15-17 years are at high risk of tobacco, alcohol and drug use. Given the changing landscape with respect to availability, use of emerging products and regulatory environments, we examined patterns and correlates of polysubstance use among US youth aged 15-17 years. Design Cross-sectional self-reported data. Setting United States. Participants A total of 6127 US youth aged 15-17 years from wave 1 (2013-14) of the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Measurements Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of polysubstance use, including 12 tobacco products, alcohol, marijuana, prescription drugs and other drugs. Socio-demographic characteristics, residence in urban area, sensation-seeking, sexual orientation and internalizing and externalizing problems were examined as correlates. Findings Approximately 43.5% of 15-17-year-olds had used at least one substance in the past 12 months. A 5-class model was identified: class 1 'abstainers' (67.3%), class 2 'alcohol users' (19.2%), class 3 'alcohol, marijuana and tobacco (AMT(predominant AM)) users' (8.2%), class 4 'alcohol, marijuana and tobacco (AMT(predominant T)) users' (3.9%) and class 5 'alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and other drug (AMTOD) users' (1.4%). Abstainers were considered the reference class. Higher sensation-seeking scores, higher age and lower academic grades were each associated with greater likelihood of membership in all user classes. Gender, race/ethnicity, parents/guardians' education, residence in non-urban areas and sexual minority groups were associated with membership in some, but not all, user classes. Compared with no/low/moderate severity, high severity internalizing problems were associated with membership in classes 2, 3 and 5, whereas high severity externalizing problems were associated with membership in classes 3 and 5 only. Conclusions There appear to be three heterogeneous polysubstance use classes among US youth aged 15-17 years. Correlates of substance use among US youth include higher sensation-seeking, poor academic performance, non-urban residence, minority sexual orientation and mental health problems.

AB In the current study, we compared emotion regulation abilities between post-institutionalized (PI; N = 124) and never-institutionalized non-adopted (NA; N = 172) children and adolescents (7-15 years). We assessed cortisol reactivity and coded emotion regulation during the speech portion of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-M). Parents reported on their children's social, academic, and behavioral adjustment. Results suggest that emotion regulation abilities increased with age, but this increase was greater for NA than PI youth. With regard to cortisol, piecewise growth modeling revealed that at higher levels of emotion regulation PI youth had greater baseline values (after a period of time allowing for acclimation to the laboratory) and had steeper recovery slopes than NA youth. There was also a main effect of emotion regulation on the reactivity slope suggesting that for both groups, as emotion regulation increased, the cortisol reactivity slope decreased. Finally, greater emotion regulation predicted fewer internalizing behavior problems for PI youth but not for NA youth.

AB We report findings of a psychometric study comparing scores from two screening tools: Student Risk Screening Scale-Internalizing and Externalizing (SRSS-IE, an adapted version of the Student Risk Screening Scale) and Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition, Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BASC-2 BESS). Participants were 624 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students attending a rural middle school in a southeastern state. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated statistically significant, positive relations between SRSS-IE and BASC-2 BESS scores, with very strong relations on externalizing and comorbid (internalizing and externalizing) scales. Results of concurrent classification accuracy analyses, kappa, and receiver operating curve analyses suggest the seven externalizing items on the SRSS (SRSS-E7) and BASC-2 BESS scores function in a similar manner with respect to detecting students with externalizing behaviors, but less so in detecting students with internalizing behaviors. Limitations and future direction are discussed.

AB Although movement disorders (MDs) are known complications, the exact frequency and severity remains uncertain in patients with classical galactosemia, especially in children. We determined the frequency, classification and severity of MDs in a cohort of pediatric and adult galactosemia patients, and assessed the association with nonmotor neuropsychological symptoms and daily functioning. Patients from seven centers in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with a confirmed galactosemia diagnosis were invited to participate. A videotaped neurological examination was performed and an expert panel scored the presence, classification and severity of MDs. Disease characteristics, nonmotor neuropsychological symptoms, and daily functioning were evaluated with structured interviews and validated questionnaires (Achenbach, Vineland, Health Assessment Questionnaire, SIP68). We recruited 37 patients; 19 adults (mean age 32.6 years) and 18 children (mean age 10.7 years). Subjective self-reports revealed motor symptoms in 19/37 (51.4%), similar to the objective (video) assessment, with MDs in 18/37 patients (48.6%). The objective severity scores were moderate to severe in one third (6/37). Dystonia was the overall major feature, with additional tremor in adults, and myoclonus in children. Behavioral or psychiatric problems were present in 47.2%, mostly internalizing problems, and associated with MDs. Daily functioning was significantly impaired in the majority of patients. Only one patient received symptomatic treatment for MDs. We show that MDs and nonmotor neuropsychological symptoms are frequent in both children and adults with classical galactosemia.

AB Adolescents who are particularly sensitive to social stress may be vulnerable to earlier alcohol consumption and related problems. Although a small literature supports this contention, previous studies mostly relied on retrospective self-report. The current study used discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA) to test whether real-time social stress responding (via laboratory induction) and social anxiety symptoms predicted 12-month alcohol onset in an alcohol-naive sample of young female adolescents. Anxiety elicited by the task was expected to predict greater and earlier rates of alcohol incidence, particularly among girls with higher levels of self-reported social anxiety symptoms. Participants were 104 community-recruited girls (ages 12-15 years) who completed a modified Trier Social Stress Test and questionnaires; follow-up calls were conducted at 3,6,9, and 12 months after the laboratory visit. Self-reported anxiety was assessed in response to the stressor following acclimation (baseline), instruction (anticipation), and speech (posttask). By 12 months. 30.8% of the sample had consumed a full alcoholic beverage. The DTSA revealed that girls with higher levels of social anxiety and greater elevations in anticipatory (but not posttask) anxiety compared to baseline had earlier alcohol initiation. This is the first study to examine the role of both laboratory-induced anxious responding and retrospective reports of social anxiety as prospective predictors of alcohol incidence. These preliminary findings suggest that adolescent girls who are more sensitive to social stress may be at risk for experimenting with alcohol earlier than their peers.

AB Past research has reported that college students use alcohol to manage their negative affective experiences. However, this finding is somewhat mixed in mood induction studies, and it is also unclear which students are most vulnerable to drinking for these reasons. The current study examined the roles of child/adolescent trauma exposure with emphasis on early sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties on college students' alcohol-related tension reduction expectancies during a mood induction paradigm. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimentally induced negative or neutral mood condition with questionnaire batteries completed pre-and postinduction. Primary results were based on participants reporting exposure to at least one traumatic event (n = 134). Findings indicated that participants in the negative compared to the neutral mood condition reported heightened tension reduction expectancies; this was particularly salient as exposure to child/adolescent sexual abuse increased. A trend (p = .08) suggested that tension reduction expectancies were higher for participants in the negative mood condition, as reports of sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties increased, and after accounting for posttraumatic stress symptoms. Tension reduction expectancies as a risk factor for problem drinking following trauma exposure are discussed, and further, indications that risk for problem drinking following sexual abuse is associated with difficulties managing typical, rather than extreme levels of negative affect are emphasized. Clinical implications include the potential modification of brief alcohol interventions.

AB Given the long-lasting detrimental effects of internalizing symptoms, there is great need for detecting early risk markers. One promising marker is freezing behavior. Whereas initial freezing reactions are essential for coping with threat, prolonged freezing has been associated with internalizing psychopathology. However, it remains unknown whether early life alterations in freezing reactions predict changes in internalizing symptoms during adolescent development. In a longitudinal study (N = 116), we tested prospectively whether observed freezing in infancy predicted the development of internalizing symptoms from childhood through late adolescence (until age 17). Both longer and absent infant freezing behavior during a standard challenge (robot-confrontation task) were associated with internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Specifically, absent infant freezing predicted a relative increase in internalizing symptoms consistently across development from relatively low symptom levels in childhood to relatively high levels in late adolescence. Longer infant freezing also predicted a relative increase in internalizing symptoms, but only up until early adolescence. This latter effect was moderated by peer stress and was followed by a later decrease in internalizing symptoms. The findings suggest that early deviations in defensive freezing responses signal risk for internalizing symptoms and may constitute important markers in future stress vulnerability and resilience studies.

AB Objectives This study aims to explore the relationship of mother's ways of coping with stress and family communication with the child internalizing and externalizing behaviors in Ukraine.
   Methods In a cross-sectional sample of 294 mother-and-child (9-16 years of age) Ukrainian dyads, mothers answered questions from the revised Ways of Coping Checklist, FACES Family Communication scale, Child Behavior Checklist, and questions about their sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results Robust regression results suggest increased internalizing behaviors were statistically associated with poor family communication (b=-.19, 95% CI [-.30, -.08], p<.01), maternal coping by accepting responsibility (b=2.14, 95% CI [.44, 3.84], p<0.05), escape-avoidance (b=3.79, 95% CI [1.00, 6.58], p<0.01), planful problem solving (b=2.80, 95% CI [.61, 4.99], p<0.05), child female gender (b=-2.53, 95% CI [-4.22, -.83], p<.01) and lower family income (b=-.003, 95% CI [-.006, -.0001], p<.01). Increased child externalizing behaviors were statistically associated with maternal seeking social support (b=3.25, 95% CI [1.06, 5.43], p<.01), decreased positive reappraisal (b=-1.52, 95% CI [-2.91, -.12], p<.05), maternal unemployment (b=-2.80, 95% CI [-5.30, -.30], p<.05), poor family communication (b=-.46, 95% CI [-.59, -.34], p<.001), and child male gender (b=3.48, 95% CI [1.53, 5.44], p<.01). Poor family communication was linked with significantly higher increase in internalizing behaviors for girls compared to boys (b=.17, 95% CI [.03, .32], p<.05).
   Conclusions When examining child internalizing and externalizing behaviors it is important to consider the role of family communication and maternal coping.

AB Objectives Adolescents face multiple changes in their social environment, which makes them more vulnerable to developing internalizing problems with strong interpersonal components, such as feelings of loneliness, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Given the widespread tacit assumption that these internalizing problems represent distinct concepts, research on these internalizing problems has evolved relatively independently. However, this assumption of distinctiveness has not often been empirically tested, especially not in adolescence. In order to check whether it is valid to examine loneliness, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms independently, the current study empirically tested whether these internalizing problems reflect a single latent construct or whether they are better represented by three distinct latent constructs.
   Methods Three large samples of Flemish adolescents were used (i.e., N=549, M-age=14.82 in Sample 1; N=1,116, M-age=13.79, in Sample 2, and N=1,423, M-age=13.58 in Sample 3) in which adolescents filled out well-established and validated self-report questionnaires tapping into the three types of internalizing problems. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in each sample separately. Adolescents filled out well-established and validated self-report questionnaires.
   Results The results contribute to the literature on the co-occurrence of loneliness, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms by showing that these internalizing problems can be best represented as interrelated, but distinguishable constructs.
   Conclusions Based on our findings, examining loneliness, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms in separate research lines seems justified. Statistical techniques examining co-development over time for these internalizing problems can be used with confidence in future research.

AB Caregivers' ability to identify infant cues plays a crucial role in child development, enabling attuned and responsive caregiving that serves as the basis for secure attachment. At the same time, exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) could alter mothers' interpretations of social stimuli and interfere with normative parent-child interactional processes. The current study examined four interrelated hypotheses. The first two hypotheses test whether IPV-exposed mothers show bias toward fear or anger in interpreting infants' facial expressions, and whether this bias is related to child symptoms. Our second set of hypotheses examines whether bias can be changed by Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) and whether this change mediates treatment gains. 113 IPV-exposed mothers of 2 to 6year old children completed the I FEEL picture task at baseline and again twelve months later. In the interim, 33 mothers were randomized into a treatment comparison group and the remainder received CPP. Analyses revealed that IPV-exposed mothers exhibit a perceptual bias toward fear, but not anger. Bias toward fear was linked to greater child internalizing symptoms while bias toward anger was linked to greater child externalizing symptoms. Participation in CPP resulted in decreased bias toward fearful faces. The treatment-related changes in mothers' perceptions of children's facial expression did not emerge as the mechanism by which CPP reduces children's symptoms. These results suggest that exposure to IPV alters mothers' ability to interpret infant facial expressions and that CPP is effective in reducing such biases.

AB Objective To assess the relation between early social behavioral tendencies and the risk of violent victimization in late adolescence.
   Study design We analyzed 5 waves of data from the Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood into Adulthood (z-proso), a longitudinal sample of Swiss first graders (N = 1138). Early social behavioral tendencies were measured at age 7 years and included internalizing problems, externalizing behavior, prosocial behavior, negative peer relations, competent problem solving, dominance, and sensation seeking. Path analyses were conducted of the association between these tendencies and violent victimization at age 17 years, and mediation through intermediate victimization at ages 11, 13, and 15 years was examined.
   Results Several childhood social behavioral tendencies predicted victimization 10 years later. Though this was the case for both sexes, the number and type of significant risk factors differed. For male children, sensation seeking, externalizing behavior, high prosociality, and negative peer relations at age 7 years increased later victimization, whereas for female children, dominance and externalizing behavior were predictive. In addition, results showed that the relation between early risk factors and age 17 years victimization was mediated by intermediate victimization, showing that differences in victimization risk in early adolescence are carried forward into late adolescence.
   Conclusions Childhood social behavioral tendencies predict victimization 10 years later. Incorporating this finding into early prevention programs could reduce victimization over the life course.

AB Background: Studies investigating the impact of having a child with hearing loss on the lives of parents and families have shown divergent results. Where some studies have reported that childhood hearing loss is associated with parental mental health problems, such as depression and stress, other studies report no impact on parental mental health and/or wellbeing.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between child-related variables-degree of hearing loss, additional disabilities, sign language abilities, cochlear implants (CI), externalizing and internalizing emotional and behavioral difficulties measured by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-and parent-related variables-parents living together, parents' mental health, spouse activities without children, and parents' experience of the child as being a burden for the family.
   Method: Data of 257 parents of children with hearing loss from a national survey were included.
   Results: Only 18% of the children with hearing loss did not live with both parents, a figure significantly lower than that of the general population. The child variables of degree of hearing loss, having a CI or not, and sign language ability were not significantly associated with any of the parent variables investigated. The child having a disability in addition to hearing loss was found to be significantly associated with the frequency of spouses engaging in activities without children and reports that the child was a burden for the family. Both higher externalizing and internalizing scores on the SDQ were significantly associated with parental mental health problems, frequency of spouse activities without children, and the degree to which the child's difficulties were experienced as a burden for the family.
   Conclusion: Children's hearing loss, per se, was found not to be significantly related to several key parent and family variables. However, children having additional disabilities and behavioral and emotional difficulties were significant with parent and family variables. This study thus underlines the need for further studies concerning relationships among factors related to childhood hearing loss and various family factors in order to better understand their impact on child development and family life.

AB This study investigated if and how children and teachers differ in their assessment of victim-aggressor relationships in kindergartens. Self-, peer, and teacher reports of victimization-aggression networks (who is victimized by whom) were investigated in 25 Swiss kindergartens with 402 5- to 7-years-old. It was examined whether child characteristics (sex and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior) influence informant reports of victimization and/or aggression. Findings from statistical network models indicated higher concordance between self and peer reports than between one of these and teacher reports. Results further showed more agreement among informants on aggressors than on victims. Aggressors reported by self and peer reports were low on internalizing behavior, and aggressors reported by self and teacher reports were high on externalizing behavior; teacher-reported victims were also high on externalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior was unrelated to victimization. According to self and peer reports, boys as well as girls were victimized by boys and girls equally; teachers reported less cross-sex victimization than same-sex victimization. The different views of teachers and children on victim-aggressor relationships have implications for the identification of aggression in early childhood. Mutual sharing of information between children, their parents, peers, and teachers may contribute to signaling victims and aggressors in the early school years.

AB This longitudinal study sought to investigate associations between adolescent substance use and family functioning and whether internalizing symptoms play a mediating role in this relationship; based on growing evidence from the literature, we also explored gender differences. Participants (N = 1,036) completed surveys in school during 2007, 2008, and 2009. Path analysis results indicated that boys' alcohol use negatively predicted family functioning while marijuana use results indicate both significant impacts on family functioning. Further results show that boys' depressive symptoms mediated the relationships between alcohol use and family cohesion and adaptability. For girls, depressive symptoms negatively predicted family functioning (cohesion, adaptability, communication with mother/father), whereas anxiety symptoms positively predicted this same set of family functioning outcomes with the exception of communication with father.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether maternal negative affectivity (MNA) moderates the effect of genetic polymorphism of SLC6A4 on behavior problems in children.
   Methods: Study participants comprised 143 preschoolers and their mothers from South Korea. The Childhood Behavior Checklist and Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability adult scale were used to measure child behavior and maternal affectivity. DNA from saliva was genotyped to determine serotonin transporter polymorphism.
   Results: MNA appeared to exert effects in externalizing (b = 5.78, p < 0.001) and internalizing problems (b = 6.09, p < 0.001). Interaction between SLCA4 polymorphism and MNA showed effects on externalizing (b = - 7.62, p < 0.01) and internalizing problems (b = - 9.77, p < 0.01). Children with two short alleles showed considerable differences in both externalizing and internalizing problems according to MNA; however, children with one short allele or none showed relatively few differences in behavior problems due to maternal affectivity.
   Conclusion: The effect of SLC6A4 polymorphism on child behavior seemed to be moderated by MNA. In addition, the impact of MNA was found to vary based on a child's genetic risk. High MNA may trigger the risk allele while low MNA causes the risk allele to illicit less behavior problems. Children with two short variants of the SLC6A4 gene may benefit from intervention that modulates MNA.

AB Childhood adversity is a potent risk factor for mental health conditions via disruptions to stress response systems. Dysregulations in oxidative stress systems have been associated with both childhood adversity and several psychological disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) in adult populations. However, few studies have examined associations between childhood adversity, oxidative stress, and mental health in pediatric populations. Childhood adversity (Adverse Childhood Events [ACE]), oxidative stress [F2(t)-isoprostanes (IsoPs)], and mental health pathology were assessed in 50 adolescent females recruited primarily through the Department of Youth Services. Standard ordinary least squares regression models were run co-varying for age, race/ethnicity, adolescent nicotine use, study condition, and parent history of ACEs. Adolescents who reported experiencing four or more ACEs had significantly elevated IsoP levels. Further, internalizing symptom scores across diagnoses were significantly associated with elevated IsoPs, whereas no externalizing symptoms scores, except Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, were related to altered oxidative stress. Results indicate that IsoPs may be a global marker of childhood adversity and mental health symptomatology, particularly within internalizing symptom domains. A limitation is that body mass index was not collected for this sample. Future studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings in larger, more diverse samples.

AB Youth with obesity are more likely than normal-weight peers to experience psychosocial problems. Empirically-based recommendations for addressing pediatric obesity include intensive interdisciplinary weight management comprising medical, behavioral health, nutrition, and exercise components. The present study examined changes in psychosocial functioning associated with frequency of participation in an interdisciplinary pediatric weight management program. Participants were 86 patients (55.8% females; median age = 11.5years; 67.4% Non-Hispanic Black; median BMI percentile = 99.5) enrolled in an interdisciplinary pediatric weight management program for at least one year. Psychosocial functioning was measured with the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17), a caregiver-completed mental health screen that assesses internalizing, externalizing, and attention difficulties as well as global functioning. The PSC-17 was completed at the initial clinic visit (baseline) and repeated one-year later (annual). The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test indicated that annual PSC-17 scores were significantly lower than baseline scores across all domains. Spearman correlation coefficients revealed no significant association between total number of clinic visits and PSC-17 global or subscale scores. However, the number of visits for exercise-only sessions was significantly correlated with caregiver-reported improvement in internalizing behaviors. Findings suggest that participation in interdisciplinary pediatric weight management may improve psychosocial functioning in youth with obesity and that attending supervised exercise sessions may be especially beneficial for improving internalizing behavior symptoms.

AB This study aimed to examine which specific emotion processes influence self-inflicted injury: basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia, baseline negative emotional intensity, emotional reactivity, or emotion regulation deficits. Self-injuring individuals with borderline personality disorder (N = 22) reported their lifetime self-injury frequency. Basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baseline skin conductance responses measurements were collected. Participants then either reacted as they usually would (i.e., emotional reactivity), or utilized mindfulness- or distraction-based strategies (i.e., emotion regulation), in response to negative images while self-reported negative emotion and skin conductance were monitored. Higher basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baseline emotional intensity predicted higher lifetime self-injury frequency. Chronic, resting emotion processes may be more important targets for reducing self-injury compared to labile, acute emotion processes.

AB Despite the well-established protective functions of positivity (i. e., a dispositional selfevaluative tendency to view oneself, life, and future under a positive outlook) from middle adolescence to old age, its reliable assessment and contribution to a proper psychological functioning have received little attention during previous developmental phases. In this article, we aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties and construct validity of the eight-item Positivity Scale (P Scale; Caprara et al., 2012) during late childhood and early adolescence in a sample of British students (N = 742; 48% boys) from both primary (M-age = 10.75, SD = 0.52) and secondary schools (M-age = 13.38 years, SD = 0.94). First, results from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) attested to the plausibility of the hypothesized 1-factor structure of the P Scale in a revised CFA model including the correlation between the residuals of two items similar in their wording. Next, we found evidence for strong (scalar) measurement invariance of the P Scale across late childhood and early adolescence as well as for its concurrent validity as indicated by expected relations of positivity to indicators of adjustment (i. e., prosocial behavior) and maladjustment (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problems). Overall, these findings support the concurrent and factorial validity of the P Scale as a short self-report instrument to measure children's tendency to view their experience from a positive stance. We discuss the implications of our results for improving the wording of the items composing P Scale as well as for understanding the dispositional mechanisms conducive to psychological health and wellbeing across late childhood and early adolescence.

AB Narrative coherence refers to the overall completeness of the narrative that helps the individual to draw meaning from past events. Research has predominantly focused on developmental trajectories of narrative coherence among typically developing individuals and less research sheds light on narrative coherence in adolescents facing serious psychological difficulties. This study is the first to apply Baerger and McAdams's well-validated coding scheme of narrative coherence to adolescents and to rate narrative coherence based on the content derived from the Child Attachment Interview in the context of attachment security, mentalization, and internalizing and externalizing pathology in 70 inpatient adolescents. Findings emphasized that the coding scheme is applicable for adolescents and attachment narratives. Narrative coherence was negatively correlated with age and no gender differences were found. Higher attachment security and better mentalization both contributed to more coherent narratives. More coherent narratives predicted less externalizing problems, but when controlling for mentalization and attachment security, mentalization was the strongest predictor. The relation between narrative coherence and other social-cognitive constructs is discussed, as well as how poor narrative coherence should be taken into account with respect to psychopathology in adolescence. Finally, the value of this coding scheme to evaluating narrative coherence in adolescence is discussed.

AB Objective: Executive function difficulties have been identified as a transdiagnostic mechanism for the development of psychological disorders; however little is known about the relations between executive function and internalizing and externalizing behavior patterns, especially in young children. To address this gap in the literature, the current study examined the reciprocal relations between internalizing and externalizing behaviors and two component processes of executive function, inhibition, and working memory. Method: Sixty-nine five- and six-year old children were included in the current study. Maladaptive behaviors were measured using the Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS). Inhibition was assessed using commission errors in the Preschool Continuous Performance Task (P-CPT), and working memory was measured using the Boxes task. Results: Results demonstrated a significant reciprocal relationship between externalizing behavior and inhibitory control (commission errors on the P-CPT), as well as between working memory and internalizing behaviors. Conclusion: The results have important implications for the development of early intervention programs. Suggestions for future research and limitations of the current work are discussed.

AB Background: Parenthood is a life transition that can be especially demanding for vulnerable individuals. Young maternal age and maternal single status have been reported to increase the risk for adverse outcomes for both mother and child. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of young maternal age and maternal single status on maternal and child mental health and child development at age 3.
   Methods: A birth-cohort of 1723 mothers and their children were followed from birth to age 3. Sixty-one mothers (3.5%) were age 20 or younger, and 65 (4.0%) reported single status at childbirth. The mothers filled out standardized instruments and medical information was retrieved from the standardized clinical assessment of the children at Child Welfare Centers, (CWC).
   Results: Young maternal age was associated with symptoms of postpartum depression whereas single status was not. Young mothers were more prone to report internalizing and externalizing problems in their children, while there was no association between single status and child behavioral problems. No differences were seen on child development (CWC scores). School drop-out was, however, a more influential factor on depressive symptoms postpartum than maternal age.
   Conclusion: Young mothers are at increased risk for symptoms of postpartum depression which indicates the need for attention in pre- and postnatal health care programs. Single mothers and their children were not found to be at increased risk for adverse outcomes. The importance of schooling was demonstrated, indicating the need for societal support to encourage adolescents to remain in school.

DT Article
ID BIRTH-ORDER; DEPRESSION; OVERWEIGHT; SIBLINGS; CHILDREN; ANXIETY; SIZE
AB Introduction
   Previous research has indicated that only children (i.e., those living with no siblings) have higher odds of obesity during childhood and young adulthood, compared with those living with siblings. However, little is known about whether the developing difference in overweight/obesity is accompanied by a difference in mental health (i.e., internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety).
   Methods
   The subjects for this prospective study were a randomly generated cohort of 1348 high-school students in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed assessments of anthropometric indices, lipid profiles, family-based factors, lifestyle, and internalization of symptoms (including those of depression and anxiety).
   Results
   Compared to their peers with siblings, only children (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.06, 2.65]) had significantly higher risk for obesity. However, only children with overweight/obesity had lower OR for depression at follow-up (aOR = 0.19, 95% CI [0.34, 0.86]), compared to individuals who were overweight/obese with siblings. This relationship was not significant for non-overweight individuals. No significant relationship between the number of siblings and anxiety at follow-up was observed, regardless of body mass index (BMI).
   Conclusions
   Although being an only child was significantly associated with overweight and obesity among adolescents in China, participants with history of overweight/obesity are less likely to experience symptoms of depression associated with being an only child.

AB Background: Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have co-occurring gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but the etiology is poorly understood. These GI symptoms often coincide with problem behaviors and internalizing symptoms, which reduces the quality of life for these individuals.
   Methods: This study examined the relationships among GI problems, problem behaviors, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 340 children and adolescents with ASD who are patients at the University of Missouri Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders.
   Results: The majority of patients experienced constipation (65%), about half experienced stomachaches or stomach pain (47.9%), and others experienced nausea (23.2%) or diarrhea (29.7%). Young children with aggressive problem behaviors were 11.2% more likely to have co-occurring nausea; whereas, older children showed more complex relationships between internalizing symptoms and GI symptoms. Older children with greater anxiety symptoms were 11% more likely to experience constipation, but 9% less likely to experience stomachaches. Older children with greater withdrawn behavior were 10.9% more likely to experience stomachaches, but 8.7% less likely to experience constipation. Older children with greater somatic complaints were 11.4% more likely to experience nausea and 11.5% more likely to experience stomachaches.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that the presentation of externalizing problem behavior and internalizing symptoms associated with GI problems differs between young children and older children with ASD. Therefore, behavior may have different relationships with GI symptoms at different ages, which may have implications for the treatment of and clinical approach to GI disturbances in ASD.

AB Few studies have examined the effects of parental incarceration (PI) on outcomes above and beyond other risk and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The objectives of this study were to (1) the associations between PI and mental health problems (attention, externalizing, internalizing, and total behavioral problems) and (2) the mediating role of current socioeconomic status and cumulative ACEs. An observational and cross-sectional design was employed. Analyses included hierarchical multivariable linear regression modeling. The analytic sample included 613 adolescents (11-17 years). On average, youth exposed to PI experienced three times as many ACEs compared with youth unexposed. Youth exposed to PI were more likely to have behavioral problems than their unexposed peers. The main effect for all models was attenuated by current economic hardship as well as exposure to increasing numbers of ACEs. Exposure to PI can be viewed as a marker of accumulative risk for intervention since youth impacted by PI are more likely to experience behavioral difficulties and associated adverse childhood experiences. Due to the associated adversity that impact youth exposed to PI, mental health providers need to be able to identify and screen for symptoms associated with trauma.

AB Background: In Hong Kong, with an increasing number of children experiencing mental health issues, there is a need to not only develop innovative interventions but also develop comprehensive prevention interventions so as to reduce their anxiety symptoms and enhance their emotional management and interpersonal relationships.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration model of the cognitive-behavioral approach and positive psychology by using digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention to magnify the social and emotional health and well-being of the school children in Hong Kong aged 9 to 11 years.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental design method was used to evaluate this digital game and school-based intervention. The Adventures of DoReMiFa was piloted in 4 primary schools where students were allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The participants were assessed at pre- and postintervention with a 6-month follow-up measuring their mental health knowledge, levels of anxiety symptoms, positive and negative thinking, perspective-taking, and self-esteem.
   Results: A total of 459 primary school students from 4 primary schools participated in the study. The response rate on the questionnaires answered on the Web was up to 85.1% (391/459). Compared with the control group, the intervention group was found to have significant association with improved mental health knowledge at the time immediately after the intervention (beta=.46; P=.01) and in the 6-month postintervention period (beta=.66; P<.001); for perspective-taking, the intervention group had exhibited a significant improvement 6 months after the completion of the universal program (beta=1.50; P=.03). The intervention, however, was found not to be effective in reducing the rates of anxiety symptoms and negative thinking among the participating students.
   Conclusions: The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration of a digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention, was shown to be effective in elevating the knowledge of mental health and promoting perspective-taking in the primary school students of Hong Kong. Although there was insufficient evidence to support a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and negative automatic thoughts, the overall results were still encouraging in that a preventive effect was found, indicating that the program has the potential to enhance the mental well-being of schoolchildren. It also suggests that knowledge enhancement may not necessarily lead to behavior change, and more focused effort may be needed to achieve the translation. The implications and limitations of this study and suggestions for future research were also discussed.

AB In adolescence, bullying victimization is typically represented in terms of a three-fold factor structure reflecting three components of verbal, physical, and social victimization. Recent studies have suggested the usefulness of alternativte models including both general and component-specific factors. In this study, we assessed the empirical and theoretical validity of an instrument assessing verbal, physical and social victimization using a set of alternative models of victimization: a unidimensional model, a three-factor model, and a bifactor model. Association between emerging factors and student variables were explored to establish theoretical fit of the models. Sample consisted of upper primary and lower secondary school students [N = 1311; 53% Male; Mean age (SD) = 10.73 (1.45)] and their teachers. The three factor and bifactor models showed good fit. In spite of acceptable fit, the unidimensional model showed lower empirical support when compared with the other models. The dimensions of the three-factor model showed similar associations with most student variables, while the bifactor showed more heterogeneous, and theoretically coherent associations. General victimization decreased with age and was positively related with externalizing and internalizing symptoms, student-teacher conflict and negative expectations. Verbal victimization showed increased prevalence among girls and older students. Physical victimization showed increased prevalence among boys and younger students, and positive associations with externalizing symptoms and student-teacher conflict. Social victimization was more frequent among girls, and positively related with internalizing symptoms and negative expectations toward teachers. These findings highlight the usefulness of modeling victimization using both general and form-specific dimensions for both assessment and theory-building purposes.

AB Presidential election campaigns provide opportunities for parents to socialize their children to become politically engaged citizens. However, news coverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign contained inappropriate content, leading parents to possibly restrict or denigrate rather than encourage child campaign news consumption. This study built on literatures in political socialization and parental mediation to explore mediation of campaign news coverage. Data from a representative sample of American parents during the Autumn of 2016 revealed that co-viewing, active mediation, and restrictive mediation were relatively common. The predictors of mediation included political variables, parenting orientations, and child factors, with the latter two often interacting with one another. The results have implications for how we conceptualize both political socialization and parental mediation.

AB The objective of this study was to assess resilience in parents of youth with chronic pain, as well as to examine the relationships between parental resilience and distress, and child pain. There is evidence that parents can play a critical role in how their children's pain problems develop, are experienced, and are maintained, yet no study to date has quantitatively evaluated parental resilience. Participants were 135 parent-child dyads referred to a tertiary-level chronic pain program. Parents completed measures of post-traumatic growth (PTG), post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Youth (M age = 13.1) completed measures assessing pain intensity and interference. The most PTG was observed at moderate level of PTSS, suggesting that some stress was necessary to foster resilience. Parental PTG was positively associated with parental internalizing symptoms and child pain outcomes, and moderated the relationship between parental depressive symptoms and child pain intensity. Resilience and distress may co-exist in the parents of youth with chronic pain, with resilience acting as a potential buffer between parent distress and child pain.

ID VICTIMIZATION; CHILDREN
AB Objective: This study compared bullying experiences, psychosocial adjustment, and resiliency in youth with and without ADHD. Method: Participants included 73 youth ages 12-17 with and without ADHD. Participants and their caregivers completed the Bullying and Ostracism Screening Scale, Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and Fitness and Flourish Scale. Results: There were no significant group differences in youth self-report for rates of bullying experiences or psychosocial adjustment. In contrast, caregivers reported significantly higher levels of victimization experiences (bullying and ostracism) and psychosocial maladjustment for youth with ADHD. Youth who reported increased victimization experiences also reported significantly more internalizing symptoms and lower levels of resilience, irrespective of ADHD diagnosis. Conclusion. The diagnosis of ADHD did not confer increased risk for bullying or ostracism according to youth self-report. In contrast, caregivers of youth with ADHD reported increased risk for victimization and higher rates of psychosocial maladjustment. Potential reasons for these inter-rater differences are discussed.

AB Research has shown that father involvement and children's perceived parental warmth contribute significantly to children's psychological adjustment. This study examines the mediating role of parental acceptance (i.e. that of mothers and fathers) between the father's involvement and the child's psychological adjustment in terms of personality dispositions and behavioral problems (internalizing and externalizing). The sample was composed of 1036 non-clinical children from 9 to 19 years old (45.1% males) who completed the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire, the Personality Assessment Questionnaire, the Youth Self-Report, and the Father Involvement Scale. The use of a structural equation model revealed that both father involvement and parental acceptance made significant and independent contributions to children's outcomes. However, relationships between father involvement and children's outcomes were mediated by both paternal acceptance and paternal acceptance via maternal acceptance. Father's residential status, and children's sex and age were considered as moderators. The father involvement in resident fathers had a stronger impact on perceived paternal acceptance, and father involvement on children's psychological adjustment was no longer significant for boys (not girls) when parental acceptance is considered as mediator. No age differences were found in the tested model. In conclusion, the findings show that the father's involvement creates an interpersonal context of love and warmth by which both the father and the mother increase the child's psychological adjustment.

AB Introduction: This study developed Brazilian psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) prototypes for children with internalizing disorders (ID) and externalizing disorders (ED).
   Method: Eighteen Brazilian experts in PDT (n = 9) and CBT (n = 9) rated the 100 items of the Child Psychotherapy Q-Set (CPQ) describing a hypothetical typical session based on their respective theoretical backgrounds for children with ID. They then rated the same items describing a hypothetical typical session for children with ED. A Q-type factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed.
   Results: Expert correlations were high within each theoretical approach and each diagnostic category. The factor analysis identified three independent factors. CBT ratings concentrated on one factor, while PDT ratings loaded onto one factor describing treatment of children with ID and another factor describing treatment of children with ED.
   Conclusion: The sole CBT prototype reflected a general conceptualization of this approach and was undifferentiated regarding treatment of children with ID and ED. The PDT prototype for children with ID provided evidence of a process focused on interpretation, while the PDT prototype for children with ED characterized a supportive process with attention to the therapeutic relationship. This infers greater variation in the PDT setting for children with different conditions.

AB Introduction: There are only a few instruments available to assess behavioral problems in school-age children based on reports of physical education teachers. The Motor Behavior Checklist (MBC) was designed to be completed by this professional in free play-situations or during physical education classes to rate students' motor-related behavior using 5-point Likert scales. The MBC comprises 59 items distributed into two broadband factors (externalizing and internalizing) and seven behavior problem scales: rule breaking, hyperactivity/impulsivity, lack of attention, low energy, stereotyped behaviors, lack of social interaction, and lack of self-regulation. The objective of this study was to describe the translation and cross-cultural adaptation processes of the MBC into Brazilian Portuguese.
   Method: The following procedures were conducted: forward translation of the original instrument, production of a synthesized version, back-translation, literal and semantic comparison, back-translator's evaluation of divergent items, synthesized version with back-translator's suggestions, clarity assessment of the synthesized version by professionals (physical education teachers), focus group to assess clarity indicators of the instrument, evaluation of adjustments by the author of the instrument, and production of the final version.
   Results: The results indicated a satisfactory level of agreement between the original and the back-translated versions, with 68% of exact equivalence between the translated items and 16% of terms requiring minor adjustments. In the draft version, 84% of the items were evaluated as clear by physical education teachers.
   Conclusion: The translated version has compatible content with the original version. Future studies should be conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the MBC.

AB BACKGROUND: Infant regulatory problems (RPs), i.e., problems with crying, feeding, and/or sleeping, are associated with behavioral and emotional problems in childhood. It is unclear, however, whether these behavioral and emotional problems persist into adulthood. The default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) support both interoceptive regulation and social and emotional abilities. We thus hypothesized that adults who had experienced RPs in infancy have more behavioral and emotional problems, which are mediated by DMN and/or SN alterations.
   METHODS: Within the scope of the Bavarian Longitudinal Study, adults (mean age 28 years; 50% female subjects) with (n = 79) and without (n = 254) a history of multiple and/or persistent infant RPs were assessed by the Young Adult Self Report to measure behavioral and emotional problems, and-in a subsample (n = 49 with and n = 71 without a history of infant RPs)-by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure DMN/SN integrity via intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC).
   RESULTS: Compared with adults with no history of infant RPs, adults who had experienced infant RPs had more total problems (p = .002), more internalizing problems (p = .005), and more avoidant personality traits (p < .001). They showed decreased iFC of the DMN and SN. DMN iFC decreases were strongest in adults with multiple and persistent RPs, and they were linked with avoidant personality traits (r = -.42, p = .006). Remarkably, DMN iFC decrements fully mediated the association between infant RPs and adult avoidant personality traits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adults who had experienced infant RPs have more avoidant personality traits that are mediated by the DMN. Persistent and/or multiple infant RPs and the DMN may be targets to attenuate behavioral and emotional problems.

AB Despite the importance of peer experiences during early childhood for socioemotional development, few studies have examined how young children process and respond to peer feedback. The current study used an ecologically valid experimental paradigm to study young children's processing of peer social acceptance or rejection. In this paradigm, 118 children (50% boys; M-age = 72.92 months; SD = 9.30; Range(age) = 53.19-98.86 months) sorted pictures of unknown, similar-aged peers into those with whom they wished or did not wish to play. They were later told how these peers sorted them, such that in half of the cases the presumed peer accepted or rejected the participant. When rejected children reported more distress (sadness), they were slower to rate their affective response, and exhibited increased mid-frontal EEG theta power, compared to when accepted. Moreover, we found that children's affective responses and EEG theta power for rejection predicted internalizing problems, especially if they displayed an attention bias to social threat. Our results further validate and illustrate the utility of this paradigm for studying how young children process and respond to peer feedback.

AB The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is poised to be the largest single-cohort long-term longitudinal study of neurodevelopment and child health in the United States. Baseline data on N = 4521 children aged 9-10 were released for public access on November 2, 2018. In this paper we performed principal component analyses of the neurocognitive assessments administered to the baseline sample. The neurocognitive battery included seven measures from the NIH Toolbox as well as five other tasks. We implemented a Bayesian Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (BPPCA) model that incorporated nesting of subjects within families and within data collection sites. We extracted varimax-rotated component scores from a three-component model and associated these scores with parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) internalizing, externalizing, and stress reactivity. We found evidence for three broad components that encompass general cognitive ability, executive function, and learning/memory. These were significantly associated with CBCL scores in a differential manner but with small effect sizes. These findings set the stage for longitudinal analysis of neurocognitive and psychopathological data from the ABCD cohort as they age into the period of maximal adolescent risk-taking.

AB Emotion regulation skills develop substantially across adolescence, a period characterized by emotional challenges and developing regulatory neural circuitry. Adolescence is also a risk period for the new onset of anxiety and depressive disorders, psychopathologies which have long been associated with disruptions in regulation of positive and negative emotions. This paper reviews the current understanding of the role of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescent anxiety and depression, describing findings from self-report, behavioral, peripheral psychophysiological, and neural measures. Self-report studies robustly identified associations between emotion dysregulation and adolescent anxiety and depression. Findings from behavioral and psychophysiological studies are mixed, with some suggestion of specific impairments in reappraisal in anxiety. Results from neuroimaging studies broadly implicate altered functioning of amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitries, although again, findings are mixed regarding specific patterns of altered neural functioning. Future work may benefit from focusing on designs that contrast effects of specific regulatory strategies, and isolate changes in emotional regulation from emotional reactivity. Approaches to improve treatments based on empirical evidence of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescents are also discussed. Future intervention studies might consider training and measurement of specific strategies in adolescents to better understand the role of emotion regulation as a treatment mechanism.

AB Mental health problems during adolescence constitute a major public health concern today for both families and stakeholders. Accordingly, different family-based interventions have emerged as an effective treatment for adolescents with certain disorders. Specifically, there is evidence of the effectiveness of concrete approaches of systemic family therapy on the symptoms of adolescents and family functioning in general. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of other relevant approaches, such as structural and strategic family therapy, incorporating parent-child or parental dyadic measurement. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a structural-strategic family therapy with adolescents involved in mental health services and their families. For this purpose, 41 parents and adolescents who participated in this treatment were interviewed at pre-test and post-test, providing information on adolescent behavior problems, parental sense of competence, parental practices, parenting alliance, and family functioning. Regardless of participants' gender, adolescents exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems after the treatment. Parents reported higher family cohesion, higher satisfaction and perceived efficacy as a parent, and healthier parental practices (less authoritarian and permissive practices, as well as more authoritative ones). An interaction effect between parenting alliance and gender was found, with more favorable results for the mothers. In conclusion, this paper provides evidence of the usefulness of structural-strategic family therapy for improving family, dyadic, and individual facets in families with adolescents exhibiting mental health problems.

   DISORDERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INFLUENZA; INFECTION; STRESS; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB Objective: Maternal infection during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of offspring psychopathology, including depression. As most infections do not cross the placenta, maternal immune responses to infection have been considered as potentially contributing to this relationship. This study examined whether gestational timing of maternal inflammation during pregnancy is associated with offspring internalizing and/or externalizing symptoms during childhood and, further, whether fetal sex moderated this relationship.
   Method: Participants were 737 pregnant women and their offspring who were continuously followed through late childhood. Archived first and second trimester sera were analyzed for markers of inflammation [interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-II (sTNF-RII)]. When offspring were aged 9-11, mothers completed a questionnaire assessing psychological symptoms.
   Results: Multivariate regression analyses indicated that elevated IL-8 in the first trimester was associated with significantly higher levels of externalizing symptoms in offspring. Higher IL-1ra in the second trimester was associated with higher offspring internalizing symptoms. Further, second trimester IL-1ra was associated with increased internalizing symptoms in females only.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that elevated maternal inflammation during pregnancy is associated with the emergence of separate psychological phenotypes and that timing of exposure and fetal sex matter for offspring outcomes. Given that internalizing and externalizing symptoms in childhood increase risk for a variety of mental disorders later in development, these findings potentially have major implications for early intervention and prevention work.

   Methods: This prospective, population-based, case-controlled study identified children with newly diagnosed early-onset epilepsy in South East Scotland using active multisource capture-recapture surveillance (May 2013 - June 2015). The CWEOE and controls completed an age-appropriate neurobehavioral assessment battery across seven domains: general cognitive ability (GCA), adaptive behavior, externalizing, internalizing, executive functioning, social functioning, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) risk.
   Results: Fifty-nine CWEOE were identified with an ascertainment of 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94, 103). Forty-six (78% [95% Cl 65.9, 86.6]) CWEOE (27 male, median age 25.5, range 1-59, months) and 37 controls (18 male, median age 31.5, range 3-59, months) consented for study entry. The CWEOE were similar to controls in gender, age, prematurity, and family history of psychopathology. but not socioeconomic status (Fisher's exact test [FET] < .001). Neurobehavioral assessments were carried out a median of 2.97 (Interquartile range [IQR] 1.51-4.95) months post epilepsy diagnosis.
   More CWEOE (63% [95% CI 48.6, 75.5]) had neurobehavioral problems compared with controls (27% [95% CI 15.4, 43.0]); p < 0.01. This observation was independent of socioeconomic status. Multidimensional problems were prevalent in CWEOE with 43% having two or more different domain-level problems; GCA impairment, adaptive behavior, internalizing, social functioning, and ASD risk were particularly marked. Risk factors varied by domain.
   Discussion: This novel study using comprehensive psychometric assessments found that neurobehavioral problems in CWEOE were detectable, common, and multidimensional. The degree of cooccurrence implies that problems are the norm, and multidimensional screening should be considered at epilepsy onset. The findings could aid policy development on health and educational provision in CWEOE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the field of psychopathology, there is high comorbidity between different disorders. Traditionally, support for two broad correlated dimensions of internalizing and externalizing symptoms has consistently emerged for children and adolescents. To date, oblique 2 and 3 first-order factor models (factors for externalizing and internalizing, and fear, distress, and externalizing) and bi-factor models with the corresponding two and three group factors have been suggested for common internalizing and eternalizing child and adolescent disorders. The present study used confirmatory factor analyses to examine the relative support for these models in adolescents (12 to 18years; N=866) and children (6 to <12years; N=1233) and the reliability and convergent and divergent validities of the psychopathology factor (P-factor) and group factors in the optimum bi-factor model. All participants were from a clinic and underwent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition clinical diagnosis. The findings showed that the bi-factor model with two group factors (internalizing and externalizing) was the optimum model for both children and adolescents. For both groups, findings showed relatively higher reliability for the P-factor than the group factors, although the externalizing group factor showed substantial reliability in adolescents, and both the externalizing and internalizing group factors also showed substantial reliability in children. The factors of the optimum bi-factor model also showed good convergent and discriminant validities. The implications for theory and clinical and research practice related to psychopathology are discussed.

AB IMPORTANCE Millions of adults now entering middle age were exposed to high levels of lead, a developmental neurotoxin, as children. Although childhood lead exposure has been linked to disrupted behavioral development, the long-term consequences for adult mental and behavioral health have not been fully characterized. OBJECTIVE To examine whether childhood lead exposure is associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study was based on a population-representative birth cohort of individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in Dunedin, New Zealand, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Members were followed up in December 2012 when they were 38 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 14, 2018, to October 24, 2018.
   EXPOSURES Childhood lead exposure ascertained as blood lead levels measured at 11 years of age. Blood lead levels were unrelated to family socioeconomic status.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were adult mental health disorder symptoms assessed through clinical interview at 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years of age and transformed through confirmatory factor analysis into continuous measures of general psychopathology and internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder symptoms (all standardized to a mean [SD] of 100 [15]) and adult personality assessed through informant report using the Big Five Personality Inventory (assessing neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) at 26, 32, and 38 years of age (all scores standardized to a mean [SD] of 0 [1]). Hypotheses were formulated after data collection; an analysis plan was posted in advance.
   RESULTS Of 1037 original study members, 579 (55.8%) were tested for lead exposure at 11 years of age (311 [ 53.7%] male). The mean (SD) blood lead level was 11.08 (4.96) mu g/dL. After adjusting for study covariates, each 5-mu g/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was associated with a 1.34-point increase (95% CI, 0.11-2.57; P = .03) in general psychopathology, driven by internalizing (b = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.19-2.62; P = .02) and thought disorder (b = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.06-2.54; P = .04) symptoms. Each 5-mu g/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was also associated with a 0.10-SD increase in neuroticism (95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P = .02), a 0.09-SD decrease in agreeableness (95% CI, -0.18 to -0.01; P = .03), and a 0.14-SD decrease in conscientiousness (95% CI, -0.25 to -0.03; P = .01). There were no statistically significant associations with informant-rated extraversion (b = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.004; P = .06) and openness to experience (b = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.03; P = .15).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this multidecade, longitudinal study of lead-exposed children, higher childhood blood lead level was associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits. Childhood lead exposure may have long-term consequences for adult mental health and personality.

AB Introduction: The dysregulation profile (DP) is a relevant clinical entity in the children and adolescent area since its association with future psychopathology. DP is defined by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), combining internalizing symptoms (anxiety/depression) and externalizing ones (aggressiveness, attention problems). Objectives: To study the frequency of CBCL-DP in a sample of Chilean preschoolers. Patients and Method: A sociodemographic survey and CBCL 1.5-5 was applied to caregivers of children aged 30 to 48 months in a national representative sample of public health system users. Frequency was estimated using the Kim et al. method and an explanatory model was made using binary logistic regression of DP using the child, caregiver, and contextual variables. Results: The sample size was n = 1,429 preschool children and their caregivers. The frequency of DP was 11.6% (95% 0 9.9-13.5%). The variables that allow to classify DP in 88.6% of cases were: current depressive symptoms in the main caregiver (OR: 2.24; 95% CI 1.37-3.67); number of stressful events experienced by the main caregiver (p = 0.005); number of available elements for child development stimulation in the home (p = 0.001); number of chronic diseases of the child (p = 0.006). Conclusions: DP has a high frequency in preschoolers, which implies a relevant mental health burden. This finding points to the need for interventions in this area and also longitudinal monitoring of this subgroup.

AB Study Objectives Several studies have reported psychiatric comorbidity in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NC1). The primary aim of this study was to explore the extent of psychiatric symptoms in a cohort of Norwegian NC1 patients, most of whom were H1N1-vaccinated. We also wanted to explore possible causes of the psychiatric symptoms seen in NC1.
   Methods Cross-sectional study. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) in children and by Adult Self Report (ASR) in adults.
   Results The mean (SD) total T-scores were 58.6 (9.2) for children and 57.0 (9.8) for adults, these being mainly driven by internalizing problems. Internalizing symptom T-scores showed that 37.5% of the children and 33.3% of the adults were in the clinical range of concern. T-scores were lower when the questionnaire's sleep-related items were excluded. However, 27.5% of children and 22.2% of adults still remained within the total psychiatric symptoms clinical range. Psychiatric symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness were not associated. However, in children fragmented sleep, measured by sleep-stage shift index was significantly negatively associated with all the psychiatric summary scores (all p 0.020), and awakening index was negatively associated with externalizing (p = 0.042) and total summary scores (p = 0.042). In adults, awakening index, but not sleep-stage shift index, was positively associated with internalizing score (p = 0.015). Hypocretin-1 levels showed no association with psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions We found a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in NC1 patients. Fragmented sleep was significantly associated with psychiatric symptoms.

AB Objectives: To determine if levels of neighbourhood poverty and neighbourhood antisocial behaviour modify associations between household poverty and child and youth mental health problems. Methods: Data come from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study-a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with 10,802 four- to 17-year-olds. Multivariate multilevel modelling was used to test if neighbourhood poverty and antisocial behaviour interact with household poverty to modify associations with children's externalizing and internalizing problems based on parent assessments of children (4- to 17-year-olds) and self-assessments of youth (12- to 17-year-olds). Results: Based on parent assessments, neighbourhood poverty, and antisocial behaviour modified associations between household poverty and children's mental health problems. Among children living in households below the poverty line, levels of mental health problems were 1) lower when living in neighbourhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and 2) higher when living in neighbourhoods with more antisocial behaviour. These associations were stronger for externalizing versus internalizing problems when conditional on antisocial behaviour and generalized only to youth-assessed externalizing problems. Conclusion: The lower levels of externalizing problems reported among children living in poor households in low-income neighbourhoods identify potential challenges with integrating poorer households into more affluent neighbourhoods. More important, children living in poor households located in neighbourhoods exhibiting more antisocial behaviour are at dramatically higher risk for mental health problems. Reducing levels of neighbourhood antisocial behaviour could have large mental health benefits, particularly among poor children.

AB Social interaction difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder can be challenging, especially during adolescence. In addition, high rates of comorbid internalizing disorders in autism spectrum disorder can lead to social isolation. With limited social activity participation, social deficits and internalizing problems in autism spectrum disorder may be related to participation, exposure, and practice with friends. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relations among friendship, activity participation, and internalizing problems. Participants included 129 children with autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 6 and 18 years. Measures of friendship, sport, hobby, and club participation, and internalizing problems were assessed. Results showed that activity participation was related to more friendships, even after controlling for intelligence quotient. This study sheds light on the impact of social engagement with peers in developing and maintaining friendships as well as managing internalizing problems.

AB Background: Research demonstrates strong associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPO), but pathways are not understood, hindering prevention and treatment responses.
   Methods: We assessed hypothesized mediators of the association between ACEs and NMPO in a nationally-representative U.S. sample. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data (N = 12,288) yielded an ordinal exposure comprising nine ACES (neglect; emotional, physical, sexual abuse; parental incarceration and binge drinking; witnessed, threatened with, experienced violence) and a binary lifetime NMPO outcome. Nine potential mediators measured in adolescence and/or adulthood included depression, anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, impulsivity, and risk-taking. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for sex-stratified associations of: ACES and mediators; mediators and NMPO; and ACES and NMPO adjusting for mediators individually and simultaneously.
   Results: All associations of ACES and mediators were statistically significant and similar by sex. All mediators had statistically significant associations with NMPO (except one depression measurement for each sex). Delinquency was strongly associated with ACEs and NMPO and was the strongest individual mediator. Every ACE increase was associated with increased NMPO odds of 32% for males and 27% for females. Adjusting for all mediators, odds of NMPO were attenuated partially for males [AOR = 1.18 (95% CI:1.07, 1.31)] and somewhat more for females [AOR = 1.11 (95% CI:1.00, 1.25)].
   Conclusions: Internalizing and externalizing factors partially explained the pathway from ACEs to NMPO. Substance abuse may be more difficult to treat with co-occurring psychopathologies and maladaptive behaviors, highlighting the need to address trauma early in life.

AB Introduction: This study examined the longitudinal associations between environmental adversity (defined in terms of exposure to violence in the neighborhood, school, and media), complex trauma (operationalized as experiences of abuse and neglect), and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Methods: Using a cross-lagged panel research design, we investigated the moderating role of peer support in these relationships in a sample of 644 adolescents from a severely disadvantaged district of Lima, Peru, who were followed up in a 1-year prospective study.
   Results and conclusions: We found significant unidirectional dynamic relations, where both types of adversity were associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Peer support significantly moderated this effect, but only for complex trauma, in that higher levels of peer support were associated with a decreased impact of complex trauma on internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of social relations and the quality of peer relations in particular as factors that may mitigate the risk of early exposure to trauma.

AB Introduction: There are potential long-term psychosocial effects of experiencing peer victimization during adolescence, including: internalizing symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and risks behaviors such as substance use. While social-emotional theories of development note associations between deficits in emotion competencies and peer victimization in childhood, these associations are less established among adolescent samples. Identifying which inadequacies in emotional competence place particular adolescents at risk for peer victimization may provide insight into the developmental pathways leading to unfavorable outcomes.
   Methods: The current study examined the relation between emotional competence and overt peer victimization among adolescents. Adolescents living in a mid-sized urban city in the southeastern region of the United States (N = 357; Mage = 12.14 years, 92% African American) reported their emotional awareness and reluctance to express emotion at baseline. Two years later, adolescents reported their regulation of anger and caregivers reported on adolescents' global emotion regulation. Adolescents also reported on occurrences of overt peer victimization during the previous 30 days at baseline and during the two-year follow up.
   Results: Our hypothesized model fit the data adequately. Greater emotion awareness was associated with higher scores on caregiver-rated emotion regulation and adolescent-rated anger regulation two years later, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Further, greater expressive reluctance was associated with greater anger regulation, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Patterns of associations did not vary by sex or age.
   Conclusions: The present study extends models of social-emotional development and peer interactions into the development age stage of adolescence.

AB Introduction The pervasive use of technology has raised concerns about its association with adolescent mental health, including internalizing symptoms. Existing studies have not always had consistent findings. Longitudinal research with diverse subgroups is needed.
   Methods: This study examines the relationship between screen-based sedentary (SBS) behaviors and internalizing symptoms among 370 Hispanic adolescents living in Miami, Florida- United States, who were followed for 2(1/2 )years and assessed at baseline, 6, 18 and 30 months post-baseline between the years 2010 and 2014. Approximately 48% were girls, and 44% were foreign-born, most of these youth being from Cuba. Mean age at baseline was 13.4 years, while at the last time-point it was 15.9 years.
   Results: Findings show that girls had higher internalizing symptoms and different patterns of screen use compared to boys, including higher phone, email, and text use. SBS behaviors and internalizing symptoms cooccurred at each time-point, and their trajectories were significantly related (r = 0.45, p < .001). Cross-lagged panel analyses found that SBS behaviors were not associated with subsequent internalizing symptoms. Among girls, however, internalizing symptoms were associated with subsequent SBS behaviors during later adolescence, with internalizing symptoms at the 18-month assessment (almost 15 years old) associated with subsequent SBS behaviors at the 30-month assessment (almost 16 years old; beta = 0.20, p < .01).
   Conclusions: Continued research and monitoring of internalizing symptoms and screen use among adolescents is important, especially among girls. This includes assessments that capture quantity, context, and content of screen time.

AB Many youth with ADHD experience peer difficulties, but the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. Very little work has examined neurophysiological measures of social feedback processing in relation to ADHD symptoms. The goal of this study was to examine associations of ADHD symptoms with indicators of sensitivity to social feedback in a laboratory task and self-report of rejection sensitivity. A large community sample of 10- to 15-year-old adolescents (N = 391; M-age = 12.64, 48.6% girls) participated in the study. Mothers rated youth ADHD symptoms. Youth completed the Island Getaway task, which elicits neurophysiological (i.e., event-related potentials [ERP]) measures of sensitivity to peer rejection and acceptance feedback, and also completed self-ratings of rejection sensitivity. Greater ADHD symptoms were associated with an enhanced N1 ERP component, which correlated with higher levels of self-reported rejection sensitivity. In addition, greater ADHD symptoms were associated with reduced reactivity to social acceptance, as measured by the later reward positivity ERP component. Youth with elevated ADHD symptoms exhibited enhanced sensitivity to peer rejection at the neurophysiological and self-report level, as well as reduced neurophysiological reactivity to peer acceptance. Future work including neural measures of social functioning may serve to elucidate mechanisms underlying the social dysfunction characteristic of ADHD.

AB This study examines the moderating effect of both branches of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic) on associations between peer exclusion and internalizing behaviors. Young adolescents (N = 68) self-reported their perceptions of peer exclusion and internalizing problems and participated in stress-inducing public speaking tasks. Skin conductance and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were assessed at baseline (skin conductance baseline, SCLB; respiratory sinus arrhythmia baseline, RSAB) and during the challenge task to provide measures of physiological reactivity (skin conductance reactivity, SCLR; respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity, delta RSA). Youth with high delta RSA (low vagal suppression) had higher levels of internalizing problems when they perceived more peer exclusion in their social environments. The combination of low SCLR and high delta RSA (reciprocal parasympathetic) predicted higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas the combination of high SCLR and high delta RSA (coactivation) predicted lower levels of internalizing problems. The association between peer exclusion and youth internalizing problems was not moderated by ANS reactivity profiles which reflected combinations of SCLR and delta RSA.

AB Childhood abuse is a potent risk factor for psychopathology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research has shown high resting vagal tone, a measure of parasympathetic nervous system function, protects abused youth from developing internalizing psychopathology, but potential mechanisms explaining this effect are unknown. We explored fear extinction learning as a possible mechanism underlying the protective effect of vagal tone on PTSD symptoms among abused youth. We measured resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses (SCR) during a fear conditioning and extinction task in youth with variability in abuse exposure (N = 94; aged 6-18 years). High RSA predicted lower PTSD symptoms and enhanced extinction learning among abused youths. In a moderated-mediation model, extinction learning mediated the association of abuse with PTSD symptoms only among youth with high RSA. These findings highlight extinction learning as a possible mechanism linking high vagal tone to decreased risk for PTSD symptoms among abused youth.

AB Previous research has linked parental corporal punishment and children's problem behaviors, whereas little is known about the effects of fathers' corporal punishment. Moreover, stress-buffering model suggested that parenting practices that are characterized by acceptance, supportive and responsiveness such as inductive reasoning may buffer children against the negative impacts of stressful life events including parental corporal punishment. As such, the current research examined the potential moderating effects of fathers' and mothers' inductive reasoning on the associations between their corporal punishment and children's problem behaviors, and further explored whether the moderating effects of inductive reasoning would be more stronger in same gender dyads (i.e., mother & daughter, father & son) than in mixed gender dyads (i.e., mother & son, father & daughter) within Chinese families. The Chinese version of Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC), the parental inductive reasoning items from the Iowa Youth and Families Project, the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used as the main assessment tools. Utilizing a sample of 675 elementary school-age children and their parents, similar patterns of findings between same gender dyads and mixed gender dyads emerged. Both mothers' and fathers' corporal punishment were directly associated with children's problem behaviors, whereas their inductive reasoning failed to moderate these associations. Findings from the current study suggested that it may be difficult for positive parenting (e.g., inductive reasoning) to counteract the adverse effects that parental harsh discipline (e.g., corporal punishment) has on children adjustment, and it may be more meaningful for intervention programs to focus on decreasing both fathers' and mothers' harsh discipline.

AB Previous studies suggested adolescents' bullying experiences to be related to risk behaviors, internalizing problems and less perceived social support. Swearer and Hymel (2015) proposed a diathesis-stress model regarding bullying experiences. We expected the diathesis variable adolescent's sex, and the stressors bullying perpetrator or victimization experiences to be related concurrently to risk behaviors, internalizing problems, talking to friends, and perceived peer support. In a cross-cultural trend study, we aimed to test these diathesis-stress relationships across three countries at three measurement times (T1-T3, World-Health-Organization data) to get new insights for future intervention approaches. The samples consisted of n = 3458 adolescents from the United States, Germany, and Greece at T1, n = 3441 adolescents at T2, and n = 4021 adolescents (about 16 years of age) at T3. We conducted latent multi-group structural equation modeling including sex, bullying experiences as perpetrator or victim, risk behaviors, internalizing problems, talking to friends, perceived peer support, and further relevant variables (e.g., school pressure). The results support in part the diathesis-stress model. Girls and boys self-reported similar frequent risk behaviors (smoking, drinking alcohol). Sex related to internalizing problems which were higher in girls than in boys. Bullying perpetration experiences or bullying victimization experiences positively related to internalizing problems across culture and time but not or even negatively with talking to friends and perceived peer support. Talking to friends is difficult for both bullying perpetrators and bullying victims. Easy communication (e.g., talking to friends) should be a central approach in further bullying prevention and intervention programs.

AB Objective: The adult INTERMED is used to determine case complexity and psychosocial needs. We developed and validated a pediatric version of the INTERMED for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assessed its utility in predicting healthcare utilization.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of children (aged 8-17 y) with IBD (n = 148) and their parents, seen in a hospital-based clinic. Subjects completed semi-structured interviews that were scored on the 34 pIBD-INTERMED items. To assess inter-rater reliability, 40 interviews were videotaped and scored by a second assessor. Convergent and predictive validity were assessed by examining the relation of the pIBD-INTERMED to standardized measures of psychological, social, and family functioning, disease activity, and healthcare utilization.
   Results: Correlational analyses supported the validity of all five pIBD-INTERMED domains with very good inter rater reliability (median r = 0.87) and internal consistency (a = 0.91) for the total complexity index. Ratings of 2-3 on the pIBD-INTERMED "mental health/cognitive threat" item were associated with greater odds of behavior and social problems (CBCL-Internalizing scale OR = 7.27, 95% CI 2.17-24.36); CBCL-Externalizing scale OR = 24.79, 95% CI 5.00-122.84), depression (Children's Depression Inventory OR = 8.52, 95% CI 1.70-43.02) and anxiety (Multidimensional Anxiety for Children OR = 11.57, 95% CI 3.00-45.37). The pIBD-INTERMED complexity index added significantly to the prediction of healthcare utilization, beyond the contribution of disease severity.
   Conclusions: The pIBD-INTERMED is a reliable and valid tool for identifying psychosocial risks and needs of children with IBD. It can be used to guide planning of individualized care and enhance interdisciplinary pediatric IBD care.

AB The parent-child relationship, a key dyad of the family. can influence disease-related and psychological processes in children with asthma. Although the critical role of parenting behaviors in asthma outcomes is well established, less is known about the attitudes and beliefs underlying parents' interactions with their children and how those attitudes may relate to asthma outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to identify profiles of parents' schemas pertaining to their children with asthma and examine whether child mental and physical health outcomes differed by profile membership. Caregivers of children (n = 177; 5-12 years old) with asthma completed the Five Minute Speech Sample (Magaila et al., 1986), which was later coded for positive and negative attitudes and attributions about their children. Using a pattern-based approach, cluster analyses revealed three profiles of schemas: high negativity-low positivity, low negativity-low positivity, and low negativity-high positivity. Profiles differed in levels of externalizing and internalizing child symptoms, and lung function. Results support the growing body of research placing emphasis on the role of parenting in pediatric asthma outcomes. Caregiver schemas may constitute a point of intervention in families of children with asthma.

AB PurposeTo evaluate the associations between the presence of a grand parent at home that is three-generation household, with children mental health in diverse countries whether this situation is frequent or not.MethodsData from the School Children Mental Health in Europe cross-sectional survey in six countries (n=4582) were used to examine the association between three-generation households and child mental health across Europe. The parent and teacher Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was combined to assess child mental clinical problems.ResultsOverall, 25.13% of European families live with at least one grandparent: 5.46% in Western and 29.70% in Eastern Europe. Controlling for key sociodemographic variables and for country of residence, the presence of a grandparent is associated with an increased risk for child mental health problems in the total sample (OR 1.37, p=0.002). In two-parent homes, the effect of the presence of a grandparent is significant (OR 1.40, p=0.026), while it is not in single-parent homes. In each country, the presence of a grandparent is a risk for either externalizing or internalizing problems.ConclusionsPrograms may be developed to educate elderly people to better respect their children's role as parents so having a grandparent in the home can become an asset for family members rather than a burden.

AB The acquisition of social competence, such as showing prosocial behaviour (fulfilling others' needs) and social initiative (fulfilling own needs), constitutes one major developmental task in childhood and adolescence. Previous research suggests that in middle childhood, impaired social competences are related to childhood psychopathology, such as externalizing and internalizing disorders. As the period of preschool age is a particularly important time for both the development of social competence and early psychopathological symptoms, we conducted a systematic review to investigate the role of social competence in relation to early childhood psychopathology. Twenty-one clinical as well as subclinical studies published prior to September 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis of the relation between prosocial behaviour, social initiative, and early externalizing and internalizing symptoms in preschool age children (age 3-6). Effect sizes for each study were calculated if required information was available. Our review suggests that from early on in childhood development, externalizing symptoms are accompanied by prosocial behaviour deficits such as lower levels of helping or cooperating, whereas internalizing symptoms may be accompanied by either deficient or excessive levels of prosocial behaviour. Exhibiting social initiative such as initiating contact with others or communicating one's own needs seems to be impaired in children with internalizing symptoms. Implications for current theory and future research are discussed.

AB Diagnostic guidelines differ between DSM attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and ICD hyperkinetic disorder (HKD). Only 145 of 579 children age 7-9 in the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (the MTA) with combined-type DSM-IV ADHD met criteria for ICD-10 HKD, because major internalizing comorbidities and more stringent symptom count/pervasiveness requirements excluded most. The 145 HKD had significantly better 14-month medication response than the rest. We explored whether HKD had greater adult symptom persistence and/or impairment than other ADHD. Multi-informant assessments were done for 16 years. We used the 12/14/16-year assessments, in young adulthood. The post-attrition 109 with baseline HKD had no greater adult persistence of ADHD symptoms/impairment than 367 without HKD, but had more cumulative stimulant use, more job losses, lower emotional lability, and fewer car crashes. However, those excluded for internalizing comorbidity but otherwise meeting HKD criteria had significantly more persistence. Only 6 of the 109 (5.5%) with baseline HKD met ICD-10 criteria for HKD in adulthood, compared to 25 of 367 (6.8%) without a childhood HKD diagnosis. Despite greater initial symptom severity, HKD had no worse 16-year young adult outcome than others, except for job losses, balanced by less emotional lability and fewer crashes. Comorbid internalizing disorder seems to have worse prognosis than initial severity/pervasiveness of ADHD symptoms.

AB Experiences of depression, anxiety, and peer victimization have each been found to predict one another, and to predict negative outcomes in the domains of school connectedness, social functioning, quality of life, and physical health. However, the common co-occurrence of depression, anxiety, and peer victimization experiences has made it difficult to disentangle their unique roles in these associations. The present study thus sought to characterize the precise nature of the bidirectional relationships between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and victimization over time, and to examine their unique sequelae during the transition from childhood to early adolescence. Longitudinal multi-informant (child-reported, parent-reported, and teacher-reported) data from a nationally representative sample were analyzed using path analysis when the study child was aged 10-11 (n=4169; M-age=10.3; 48.8% female) and aged 12-13 (n=3956; M-age=12.4; 48.2% female). Depressive symptoms, anxiety, and peer victimization had small but significant unique bidirectional relationships. All three constructs also uniquely and prospectively predicted poorer life functioning across all domains examined. These results demonstrate that current interventions should broaden their scope to simultaneously target depression, anxiety, and peer victimization, as each of these experiences independently act as additive risk factors for subsequent negative outcomes.

AB The task of identity development, which involves distinguishing who one is, and defining and articulating this to others, is a challenging developmental task for most youth. This is made even more challenging when one considers that there are multiple domains of identity development. In the current study, Australia adolescents (N=336; aged 12-15 years, 46% male) reported their identity status commitment, exploration and reconsideration across two different domains (education and friendship). Cluster analysis was used to evaluate patterns of identity formation within and across domains, and the internalizing symptoms (low self-worth, emotion dysregulation, depressive and anxiety symptoms) and identity disturbance of clusters of youth with different identity status patterns were compared. Results revealed five clusters of committed explorers, committed non-explorers, committed reconsiders, uninvolved, and friend identifiers. Cluster comparisons revealed that, across self-worth, emotion dysregulation and identity disturbance, adolescents in the friend identifiers cluster, who reported high commitment to friendship identity and lower commitment to educational identity relative to their peers, fared worse than adolescents reporting higher than average commitment across both domains, and those reporting high reconsideration in both domains. These findings suggest that the benefit of identity commitment for emotional adjustment may depend somewhat on the domain under investigation, and that evaluating the junction and divergence of different identity domains might identify additional adolescents who are experiencing symptoms of maladjustment.

AB Girls are more likely to engage in rumination, associated with the development of mental health problems, as well as report higher levels of friendship quality, hypothesized to protect against these disorders. The current study examined whether co-rumination may drive simultaneous increases in rumination and changes in friendship quality among adolescents. The project included 360 participants (43% boys), ages 9.8 to 15.8 years, and analyses revealed that co-rumination mediated the link between female sex and both rumination and negative friendship quality. There was also a bidirectional relation between co-rumination and positive friendship quality. These findings highlight several pathways by which co-rumination mediates the relation between sex and both maladaptive (i.e. rumination, negative friendship quality) and adaptive (i.e. positive friendship quality) outcomes.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is particularly prevalent during adolescence and emerging adulthood. The salience of shame during these developmental periods suggests that shame may be inherently linked to NSSI, and at least partially explain the high rates of NSSI observed among youth. In this article, a theoretical developmental model relating shame and NSSI is proposed, and results from a preliminary test of a sub-set of cross-sectional relationships in this model is presented. In the model tested, it was hypothesized that adverse caregiving experiences in prior development (i.e., childhood to late adolescence) like parental invalidation and child maltreatment, established predictors of NSSI, would be linked to proximal episodes of NSSI (i.e., past year) through current shame-proneness (i.e., experiencing shame in a trait-like manner) and internalizing shame-coping (i.e., responding to shame through attacking one's self and withdrawing). It was also hypothesized that some key proximal predictors of NSSI during youth development, such as low body esteem, increased loneliness and heightened psychological distress, would be linked to proximal NSSI via shame-proneness and internalizing shame-coping. Using structural equation modelling, it was observed that data, obtained via self-reports completed by 573 emerging adults (age in years: M=20.7, SD=2.20, 69.1% female, NSSI history: n=220, where most recent NSSI episode was within a year of study participation) recruited throughout Australia between June 2013 and June 2014, fit the hypothesized model well. Tests of indirect effects indicated that current shame-proneness and internalizing shame-coping significantly linked perceived parental invalidation and prior experiences of child maltreatment to proximal NSSI, though this relationship was, unexpectedly, an inverse one in relation to child maltreatment. Current shame-proneness was also linked to proximal NSSI via internalizing shame-coping, current loneliness, and current psychological distress, but not through current body esteem. Finally, proximal self-evaluations of body esteem, loneliness and increased psychological distress were linked to recent NSSI through internalizing shame-coping. The theory and findings presented in this article contribute to a deeper developmental understanding of NSSI among youth, highlight crucial pathways between adverse caregiving experiences and NSSI, and illuminate important shame-based mechanisms that potentially warrant clinical attention for at-risk individuals. Future research directions and clinical recommendations are discussed.

AB Few studies have investigated nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) as a predictor of outcomes other than suicidal self-injury, severely limiting our understanding of this behavior's full range of consequences. Three independent studies were used to examine the prospective association between NSSI and two outcomes: depressive symptoms and self-criticism. Data were collected from samples of (1) adults with past-month NSSI, (2) adults with lifetime NSSI, and (3) adults with past-year NSSI. Studies included 1- and 6-month follow-up periods. Results were tested in an internal meta-analysis. Results suggested that NSSI did not prospectively predict changes in self-criticism. No changes in depressive symptoms were seen over shorter follow-up periods; however, NSSI predicted increases in depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up in one sample. The internal meta-analysis indicated a null relationship between NSSI and prospective internalizing symptoms. Future research should replicate these findings and examine a broader range of outcomes of NSSI to better understand its complex relationship to psychopathology.

AB Objectives: Experiences of ethnic-racial discrimination are associated with a host of problems in adolescence and adulthood, yet little is known about if and how such experiences influence children. Likewise, ethnic-racial identity (ERI) research has focused on adolescent and adult development to the detriment of understanding if and how ERI might influence early development, particularly in the context of ethnic-racial discrimination. To address these gaps, this study tested the hypotheses that a) children's perceived experiences of ethnic-racial discrimination would predict elevated behavior problems, and b) children's ERI with respect to their exploration of the meaning of their ethnicity-race and their sense of commitment to their ethnic-racial group(s) would mitigate this relation. Method: Path analyses evaluated the prospective contribution of children's perceived ethnic-racial discrimination at age 7 (N = 172) to examiner ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems one year later as moderated by child-reported ERI. Results: Perceived experiences of ethnic-racial discrimination predicted increased internalizing and externalizing behavior problems one year later, but only among children who had relatively less-well developed ERI, particularly with regard to their sense of commitment to their ethnic-racial group(s). Conclusion: These findings document the incidence and the prospective negative impact of children's experiences of ethnic-racial discrimination on their behavioral adjustment, while illuminating the heretofore underappreciated protective role of ERI on children's development in contexts of discrimination. By cultivating ERI among children, parents, educators, and other community leaders can help children navigate institutionalized racism, and the prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory practices it engenders.

AB Objectives: We examined the prospective association (from M-age = 15.84 to 17.38 years) between bicultural competence and mental health among U.S. Mexican-origin adolescents relative to multiple (a) developmental niches, (b) components of bicultural competence, and (c) indicators of mental health. Method: Participants included 749 adolescents (49% female, 29.7% Mexico-born) recruited during late childhood and followed through late adolescence. We used latent profile analyses to identify adolescents' developmental niches based on sociocultural characteristics of the family, school, and neighborhood contexts and multiple-group structural equation modeling to examine whether these niches moderated the association between bicultural competence and mental health. Results: We identified 5 distinct adolescents' developmental niches. We found no association between bicultural competence and internalizing symptoms across niches; bicultural facility predicted lower externalizing symptoms among adolescents developing in niches characterized by immigrant families and predominantly Latino schools and neighborhoods. Conclusions: The diversity found among U.S. Mexican-origin adolescents' niches underscores the need to assess context broadly by including a range of settings. Studying multiple components of bicultural competence across numerous cultural domains may provide a better understanding of any mental health benefits of biculturalism.

AB Objectives: We examined interactions between adolescents' sleep duration and quality as predictors of their internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors. As a secondary aim, we assessed adolescent sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) as additional moderators of risk (ie, 3-way interactions among sleep duration; quality; and sex, race, or SES).
   Design: The study used a cross-sectional design.
   Setting: Participants were from small towns and semirural communities in Alabama.
   Participants: The sample consisted of 235 adolescents (M-age=15.78 years, SD=9.60 months) andwas diverse with respect to sex (54% female), race/ethnicity (32% Black/African American, 67% White), and SES.
   Measurements: Sleep duration (actual sleep minutes) was examined with actigraphs for 1 week. Adolescents reported on their subjective sleep quality, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behavior with psychometrically sound measures.
   Results: Findings revealed interactions between sleep duration and sleep quality as predictors of adolescents' adjustment. Adolescents with both short sleep duration in conjunction with poor sleep quality had the highest levels of internalizing symptoms and aggressive and rule-breaking behavior. SES interacted with sleep duration and sleep quality to predict rule-breaking behavior, and the highest level of problems was observed for adolescents from lower-SES homes who had short sleep duration accompanied by poor sleep quality.
   Conclusions: Findings identify the conjoint role of sleep duration and quality as predictors of adolescents' socioemotional adjustment and emphasize the importance of examining multiple sleep parameters simultaneously toward a better understanding of adaptation in adolescence.

TI Residential Greenspace Association with Childhood Behavioral Outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective To assess the relationship between greenspace exposure and childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Study design We analyzed data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, an ongoing prospective birth cohort. Greenspace exposure was estimated based on children's addresses using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Neurobehavioral outcomes were assessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. Regression models adjusted for neighborhood deprivation, maternal education, race, and sex assessed the risk for problematic internalizing and externalizing behaviors at residential greenspace buffers of 200, 400, and 800 m.
   Results There were 562 and 313 children in our age 7- and 12-year analyses, respectively. At age 7 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with decreased conduct scores (beta = -1.10, 95% CI [-2.14, -0.06], 200 m). At age 12 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with a decrease in anxiety scores (beta = -1.83, 95% CI [-3.44, -0.22], 800 m), decreased depression scores (beta = -1.36, 95% CI [-2.61, -0.12], 200 m), and decreased somatization scores (beta = -1.83, 95% CI [-3.22, -0.44], 200 m).
   Conclusions This study provides evidence that increased exposure to residential greenspace is associated with reduced youth's problematic internal and external behaviors, measured by Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, at ages 7 and 12 years. Improved understanding of this mechanism could allow for implementation of neighborhood-level approaches for reducing the risk for childhood behavioral problems.

AB Objective: To examine the reciprocal relationships between parenting stress and psychosocial adjustment of children with congenital craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) at 2 time points: school entry and approximately 2.5 years later, after children had time to adjust to school.
   Design: Retrospective review of medical charts of children with CFAs.
   Setting: Department of reconstructive plastic surgery at an urban medical center.
   Participants: Parents of 42 children aged 3.9 to 6.5 years at time I and 6.5 and 9.8 years at time 2.
   Main Outcome Measures: Parenting Stress Index/Short Form and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), both completed by parents at time 1 and time 2.
   Results: Compared to norms, more parents scored in the clinical range on parenting stress both at time 1 and time 2. Parenting stress remained stable across the 2 time points. Although rates of psychosocial problems for boys were comparable to those of the CBCL normative sample, higher-than-expected rates of clinically significant internalizing and externalizing were found for girls at time 2. Parenting stress at time 1 was associated with child internalizing and externalizing problems at time 2. Whereas child externalizing problems at time I predicted parenting stress at time 2, child internalizing at time 1 showed trivial effects on time 2 parenting stress.
   Conclusions: Early school years may be a period that is particularly stressful for parents of children with CFAs. There appears to be a transactional relationship between parenting stress and child psychosocial adjustment during the early school years.

AB Although the neural correlates of social exclusion have been well-documented, most studies have examined single age groups. No studies have directly compared specific age-related differences in social exclusion across children, adolescents, and adults using event-related oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics. The authors examined event-related theta EEG power and phase coherence in fair play and social exclusion conditions during the Cyberball task in 166 participants: 42 children (ages 10-12), 56 adolescents (ages 14-17), and 68 adults (ages 18-28). Children and adolescents displayed the greatest theta power to rejection events, whereas adults displayed the greatest theta power to " not my turn" events. Moreover, the functional link between theta power to rejection and self-reported distress was strongest among the adolescents. These findings suggest that an enhanced neural response to social exclusion is present by preadolescence, but the association between neural and subjective responses is most prominent during adolescence.

AB Research on personality in adolescence underlined the importance of adopting a dimensional approach to personality pathology rather than a categorical one. In this regard, the association between maladaptive versions of personality traits and pathological outcomes has been studied, neglecting the study of the severity of personality functioning. The aim of the current study is to investigate the interactions between maladaptive personality traits as conceptualized in DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders and personality functioning in a large sample of non-clinical adolescents. Maladaptive personality traits, severity of personality functioning and psychological distress were evaluated in 562 adolescents (62.5% females, M = 16.24, SD = 1.69) recruited from middle and secondary schools in Northern Italy. Results showed that internalizing maladaptive personality traits and psychoticism were associated with psychological distress, whilst externalizing traits were not. Moreover, dimensions of personality functioning (self and interpersonal related) moderated the strength of these associations. These findings suggest the importance of taking into account the level of personality functioning in order to deeper understand the association between maladaptive personality traits and psychological distress. In particular, our results indicate that internalizing features might be highly influenced by personality dimensions in adolescence.

AB ObjectivesCross-informant agreement between parent-youth dyads has been the focus of extensive research, but youth from diverse cultures have received less attention. Cross-information agreement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous parent-youth dyads were compared.MethodA total of 152 parent-youth dyads, consisting of 29.6% Indigenous and 70.4% non-Indigenous, were contrasted on level of agreement using the Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report forms of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment.ResultsThe overall level of agreement for the full sample (r=.41) was comparable to the extent literature. As predicted, externalizing difficulties were rated with significantly higher levels of agreement than internalizing difficulties (externalizing r=.51; internalizing r=.32). While age did not significantly moderate the levels of agreement, gender did show an effect with female youth reporting higher levels of problems than males. The most notable finding was the cultural effect on levels of agreement. The rate of cross-informant agreement for the Indigenous parent-youth dyads was significantly higher than the low to moderate agreement found for non-Indigenous pairs. Moreover, the level of cross-informant agreement between the externalizing and internalizing problem scales was similar for the Indigenous dyads (r=.59; r=.62, respectively), but was significantly different for the non-Indigenous dyads (r=.50; r=.19, respectively).ConclusionsThis study highlights possible cultural differences in cross-informant agreement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth and their parents

AB ObjectivesThis study had two major aims: (1) to explore the relationship between sleep related difficulties and behavioral and emotional problems in young children, and (2) to identify predictors of child fear and problematic sleep behaviors.MethodsSixty-eight children (34 boys), ages 4-6 years (M=4.9, SD=0.9) who experienced nighttime fears and who co-slept with their parents were evaluated using parental reports of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems, sleep difficulties and related anxiety, as well as child and parental reports of fear.ResultsChild-reported fear was significantly predicted by internalizing problems when controlling for other variables whereas parent-reported fear was primarily related to child endorsed fears on a preschool fear questionnaire when controlling for the other variables. In contrast, sleep-related problems were primarily related to externalizing behavior problems whereas the number of nights slept alone was primarily related to separation anxiety on a preschool anxiety questionnaire.ConclusionsFindings from the present study point to the multiplicity of factors that account for nighttime fears and sleep difficulties in young children. Child fear and separation anxiety were related to co-sleeping. Moreover, internalizing symptoms in young children predicted child fear whereas, externalizing symptoms predicted sleep problems. Based on the reciprocal relationship between emotional/behavior problems and sleep, frequent co-sleeping and nighttime fears might serve as a risk and/or maintaining factor of disrupted sleep practices. When treating nighttime fears in young children, co-sleeping should be targeted for intervention as well.

AB Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with higher rates of psychopathology as well as hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex structure. However, little is known about how variations in brain morphometry are associated with socio-emotional risks for mood disorders in children growing up in families experiencing low income. In the current study, using structural magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and gray matter volume in the hippocampus, amygdala, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in a sample of children (n = 34) in middle childhood. Using an affective dot probe paradigm, we examined the association between gray matter volume in these regions and attentional bias to threat, a risk marker for mood disorders including anxiety disorders. We found that lower income-to-needs ratio was associated with lower bilateral hippocampal and right amygdala volume, but not prefrontal cortex volumes. Moreover, lower attentional bias to threat was associated with greater left hippocampal volume. We provide evidence of a relationship between income-related variations in brain structure and attentional bias to threat, a risk for mood disorders. Therefore, these findings support an environment-morphometry-behavior relationship that contributes to the understanding of income-related mental health disparities in childhood.

AB Few studies examine how racial-ethnic peer discrimination experiences of Latinx youth vary across the race-ethnicity of the perpetrator. In a sample of 170 Latinx early adolescents (M-age = 12.86 years, range = 10.33-15.23; 51% female), we identified 4 latent profiles of youth: (a) relatively low likelihood of experiencing discrimination regardless of peers' racial-ethnic group (38%; low discrimination); (b) relatively high probability of experiencing discrimination from the majority outgroup peers (33%; outgroup); (c) relatively high likelihood of experiencing discrimination from ingroup peers (14%; ingroup); (d) the highest probability of discrimination experiences across the in-and outgroup (15%; high discrimination group). Overall, Latinx youth classified in a typology characterized by a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination from both ingroup and outgroup peers also reported the worst internalizing and externalizing symptoms relative to those in the low discrimination typology.

AB BACKGROUND About one third of youth in the United States are overweight or obese and African American youth are at an increased risk for pediatric overweight and obesity as well as their complications. Physical activity has been identified as one determinant of overweight and obesity, and school bullying has been found to be associated with decreased physical activity. Guided by the Transactional Stress and Coping Model, this study examines how school bullying might impact the physical activity of white and African American healthy weight and overweight youth. METHODS Existing, nationally representative, and complex survey data (N = 4509) from the 2005-2006 United States Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) were analyzed using multiple group structural equation modeling to evaluate study questions. RESULTS Support for the hypothesized model was found such that bullying negatively impacted physical activity by way of increasing internalizing symptoms. Possible evidence for parental support, but not peer support, as a protective factor was also found. Results were generally similar for all groups, though some differences are discussed. CONCLUSION School bullying is a risk factor for reduced physical activity, regardless of race-ethnicity and weight. Implications for school health professionals are discussed.

This study reports initial validation information for the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-Third Edition, Behavioral and Emotional Screening System, Parent Form-Preschool (BASC-3 BESS Parent-P). Using an Integrative Data Analysis framework, the BASC-3 BESS Parent-P latent structure was investigated using the norming sample from the BASC-3 (n = 459) as well as two randomly split samples from the BASC-2 norming sample (development sample n = 770; validation sample n = 799). Five models were tested using confirmatory factor analyses; findings suggested a four-factor oblique solution, including Internalizing Risk, Externalizing Risk, Adaptive Skills, and Attention Problems factors. Future research directions and use in school-based screening applications are presented.

AB This study examines the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on the risk of internalizing or externalizing outcomes among juveniles. While myriad research has investigated the impacts of ACEs on internalizing and externalizing outcomes, it is unclear whether ACEs have a stronger link to one outcome over the other when controlling for other factors. Using a sample of 30,909 youth who exclusively exhibited internalizing (n = 1,030) or externalizing problems (n = 29,879), regression techniques and propensity score matching were utilized to evaluate the impact of each ACE on the risk of internalizing versus externalizing outcomes. Results indicate that the most pertinent factor for predicting externalized problems is emotional abuse. Household member incarceration, physical abuse, emotional neglect, and household violence or substance abuse also predicted externalizing outcomes. Sexual abuse was the only ACE predictive of internalizing, while physical neglect and parental mental illness did not have a correlation with either outcome.

AB Objective To identify different kin and fictive kin network support profiles available to children in foster care and examine whether these profiles predict behavioral outcomes. Background For kids in foster care, individual-level strengths have been shown to buffer the impact of maltreatment on negative outcomes. However, little is known about the possible benefit of kin and fictive kin networks on outcomes (e.g., internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors). Method This longitudinal study measured the involvement of 221 foster care children's (6-14 years of age) kin and fictive kin networks (e.g., visits, childcare, homework help, transportation). Strengths (e.g., coping, talents), maltreatment, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors were measured using the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths dataset. Results Using latent profile analysis, two kinship involvement profiles emerged: A low-involvement profile (75.5%) and a high-involvement profile (23.5%). The high-involvement profile was negatively associated with internalizing symptoms trajectories but not externalizing behavior trajectories. However, this effect was moderated by child-level strengths: Children with more strengths and in the high-involvement profile had the best internalizing symptoms outcomes. Finally, membership in the high-involvement profile buffered the negative impact of maltreatment on internalizing symptoms trajectories. Conclusion The presence of both child strengths and kin and fictive kin involvement is associated with better outcomes. Implications These results support efforts to promote policies and practices designed to engage kin and fictive kin networks, which is not currently a priority in child welfare.

AB We tested the hypothesis of school satisfaction being an antecedent to social coping behaviors in early adolescents (N = 892) using a two-wave cross-lagged panel design. We also explored the possible bidirectional relations between school satisfaction and social coping behaviors. Four types of social coping behaviors in peer conflict contexts included social support seeking, self-reliance, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors. The findings showed that school satisfaction significantly predicted three of the four coping behaviors (social support seeking, self-reliance, and externalizing behaviors) in the expected directions. Among all the social coping behaviors, only social support seeking significantly predicted school satisfaction over time. Taken together, the results suggest that school satisfaction may be an antecedent that predicts most social coping behaviors in early adolescents. Furthermore, the relations between social support seeking coping and school satisfaction appeared to be reciprocal. Implications, especially the importance of monitoring students' school satisfaction, are discussed.

AB Parental depression has been associated with psychological problems in offspring. It was hypothesized that harsh parenting would mediate this relationship and that gender differences would suggest moderated mediation. Emerging adults (N = 490) reported on their current perceptions of parental depression, harsh parenting, and their own psychological problems. The indirect effects of parental depression on emerging adult psychological problems in the context of parent-child gender dyads were examined. All variables shared positive free correlations across gender, whereas direct and indirect effects were influenced heavily by gender. Parental depression was directly related to male and female depression, and harsh parenting was only directly and indirectly related to female depression. Further research should focus on the complexity of harsh parenting and environmental predictors on child psychological problems. Addressing parental depression may indirectly and directly improve children's internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB This study aimed to examine the effect of attachment security in 17-month-olds on their peer play interactions and behavioural problems at ages 4 and 6 years, respectively, in Korea. By employing structural equation modelling, we analyzed the data of 183 children and their mothers, which were extracted from the Panel Study on Korean Children (2009-2013). The results indicated that higher attachment security at 17 months was associated with positive play interactions with peers at age 4, which in turn led to fewer internalizing and externalizing problems at age 6.Conversely, lower attachment security at 17 months was related to negative play interactions with peers at age 4, which in turn led to more externalizing problems at age 6.These findings highlight the importance of early infant-mother attachment security to enhance peer competence and protect against behavioural problems in early childhood.

AB The study examined the relationship between spirituality, identity development, and maladjustment variables. A total of 1,016 college student participants (53.9% female) were recruited from a major state university in the southern United States, the structural equation modeling revealed that aspects of identity development mediated the relationship between certain aspects of spirituality (spiritual transcendence, spiritual search, and spiritual function) and certain maladjustment variables (existential anxiety, identity distress, and internalizing symptoms). Identity exploration and identity commitment items appeared to have some unique relationships with the other variables, as did the various aspects of spirituality. Implications for measurement and future research are discussed.

AB Background
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood worldwide, and causes significant impairments in overall functioning. In order to develop effective prevention and intervention programs, knowledge of the determinants that have an impact on the onset and development of ADHD symptoms is essential. So far, little is known about factors affecting ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents over time. Therefore, this study investigates potential psychosocial risk and protective factors for ADHD symptoms based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data of a German population-based study.
   Methods
   Data on children and adolescents (n = 1,384 aged 11 to 17 years) were collected at three measurement points (baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups) covering a period of two years. We used latent growth modelling to investigate effects of parental mental health problems (risk factor) and self-efficacy, family climate and social support (protective factors) on symptoms of ADHD based on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data. Sociodemographic factors, pre- and postnatal factors, and comorbid symptoms of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems were considered as covariates.
   Results
   At baseline, male gender, younger age, stronger aggressive behavior, and stronger parental mental health problems were related to more ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal analyses showed that female gender, migration status, increasing symptoms of generalized anxiety, increasing aggressive behavior and increasing parental mental health problems were associated with stronger increase of ADHD symptoms over time. However, improving family climate was related to decreasing ADHD symptoms over time. We further found moderator effects for social support.
   Conclusion
   The findings of the study provide important information concerning risk and protective factors in the context of ADHD. Hence, the results may be integrated into the planning and implementation of future prevention and early intervention strategies that target affected children and adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of borderline personality features (BPFs) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms among male patients with substance use disorder (SUD) and to evaluate the impact of emotion dysregulation on this relationship. We also wanted to control the effects of depression and state anxiety. METHOD: Participants included 305 treatment-seeking male patients with SUD. Participants were evaluated by applying the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Age, duration of education, marital status, employment status, age at first and age at regular substance use did not differ between those with probable borderline personality disorder (BPD) (n = 155, 50.8%) and those without probable BPD (n = 150, 49.2%). Probable ADHD risk was 3.5 times higher among those with probable BPD. Also ADHD, DERS, depression and anxiety scores were higher in this group with probable BPD. Scale scores were mild and moderately correlated with each other. In hierarchical regression analysis severity of ADHD symptoms (particularly hyperactivity/impulsivity [HI] dimension), together with difficulties in emotion regulation (particularly impulse control difficulties), depression and trait anxiety predicted the severity of BPFs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the severity of HI symptoms of ADHD is related with the BPFs, while difficulties in emotion regulation, particularly impulse control difficulties, partially mediate this relationship among patients with SUD.

AB The attachment security of children in 30 gay father families, 29 lesbian mother families and 38 heterosexual parent families was investigated using the Friends and Family Interview (FFI) at the second phase of a longitudinal study. Children in gay father families showed significantly higher levels of secure-autonomous attachment than children in heterosexual parent families, significantly lower levels of preoccupied attachment than children in either lesbian mother or heterosexual parent families, and significantly lower levels of disorganised attachment than children in heterosexual parent families. For children in gay father families, stepwise multiple regression revealed that neither hyperactivity nor emotional symptoms at Phase 1 were predictive of disorganisation at Phase 2. However, when entered alone, Phase 1 emotional symptoms predicted Phase 2 disorganisation. The results indicate that adopted children in gay father families are at least as likely to be securely attached as children in lesbian mother or heterosexual parent families.

AB BackgroundAdolescents' nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) leads to distress that affects the whole family system, and siblings are reported to suffer from disrupted family communication and functioning. So far, no studies have examined the quality of relationships between adolescents with NSSI and their siblings. The aim of the present study was to examine the sibling relationship quality of adolescents with NSSI, adolescents with other mental disorders without NSSI (clinical controls, CC), and adolescents without current or past experience of mental disorders (nonclinical controls, NC).Methods139 female adolescents aged 13-20years (mean age=16.18years, SD=1.62, NSSI: n=56, CC: n=33, NC: n=50) and 73 siblings aged 10-28years (mean age=16.88years, SD=4.02, 60.3% female) participated. Self-report measures were used to assess psychopathology and sibling relationship quality.ResultsSiblings reported a wide range of negative emotional and familial consequences, such as feeling left alone with their sister's issues or a distressing family situation, as a result of their sister's NSSI. Siblings of adolescents with NSSI experienced significantly more coercion in the relationship with their sister compared to CC (d=1.08) and NC (d=0.67) siblings, indicating an imbalance of dominance and control in their relationship. Further, adolescents with NSSI reported significantly less warmth and empathy in the sibling relationship and higher rivalry scores between their siblings and themselves than NC adolescents, suggesting higher levels of parental favoritism among parents of adolescents with NSSI compared to NC parents (d=0.93). Among siblings of adolescents with NSSI, high levels of warmth, conflict, and empathy were significantly associated with internalizing problems. For adolescents with NSSI a significant association was found between internalizing problems and coercion and externalizing problems and similarity.ConclusionsGiven the negative impact of NSSI on siblings' emotional well-being and family life, efforts should be made to offer siblings psychoeducation and support to help them cope with the emotional and familial consequences of their sister's NSSI. Given adequate support, siblings can in turn be a source of emotional support for their sister.

AB The relationship between childhood trauma and dissociative experiences is widely acknowledged. However, the association between emotion regulation difficulties (ERD), anxiety/depression and dissociation in adolescents and young adults with cumulative maltreatment (CM) remains unclear. The present study examined the role of ERD at both intrapersonal and interpersonal levels and anxiety/depression symptoms in the development of psychoform or somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. We assessed 58 participants with CM and 55 participants without childhood trauma history between the age of 12 and 22 years old. Participants completed self-reports of ERD, anxiety/depression, psychoform dissociation and somatoform dissociation. The results revealed that adolescents and young adults exposed to CM displayed high levels of psychoform and somatoform dissociation, ERD and anxiety/depression symptoms. It was also found that intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD predicted psychoform dissociation, whereas anxiety/depression predicted somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. Intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD and anxiety/depression are therapy targets for clinical interventions in adolescents and young adults with CM and dissociative symptoms.

AB Background: Childhood maltreatment, such as severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and neglect has been linked to impulse control problems and dysfunctional emotional coping. In borderline personality disorder (BPD), a history of childhood maltreatment may worsen difficulties in emotion regulation, which may in turn give rise to impulsive behaviours. The aim of this self-report study was to investigate associations between childhood maltreatment severity, emotion regulation difficulties, and impulsivity in women with BPD compared to healthy and clinical controls.
   Methods: Sixty-one female patients with BPD, 57 clinical controls (CC, women with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and/or Substance Use Disorder, without BPD), and 60 female healthy controls (HC) completed self-report scales on childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, CTQ), difficulties in emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale). A conditional process analysis was performed to investigate whether emotion dysregulation statistically mediated the effect of childhood maltreatment severity on impulsivity depending on group (BPD vs. CC vs. HC).
   Results: Childhood maltreatment, particularly emotional maltreatment, was positively associated with impulsivity and emotion regulation difficulties across all groups. Difficulties in emotion regulation statistically mediated the effect of childhood maltreatment on impulsivity in BPD, but not in the other groups.
   Conclusion: In the context of current conceptualizations of BPD and previous research, findings suggest that problems with emotion regulation may be related to a history of childhood maltreatment, which may in turn enhance impulsivity. Targeting emotion dysregulation in psychotherapy and discussing it in relation to childhood maltreatment can help decreasing impulsive behaviors in individuals with BPD. Given the correlational design of our study which does not allow causal conclusions, future studies have to employ prospective, experimental designs and include larger sample sizes to corroborate associations between childhood maltreatment emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity.

AB Background: The Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) is an interview that assesses psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, including substance use disorders and anxiety and mood (i.e., internalizing) disorders. Although the SSAGA is widely used, there exists no overall internalizing characteristics scale based on items drawn from SSAGA's mood and anxiety disorder sections. Objectives: To design and assess a SSAGA-based measurement instrument capturing the overall internalizing dimension that underlies more specific internalizing conditions. Methods: We developed, assessed, and characterized a new scale for measuring internalizing problematic characteristics derived from the SSAGA interview. All samples were drawn from the Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism, a prospective multi-site genetic study of families at high risk for alcohol use disorders. All participants taking part in the study between September 2005 and September 2017 were eligible (n = 904, 52.2% female). Results: The scale had adequate internal consistency (ordinal alpha = 0.85, 95% CI = [0.81, 0.89]). Construct validity was supported by its association with other measures of internalizing characteristics (Internalizing Scale from Achenbach Self Reports; Neuroticism Scale from the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Five-Factor Personality Inventory). Several indices of alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine misuse were also positively associated with Internalizing Scale scores. Conclusions: The Internalizing Scale has very good psychometric properties and can be used in studies that incorporate the SSAGA interview to study the association between internalizing characteristics and problematic alcohol and other substance use. These associations can potentially be utilized to identify individuals at risk for substance problems and to design treatments targeting such individuals.

AB In reviewing the preceding articles, I emphasize the predominance of relational theories in the study of development as a way of demonstrating the evolutionary and relational extremity of reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The lack (or distortion?) of mutuality, RAD's defining feature, has implications for all aspects of development, not least of which is self-regulation. I review each article in this special issue, emphasizing important features, integrating across studies, expanding their links to attachment theory, and recommending future directions. Finally, I conduct two meta-analyses of the samples in this special issue, one meta-analysis addressing convergent validity of RAD assessment instrumentation developed by authors represented here and the other addressing the links between RAD and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. This special issue exploits the disaggregation of reactive attachment and disinhibited social engagement disorders to move the field forward in remarkable ways, both methodologically and substantively.

AB School bullying is associated with externalizing and internalizing problems, but little is known about whether reading difficulties also play a part. We asked how, in Grades 1 and 2, word reading skills and externalizing/internalizing problems predict the degree to which students are involved in bullying in Grade 3. Using a sample of 480 Finnish children (M age = 7 years 2 months at the beginning of the study), developmental profiles were identified using mixture modeling based on reading skills, as well as externalizing and internalizing problems. In Grade 3, one fifth of the students were involved in bullying as victims, bullies, or bully/victims. Poor readers with externalizing/internalizing problems were most involved as bullies and bully/victims but not as victims. Average readers with externalizing/internalizing problems were also involved in bullying, whereas students with only reading difficulties were not. Skilled readers displayed little externalizing/internalizing problems and were not involved in bullying.

AB This study examined the health profile of children with different types of disabilities and explored the disability-specific associations with various types of health and functioning using a large nonclinical sample of children. A cross-sectional school survey was conducted during 2016 and 2017. A total of 4114 children (aged 6-18 years) receiving primary or secondary education, or their proxy, in Hong Kong participated in the study. Disabilities were categorized as (a) physical disabilities; (b) learning and developmental disabilities; (c) intellectual disabilities; (d) internalizing disorders or mental illness; and (e) autism spectrum disorder. Health-related quality of life (QoL), sleep-related QoL, activities of daily living (ADL), emotional functioning, and social functioning were assessed and compared between children with disabilities and those without. The results showed that children with disabilities showed poorer physical functioning, health-related QoL, and emotional and social functioning than their counterparts without disabilities. Disability-specific associations with health were found: (a) physical disabilities and intellectual disabilities were associated with greater difficulties in ADL; (b) language impairment and Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were negatively associated with sleep-related QoL; (c) all types of disabilities but hearing impairment were negatively associated with health-related QoL (HRQoL); and (d) language impairment, ADHD, internalizing disorder, as well as autism spectrum disorder were associated with greater abnormal behavioral difficulties. The findings warrant the development of tailor-made intervention programs and give insights to effective resource allocation for the children in need.

AB Background and objectives: Research on the social effects of intranasal oxytocin in children is scarce. Oxytocin has been proposed to have clearer beneficial effects when added to social learning paradigms. The current study tested this proposition in middle childhood by assessing effects of cognitive bias modification (CBM) training and oxytocin on trust in maternal support.
   Methods: Children (N = 100, 8-12 years) were randomly assigned to one of two training conditions: CBM training aimed at increasing trust or neutral placebo training. Within each training condition, half the participants received oxytocin and half a placebo. Main and interaction effects were assessed on measures of trustrelated interpretation bias and trust. We explored whether child characteristics moderated intervention effects.
   Results: Children in the CBM training were faster to interpret maternal behaviour securely versus insecurely. Effects did not generalize to interpretation bias measures or trust. There were no main or interaction effects of oxytocin. Exploratory moderation analyses indicated that combining CBM training with oxytocin had less positive effects on trust for children with more internalizing problems.
   Limitations: As this was the first study combining CBM and oxytocin, replication of the results is needed.
   Conclusions: This study combined a social learning paradigm with oxytocin in children. CBM training was effective at an automatic level of processing. Oxytocin did not enhance CBM effects or independently exert effects. Research in larger samples specifying when oxytocin might have beneficial effects is necessary before oxytocin can be used as intervention option in children.

AB Introduction Young adulthood (aged 18-24) is a crucial period in the development of long-term tobacco use patterns. Tobacco advertising and promotion lead to the initiation and continuation of smoking among young adults. We examined whether vulnerability factors moderated the association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use in the United States.
   Methods Analyses were conducted among 9109 US young adults in the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study wave 1 (2013-14). Participants viewed 20 randomly selected sets of tobacco advertisements (five each for cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco) and indicated whether they liked each ad. The outcome variables were past 30-day cigarette, e-cigarette, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use. Covariates included tobacco advertisement liking, age, sex, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, poverty level, military service, and internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms.
   Results Liking tobacco advertisements was associated with tobacco use, and this association was particularly strong among those with lower educational attainment (cigarettes, cigars) and living below the poverty level (e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco).
   Conclusions The association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use was stronger among young adults with lower educational attainment and those living below the poverty level. Policies that restrict advertising exposure and promote counter-marketing messages in this population could reduce their risk.
   Implications This study shows that liking tobacco advertisements is associated with current tobacco use among young adults, with stronger associations for vulnerable young adults (ie, lower education levels and living below the poverty level). Findings suggest a need for counter-marketing messages, policies that restrict advertising exposure, and educational interventions such as health and media literacy interventions to address the negative influences of tobacco advertisements, especially among young adults with a high school education or less and those living below the poverty level.

AB Objective: To examine the effectiveness of a web-based parenting intervention (Internet-Based Interacting Together Everyday: Recovery After Childhood TBI [I-InTERACT]) and an abbreviated version (Express) in reducing executive dysfunction and internalizing problems among young children following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: Parents of 113 children (ages 3-9 years) who had sustained a TBI were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: I-InTERACT, Express, or an Internet Resource Comparison (IRC) group. Parents who participated in either I-InTERACT or Express completed self-guided web sessions and received live coaching of their parenting skills via videoconferencing with a therapist. I-InTERACT included additional psychoeducation, stress management, and family communication skills (eg, marriage, grief, pain, and sleep). Analyses of covariance were utilized to compare the groups on parent-reported executive function behaviors (ie, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) and internalizing symptoms (ie, Child Behavior Checklist) at baseline and 6 months. Results: Parents who participated in Express reported significantly lower levels of executive dysfunction than those in I-InTERACT, beta = -0.49; t(2, 73) = -2.47, P = .048, and significantly lower levels of withdrawal than those in the IRC group, beta = -0.44; t(2, 74) = -2.22, P = .03. The Express group did not significantly differ from the IRC group on executive function behaviors or the I-InTERACT group on internalizing problems, all P > .05. Children with more problems at baseline, families with lower education levels, and parents with more symptoms of depression benefited most. Conclusion: A brief, online parent training intervention may be efficacious in improving executive dysfunction and internalizing problems following early TBI, particularly among children of lower socioeconomic status or with existing behavioral concerns.

AB Objectives: To characterize the sleep disturbance in children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to identify associated factors. Setting: An urban tertiary pediatric healthcare facility. Participants: Children aged 5 to 15 years with a moderate TBI (n = 21), severe TBI (n = 23), or an orthopedic injury (OI; n =38) comparable in age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Design: Cohort study. Measures: Primary: Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). Secondary: Injury-specific factors (TBI severity, age at injury, and time since injury), and other factors of interest (sleep hygiene; pain intensity; difficulties with internalizing, externalizing, or attention/hyperactivity; parental distress; and parental knowledge of TBI). Results: On the SDSC, parents rated children with moderate TBI (but not severe TBI) as experiencing greater overall sleep disturbance, as well as excessive somnolence and sleep breathing disturbance, relative to OI controls. Children with severe TBI (but not moderate TBI) were rated as experiencing greater disturbance with initiating and maintaining sleep. The moderate and severe TBI groups did not differ on any of the sleep outcomes. Only 3 factors were associated with sleep disturbance in the combined TBI group: (1) lower TBI severity with greater excessive somnolence; (2) greater internalizing difficulties with greater overall sleep disturbance, and disturbance with initiating and maintaining sleep specifically; and (3) younger age at injury with greater overall sleep disturbance, and sleep breathing disturbance specifically. Conclusion: Children with moderate or severe TBI experience greater overall and/or specific forms of sleep disturbance. Different forms of sleep disturbance may be associated with different factors.

AB Early childhood teachers play a key role in promoting children's social, emotional, and behavioral functioning. We investigated how preschool lead and assistant teachers' personal and job-related stress are, collectively and separately, associated with their perceptions of children's anger-aggression, anxiety-withdrawal, and social competence. Using a sample of 103 teachers from 54 classrooms serving 329 children, we conducted three-level multilevel analyses. Lead and assistant teachers' cumulative personal stress was significantly associated with teachers' evaluations of children's anger-aggression, and cumulative job-related emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with teachers' evaluations of children's anxiety-withdrawal and social competence. Exploring lead and assistant teachers' stress separately, the results showed that lead teachers with higher levels of stress perceived children as having higher levels of anger-aggression and anxiety-withdrawal. On the other hand, assistant teachers' stress was associated with teacher-reported children's social competence. We suggest ways to support children's social, emotional, and behavioral functioning through intervening with teachers' stress.

AB Objective: To explore the effects of breastfeeding on behavioral disorders of school-age children.
   Materials and Methods: Totally 1,979 children of 6-11 years old from three primary schools in Xiamen, China, were assessed and included for further analysis. The Pearson chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression model were used to analyze the effects of breastfeeding on internalizing behaviors such as depression, withdrawn, and somatic complaints, and externalizing behaviors such as aggression and rule-breaking behavior.
   Results: The Pearson chi-square test revealed that the percentages in internalizing behavioral problems (chi(2) = 21.693, p < 0.001), depression (chi(2) = 12.713, p= 0.002), and somatic complains (chi(2) = 12.850, p= 0.002) were significantly lower with the decrease of the duration of breastfeeding. However, there were no statistically significant differences in externalizing behavioral problems. After adjusting the potential covariates, children who were breastfed for >6 months were significantly associated with the reduced risk of internalizing behavioral problems (Odds ratio = 0.446, 95%CI: 0.228-0.873) and depression (Odds ratio = 0.452, 95% CI: 0.225-0.906) compared with those who were never breastfed, whereas differences were not found in externalizing behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Increased duration of breastfeeding (>= 6 months) could help lower internalizing behavioral problems, particularly depression, in school-age children. Breastfeeding with longer duration will play an important role to prevent and reduce children's internalizing behavioral disorders.

TI Does free schooling affect pathways from adverse childhood experiences

AB Introduction: Adolescent girls are at high risk of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Mental health distress, driven by adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as abuse, poverty and family HIV, may be an important driver of HIV risk behaviour among adolescent girls, while education may mitigate these risks. This study aimed to develop an empirically based theoretical model between ACEs, mental health distress and HIV risk behaviour among adolescent girls in South Africa and to investigate the potential moderating effects of free schooling provision.
   Methods: Self-report questionnaires using validated scales were completed by adolescent girls aged 12 to 17 at baseline in two provinces in South Africa in 2011, with a 99% one-year follow-up in 2012 (n = 1498). Sampling included every household in randomly selected census enumeration areas of four deprived health districts. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to identify measurement models and a structural equationmodel was developed to test pathways of risk and protection.
   Results: Internalizing and externalizing mental health distress fully mediated the positive relationship between ACEs at baseline and HIV risk behaviour at follow-up among adolescent girls. Internalizing mental health distress was associated with increased sexual risk at follow-up via higher externalizing problems. Free schooling provision at baseline and follow-up eliminated the pathway from internalizing to externalizing mental health distress by moderating the pathway between ACEs and internalizing mental health distress. It also weakened the pathway from externalizing mental health distress to HIV risk behaviour at follow-up through a direct negative effect on externalizing mental health distress.
   Conclusions: Reducing ACEs and adolescent mental health distress is essential for reducing HIV risk behaviour among girls in South Africa. Free schooling provision may be an important tool for reducing these problems and mitigating negative pathways to HIV risk among vulnerable adolescent girls.

AB Increased reaction time variability (RTV) is one of the most replicable behavioral correlates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, this may not be specific to ADHD but a more general marker of psychopathology. Here we compare RT variability in individuals with ADHD and those with other childhood internalizing and externalizing conditions both in terms of standard (i.e., the standard deviation of reaction time) and alternative indices that capture low-frequency oscillatory patterns in RT variations over time thought to mark periodic lapses of attention in ADHD. A total of 667 participants (6-12years old) were classified into non-overlapping diagnostic groups consisting of children with fear disorders (n=91), distress disorders (n=56), ADHD (n=103), oppositional defiant or conduct disorder (ODD/CD; n=40) and typically developing controls (TDC; n=377). We used a simple two-choice reaction time task to measure reaction time. The strength of oscillations in RTs across the session was extracted using spectral analyses. Higher RTV was present in ADHD compared to all other disorder groups, effects that were equally strong across all frequency bands. Interestingly, we found that lower RTV to characterize ODD/CD relative to TDC, a finding that was more pronounced at lower frequencies. In general, our data support RTV as a specific marker of ADHD. RT variation across time in ADHD did not show periodicity in a specific frequency band, not supporting that ADHD RTV is the product of spontaneous periodic lapses of attention. Low-frequency oscillations may be particularly useful to differentiate ODD/CD from TDC.

AB This longitudinal study focused on early behavioural problems and autistic traits. In a stratified, population-derived sample of 119 children, mothers reported through questionnaires on externalizing, internalizing, and social-communicative characteristics of their child in infancy (14months) and toddlerhood (37months), and on autistic traits at preschool age (4-5years). Children with consistently normal behaviour from infancy to toddlerhood showed lower autistic traits at preschool age than children with deviant behaviour on one or both time points. High autistic traits at preschool age were predominantly preceded by problems in interaction, communication, language, play, and affect in infancy and/or toddlerhood, but also by inattention in toddlerhood. Adequate support and specific interventions in these domains are needed in an attempt to diminish further derailment of the child's behaviour and development, and to prevent the full manifestation of ASD or related disorders such as ADHD.

AB The purpose of this study was to test whether Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a widely used effective therapy for children's externalizing behaviors and parenting problems, was associated with improvements in parents' emotion regulation and reflective functioning. We also investigated whether these improvements had unique associations with children's improvements in externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Participants were 139 Australian children aged 29 to 83 months and their caregivers; all were referred for child externalizing behavior problems coupled with parenting skill deficits or high parent stress. All data were gathered via a questionnaire completed prior to and after completion of PCIT. Significant improvements were found in parents' self-reported emotion dysregulation and capacity to use cognitive reappraisal for emotion regulation. There was also improvement in parents' self-report of children's symptoms, parenting practices, and reflective functioning in the form of prementalizing, which measured a low capacity to understand the emotional world of the child. Multiple regression showed that improvements in cognitive reappraisal, prementalizing, and negative parenting practices were associated with improvement in children's symptoms. The findings extend the existing evidence for PCIT as an effective parenting intervention, adding parents' perceived emotion regulation and reflective functioning to the list of positive outcomes from PCIT. Improved emotion regulation and reflective functioning, unique from changes in parenting practices, could be mechanisms that help explain why PCIT has been associated with improvements in children's externalizing behaviors.

AB In this study, behavioral and emotional reactions to cyberbullying were investigated by surveying 567 undergraduate-level university students and 211 high school students. Among the study participants, 170 of the undergraduates (29.98%) and 120 of the high school students (56.87%) reported that they had recently been cyberbullied. A four-factor scale with 37 items was used to investigate the behavioral cyberbullying reactions of victimized students. The four factors were revenge, countermeasure, negotiation and avoidance. An additional two factor scale with 11 items was used to classify victimized students' emotional reactions as either internalizing or externalizing. Explained variance values of both scales were above 50%, and the factors were found to have acceptable internal consistency coefficients. Behavioral and emotional reactions varied according to gender and school level. Computer self-efficacy and internet use were associated with different reaction types.

AB Objectives: Childhood emotional/behavioral problems in children with epilepsy have been reported to be higher compared with those with typical development or with other nonneurologic health conditions. Increasing interest towards understanding these behavioral comorbidities is reflected in literature. However, longitudinal investigations regarding the course of behavioral problems in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy and normal development are rare, and majority of them involve school-aged children. We aimed to study the behavioral comorbidities of preschool children with newly diagnosed epilepsy and to explore the changes of behavioral problems after one year from the diagnosis in comparison with the healthy group and subsequently, to elucidate the potential developmental, neurologic, and social risk factors associated with these difficulties.
   Methods: Participants were 83 patients, aged between 18 and 59 months, 43 of them were children with new-onset epilepsy, and 40 of them were healthy children as the comparison group. The Child Behavior Check List-1 1/2-5 (CBCL) was used to evaluate emotional/behavioral problems of the children. Maternal anxiety was analyzed by The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The general development of children was evaluated by the Denver-IIDevelopmental Screening Test (D-II-DST). Sociodemographic characteristics were also collected for all participants. Each evaluation was repeated after one year from the diagnosis.
   Results: Internalizing, externalizing, and total problem scores were higher in children with epilepsy than the control group at baseline, and despite some reduction in several scales, the differences continued across groups after one year. The analysis for the course revealed that behavior problem scores reduced in children with new-onset epilepsy over a year, but it did not change in healthy children. Among the possible factors related to behavior problem scores, in correlation analysis, the duration of screen viewing, socioeconomic status, and maternal education were associated with behavior problem scores. There was no significant association between epilepsy-related variables and the behavior problem scores and the course. Among all possible risk factors in the regression analyses, maternal trait anxiety level was found to be significantly related to the total problems, internalizing, and externalizing scores in the group with epilepsy.
   Conclusion: Behavioral comorbidities of epilepsy are present very early and can be seen at the time of the diagnosis, however, they do not worsen over time in preschool children. Maternal anxiety should be considered as a risk factor for behavioral problems in preschool children with epilepsy. Assisting children and parents and ensuring necessary guidance and support should be a crucial part of epilepsy treatment initiated as soon as the time of diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective This study aimed to identify temperament and character profiles associated with internalizing and externalizing problems in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods Children with ADHD (n=114, 8.51 +/- 1.87 years) were selected from the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Jeju National University Hospital. They were diagnosed by Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version and evaluated using the Advanced Test of Attention and Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition. Their parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale, Korean-Child Behavioral Checklist, and Junior Temperament and Character Inventory.
   Results The participants with both internalizing and externalizing problem had more severe ADHD symptoms and significantly higher novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and self-transcendence, as well as lower self-directeclness and cooperativeness than those who had not comorbid problems. Harm avoidance was correlated with their level of internalizing problems regardless of severity of ADHD symptoms. In addition, novelty seeking and sex (male) were being associated with the level of externalizing problems.
   Conclusion Differences were observed in the temperament and character profiles of children with ADHD according to their comorbid psychopathology. Results suggested that temperament and character profiles may affect the comorbid psychopathology in children with ADHD regardless of ADHD symptom severity.

AB The mechanisms of change are rarely investigated in the field of gamified interventions for preventing emotional disorders in children and adolescents despite the wide recognition for the advantages they offer as prevention tool. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of change of a therapeutic game (REThink), specifically mediators and moderators of its efficacy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial, involving 165 children (age range 10-16years), who were randomly distributed across three groups: the REThink group (N=54), the Rational Emotive Behavior Education group (N=55) and the Waitlist condition (N=56). Results indicated that changes in irrational beliefs were significant mediators for the REThink intervention on depressive mood and overall negative emotions. Age did not moderate the effect of REThink, which indicates that the program was equally effective for children and adolescents.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03308981.

AB The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), or oppositionality, seem to constitute a three-dimensional structure of angry/irritable, vindictiveness and argumentative behavior dimensions. Also, subjects with oppositionality are characterized by different comorbidity and longitudinal trajectories, suggesting that they could be divided into subtypes. This study is the first to examine the dimensions and subtypes of oppositionality in Nordic children. Study participants included 3435 children aged 7-10years from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Information was collected using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) online version. A three-factor ODD model was identified. The angry/irritable dimension was associated with emotional problems and disorders, fewer social skills and fewer personal positive attributes. The argumentative behavior dimension was associated with hyperactivity/conduct problems, reduced social skills and positive attributes. The vindictiveness dimension was associated with externalizing, internalizing and prosocial problems. Four ODD subtypes were identified. The subtypes with many or mainly angry/irritable symptoms were characterized by comorbid psychopathology, increased functional impairment and psychosocial problems. Children with ODD had fewer positive attributes, more friendship/school problems and higher functional impairment than children with emotional disorders and control group children. Oppositionality consists of three dimensions differently associated with comorbidity and psychosocial characteristics, and the same pattern is seen for the four ODD subtypes identified in this study. Children with ODD experience more adversities and functional impairment than children with emotional disorders. Our results indicate that treatment of children with ODD would improve from extended knowledge on individual ODD dimensions and subtypes and the related child psychosocial characteristics.

AB Decreased emotional awareness contributes to the risk of internalizing disorders, such as depression. Although emotional awareness may be especially important during adolescence, a developmental period in which emotional arousal is high and the risk of depression rises dramatically, little research has examined the mechanisms linking emotional awareness to depression. Starting from affect regulation models, the current study proposes emotion regulation (ER) as a key underlying mechanism in the emotional awarenessdepression relationship. The current study investigated whether maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies mediate the relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms among youth using a cross-sectional design. Participants were 220 youth (65% girls; Mage=11.87, SD=1.94) who filled out a set of questionnaires assessing emotional awareness, ER strategies, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed no direct relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms. However, emotional awareness yielded a significant mediation effect through total adaptive ER strategies on higher depressive symptoms. No evidence was found for the mediating role of maladaptive ER strategies in this relationship. The current study provides further support for affect regulation models positing that emotional awareness may be a basic skill that is required for learning adaptive ER skills, and thus call for greater attention to adaptive ER strategies.

AB School attendance problems (SAPs) become manifest in many ways and are associated with multiple risk factors, calling for comprehensive assessment methods. This study documents the development of the inventory of school attendance problems (ISAP), which assesses both the quality and the function of a broad spectrum of SAPs by first asking students with SAPs to rate the intensity of symptoms prior to or at school and then to rate their impact on school attendance. An empirically generated pool of 124 items was analyzed (explorative factor analysis) using a clinical sample of N=245 students with SAPs (53.5% male; M-age: 14.4). The Youth Self Report (YSR), a German version of the School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS), and the extent of school absenteeism were used to determine construct validity. The resulting 48 items loaded on 13 factors. The 13 scales assess internalizing and externalizing symptoms (Depression, Social Anxiety, Performance Anxiety, Agoraphobia/Panic, Separation Anxiety, Somatic Complaints, Aggression, School Aversion/Attractive Alternatives) as well as emotional distress due to problems in the school or family context (Problems with Teachers, Dislike of the Specific School, Problems with Peers, Problems Within the Family, Problems with Parents). All scales showed good internal consistencies. Their correlations with the YSR and the SRAS indicated convergent and discriminant validity. Positive associations between most of the scales and the extent of school absenteeism were obtained. Although preliminary, these results support the usefulness of the ISAP for a comprehensive assessment of SAPs in clinical settings.

AB Researchers examined whether a parent-implemented language intervention improved problem behaviors 1 year after intervention. Ninety-seven children with language delays (mean age at 12-month follow-up = 48.22 months) were randomized to receive Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT) language intervention or business as usual treatment. Twelve months after the intervention ended, children in the EMT intervention condition displayed lower rates of parent-reported externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors. A mediation analysis revealed that the relation between EMT and problem behaviors was partially mediated by child rate of communication for both internalizing and total problem behaviors. A developmental framework is proposed to explain the impact of EMT on problem behaviors, and future lines of research are discussed.

AB Youth involved in the justice system meet criteria for psychiatric disorders at much higher rates than youth in the general population and a large body of research has established a relationship between mental health problems and delinquency or recidivism. However, only limited research has examined the relationship between specific types of psychopathology and specific patterns or types of delinquency for justice-involved youth and only a single study has explored the relationship between psychopathology and delinquency among youth with psychiatric diagnoses receiving mental health treatment. We examined the relationship between severity of offending and internalizing and externalizing symptoms among court-involved, non-incarcerated youth referred for mental health treatment. Over half of youth and over two-thirds of parents reported youth symptomatology at the 93rd percentile or above for internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, or both. We found that youth engaged in serious or violent delinquency are more likely to have externalizing problems but that internalizing symptoms were equally high across youth committing minor, moderate, and serious delinquent acts. Findings from this study support the need for future research exploring the nuances of relationships between psychiatric disorder and patterns of delinquency, which can provide helpful information to justice system stakeholders in identifying youth needs.

AB Social-Emotional competencies evolve early in life. For example, early emotion regulation is learned primarily in the context of mother-child interaction, which may allow for maternal influences to shape children's social-emotional development. The aim of the current study was to longitudinally examine maternal determinants of children's early social-emotional development in a community-based sample of first-time mothers (N = 61, aged 22-39 years). Specifically, we used structural equation modeling to examine how maternal emotion regulation difficulties and subclinical depression directly and indirectly, through sensitivity and postnatal bonding, assessed at 6 to 8 months predicted child outcomes at 12 to 16 months. We found that mothers' sensitivity predicted fewer social-emotional and behavioral problems and that stronger bonding predicted fewer problems and more social-emotional competencies. Emotion regulation difficulties were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; yet, when accounting for shared variances, both factors differentially predicted less positive child outcomes such that more difficulties indirectly, through poorer bonding, predicted greater delay in competencies, and more symptoms indirectly, through less sensitivity, predicted more problems. Current findings underline the significance of maternal factors impacting the quality of mother-child interaction for children's positive development. Potential implications for early prevention programs to support children who are otherwise at risk for negative emotional outcomes due to mothers' emotional state postpartum are discussed.

AB Using a longitudinal design, this study examined the associations between infant temperamental withdrawal and behavior problems during toddlerhood and tested the moderating effects of maternal sensitivity to infant distress (MSID) and toddlers' ability to delay gratification (ADG) in urban Chinese families. Participants were 84 Chinese children (37 boys, 47 girls) and their mothers. When the infants were 6 months old (T1: infancy), their mothers reported their temperamental withdrawal, and research assistants observed and coded MSID by using a subscale of the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort during free-play interaction. When the toddlers were 1 year old (T2: early toddlerhood), their mothers reported their internalizing and externalizing problems. When the toddlers were 2 years old (T3: late toddlerhood), their mothers again reported their internalizing and externalizing problems, and their abilities of delay gratification were assessed through a laboratory-based procedure. Infant temperamental withdrawal was associated with increased internalizing problems in early toddlerhood and increased externalizing problems during middle to late toddlerhood; infants whose mothers were extremely high sensitive or low sensitive to their distress or those with late poor ability of delay gratification were at particular risk. The findings highlight the importance of matching parenting and promotion of self-control for temperamental withdrawn children's optimal development.

AB Objective: Universal prevention programs such as Positive Action (PA) mitigate risk factors and enhance promotive factors, often leading to improved adolescent functioning and school climate. The current study used 5 waves of data to assess the impact of PA on adolescent mental health and perceptions of school climate 1 year after completion of the program in a sample of low-income, rural youth. Method: Following multiple imputation and propensity score analysis, we ran 4 (2-level) hierarchal linear models to examine program effects. Results: PA program participants reported significant increases in self-esteem and significant decreases in school hassles relative to youths who did not participate in PA. Participation in PA did not have a significant impact on internalizing symptoms or aggression. Risk factors across the adolescents' ecology had a strong negative impact on the outcomes, and some promotive factors modestly bolstered adolescent functioning. Conclusions: Findings highlight the influence that risk factors-especially negative interpersonal conflicts-have on adolescent outcomes and indicate that, although PA can help improve adolescents' perceptions of themselves and their school climate, the program might need to be tailored for use in low-income, rural areas.

AB Introduction: Interpersonal trust behavior is an important target for the identification and treatment of psychiatric disorders with interpersonal dysfunction. Adolescent depression is a highly interpersonal disorder marked by impaired social interactions. However, trust has received little empirical attention. The examination of reward-related decision-making using behavioral economic methods is a relatively novel approach for studying trust in adolescent depression. The present study employed a modified trust game to examine whether depressive adolescents exhibited perturbed reward-related decision-making in social and/or non-social contexts. Methods: One hundred and thirty adolescent girls (65 depressive, 65 healthy comparisons) played a modified trust game under two conditions, interpersonal risk-taking (trust) and general risk-taking (lottery), and completed self-report psychopathology measures. Results: Three-way repeated measures ANCOVA analyses revealed a significant group x game interaction such that while the depressive group invested more across trials in the trust game they invested similarly to healthy comparisons in the lottery condition. Discussion: Findings highlight the interpersonal nature of adolescent depression. Future research may help determine whether increased trust behavior is characteristic of depression in adolescent girls. Behavioral economic games, like the trust game, may serve as valuable therapeutic tools for improving social interaction style among depressive adolescents.

AB HIV/AIDS-related (HAR) stigma is still a prevalent problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, and has been found to be related to mental health of HIV-positive individuals. However, no studies in the Sub-Saharan African context have yet examined the relationship between HAR stigma and mental health among HIV-negative, HIV-affected adults and families; nor have any studies in this context yet examined stigma as an ecological construct predicting mental health outcomes through supra-individual (setting level) and individual levels of influence. Multilevel modeling was used to examine multilevel, ecological relationships between HAR stigma and mental health among child and caregiver pairs from a systematic, community-representative sample of 508 HIV-affected households nested within 24 communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Two distinct dimensions of HAR stigma were measured: individual stigmatizing attitudes, and perceptions of community normative stigma. Findings suggest that individual-level HAR stigma significantly predicts individual mental health (depression and anxiety) among HIV-affected adults; and that community-level HAR stigma significantly predicts both individual-level mental health outcomes (anxiety) among HIV-affected adults, and mental health outcomes (PTSD and externalizing behavior scores) among HIV-affected children. Differentiated patterns of relationships were found using the two different stigma measures. These findings of unique relationships identified when utilizing two conceptually distinct stigma measures, at two levels of analysis (individual and community) suggest that HAR stigma in this context should be conceptualized as a multilevel, multidimensional construct. These findings have important implications both for mental health interventions and for interventions to reduce HAR stigma in this context.

AB Purpose of ReviewEmotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cause clinically significant impairments. We review recent neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and peripheral psychophysiological evidence for emotion and emotion regulation deficits in ADHD across youth and adults.Recent FindingsCentral and autonomous nervous system correlates argue in favor of more general self-regulation deficits and also specific emotional deficits in ADHD. These include general performance deficits in executive functions, and structural as well as functional impairments in neuronal networks associated with top-down self-regulation. Specific deficits with bottom-up emotional activation in the amygdala and emotion evaluation associated with the orbitofrontal cortex have also been described. Furthermore, vagally mediated, high-frequency heart rate variability is associated with emotional self-regulation deficits throughout the life span. The current evidence is based on multilevel studies that assess associations of emotion regulation. However, further studies that adequately consider the processual recursive character of emotion generation and regulation may give important new insights into emotional regulation of ADHD.SummaryEmotion regulation deficits in ADHD are associated with specific as well as general self-regulation deficits traceable on the level of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and psychophysiological assessments. The temporal dynamics of the interplay of those different systems need further study in order to optimize and personalize treatment of emotion regulation difficulties, including emotional reactivity, in patients with ADHD.

TI Parental Perceptions of Individual and Dyadic Adjustment as Predictors

AB Over the past 20 years, systemically guided approaches to understanding early family processes have helped to provide greater clarity concerning the interplay among individual, dyadic, and family level processes. Parental depression, marital functioning, and child adjustment in particular appear to be reliable predictors of coparental and family level functioning. Indeed, cohesion at the level of the family group covaries in theoretically meaningful ways with these indicators of individual and dyadic adjustment. In this study, two collaborating research groups (one in Switzerland, the second in the United States) partnered to examine whether similar patterns of relationships exist among individual and marital adjustment and coparenting processes in families of 4-year-old children. Using similar constructs but disparate and occasionally dissimilar measures, both groups measured parent-reported depression, marital satisfaction, and child behavior problems. Coparenting cooperation and warmth were observed during family interactions. Despite differences between samples and evaluation tools, similar results were found for the Swiss and U.S. samples. A model with depression, marital satisfaction, and child symptoms as predictors of a latent factor of observed coparenting cooperation and warmth showed good fit to data in both samples, suggesting the model was relevant for each. Parameter estimation showed that higher coparenting cooperation and warmth was predicted by lower maternal depression and higher child internalizing symptoms. The common significant effects despite differences in assessment paradigms and instrumentation are of substantive interest. Future directions pertinent to the coparenting questions addressed in this research are discussed.

AB Child internalizing and externalizing problems have been identified as high priority intervention targets by the World Health Organization. Parental depression is a risk factor for development of these childhood problems and may negatively influence intervention outcomes; however, studies have rarely assessed its influence on these outcomes. The present study assessed whether baseline parental depressive symptoms predicted psychotherapy outcomes among children treated for clinically significant internalizing and externalizing problems. The sample included 142 children (79 with primary internalizing problems, 63 with primary externalizing problems). Children were aged 7-13, 67.6% boys, and race included Caucasian (46.5%), African-American (9.9%), Latino (5.6%), Asian (1.4%), and multi-racial (32.4%). Analyses focused on child- and parent-reported weekly trajectories of change and post-treatment symptoms among children treated for internalizing and externalizing problems whose parents did (N=28 and 25) and did not (N=51 and 38) have elevated depressive symptoms. For children with internalizing problems, growth curve analyses showed markedly different trajectories, by child- and parent-report: children with less depressed parents showed significantly steeper symptom declines than did children with more depressed parents, who showed an increase in symptoms. ANCOVAs showed marginally lower post-treatment symptoms for children of less depressed versus more depressed parents (p=0.064 by child-report). For children with externalizing problems, growth curve analyses showed trajectories in the opposite direction, by child- and parent-report; however, ANCOVAs showed no group differences at post-treatment. These findings suggest that it may be important to consider the impact of parental depressive symptoms when treating child internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Adolescence is a period of heightened emotional reactivity, which is reflected in greater activation in emotion-processing regions of the brain in adolescents relative to children and adults. While elevated emotional reactivity and poor emotion regulation are thought to contribute to the rise in rates of internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, during adolescence, little research has examined factors predicting individual differences in the neural regulation of emotion that can explain why only some adolescents experience anxiety. To address this gap, the present study examined the contribution of childhood negative emotionality (NE) and cognitive control (CC) to neural processing of emotion in adolescence. A sample of 44 girls (M age=15.5, SD=0.35) was selected from a longitudinal study that included self, parent, and teacher report of NE and CC between 2nd and 7th grades. Following 9th grade, girls completed an emotion regulation task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Neural regulation of emotion was indexed by functional connectivity between the amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) during emotion regulation. Analyses revealed that NE predicted a less mature pattern of amygdala-rVLPFC connectivity while CC predicted a more mature pattern of amygdala-rVLPFC connectivity. Additionally, we found an interaction between NE and CC, such that NE predicted emotion dysregulation at low but not high levels of CC. Neural dysregulation of emotion was associated with anxiety symptoms across the following nine months. These findings identify important individual differences in the development of emotion dysregulation that contribute to risk for anxiety in adolescence.

AB This study, based on a transactional perspective of psychopathology, aimed to examine whether the mindful attention and awareness component of mindfulness moderates the bidirectional long-term predictive associations between dependent stressors, maladaptive schemas, and depressive symptoms in adolescents. It was hypothesized that mindful attention and awareness would buffer the predictive bidirectional associations between these variables. The sample was composed of 1190 high school students (48.7% girls) from the Basque Country (Spain), who participated in a two-wave longitudinal study spaced 2years apart. The participants were all between 13 and 18years old (M=15.16, SD=0.95). They completed a measure of dispositional mindfulness at wave 1, and measures of dependent stressors, schemas from the disconnection/rejection schema domain, and depressive symptoms at both waves. Results indicated that mindful attention and awareness reduced the predictive associations between disconnection/rejection schemas and depressive symptoms at follow-up (wave 2). In addition, mindfulness predicted lower scores on maladaptive schemas, dependent stressors, and depressive symptoms at follow-up and buffered the stability of schemas over time. However, these findings were statistically significant only for boys. The results suggest that mindfulness-based intervention can be used to reduce maladaptive schemas that are relevant for depressive symptoms in adolescents.

AB Socialization of children's emotions is implicated in a variety of child outcomes including children's social and emotional competence, peer relations, self-esteem, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Recognizing the importance of culture, an emerging body of literature has examined caregiver socialization of children's emotions in culturally diverse groups and has shown both similarities and variation in parental emotion-related socialization behaviors. Preliminary findings also suggest that caregiver emotion socialization behaviors that are associated with adaptive child outcomes in White middle-class families (with whom a bulk of the emotion socialization research is conducted) may not be related to adaptive child functioning in other cultural groups. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework that extends Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) model and unpacks aspects of culture that help explain the variation in caregiver emotion socialization processes and in the relation between caregiver emotion socialization and child socio-emotional functioning across cultural groups. Within the context of this framework, we systematically review published studies of caregiver emotion related socialization behaviors in culturally diverse families for children between preschool-age to adolescence, with a focus on their implication for child well-being. Gaps in the existing literature are identified, and directions for future research are outlined.

AB In the present study, we sought to examine response trajectories to brief (11-week) school-based homework interventions and factors that may help schools predict responses. Participants included 222 middle-school students (72% boys; M-age = 12.00 years, SD = 1.02) who had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and had received either a contingency-management or skills-based intervention for homework problems. Both interventions included 16 20-min student meetings with a school counselor and two parent meetings. Trajectories of response for ratings of homework problems and assignment completion were examined from baseline to a 6-month follow-up using growth-mixture models. Baseline variables routinely measured in school settings, including grade-point average (GPA), math and reading achievement, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms, were examined as predictors of treatment-response trajectories. The majority of students (68-81%) showed positive treatment response across outcomes. However, trajectories of students who did not respond to intervention were identified for each outcome. Baseline GPA significantly predicted trajectories for all outcomes and achievement scores significantly predicted trajectories of teacher-reported homework performance and parent-reported homework problems, such that youth with relatively higher baseline GPAs and achievement were most likely to respond. In contrast, neither externalizing nor internalizing symptoms were significant predictors of response trajectories. Schools can use GPA and academic-achievement data to determine whether brief school-based interventions for homework problems are likely to succeed. Students with ADHD who display severe academic impairment (i.e., GPA lower than 2.0 at baseline) may benefit from a more long-term, intensive intervention.

AB Research on parental rearing dimensions faced ethnocentric criticism for mainly focusing on adolescents in Western industrialized countries. Over the past decade, the phenomenon of anxious parenting, so called helicopter parenting, gained attention in popular media as well as scholarly publications in addition to support and psychological control. Whether these parenting dimensions, which were associated with different health outcomes in adolescents, were only occurring in the Western world or are visible cross-culturally, has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, it is unclear whether these links exist also for adolescents from other parts of the world. Additionally, the involvement of fathers in child rearing continues to be neglected in adolescent psychopathology research. The current cross-cultural study tested the association of maternal and paternal rearing dimensions with youth internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in a sample of 2415 adolescents (56% female, 15.33 years, SD=0.61) from eight countries (Argentina, France, Germany, Greece, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, and Turkey). Hierarchical regression models showed that internalizing symptomatology was associated with mothers' support, psychological control, and anxious rearing as well as fathers' psychological control up and above predictors like country and mother's level of education. For predicting externalizing symptomatology, mother's anxious rearing, mother's psychological control, and father's support as well as father's psychological control were significant up and above adolescents' gender, standard of living, and country. To conclude, across countries, anxious rearing and psychological control experienced from both parents were substantially linked with adolescent mental health.

AB Parents and children with high negative emotionality may be more likely to provide and receive non-supportive contingencies, respectively. However, no study has examined child and parent negative emotionality in the same study and explored whether the link between child and parent negative emotionality may exist in part because of parental emotion socialization. The present study was designed to explore the link between the negative emotionality of mothers and their adolescent children and the potential mechanisms for this similarity. Maternal emotion socialization was explored as a mediator between maternal and adolescent negative emotionality, and between maternal negative emotionality and adolescent internalizing symptoms. Participants were mothers (M age=30.47) with their children at two time points: preschool (Time 1; M age=4.55 years old) and adolescence (Time 2; M=13.73), with 81 boys and 94 girls. Negative emotionality was measured using a questionnaire, with mothers reporting for herself and her child. Maternal emotion socialization was measured by mothers' self-report of their contingencies to their adolescent child's negative emotions: 1) Punish; 2) magnify; 3) ignore; 4) override; and 5) support. The results revealed that the maternal punishing of the adolescent's negative emotions was a mediator between concurrent mother negative emotionality and adolescent negative emotionality, such that higher mother negative emotionality was associated with more punishing, and more punishing was associated with higher adolescent negative emotionality, controlling for previous levels of maternal and child negative emotionality. Furthermore, being supportive of a child's negative emotions was negatively associated with concurrent levels of adolescent internalizing symptoms, while magnifying a child's emotions held a marginal positive association, controlling for previous levels of internalizing symptoms. The results highlight the importance of considering maternal emotion socialization strategies, even into adolescence, for a more comprehensive understanding of children's emotional well-being. The findings have implications for developing and implementing emotion-based parenting interventions.

AB There is growing recognition that clinical and developmental outcomes will be optimized by interventions that harness strengths in addition to ameliorating deficits. Although empirically-supported methods for identifying strengths are available for children and adolescents, this framework has yet to be applied to emerging adulthood. This study evaluates the nature of the Five Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD) - character, confidence, competence, connection, and caring - in a sample of emerging adults from six universities (N=4654; 70% female; 81% White). Historically, PYD has been modeled as either separate correlated factors or a second-order factor structure. More recently, the bifactor model has been recommended to determine the degree to which PYD is unidimensional versus multidimensional. The present study examined the multidimensionality of PYD by comparing the model fit of a one-factor, five-correlated factor model, and second-order factor structure with a bifactor model and found support for the bifactor model with evidence of invariance across sex. Criterion validity was also assessed using three criterion measures particularly relevant for adjustment during emerging adulthood: anxiety, depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties. PYD and the residual Cs tended to correlate negatively with indicators of maladaptive development. Future directions including applications of the PYD framework as a measure of thriving across emerging adulthood are discussed.

AB Experiences of traditional victimization often co-occur with cyber victimization in adolescence but are not always controlled for when considering how cyber victimization is uniquely related to internalizing and externalizing symptoms. This is particularly problematic in longitudinal studies that attempt to determine the longitudinal associations between cyber victimization and internalizing symptoms, and between cyber victimization and externalizing problems and how these patterns may differ for adolescent boys and girls. In the current study, traditional victimization was controlled to examine the longitudinal sequences of association between cyber victimization and internalizing symptoms, and between cyber victimization and externalizing problems for adolescent boys and girls. Participants included 510 seventh and tenth grade students (M-age=13.7, 61.6% girls, 44% Asian and 30% White) who completed surveys across three academic years in middle and high school. Findings from longitudinal path models suggest that internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems respectively were associated with increases in experiences of cyber victimization (beyond the effect of traditional victimization) both within and across time, particularly for adolescent girls. Efforts to address adolescents' experiences of cyber victimization must consider the vulnerabilities created by adolescents' continued internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems that may differ for boys and girls. Implications for cyber victimization prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

AB Chronotype, or morningness/eveningness, has been associated with adjustment in both children and adolescents. Specifically, eveningness has been linked to adjustment difficulties; however, the mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test whether the associations between eveningness and adjustment difficulties could be explained by an unfavorable impact of eveningness on sleep. Links from chronotype to internalizing problems and problem behaviors via sleep quantity and sleep problems were tested in a sample from the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (N=3485; 48.8% female), both when the participants were children (7 years at T1, 11 at T2) and when they were adolescents (15 years at T1, 18 at T2). The findings provided evidence that eveningness predicted greater sleep problems and lower sleep quantity; however, only sleep problems predicted internalizing problems and problem behaviors. Sleep quantity did not mediate the eveningness-adjustment link, and sleep problems did so only in children. The findings show that sleep problems appear to be more important in explaining the eveningness-adjustment link rather than altered sleep quantity, commonly associated with eveningness.

DT Article
ID IDEAL CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH; PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS; STOP-SIGNAL;
   CHILDREN; RISK; INHIBITION; ADULTHOOD; TASKS; ATTENTION; STRENGTHS
AB BACKGROUND: Research shows that the development of cardiometabolic disease can begin early in life with risk factors accumulating over time, but less is known about protective pathways to positive health. In this study, we use prospective data to test whether childhood assets predict a greater likelihood of being in optimal cardiometabolic health by age 17.
   METHODS: Data are from 3074 participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (mean age = 17.8). Four childhood assets were prospectively assessed via cognitive tests and parent report when children were between ages 8 and 10: strong executive functioning skills, prosocial behaviors, and low levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Cardiometabolic health was assessed at ages 9 and 17 by using a composite dysregulation score derived from multiple biological parameters, including cholesterol, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, insulin resistance, and BMI. Associations between assets and optimal health at age 17 (ie, a dysregulation score of <= 1) were evaluated with Poisson regression models with robust error variances.
   RESULTS: After controlling for covariates (including sociodemographics, correlates of cardiometabolic health, and dysregulation scores at age 9), participants with multiple assets were 1.08 to 1.27 times more likely to be in optimal cardiometabolic health at age 17 compared with those with 0 or 1 asset. Each additional asset conferred a 6% greater likelihood of optimal health over time (relative risk = 1.06 [95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.11]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Childhood assets predicted cardiometabolic health with seemingly cumulative impacts. Identifying early assets may provide novel targets for prevention and elucidate pathways to positive adult health.

AB This study examined whether DHEA and its ratio to cortisol moderated risk for psychopathology among incarcerated youth exposed to childhood maltreatment. Resistance to stress-related psychopathology under adversity was also examined in relation to callous-unemotional (CU) traits, a personality construct characterized by resistance to pathological anxiety and blunted reactivity to threatening stimuli. Participants were 201 ethnically heterogeneous (41.8% White, 35.3% Black, 17.2% Hispanic) adolescent boys (M age = 16.75, SD = 1.15 years) incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility in the South Eastern United States who provided four afternoon saliva samples (later assayed for DHEA and cortisol) and completed self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that childhood maltreatment was associated with greater internalizing problems at lower DHEA concentrations and at higher cortisol-to-DHEA ratios. Conversely, higher DHEA levels and lower cortisol-to-DHEA ratios were associated with greater CU traits, irrespective of maltreatment exposure. CU traits did not attenuate levels of psychopathology in maltreated youth. Findings inform biosocial models of how exposure to parental maltreatment in early life contributes to risk and resilience through mechanisms associated with adaptive environmentally sensitive biological systems and processes.

AB ObjectiveComplex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) will be introduced in ICD-11 and comprises symptoms of PTSD and disturbances in self-organisation (DSO). The association of trauma with PTSD and DSO is not yet fully understood. We investigated the path from child maltreatment to PTSD and DSO and examined the mediating role of emotion regulation (ER) and adult interpersonal re-victimisation.
   MethodAdult patients (N=193) from a Scottish National Health Service clinic participated in the project. Participants completed measures of life events, ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD, and ER. Path analysis was used to assess possible direct and indirect effects from childhood trauma on current post-traumatic psychopathology.
   ResultsOverall results indicate that the path from child maltreatment to PTSD is a direct one, while the path to DSO is indirectly mediated by ER.
   ConclusionsFuture research should address the potentially beneficial effect of treatment protocols for CPTSD explicitly aiming at reducing ER difficulties.

AB Background: Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, many people, including children and adolescents, have fled their homes into neighboring countries. Little research exists on the psychosocial adjustment of refugee children and adolescents resettled in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of PTSD and emotion dysregulation in Syrian refugee children and adolescents who resettled in Lebanon and Jordan. It was hypothesized that a combination of pre-trauma variables (age and gender), trauma-specific variables (traumatic events and time spent in host country, and host country), and post-trauma variables (coping strategies, family relationships, and school environment) would be associated with PTSD and emotion dysregulation.
   Participants and Setting: Participants were 1000 Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 7-18 years attending formal and non-formal schools representing various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Methods: The trauma exposure scale, DSM-IV criteria for the assessment of PTSD, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Kidcope, Family relationship scales, and school environment scale were administered in an interview format with children and adolescents at school by two trained psychologists. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict PTSD whereas hierarchical multiple regression was used to predict emotion dysregulation.
   Results: Results indicated that 45.6% of the refugees have developed PTSD with excessive risk for comorbidity with emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation was reported by older refugee children and adolescents. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in refugee children and adolescents who had resettled in Lebanon than for those who had resettled in Jordan. Refugee children and adolescents who were exposed to higher levels of war atrocities evidenced the greatest prevalence of PTSD and emotion dysregulation. PTSD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents varied according to coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. Both decreased significantly with the passage of time spent in host country.
   Conclusions: The results may be used to formulate cognitive behavioral coping interventions that can lead to optimal developmental outcomes in the posttrauma environment.

AB Background: There is limited research on the disclosure experiences of men who have experienced childhood sexual abuse and on how such experiences might impact mental health outcomes.
   Objective: The current study described men's disclosure experiences and examined the role of disclosure characteristics on mental well-being (internalizing and externalizing behaviors, substance use, resilience).
   Participants and setting: Men (N = 253) from across Canada and the U.S. were recruited through websites for males with sexual abuse histories. Men aged 18-59 years anonymously completed an online study on their sexual abuse, disclosure experiences, and mental health outcomes.
   Results: Findings indicated that 77.9% of men disclosed their sexual abuse, although they waited an average of 15.4 years before sharing their experience. Once disclosed, 64.4% of the men reported a positive response (e.g., support), while 35.6% reported a negative response (e.g., blame). Regression analyses indicated that a greater delay in disclosure predicted greater externalizing behaviors (B =.49, p <.05), although this was a small effect (Cohen's f 2 = 0.02). Additional disclosure variables were associated with components of externalizing (aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors) and internalizing (somatic complaints) behaviors.
   Conclusions: These results require replication in future studies. However, they do suggest that efforts need to be undertaken to address the barriers that hinder men from disclosing their sexual abuse and to ensure that men are supported once they disclose.

AB Background Systematic reviews of quantitative research on the effects of childhood epilepsy have established its association with higher levels of psychiatric diagnosis, externalizing and internalizing problems, lower health-related quality of life, social competence, and poorer academic achievements, compared with their peers. However, much less is known about young people's experiences of living with epilepsy and its impact on their development from their own perspectives. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 young people aged between 13 and 16 years. Participants were recruited as part of a larger mixed methods study examining individual and family influences on outcomes for young people with epilepsy. These young people attended an epilepsy clinic in KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. The framework approach to data management and analyses involved both inductive and deductive generation of themes. Results Findings from young people's interviews provided in-depth descriptions of stressful circumstances encountered. Interconnectedness between severity of the impairment and its impact on key developmental tasks, such as independence, autonomy, and social development, were emphasized. Seizures and illness-related demands disrupted their day-to-day functioning and challenged their abilities to meet these tasks. In addition to these impairment effects, young people's experiences of social exclusion were also affected by social and environmental factors, which act as systemic barriers to participation. In turn, this has an effect on their self-esteem. Nevertheless, young people reported positive experiences, such as support from both family and friends, which served as protective factors against the stress of living with a chronic medical condition. Conclusion The demands of epilepsy affect various domains of young people's lives. In order to obtain a holistic understanding of young people's inclusion or exclusion to participation, it is necessary to consider impairment effects, barriers to doing, and barriers to being.

AB This study examined infant cortisol secretion as a moderator of the association between mother-infant attachment security at age 17 months and child behavior at age 5 years. A longitudinal community sample of 96 mother-child dyads participated in the strange situation procedure (SSP) at age 17 months. Cortisol was collected at baseline, and at 20 and 40 min post-SSP. Maternal reports of child behavior were collected at age 5 years. Results revealed that the associations between nonsecure mother-infant attachment and higher total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior were stronger for infants with high cortisol secretion, relative to infants with low cortisol secretion. The model of interaction differed depending on the outcome, with diathesis-stress explaining variance in total as well as internalizing behavior, and with differential susceptibility explaining variance in externalizing behavior. These findings augment our understanding of risk and resilience to the impact of the early rearing environment on later psychopathology.

AB Adolescents in the United States live amid high levels of concentrated poverty and increasing income inequality. Poverty is robustly linked to adolescents' mental health problems; however, less is known about how perceptions of their social status and exposure to local area income inequality relate to mental health. Participants consisted of a population-representative sample of over 2,100 adolescents (ages 10-16), 395 of whom completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study. Participants' subjective social status (SSS) was assessed at the start of the EMA, and mental health symptoms were measured both at baseline for the entire sample and daily in the EMA sample. Adolescents' SSS tracked family, school, and neighborhood economic indicators (vertical bar r vertical bar ranging from .12 to .30), and associations did not differ by age, race, or gender. SSS was independently associated with mental health, with stronger associations among older (ages 14-16) versus younger (ages 10-13) adolescents. Adolescents with lower SSS reported higher psychological distress and inattention problems, as well as more conduct problems, in daily life. Those living in areas with higher income inequality reported significantly lower subjective social status, but this association was explained by family and neighborhood income. Findings illustrate that adolescents' SSS is correlated with both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems, and that by age 14 it becomes a unique predictor of mental health problems.

AB Research conducted over the past decade indicates that difficulties in emotion regulation are more prevalent among those who have been abused than in individuals with no such experiences. Emotional Schema Therapy (EST), which is an integration of cognitive and metacognitive models as well as acceptance-based approaches, specifically targets content of beliefs about emotions and dysfunctional coping strategies to deal with difficult emotions. This study provides an initial evaluation of the efficacy of EST in addressing difficulties in six dimensions of emotion regulation in women with a history of child abuse or neglect. The statistical population consisted of all female residents of Isfahan, Iran, aged above 18years. Five hundred volunteer women responded to a Child Abuse and Neglect questionnaire. Individuals who had higher scores on this questionnaire were invited to participate in the research project. Thirty volunteer participants were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups (n(1)=n(2)=15). The intervention was a 15-session group therapy consisting of cognitive, behavioral, experiential, and mindfulness techniques. Participants completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) 2weeks before and after the treatment and at 2months follow-up. The same assessments were conducted with the control group. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U Test, Friedman Test, and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Results showed that EST significantly improved acceptance of emotional responses, goal-directed behaviors, impulse control, and adaptive emotion regulation strategies in both post-test and follow-up assessments in the experimental group. In contrast, the control group did not have any significant changes on these variables. Significant changes were not detected for lack of emotional awareness and lack of emotional clarity in both groups. These findings indicate that EST is a potential effective treatment to improve aspects of emotion regulation in women with a history of child abuse and neglect.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) consists of symptoms of slowness, sluggishness, daydreaming, and low motivation. SCT has been linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing symptoms. and daytime sleepiness. Although there is clear evidence that SCT and ADHD symptoms are distinct constructs, the distinction between SCT, anxiety/depression, and daytime sleepiness is less clear. Prior research has largely relied upon parent-report to evaluate potential overlap between SCT, sleep, and anxiety/depression. despite best practice suggesting that self-report should be used to assess internalizing symptoms. The present study used adolescent self-report to evaluate whether SCT was distinct from daytime sleepiness, anxiety. and depression. Participants were 285 middle school students comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD. Ten confirmatory factor analyses were conducted: four 1-factor models, three 2-factor models, one 3-factor model, one 4-factor model, and a higher order model. Results showed that SCT was indeed distinct from all tested constructs, with the four-factor model including self-report of SCT, anxiety, depression, and daytime sleepiness meeting adequate model fit criteria. All models including SCT as its own factor had improved model fit over models with SCT in a combined factor with another construct. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SCT are discussed.

AB Although low prosocial behavior (LPB) items have been incorporated into youth measures of callousness, it remains unclear from current factor analytic findings whether callous traits and LPB are best operationalized as a common construct, or distinct dimensions. Using data from a population-representative birth cohort (N = 5.463), this study compared 4 latent factor structures for interpersonal callousness (IC; 6 items) and LPB (5 items) at age 13: (a) unidimensional; (b) two-factor; (c) higher-order (with 2 subfactors); and (d) bifactor (1 general and 2 specific residual factors). Alternative models distinguishing positively and negatively worded items were tested for comparative purposes. To assess the external validity of the factors that emerged from the best-fitting model, associations with early parenting styles and psychiatric comorbidities were examined. A bifactor model, achieving invariance for males and females, offered the best fit for these data. However, additional bifactor-specific indices suggested that the specific IC factor did not offer a unique contribution to the total variance over and above the general factor (IC/LPB). Of the remaining factors, IC/LPB was associated with higher levels of harsh parenting, externalizing and internalizing disorder, and social-cognitive difficulties, and lower levels of warm parenting. The LPB factor, meanwhile, was associated with greater social-cognitive difficulties and externalizing disorder, and lower maternal warmth, evoking a phenotype that may be more indicative of the autism spectrum than IC. These findings suggest that the shared variance underlying IC and LPB taps a severe psychiatric phenotype, while the residual variance for LPB may represent a distinct profile of social-cognitive dysfunction.

AB Objective: Trauma exposure is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with youth emotional and behavioral problems. The present study adds to the current literature on trauma exposure and adolescent clinical populations by examining the association between trauma exposure and adolescent self-report of emotional and behavioral problems broadly, including internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in addition to the trauma-specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: This study included 94 female (64%) and male (36%) adolescents, ages 13-19, representing 4 clinical populations: those seeking inpatient psychiatry, outpatient psychiatry, residential substance abuse. and outpatient medical services. Adolescents self-reported trauma history and internalizing, externalizing, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Most adolescents reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event (83%; M = 2.28, SD = 1.83). Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, race/ethnicity, gender, and treatment setting indicated a greater number of types of trauma are associated with externalizing symptoms (beta = .31, p < .01) and PTSD symptoms (beta = .35, p < .01). Conclusion: Trauma is a common experience among adolescents, particularly those presenting for behavioral health services, making trauma-informed care essential in these service delivery settings. Treatment that addresses adolescent risk behaviors and prevents recurrent trauma may be particularly important given the negative impact of multiple traumatic events on developing adolescents.

AB Objective: Autonomy-connectedness (AC), the adult capacity for self-governance while being connected to others, reflects the healthy capacity of adults for self-steering. The present study's main aim was to investigate whether childhood stressful life events were associated with psychopathological symptoms in adulthood, but only in people with AC deficits. Method: We estimated path models based on data from several assessment waves, concerning childhood stressful life events, AC, and internalizing psychopathological symptoms (including posttraumatic symptoms) completed by panel members from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel (community sample). Results: We found positive associations between AC deficits and childhood stressful life events, on one hand, and psychopathological symptoms in adulthood, on the other hand, as well as between childhood stressful life events and the AC component Sensitivity to Others. Importantly, we found that the association between childhood stressful life events and trauma-related hyperarousal symptoms was strongest in individuals with low levels of the AC components Self-Awareness and Capacity for Managing New Situations (moderation). Childhood stressful life events also interacted with Self-Awareness in predicting general mental health symptoms. All effect sizes were small. Conclusions: Deficits in AC, particularly regarding Self-Awareness and Capacity for Managing New Situations. may represent a vulnerability factor for developing trauma-related psychopathology. Enhancing AC may be a beneficial treatment approach for trauma-related psychopathology.

AB Early intervention and prevention services for students at risk of emotional and behavioral problems are increasingly plentiful in the schools. However, recent reviews have revealed gaps in the literature regarding supports for students with internalizing problems. This gap has set precedent for the development of novel Tier 2 interventions that specifically address internalizing behavior problems. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a novel, targeted intervention for elementary students who are at risk of internalizing problems: the Resilience Education Program (REP). REP is founded upon a social-ecological framework, integrating small-group cognitive-behavioral instruction with a modified check-in/check-out procedure. The current study employed a multiple-baseline single-case design with three student participants at risk of internalizing concerns. Visual analysis of direct observation data and single-case effect size estimates indicated that the REP intervention resulted in the decrease in internalizing behaviors and an increase in social engagement relative to baseline levels for two of three participants. Findings were further supported in that the changes noted in observational data were also partially confirmed by teacher ratings. Limitations of this study and future directions for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB We designed a cross-sectional study to examine the association between sleep and behavior problems in toddlers and preschoolage children with epilepsy. We found that 71 (78.9%) children slept less than 10 hours in a 24-hour period according to the actigraphy, with 75 (83.3%) children waking for more than an hour during nocturnal sleep. Twenty-five (27.8%) children usually or sometimes had an inconsistent bedtime, and 24 (26.7%) did not sleep the same amount each day. Twenty-nine (32.2%) and 18 (20.0%) children had an internalizing and externalizing problem in clinical range, respectively. Sleep anxiety was significantly (p < .01) associated with increased internalizing and externalizing problems, even after the relevant epilepsy variables were controlled for. Findings from our study suggest that screening of sleep and behavior problems should be part of routine epilepsy care to identify children with problematic sleep and unrecognized sleep disorders and those at risk of behavioral dysfunction.

AB Peer victimization is strongly associated with depression and anxiety symptoms; however, not all victimized youth experience these internalizing symptoms. Accordingly, factors that contribute to these associations need to be examined. The current study examined the potential moderating role of sleep in the associations between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms in a middle childhood sample, as this developmental stage marks a period when children are at increased risk for both poor quality sleep and peer victimization. Participants were 293 elementary school children (51.5% female, 8-12years old). Children self-reported on sleep quality, two forms of peer victimization (i.e., relational and overt), and anxiety and depression symptoms. Results indicated that sleep quality was negatively correlated with both depressive and anxious symptoms as well as both forms of victimization. Additionally, both forms of victimization were positively correlated with depressive and anxious symptoms. Moreover, poor sleep quality was found to exacerbate the link between relational victimization and depressive symptoms during middlechildhood. Findings have implications for targeting sleep with victimized youth to prevent depressive symptoms.

AB Emotion dysregulation is associated with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and may contribute to the functional impairment experienced by people with this disorder. The present study addressed the following questions: 1) Does emotion dysregulation mediate the relationship between ADHD and key domains of functioning in adults with ADHD?, and, 2) If so, which emotion regulation strategies might further explain this relationship? 159 participants (59 ADHD, 100 non-ADHD) were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants completed a variety of online self-report measures assessing ADHD symptoms, emotion regulation deficits and strategies, symptoms of depression and anxiety, relationship satisfaction, and overall functional impairment. Deficits in emotion regulation mediated the relationship between ADHD and internalizing symptoms, relationship satisfaction, and overall functional impairment. In exploratory analyses, avoidance mediated the relationship between ADHD and deficits in emotion regulation, but reappraisal and suppression did not. Serial mediation analyses indicated that the indirect effects of avoidance alone, apart from deficits in emotion regulation, partially explained the relationship between ADHD and nearly all outcomes. These results are consistent with past literature indicating that emotion regulation problems help explain the presence of depressive symptoms and romantic relationship impairment in adults with ADHD, and add that anxiety symptoms, poorer friendship quality, and greater functional impairment also may be influenced by emotion regulation problems. This study also identifies a specific emotion regulation strategy - avoidance - as a potential contributor to these outcomes. Future work should investigate contexts in which avoidant coping is most problematic so that interventions can be adapted accordingly.

AB Co-occurring internalizing symptoms are common and important to assess in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One frequently used child self-report measure of internalizing symptoms is the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS), yet the psychometric properties of the RCADS remain unexamined in children referred for ADHD specifically. The present study evaluated the RCADS in 117 children (ages 8-12; 66% male) evaluated for suspected ADHD at an ADHD specialty clinic (83% met criteria for ADHD). In addition to the RCADS, children completed measures of social anxiety and depression. Parents completed the RCADS-Parent Version (RCADS-P) in addition to other measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Children and parents both completed a measure of aggression. Factor structure, reliability, and convergent/discriminant validity of the RCADS were examined. Results supported the six-factor structure of the child-report RCADS (Separation Anxiety, Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder). The RCADS demonstrated adequate reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity with other child ratings. The total anxiety score on the RCADS also demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity with parent measures, though the depression score on the RCADS did not. Findings provide preliminary psychometric support for the RCADS in children referred for ADHD.

AB ObjectiveUnderstanding factors that impact child adjustment is imperative. Parental adjustment, parenting behaviors, and environmental factors (e.g., child routines) have been linked to child behavior. In clinical child populations, these factors are particularly important given the increased demands the child's disorder often places on caregivers. Furthermore, children in clinical populations often engage in increased levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors both related to and in addition to the core symptoms of their disorder. Two such clinical child populations are Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).PurposeThe first goal of the present study was to elucidate parental and environmental factors that predicted child behavior in ADHD and ASD. Based on Sameroff's Transactional Model of Development (2009), it was hypothesized that parental adjustment, parenting behaviors and child routines would collectively predict child behavior. A second goal was to examine differences in patterns of association between ADHD and ASD groups. Due to differences in the core symptoms of each disorder, it was hypothesized that the strength of associations would vary between groups.MethodResearchers examined the impact of parental adjustment, parenting behaviors, and child routines on internalizing and externalizing child behavior using parent-report measures (CBCL, CRQ, HSCL-25, APQ) of children ages 6 to 12.ResultsResults indicated that for both groups, poor parental adjustment directly predicted externalizing child behavior and indirectly through harsh/disengaged parenting behavior. Fewer warm/supportive parenting behaviors predicted internalizing behavior, and more harsh/disengaged parenting predicted externalizing behavior. Higher levels of child routines predicted internalizing behavior for both groups but had a significantly stronger effect for children with ASD than ADHD.Clinical SignificanceFindings have important implications for interventions on several levels (e.g., parental adjustment, parenting behaviors, and environmental supports) in both the ADHD and ASD populations.

AB ObjectivesPrevious literature highlights attachment security as a key antecedent of early affective regulation that is frequently associated with positive socioemotional outcomes in early childhood. Less is known of attachment in adolescence, particularly within underserved, stress-exposed families. The current study investigated relations among adolescents' secure base knowledge (an indicator of secure attachment), internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and stress and trauma exposure.MethodsParticipants were 83 inner-city adolescents (ages 13-18 years; 72.3% African American) and one of their primary caregivers (75.9% biological mothers). Secure base knowledge was assessed utilizing the Attachment Script Assessment (ASA).ResultsAfter controlling for adolescents' exposure to potentially stressful or traumatic events, secure base knowledge uniquely predicted fewer internalizing, but not externalizing, problems. Analyses controlled for youth receptive vocabulary, age, and gender.ConclusionsThis study provides further evidence that youth attachment security contributes uniquely to fewer youth internalizing problems even within the context of numerous contextual risks.

AB ObjectivesEmotion regulation is thought to be an important transdiagnostic process across internalizing disorders in youth, and the regulation of emotions is believed to play a central role in both adaptive and maladaptive development. Several preventive interventions focus on improving children's emotion regulation skills, but research regarding the outcomes of emotion regulation skills are scarce.MethodsWe therefore investigated whether a new transdiagnostic indicated prevention intervention for anxiety and depressive symptoms, the EMOTION program, improves emotion regulation skills as reported by parents of children aged 8-12 years. Data from a large national cluster randomized control trial (RCT) study, Coping Kids, performed in Norway were used, including data from 601 children and their parents.ResultsUsing mixed models, we found a decrease in dysregulation of emotions (=.06, CI=(0.00 to .11), p=.040) and an increase in emotion regulation (=.11, CI=(0.05 to .17) p<.001) in the intervention group compared to the control group.ConclusionsThe EMOTION intervention has a potential positive effect on children's emotional regulation skills. One opportunity in transdiagnostic interventions lies in targeting common underlying processes in internalizing disorders and thereby reaching a larger proportion of the youth population than is possible with single-disorder approaches.

AB ObjectivesWith the introduction of co-parenting, Korean society has begun demanding that fathers share child-rearing responsibilities. In the present study, we examined the association between fathers' parenting self-efficacy and children's behavioral problems via fathers' parenting behavior, after controlling for mothers' parenting self-efficacy, to clearly identify the importance of fathers in child rearing.MethodWe analyzed data from 1,463 children and their fathers, which were available from the 2014 Panel Study on Korean Children, by employing structural equation modeling.ResultsThe results were as follows. First, the results revealed that there was a significant association between fathers with parenting self-efficacy and both warm and positive controlling parental behaviors. Second, warm parental behavior was significantly associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems, while fathers' positive controlling behavior was not linked to children's behavioral problems. Third, fathers' parenting self-efficacy had significant indirect effects on both internalizing and externalizing problems via warm parental behavior.ConclusionsThese findings imply the importance of the role of fathers in the family, father-child relationships for child development, and fathers' parenting self-efficacy in child rearing.

AB Background Intervention on adolescent bullying is reliant on valid and reliable measurement of victimization and perpetration experiences across different behavioural expressions. Aims This study developed and validated a survey tool that integrates measurement of both traditional and cyber bullying to test a theoretically driven multi-dimensional model. Sample Adolescents from 10 mainstream secondary schools completed a baseline and follow-up survey (N = 1,217; M-age = 14 years; 66.2% male). Methods The Bullying and cyberbullying Scale for Adolescents (BCS-A) developed for this study comprised parallel victimization and perpetration subscales, each with 20 items. Additional measures of bullying (Olweus Global Bullying and the Forms of Bullying Scale [FBS]), as well as measures of internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality, were used to further assess validity. Results Factor structure was determined, and then, the suitability of items was assessed according to the following criteria: (1) factor interpretability, (2) item correlations, (3) model parsimony, and (4) measurement equivalence across victimization and perpetration experiences. The final models comprised four factors: physical, verbal, relational, and cyber. The final scale was revised to two 13-item subscales. The BCS-A demonstrated acceptable concurrent and convergent validity (internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality), as well as predictive validity over 6 months. Conclusions The BCS-A has sound psychometric properties. This tool establishes measurement equivalence across types of involvement and behavioural forms common among adolescents. An improved measurement method could add greater rigour to the evaluation of intervention programmes and also enable interventions to be tailored to subscale profiles.

AB Many studies have established a link between foster care placement instability and child behavioral problems. Evidence-based interventions for behavioral problems, however, are often unavailable to children in foster care given challenges of recruiting behavioral health providers, sustaining funding, and engaging families in intensive interventions. This pilot study, therefore, sought preliminary data on the effectiveness of a novel brief intervention, Child-Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE), to decrease behavioral problems in children entering foster care. CARE, a trauma-informed 6-hr training, was implemented at two foster care agencies. Nineteen children, aged 3 to 8 years, newly entering foster care whose caregivers were exposed to CARE were compared with 28 historical comparison children from the same foster care agencies. Child behavioral problems were assessed at baseline and follow-up using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Adjusted CBCL change scores revealed greater improvements in externalizing and internalizing behaviors from baseline to follow-up among children in the CARE group compared with the historical comparison group (all ps <= .05). The effect was concentrated in younger children. Thus, CARE showed promise in improving parent-reported child behavior problems. The effectiveness of CARE needs to be further evaluated as it is replicated within child welfare systems.

AB The aim of the study is to examine the relationships between early adolescents' low effortful control, middle adolescents' internalizing problems and late adolescents' Internet abuse, focusing on the mediating role that middle adolescents' internalizing problems may play in the relationship between early adolescents' low effortful control and late adolescents' Internet abuse. The study followed a sample of 482 adolescents (245 boys and 237 girls) from early adolescence (wave 1; mean age = 14.76, SD = 0.63), through middle adolescence (wave 2; mean age = 15.77, SD = 0.61), to late adolescence (wave 3; mean age = 17.88, SD = 0.57). The participants completed self-report questionnaires on temperament in wave 1 and on internalizing problems and Internet abuse in all three waves. Data from the mediation model showed that internalizing problems in middle adolescence mediated the relationship between low effortful control in early adolescence and Internet abuse in late adolescence.

AB The current study examined the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reactivity (a physiological indicator of stress) in early infancy as a mediator of the relationship between maternal postpartum depression and toddler behavior problems. Participants were 137 at-risk mothers and their children participating in a longitudinal study of intergenerational transmission of risk. Mothers' depression was measured five times during the infants' first 18 months. Infant cortisol was collected during a social stressor (the still-face paradigm) when infants were 6 months old, and mothers reported on toddlers' internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 18 months. Among this sample of high-risk mother-infant dyads, early postpartum depression predicted atypical infant cortisol reactivity at 6 months, which mediated the effect of maternal depression on increased toddler behavior problems. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Background: Preterm births rates of infants with very low birth weight (VLBW < 1500 g) are increasing. Prematurity poses several risks for emotional child development, e.g., internalizing symptoms. Our understanding of this condition in young children is limited, for at preschool age, symptoms have mostly been assessed from the mother's perspective only.
   Methods: As part of the longitudinal HaFEn cohort-study in Hamburg, Germany, we measured the level of internalizing symptoms in VLBW and term preschoolers as well as predictors from four informants' perspectives: mother, father, teacher, and child. A multilevel model was constructed to examine predictors of internalizing symptoms. n = 104 VLBW and n = 79 term children were included.
   Results: From both their parents' perspective, children with VLBW had a significantly higher level of internalizing symptoms. From the teacher's and child's own perspectives, there were no significant mean group differences. In the multilevel analyses, the results were different regarding the four perspectives. VLBW did not predict internalizing symptoms. From mother's perspective, her own postpartum psychological distress, and from father's perspective, his postpartum and current psychological distress predicted a higher level of internalizing symptoms in their offspring. From teacher's perspective, socio-economic status predicted internalizing symptoms.
   Limitations: The sample size was relatively small. Exclusion criteria and drop out of families could have created some selection bias.
   Conclusions: Our findings point to the importance of early identification of parental postpartum psychological distress given the potential for later internalizing symptoms in their children or the perception of their offspring as vulnerable and symptomatic, which may also impact the child's development.

AB Youth with conduct problems present frequently depressive symptoms. Academic skills are thought to be a mediating variable by which conduct problems could lead to depressive symptoms. No studies have longitudinally compared this model among school-aged boys and girls with different levels of conduct problems. Cascade models were tested to examine the relations between conduct problems, depressive symptoms, and academic skills over a 3-year period, and whether the severity of conduct problems and gender moderated these associations. Participants were 381 children presenting early clinically significant conduct problems (44.9% female) and 363 children with low levels of conduct problems (48.8% female). While results did not show any cascade or indirect associations, they revealed different direct links between conduct problems or depressive symptoms and academic skills in the four groups. These findings suggest that conduct problems severity and gender differences should be considered in treatment planning.

AB BackgroundWarts Hypogammaglobulinemia Immunodeficiency Myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, severe chronic neutropenia, with lymphopenia, monocytopenia and myelokathexis which is caused by heterozygous gain of functions mutations of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). WHIM patients display an increased incidence of non-hematopoietic conditions, such as congenital heart disease suggesting that abnormal CXCR4 may put these patients at increased risk of congenital anomalies.Studies conducted on CXCR4 and SDF-1-deficient mice have demonstrated the role of CXCR4 signaling in neuronal cell migration and brain development. In particular, CXCR4 conditional knockout mice display abnormal cerebellar morphology and poor coordination and balance on motor testing.ResultsIn order to evaluate a possible neurological involvement in WHIM syndrome subjects, we performed neurological examination, including International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, cognitive and psychopathological assessment and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in 6 WHIM patients (age range 8-51years) with typical gain of functions mutations of CXCR4 (R334X or G336X). In three cases (P3, P5, P6) neurological evaluation revealed fine and global motor coordination disorders, balance disturbances, mild limb ataxia and excessive talkativeness. Brain MRI showed an abnormal orientation of the cerebellar folia involving bilaterally the gracilis and biventer lobules together with the tonsils in four subjects (P3, P4, P5, P6). The neuropsychiatric evaluation showed increased risk of internalizing and/or externalizing problems in four patients (P2, P3, P4, P6).ConclusionsTaken together, these observations suggest CXCR4 gain of function mutations can be associated with cerebellar malformation, mild neuromotor and psychopathological dysfunction in WHIM patients.

AB From examinations of the literature on the influence that exposure to violence and coping strategies have on delinquent behavior and emotional outcomes, this study addresses the association between violent victimization and the moderating effects of coping strategies among 500 African-American adolescents who exhibit both externalizing behaviors such as delinquency and internalizing symptoms, including anxiety and depression. The investigation examines the development of the aforementioned adjustment problems in response to victimization, and the findings indicate a relationship between the specific indices of victimization, including peer violence, and the symptomatology and coping mechanisms utilized by the youth in this study. Suggestions for future research in this area are discussed.

AB This study examines the effects of puberty and sex on the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of brain networks, with a focus on the default-mode network (DMN). Consistently implicated in depressive disorders, the DMN's function may interact with puberty and sex in the development of these disorders, whose onsets peak in adolescence, and which show strong sex disproportionality (females > males). The main question concerns how the DMN evolves with puberty as a function of sex. These effects are expected to involve within- and between-network iFC, particularly, the salience and the central-executive networks, consistent with the Triple-Network Model. Resting-state scans of an adolescent community sample (n = 304, male/female: 157/147; mean/std age: 14.6/0.41 years), from the IMAGEN database, were analyzed using the AFNI software suite and a data reduction strategy for the effects of puberty and sex. Three midline regions (medial prefrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate), within the DMN and consistently implicated in mood disorders, were selected as seeds. Within- and between-network clusters of the DMN iFC changed with pubertal maturation differently in boys and girls (puberty-X-sex). Specifically, pubertal maturation predicted weaker iFC in girls and stronger iFC in boys. Finally, iFC was stronger in boys than girls independently of puberty. Brain-behavior associations indicated that lower connectivity of the anterior cingulate seed predicted higher internalizing symptoms at 2-year follow-up. In conclusion, weaker iFC of the anterior DMN may signal disconnections among circuits supporting mood regulation, conferring risk for internalizing disorders.

AB Social ostracism among the homeless is a prevailing problem, yet few studies have focused on whether internalizing psychopathology moderates the links between feeling ostracized and perceiving threats to fundamental human needs. This study used a person-oriented approach to identify commonly occurring profiles of internalizing psychopathology characterized by symptoms of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression (Low, Medium, and High Internalizers) among homeless participants residing in London, United Kingdom (N = 114; age range = 18-74; M-age = 46; 25% women). Data on perceived ostracism (feeling ignored and daily discrimination) and need-threat (belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and feelings of control) was also collected. Controlling for the effects of age, living arrangement, gender, and time being homeless, feeling ignored was a significant predictor of need-threat, whereas daily discrimination was not. One significant interaction on the links between daily discrimination and need-threat emerged between Low and Medium Internalizers. For Medium Internalizers, high levels of daily discrimination were associated with high levels of need-threat. The effect was similar for High Internalizers and the opposite for Low Internalizers, though it was not significant within those groups. Taken together, these results indicate that differences in patterns of internalizing psychopathology should be taken into account when attempting to make homeless individuals feel more included in their surroundings.

ID CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of parenting style on children's behavior problems after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.
   Methods: Participants were children exposed to the 2011 disaster at preschool age (n = 163). Data were collected from August 2012 to March 2013, and from July 2014 to March 2015 (2 and 4 years, respectively, after the earthquake), thus participants were aged 4-11 years when assessed. Parenting style was assessed by caregivers using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APO), which measures parental involvement, positive parenting, poor monitoring/supervision, inconsistent discipline, and corporal punishment in the second year after the disaster. Behavior problems were assessed by caregivers using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which identifies internalizing, externalizing, and total problems in the second and fourth year after the disaster.
   Results: The results show that corporal punishment in the second year after the disaster had negative influence on CBCL internalizing score (coefficient: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.12-1.45, p = 0.023), externalizing score (coefficient: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.09-1.39, p = 0.025), and total score in the fourth year after the disaster (coefficient: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.16-1.55, p = 0.016), after adjusted for children's age, sex, the number of trauma experiences, maternal education, the number of siblings, temporally housing experience, and CBCL each scores in the second year after the disaster. Other parenting style did not affect children's behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: The result suggests that inadequate rearing after a natural disaster had negative impact on the behavior problems of the affected children in 4 years later of the disaster. Specifically, corporal punishment had negative influence on children's behavior problems.

   3RD-GRADE STUDENTS; CHILDREN
AB Background: 3-7% of all children, adolescents, and adults suffer from dyscalculia. Severe, persistent difficulty performing arithmetical calculations leads to marked impairment in school, at work, and in everyday life and elevates the risk of comorbid mental disorders. The state of the evidence underlying various methods of diagnosing and treating this condition is unclear.
   Methods: Systematic literature searches were carried out from April 2015 to June 2016 in the PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ERIC, Cochrane Library, ICTRP, and MathEduc databases. The main search terms on dyscalculia were the German terms "Rechenstorung," "Rechenschwache, "and "Dyskalkulie" and the English terms "dyscalculia," "math disorder", and "math disability." The data from the retrieved studies were evaluated in a meta-analysis, and corresponding recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of dyscalculia were jointly issued by the 20 societies and associations that participated in the creation of this guideline.
   Results: The diagnosis of dyscalculia should only be made if the person in question displays below-average mathematical performance when seen in the context of relevant information from the individual history, test findings, clinical examination, and further psychosocial assessment. The treatment should be directed toward the individual mathematical problem areas. The mean effect size found across all intervention trials was 0.52 (95% confidence interval [0.42; 0.62]). Treatment should be initiated early on in the primary-school years and carried out by trained specialists in an individual setting; comorbid symptoms and disorders should also receive attention. Persons with dyscalculia are at elevated risk of having dyslexia as well (odds ratio [OR]: 12.25); the same holds for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and for other mental disorders, both internalizing (such as anxiety and depression) and externalizing (e.g., disorders characterized by aggression and rule-breaking).
   Conclusion: Symptom-specific interventions involving the training of specific mathematical content yield the best results. There is still a need for high-quality intervention trials and for suitable tests and learning programs for older adolescents and adults.

AB Background: Early adulthood is a period of increased risk for depression and suicide. Emotional reactivity (a tendency to react to stress with increases in negative affect and maladaptive interpretations of events) is an important risk factor for these outcomes that has been under-studied. We hypothesized that elevated emotional reactivity would be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Further, we hypothesized that experiences of childhood maltreatment would amplify this relationship, whereas the presence of resilience would act as a buffer.
   Methods: 1703 young adults (Mean Age=19.56 years), 71% female) completed well-validated self-report questionnaires at a single time point.
   Results: Higher emotional reactivity was directly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Further, resilience levels significantly moderated the relationships between emotional reactivity and depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Finally, childhood trauma significantly moderated the relationship between emotional reactivity and suicidal thoughts and behaviors only.
   Limitations: This study was cross-sectional in design and relied upon self-report measures only.
   Conclusions: The current study demonstrates an association between emotional reactivity, depressive symptoms, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors during emerging adulthood. Whereas a history of childhood maltreatment may amplify the relationship between emotional reactivity, depression, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, certain qualities associated with resilience may buffer against the effects of emotional reactivity. Future studies can identify the resilience-promoting factors that are most protective and develop and test interventions that can potentially augment those factors.

AB Background: Social inhibition may promote emotional problems in children, but little is known about this disposition in adults. Our research builds on a theory-based model to suggest that adult social inhibition involves distinct behavioral (inhibition), cognitive (sensitivity), and affective (withdrawal) characteristics.
   Methods: A total of 1385 adults completed measures of social inhibition, emotional distress, and social stress. Factor analyses, reliability estimates and regression analyses were used to examine the robustness of our model, and the validity of the 15-item Social Inhibition Questionnaire (SIQ15).
   Results: In Study 1 (N=1180; M-age 46.9 years; 52% women), factor analysis confirmed that behavioral inhibition, interpersonal sensitivity, and social withdrawal reflected distinct facets of social inhibition. Next, we developed the SIQ15 that covers these facets with 5 items each; e.g. has difficulty making contact; expects negative reactions from others; keeps others at a distance. Study 2 (N=209; M-age 20.3 years; 77% women) showed that the SIQ15 and its 5-item Inhibition, Sensitivity and Withdrawal facet scales were internally consistent (Cronbach's a between 0.86/0.94) and stable over time (test-retest between r=0.73/0.78). The SIQ15 facets differentially predicted related inhibition (Behavioral Inhibition Scale), rumination (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and withdrawal (Personality Inventory for DSM-5) scores at 6 months follow-up. Younger age and having no partner were associated with more social inhibition.
   Limitations: Findings are based on self-report; experimental and prospective studies are needed to further validate our inhibition model.
   Conclusions: Inhibition, sensitivity, and withdrawal are distinct manifestations of adult social inhibition that can be reliably assessed with the SIQ15. Research needs to examine how this multidimensional nature of social inhibition has an effect on stress, health, and wellbeing.

AB Research on the inter-relationship between drug abuse and social stress has primarily focused on the role of stress exposure during adulthood and more recently, adolescence. Adolescence is a time of heightened reward sensitivity, but it is also a time when earlier life experiences are expressed. Exposure to stress early in postnatal life is associated with an accelerated age of onset for drug use. Lifelong addiction is significantly greater if drug use is initiated during early adolescence. Understanding how developmental changes following stress exposure interact with sensitive periods to unfold over the course of maturation is integral to reducing their later impact on substance use. Arousal levels, gender/sex, inflammation, and the timing of stress exposure play a role in the vulnerability of these circuits. The current review focuses on how early postnatal stress impacts brain development during a sensitive period to increase externalizing and internalizing behaviors in adolescence that include social interactions (aggression; sexual activity), working memory impairment, and depression. How stress effects the developmental trajectories of brain circuits that are associated with addiction are discussed for both clinical and preclinical studies.

AB Children who experience maltreatment are at well-documented risk for the development of problematic substance use and disorder in adolescence and beyond. This review applies a developmental psychopathology framework to discuss the complex multilevel probabilistic pathways from child maltreatment to substance use and substance use disorder (SUD). We begin with an overview of the myriad vulnerabilities associated with child maltreatment, including the development of substance use and SUD. Prominent pathways that may potentiate liability for SUD are discussed. Specifically, we highlight the robust empirical support for the prominent externalizing pathway of risk, and also discuss the state of the research regarding the internalizing pathway. Consistent with the developmental psychopathology perspective, we then review biological processes such as neuroendrocrine mechanisms, allostatic load, and neurobiological pathways that may underlie child maltreatment risk, as well as discuss broader contextual issues. Elucidating the processes underlying the development of substance use and disorder among children exposed to this form of early adversity is paramount for not only informing developmental theories, but also designing effective prevention and intervention programs. Thus, implications for preventive interventions are provided. Finally, critical next steps for research within the area of child maltreatment and the developmental psychopathology of substance use and SUD are proffered.

AB Research supports cascading relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and academic problems. This constellation of problems is characteristic of early-onset, persistent delinquent [EOPD] youth, and appropriately targeted interventions accounting for this comorbidity may improve outcomes. To investigate these relationships in EOPD youth, we characterized their cross-diagnostic psychopathology and verbal (word-list) learning/memory and evaluated: 1) verbal learning/memory profiles of Withdrawn/Depressed relative to Non-Withdrawn/Depressed youth; 2) cognitive and psychiatric predictors of verbal learning; and 3) emotion regulation as a mediator of psychiatric and cognitive relationships. Results indicated Withdrawn/Depressed youth recalled significantly fewer words during immediate, and some delayed, recall conditions. Less word-learning was predicted by: Withdrawn/Depressed classification, higher trauma-specific re-experiencing symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, weaker executive skills, fewer trauma-avoidance and aggressive symptoms, and earlier alcohol-use onset. Emotion regulation strongly mediated the relationship between verbal learning and psychopathology, but not other cognitive skills, among these youth at high-risk for school dropout. Mental health and education implications are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB School readiness includes a constellation of skills and behaviors, such as social and emotional development, language and literacy, and self-regulation that provide a basis critical for classroom participation and learning. Whereas it has been well-established that students who enter kindergarten with weaknesses in language and literacy are more likely to struggle academically, less research has focused on the variability and educational impact of other foundational learning components, including internalizing and externalizing behaviors, particularly in first grade. This study used latent profile analysis to identify the following four subgroups (profiles) of students, using foundational learning components, in a sample of first graders (n = 324): Emergent Hyperactive, Externalizing, Generally Good Students, and Internalizing. Latent class growth analysis illustrated significant differences in the average rate of growth in literacy skills from the beginning to the end of first grade across the four profiles, after controlling for gender and socioeconomic status. Findings indicated the greatest growth in literacy skills for students in the Externalizing profile and the least amount of vocabulary growth for students in the Emergent Hyperactive profile followed by the Internalizing profile. Educational implications of how researchers and educators might consider students' individual differences across profiles of foundational learning components to inform ways to support development and learning in the classroom are discussed.

AB Background Psychological problems are increasing among adolescents, but little is known about the role of GPs in this area.
   Objectives This study aims to investigate the frequency of GP consultations with a psychological diagnosis in adolescence and predictors for such help seeking.
   Methods Nationwide longitudinal register-based study investigating GP consultations among adolescents aged 13-17 years (N = 123 516) in Norway. First, all GP consultations within the study population were identified from the national GP claims register for 2006-11. Second, adolescents with a first-time consultation with a psychological diagnosis at age 15-16 years were identified, and prior GP consultations, prior somatic diagnoses, parental education and GP and GP-practice characteristics were assessed as possible predictors for seeking help.
   Results From age 13 to 17 years, 15.3% of girls and 13.0% of boys had 1 GP consultation with a psychological diagnosis. In total, 6.8% of girls and 4.8% of boys consulted a GP for the first time with a psychological problem at age 15-16 years. For both sexes, number of prior GP consultations and a prior diagnosis of headache and abdominal pain predicted consulting with an internalizing problem (depression, anxiety and stress). A prior headache diagnosis predicted consulting for behavioural problems. Psychological diagnoses were more often found among adolescents with lower parental education. There were only minor associations with GP characteristics.
   Conclusions Norwegian adolescents often consult a GP and one in seven had a GP-diagnosed psychological problem at age 13-17. Policies to improve mental health care for adolescents should include strengthening of GP services.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) of parents are associated with a variety of negative health outcomes in offspring. Little is known about the mechanisms by which ACEs are transmitted to the next generation. Given that maternal depression and anxiety are related to ACEs and negatively affect children's behaviour, these exposures may be pathways between maternal ACEs and child psychopathology. Child sex may modify these associations. Our objectives were to determine: (1) the association between ACEs and children's behaviour, (2) whether maternal symptoms of prenatal and postnatal depression and anxiety mediate the relationship between maternal ACEs and children's behaviour, and (3) whether these relationships are moderated by child sex. Pearson correlations and latent path analyses were undertaken using data from 907 children and their mothers enrolled the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study. Overall, maternal ACEs were associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during the perinatal period, and externalizing problems in children. Furthermore, we observed indirect associations between maternal ACEs and children's internalizing and externalizing problems via maternal anxiety and depression. Sex differences were observed, with boys demonstrating greater vulnerability to the indirect effects of maternal ACEs via both anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that maternal mental health may be a mechanism by which maternal early life adversity is transmitted to children, especially boys. Further research is needed to determine if targeted interventions with women who have both high ACEs and mental health problems can prevent or ameliorate the effects of ACEs on children's behavioural psychopathology.

AB Objective: Trauma, particularly when experienced early in life, can alter neurophysiologic and behavioral development, thereby increasing risk for substance use disorders and related psychopathology. However, few studies have empirically examined trauma using well-characterized developmental samples that are followed longitudinally.
   Method: The association of assaultive, non-assaultive, and sexual assaultive experiences before 10 years of age with developmental trajectories of brain function during response inhibition was examined by measuring electrophysiologic theta and delta oscillations during no-go and go conditions in an equal probability go/no-go task. Data were drawn from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) prospective cohort, composed of offspring who were aged 12 through 22 years at enrollment from high-risk and comparison families, with follow-ups at 2-year intervals since 2004. In addition, other important predictors of neurophysiologic functioning (eg, substance use, impulsivity, and parental alcohol use disorders) were investigated. Moreover, associations of neurophysiologic functioning with alcohol and cannabis use disorder symptom counts and externalizing and internalizing psychopathology were examined.
   Results: Individuals exposed to sexual assaultive trauma before 10 years of age had slower rates of change in developmental trajectories of no-go frontal theta during response inhibition. Importantly, effects remained significant after accounting for exposure to other traumatic exposures, such as parental history of alcohol use disorder and participants' substance use, but not measures of impulsivity. Further, slower rates of change in no-go frontal theta adolescent and young adult development were associated with increased risk for alcohol use disorder symptoms and internalizing psychopathology, but not for cannabis use disorder symptoms or externalizing psychopathology.
   Conclusion: Childhood sexual assault is associated with atypical frontal neurophysiologic development during response inhibition. This could reflect alterations in frontal lobe development, synaptic pruning, and/or cortical maturation involving neural circuits for inhibitory control. These same areas could be associated with increased risk for young adult alcohol use disorder symptoms and internalizing psychopathology. These findings support the hypothesis that changes in neurocognitive development related to early sexual trauma exposure could increase the risk for mental health and substance use problems in young adulthood.

AB Adolescence and young adulthood is a critical stage when the economic foundations for life-long health are established. To date, there is little consensus as to whether marijuana use is associated with poor educational and occupational success in adulthood. We investigated associations between trajectories of marijuana use from ages 15 to 28 and multiple indicators of economic well-being in young adulthood including achievement levels (i.e., educational attainment and occupational prestige), work characteristics (i.e., full vs part-time employment, hours worked, annual income), financial strain (i.e., debt, trouble paying for necessities, delaying medical attention), and perceived workplace stress. Data were from the Victoria Healthy Youth Survey, a 10-year prospective study of a randomly recruited community sample of 662 youth (48% male; M-age=15.5), followed biennially for six assessments. Models adjusted for baseline age, sex, SES, high school grades, heavy drinking, smoking, and internalizing and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms. Chronic users (our highest risk class) reported lower levels of educational attainment, lower occupational prestige, lower income, greater debt, and more difficulty paying for medical necessities in young adulthood compared to abstainers. Similarly, increasers also reported lower educational attainment, occupational prestige, and income. Decreasers, who had high early use but quit over time, showed resilience in economic well-being, performing similar to abstainers. Groups did not differ on employment status or perceived workplace stress. The findings indicate that early onset and persistent high or increasingly frequent use of marijuana in the transition from adolescent to young adulthood is associated with risks for achieving educational and occupational success, and subsequently health, in young adulthood.

AB Exposure to stressful life events increases risk for both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, but less is known about moderators of the association between stressful life events and psychopathology. The present study examined the influence of stressful life events, psychopathy, and their interaction on internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in 3877 individuals from the community. We hypothesized that (1) exposure to stressful life events would be a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, (2) primary and secondary psychopathy would be differentially associated with internalizing psychopathology, and (3) primary psychopathy would moderate the association between stressful life events and internalizing psychopathology. Confirming existing findings, our results were consistent with the first and second hypotheses. In contrast to our third hypothesis, primary psychopathy was not associated with stressful life events in childhood, inconsistently associated with stressful life events in adolescence, and did not moderate the association between stressful life events and internalizing psychopathology. Furthermore, stressful life events across development were associated with secondary psychopathy and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. We also found similar associations between stressful life events, psychopathy, and psychopathology in females and males. Future studies investigating the impact of stressful life events on psychopathology should include psychopathic traits and stress reactivity.

AB Biological rhythm theories highlight the reciprocal relations between dysregulated circadian patterns and internalizing psychopathology. Chronotype characterizes individuals' diurnal preference, as some exhibit more morningness or eveningness. Previous research suggests that eveningness prospectively predicts depression in adolescence. Anxiety often co-occurs with depression, but little is known about longitudinal, reciprocal associations between chronotype and anxiety, and whether this relationship remains after controlling for depression. We assessed different forms of anxiety (social, panic, separation), positive/negative affect, anxious arousal (from tripartite theory), and depression, in relation to chronotype to better understand the specificity and directionality of associations between chronotype and internalizing problems in adolescence. Community youth participated in three assessment time points: T1, T2 (18-months post-T1), and T3 (30-months post-T1) as part of a larger longitudinal study. Youth completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and chronotype. Regression analyses showed that eveningness: (1) concurrently associated with decreased separation anxiety, elevated symptoms of depression and low levels of positive affect, (2) was prospectively predicted by elevated depression, (3) did not predict later symptoms of anxiety. The reciprocal, prospective relationship between chronotype and internalizing psychopathology is specific to depression during adolescence.

AB Background: Behaviour problems are prevalent among children born very preterm (<= 32 weeks gestation), and have been associated with morphine exposure. Morphine accumulation in the brain is determined by genetic variations related to morphine biotransformation. The objective of the study was to investigate whether morphine-biotransformation genotypes contribute to individual differences in long-term effects of morphine on behaviour at 18 months corrected age (CA).
   Methods: 198 children born very preterm (24-32 weeks gestation) were followed from birth and seen at 18 months CA. Relationships between child behavior (Internalizing, Externalizing on the Child Behavior Checklist), morphine exposure, neonatal clinical variables, and morphine biotransformation gene variants in ABCB1, UGT1A9, UGT 2B7*2, ABCC2, ABCC3, SLCO1B1, CYP3A4, COMT were examined.
   Findings: Neonatal clinical predictors and genotypes accounted for 39% of the overall variance in behaviour. In children with the minor allele of UGT1A9 rs17863783 (marker of UGT1A6*4, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), greater morphine exposure (p = .0011) was associated with more Internalizing behaviour. More Externalizing behaviour was predicted by greater morphine exposure in children with the COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype (p = .0006).
   Interpretation: Genetic variations that affect relative accumulation of morphine in the brain, together with neonatal clinical factors, are differentially related to anxiety and depressive symptoms (internalizing) and to acting out (externalizing) behaviours at 18 months CA in children born very preterm.

AB The Tromso Intervention Study on Preterms (TISP) randomized 146 preterm-born children either to the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP) or to a preterm control group. Previously, significant reductions of child behavior problems and maternal stress have been reported in the intervention group. This follow-up study examines whether the MITP may have affected the longitudinal adaptation between mothers and their children from two until nine years, expressed as associations between different behavioral problems and parenting stress reported by mothers. Associations between internalizing, attentional, and social problems and different dimensions of parenting stress were analyzed in separate models that included effects of time and group status. The MITP did not influence the development of longitudinal associations as no significant three-way interaction (stress*group*time) was found. Significant stress by group interactions was only found in reports on children's attentional problems when analyzed with parent- or interaction-related stress. Mothers who had participated in the MITP reported weaker stress-behavior associations than control mothers. This effect was moderated by two independent variables, namely children's birthweight and years of maternal education for the parent-child difficult interaction stress.

AB Problematic school absenteeism is defined as absence from school occurring with a clinical-level mental disorder. It represents a higher order term for school refusal, school truancy, and the combination thereof and is associated with an increased risk for school dropout, prolonged mental disorders, and unemployment. This article describes the manualized modular treatment of problematic school absenteeism (MT) by a multiprofessional team. The manual was developed to target a broad spectrum of mental disorders characterized by internalizing but also externalizing behavior. The therapeutic focus is on the reintegration into school and on the cognitive behavioral treatment of the mental disorder. The MT is based on a multilevel model of problematic school absenteeism. The treatment is informed by an extensive case-conceptualization and addresses motivational aspects by offering a low-threshold therapeutic design and motivational interviewing. Core interventions are represented in four modules: cognitive behavioral therapy, family counseling, school counseling, and a psychoeducational physical exercise program. A case vignette provides an illustration of the treatment and the specific graduated approach for school reintegration. The current modular approach is discussed in relation to other cognitive-behavioral manuals targeting a broad spectrum of mental disorders or school refusal.

AB Objective: Early pubertal development is associated with negative health and mental health outcomes. Research on the influence of puberty on mental health underscores a need to examine the interplay between puberty and exposure to environmental risk. This study investigates a more rarely studied aspect of girls' environments romantic relationships with boyfriends. Specifically, this study examined sexual partner age and the timing of girls' pubertal development in relation to externalizing and internalizing symptoms among female students attending therapeutic day schools in the United States, a population at elevated risk for negative mental health outcomes.
   Methods: A total of 121 13 to 19-year-old adolescent girls (Mean age = 15.4; SD = 1.5) reported on the relative age of their past 3 sexual partners, their age of pubertal onset, and mental health challenges via clinical assessments of externalizing and internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Forty-three percent of participants qualified for at least one mental health diagnosis. Earlier pubertal onset predicted greater internalizing symptoms, and this effect did not depend on the age of girls' sexual partners. However, early-developing girls who also reported having a sexual partner more than 2 years older than them were at increased risk for externalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Findings underscore that sexual relationships are an important risk factor for early-developing girls already at risk for mental health problems. Early developing girls with older partners may experience stronger social pressure to stay in relationships that expose them to partner violence and delinquency-related pressure, which combine with interpersonal stress to predict externalizing symptoms.

AB Introduction: The ubiquity of technology is reshaping the way teens express themselves and interact with peers. Considering that teens with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience a range of social impairments and that risk behaviors have the potential to be more widespread and damaging online, understanding how teens with ADHD use the Internet is important.
   Methods: The current study included 58 teens (72.4% boys; 13-16 years old) from the United States of America with ADHD. Study aims were to examine these teens' Internet use frequency, preferred online activities, Facebook interactions, and online risk behaviors (i.e., cyberbullying and sexting). Associations between online behaviors and offline symptoms and behaviors were explored to identify potential risk and protective factors.
   Results: Findings suggested that teens with ADHD use technology in similar ways as do the general population of teens described in previous research but appeared at unique risk of cyberbullying behaviors. Offline risks were associated with online risk behaviors. Using Facebook was associated with online risks (e.g., weak online connections) and offline risks (e.g., poorer social skills and more internalizing symptoms).
   Conclusions: Online social platforms permit the exploration of social behaviors via naturalistic observation. It is imperative researchers gain understanding of the increasingly prevalent online social worlds of teens. Such an understanding may enable researchers to formulate effective social interventions for teens with ADHD.

AB This study sought to explore whether creativity in undertaking activities such as free writing, telling a story, crafts, painting, drawing, or drama at age 7 is associated with a lower risk of social and behavioral maladjustment in children at the onset of adolescence. Data from 7558 7-year-olds who were socially and behaviorally "stable" at baseline were analyzed from the nationally representative National Child Development Study. Multinomial regression analyses showed associations between teacher-rated creativity at age 7 and a lower relative risk of social and behavioral instability and maladjustment at age 11. Specifically, the associations were found between moderate and marked creativity and a lower risk of symptoms of internalizing behaviors (including depression and withdrawal), externalizing behaviors (such as restlessness) as well as a lower risk of various nervous symptoms of social and behavioral instability and maladjustment. Associations were independent of social, demographic, educational, parental, academic, and personality covariates, and robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. These results suggest that facilitating engagement with creative activities could be explored further as a way of reducing levels of instability and maladjustment at the onset of adolescence.

AB Introduction: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with known behavioral abnormalities, both internalizing (e.g., anxiety, social withdrawal) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, self-abuse). However, a broad evaluation of behavioral abnormalities in a large cohort is lacking.
   Objective: In this report, we describe profiles of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in individuals evaluated in the multi-center U.S. Rett Natural History Study.
   Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were collected from 861 females with RTT and from 48 females who have MECP2 mutations without meeting criteria for RTT. Standard statistical methods including linear regression evaluated internalizing behavioral components from the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF50) and externalizing components from the Motor Behavioral Assessment (MBA).
   Results: We found mildly to moderately severe internalizing behaviors in nearly all individuals with RTT, while externalizing behaviors were mild and uncommon. Internalizing behavior in RTT was comparable to groups with psychiatric disorders. Participants with mixed (internalizing and externalizing) behaviors were younger and less affected overall, but showed prominent self-injury and worsening internalizing behaviors over time.
   Conclusions: This study revealed that internalizing behaviors are common at a clinically significant level in RTT. Understanding clinical features associated with behavioral profiles could guide treatment strategies. (C) 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is no denying the fundamental role played by parents in the psychosocial development of their childreneither as a liability or as protection against mental health disorders. This study seeks to ascertain, by means of odds ratio statistics (OR), the correlation between parental psychological control and emotional and behavioral disorders. A total of 762 students took part in this study, with an average age of 12.23 years53.8% of whom were girls and 46.2% were boys. Children and adolescents reported their parental psychological control and their emotional and behavioral disorders (i.e., emotional and behavioral problems, internalizing and externalizing problems). Minors who perceive their psychological control as high are 6 times more likely to suffer from internalizing disorders and 4.8 times more likely to develop externalizing disorders. Furthermore, the probability of suffering externalizing disorders is higher among males who perceive a high degree of psychological control. This study breaks new ground on the importance of perceived psychological controlconsidered as a negative form of control by parentsin the emotional and behavioral disorders among children and adolescents.

AB We utilized the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing longitudinal dataset to evaluate associations among a maternal relationship dissolution, childhood sleep, and child development, specifically externalizing and internalizing symptoms, attention and social difficulties, as well as cognitive ability, when children were ages 5 (n = 3590) and 9 (n = 3062). A maternal relationship dissolution was related to poorer child sleep quality at ages 5 and 9. There was evidence of an indirect relation from a maternal relationship dissolution to child development through poor sleep quality when the child was 5 and 9 years old. The implications of this work are discussed.

AB Introduction: Clinical research and studies using animal models have revealed a complex and relatively under-explored interaction between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and alterations in sleep-wake behaviors.
   Objectives: To utilize a structured naturalistic observation-based methodology, consisting of descriptive elements, to provide insight into possible links between altered sleep and disruptive daytime presentations in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). To apply a similar structured behavioral observation protocol in a PAE animal model to compare outcomes from the experimental and clinical studies utilizing naturalistic observational methodology.
   Methods: Forty pediatric patients with FASD (1.8-17.5 yrs, median age 9.4 yrs) and chronic sleep problems were assessed. In the PAE animal model, male offspring from PAE, Pair-Fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed Control (C) groups (n = 8/group) were assessed in the juvenile/preadolescent (23-25 days of age) and adolescent/pubertal (35-36 days of age) periods.
   Results: In the clinical setting, we found that 95% of children with FASD showed disruptive or externalizing behaviors, 73% showed internalizing behaviors, 93% had circadian rhythm sleep disorders, all had chronic insomnia, and 85% had restless sleep, often with tossing/turning/kicking movements indicative of non-restorative sleep with hypermotor events. In the daytime, individuals showed excessive daytime sleepiness as well as hyperactive/hyperkinetic behaviors, an urge-to-move, and involuntary movements suggestive of hyperarousability. Alterations in sleep/wake behaviors in the PAE animal model paralleled the clinical data in many aspects, demonstrating greater sleep latencies, less total time asleep, more total time awake and longer awake bouts, more position changes, more time in transition, and longer transition bouts in PAE compared to PF and/or control animals.
   Conclusions: Thus, our findings provide support for the power and validity of naturalistic observational paradigms in revealing dysregulated sleep-wake behaviors and their association and/or exacerbating relationship with day and nighttime behavioral problems, such as disruptive behaviors, externalizing and internalizing disorders, and daytime sleepiness.

AB Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) experience a variety of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, gaps in academic achievement, and increased rates of dropping out of school. Thus, it is essential that students with EBD receive evidence-based academic and behavioral supports from skilled and knowledgeable teachers to improve student outcomes. Unfortunately, teachers typically receive limited professional development in classroom management practices and other supports targeting the unique needs of students with EBD. In this manuscript, we describe (a) challenges in the field related to supporting students with EBD, (b) current practices in professional development, (c) a multitiered-system-of-support framework for organizing and providing professional development, and (d) the need for more research on efficient and effective professional-development supports for teachers of students with EBD.

AB Objectives To examine co-occurring mental health problems among a population-based sample of high school students in Ontario, Canada, to understand their prevalence, associated risk factors, and relationship with mental health service access and utilization.
   Methods The data were derived from the 2013 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a biennial survey of students attending publicly funded Ontario schools, from a subsample of students who completed both the internalizing and substance use portions of the survey (n = 2945). Rates of co-occurring problems were calculated for the previous 12 months. Service use for students with co-occurring problems was also calculated for the past 12 months. Odds ratios were estimated using binary logistic regression models correcting for the survey design.
   Results In an adjusted model, youth with internalizing symptoms were 2.40 times more likely and youth with substance use problems were 2.24 times more likely to have accessed mental health services during the past 12 months than youth without these problems. Youth with co-occurring internalizing and substance use problems were 6.74 times more likely (95% CI 4.66-9.76, p < 0.001) to have accessed mental health services during the past year compared with youth without co-occurring problems, but only 52.8% of youth with co-occurring problems (95% CI 45.6-59.9%) used mental health services.
   Conclusions The findings suggest that just over half of Ontario students in grades 9 through 12 who have co-occurring internalizing and substance use problems are utilizing mental health services. Further research should examine the factors related to service use in this population in order to better inform policy and program development.

AB Youth who enter foster care are at risk of mental health need, but questions arise as to the validity of their self-reported symptomatology. This study examines the screening validity of the youth-report version of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17) in a child welfare population. Data come from 2389 youth who completed a version of the PSC-17 adapted for youth report, and their biological and foster parents who completed the parent-report version. Youth also completed a shortened version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED). Convergent and discriminant validity of the PSC-17 was assessed using multi-trait multi-method matrices. The PSC-17's internalizing subscale was strongly correlated, attention subscale was moderately correlated, and externalizing subscale was weakly correlated with the SCARED's anxiety and PTSD subscales. Comparing youth and foster parent scores, the PSC-17 had moderate convergent validity and weak/fair discriminant validity. Comparing youth, foster parent, and biological parent scores, the PSC-17 had moderate convergent validity and weak/fair discriminant validity. The current study provides some support for the validity of the PSC-17 for the population of youth in foster care.

AB Children's maladaptive cognitive attributions may elicit affective reactions that contribute to depressive and anxious symptoms. This study investigated cognitive-affective pathways in depressive and anxious symptoms in a sample of 110 prepubertal children, evaluating children's specific appraisals of experiences of parental discipline as well as general attributional style, along with their hopelessness, self-esteem, and shame. Pathways toward depressive and anxious symptoms were tested simultaneously to identify potential unique etiological mechanisms. Results suggested that lower self-esteem strongly contributed to depressive and anxious symptoms, whereas shame related to depression only and hopelessness related to depression only marginally. Additionally, general negative attributional style and low sense of control over discipline related to all three affective elements. Lastly, low sense of discipline control directly predicted depressive symptoms, whereas beliefs that discipline was undeserved directly predicted anxious symptoms. Future work should continue to examine the role of children's discipline-specific attributions, which appear important in internalizing symptoms.

AB Purpose of ReviewPrenatal maternal psychological distress is an established risk factor for the development of psychopathology in offspring. The purpose of this review is to evaluate whether sex differences in fetal responses to maternal distress contribute to sex differences in subsequent psychopathology.Recent FindingsMale and female fetuses respond differently to stress signals. We review recent evidence that demonstrates a sex-specific pattern of association between prenatal maternal distress and pathways associated with risk for psychopathology including offspring hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis regulation, brain development, and negative emotionality.SummaryPrenatal maternal distress exerts sex-specific consequences on the fetus. These differences may contribute to the well-established sex differences in psychopathology and in particular to greater female vulnerability to develop internalizing problems.

AB Mothers who have experienced childhood maltreatment are more likely to have children also exposed to maltreatment, a phenomenon known as intergenerational transmission. Factors in the perinatal period may contribute uniquely to this transmission, but timing effects have not been ascertained. Using structural equation modeling with 1,016 mothers and their 2,032 children in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, we tested the mediating role of postpartum depression between maternal childhood maltreatment and a cascade of negative child outcomes, specifically child exposure to maltreatment, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms: (a) adjusting for later maternal depression, (b) comparing across sex differences, and (c) examining the relative role of maltreatment subtypes. Mothers who had been maltreated as children, especially those who had experienced emotional or sexual abuse, were at increased risk for postpartum depression. In turn, postpartum depression predicted children's exposure to maltreatment, followed by emotional and behavioral problems. Indirect effects from maternal childhood maltreatment to child outcomes were robust across child sex and supported significant mediation through postpartum depression; however, this appeared to be carried by mothers' depression beyond the postpartum period. Identifying and treating postpartum depression, and preventing its recurrence, may help interrupt the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and its sequelae.

AB The current investigation examined if changes in youth internalizing problems as a result of a family group cognitive behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for families with a parent with a history of depression had a cascade effect on youth social problems over 24 months and the bidirectional nature of these effects. One hundred eighty families with a parent with a history of major depressive disorder (M age = 41.96; 88.9% mothers) and a youth age 9 to 15 years (49.4% females; M age = 11.46) participated. Findings from a panel model indicated that, compared to a minimum intervention condition, the FGCB intervention significantly reduced youth internalizing problems at 12 months that in turn were associated with lower levels of social problems at 18 months. Similarly, the FGCB intervention reduced internalizing problems at 18 months, which were associated with fewer social problems at 24 months. Changes in social problems were not related to reductions in subsequent internalizing problems. The findings suggest that reductions in youth internalizing problems can lead to lower levels of social problems. Youth social problems are difficult to change; therefore, targeting internalizing problems may be an effective way to reduce the social problems of children of parents with a history of depression.

AB Evidence on the intergenerational continuity of intimate partner violence (IPV) suggests small to moderate associations between childhood exposure and young adult IPV involvement, suggesting an indirect effects model. Yet, few prospective studies have formally tested meditational mechanisms. The current study tested a prospective (over 9 years) moderated-mediational model in which adolescent psychopathology symptoms (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and combined) mediated the association between exposure to IPV in middle childhood and young adult IPV perpetration. In a more novel contribution, we controlled for proximal young adult partner and relationship characteristics. The sample consisted of n = 205 participants, who were, on average, assessed for exposure to parent IPV at age 12.30 years, adolescent psychopathology symptoms at age 15.77 years, and young adult IPV at 21.30 years of age. Data suggest a small, significant direct path from IPV exposure to young adult perpetration, mediated only through adolescent externalizing. Gender moderation analyses reveal differences in sensitivity to exposure across developmental periods; for males, effects of exposure were intensified during the transition to adolescence, whereas for females, effects were amplified during the transition to adulthood. In both cases, the mediational role of psychopathology symptoms was no longer significant once partner antisocial behavior was modeled. Findings have important implications for both theory and timing of risk conveyance.

AB Research has clearly established the important role of parents in preventing substance use among early adolescents. Much of this work has focused on deviance (e.g., antisocial behavior, delinquency, and oppositional behavior) as a central pathway linking parenting behaviors and early adolescent substance use. This study proposed an alternative pathway; using a four-wave longitudinal design, we examined whether nurturant-involved parenting (Fall sixth grade) was inversely associated with adolescent drunkenness, marijuana use, and cigarette use (eighth grade) through social anxiety symptoms (Spring sixth grade) and subsequent decreases in substance refusal efficacy (seventh grade). Nurturant-involved parenting is characterized by warmth, supportiveness, low hostility, and low rejection. Analyses were conducted with a sample of 687 two-parent families. Results indicated that adolescents who were in families where fathers exhibited lower levels of nurturant-involved parenting experienced subsequent increases in social anxiety symptoms and decreased efficacy to refuse substances, which in turn was related to more frequent drunkenness, cigarette use, and marijuana use. Indirect effects are discussed. Findings were not substantiated for mothers' parenting. Adolescent gender did not moderate associations. The results highlight an additional pathway through which parenting influences youth substance use and links social anxiety symptoms to reduced substance refusal efficacy.

AB This study aims to test whether adolescent negative social interactions mediate the relation between early adolescent self-regulatory capacities and young adult psychopathology, using a fully prospective mediation model. Data were derived from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a large population cohort of Dutch adolescents (n = 962). At age 11, three indicators of self-regulation were assessed: low frustration, high effortful control, and high response inhibition. Negative social interactions between ages 11 and 22 were captured twice using the Event History Calendar. Psychopathology (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems) was assessed at ages 11 and 22. Findings indicate that adolescents' frustration and effortful control but not response inhibition assessed at age 11 are related to both internalizing and externalizing problems at age 22, after controlling for psychopathology at age 11, sex, and socioeconomic status. These associations were partly (about 22%) mediated by the negative social interactions adolescents experienced. Effect sizes were all modest. This study shows that self-regulation is related to subsequent psychopathology in part through its effect on negative social interactions, providing evidence for sequences of self-regulatory capacities, life experiences, and developmental outcomes.

AB Child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral consequences. Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school students (52% boys, M = 10.5 years, range = 6-15) participated in the cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31% (n = 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31% (n = 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing (beta = 0.59, p < .01) and externalizing problems (beta = 0.35, p < .05). However, these associations could only be detected in younger children (ages 6-9), whereas in older children (ages 10-15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and abuse. Our findings suggest that the current age may influence the association between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and/or externalizing problems.

AB Background: Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) has been linked to child/adolescent behavior problems and substance use in several longitudinal cohort studies. It is unclear whether these effects extend into adulthood and influence young adult behavior problems and substance use and, if so, whether they are mediated by childhood and adolescent experiences.
   Methods: These data are from an ongoing longitudinal study of individuals born to women who were recruited early in pregnancy. Trimester-specific data on prenatal drug exposure were obtained. Caregivers and offspring were assessed at delivery and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, and 21 years postpartum. This report is from age 21, when 225 offspring (52% females; 54% African American, 46% Caucasian) reported on behavior problems, emotion regulation, and substance use.
   Results: There were significant direct associations between PCE and early initiation of marijuana, 21-year emotion regulation problems, arrest history, and Conduct Disorder. The relation between PCE and young adult internalizing behavior was mediated by adolescent mood symptoms. The association between PCE and 21-year marijuana use was mediated by early initiation of marijuana use.
   Conclusions: PCE has both direct and indirect long-term associations with young adult development. Using statistical models that considered the complex interrelationships among PCE and adult outcomes, we demonstrated that the direct effects of PCE on young adult emotion regulation problems, arrest history, and Conduct Disorder are not completely explained by earlier adolescent behavior. Moreover, the analyses suggesting mediated pathways from PCE to young adult problems identify crucial variables to target interventions for exposed children and adolescents.

AB Objectives: Difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) may be important in heroin craving in individuals with heroin dependence who have experienced childhood trauma (CT). However, no research has been performed on DER in the context of heroin dependence. The aim of this study was to evaluate direct and indirect relations of CT to the subscales of heroin craving (i.e., heroin thoughts and interference, intention to use heroin and control of its consumption, and resistance to thoughts and decisions to use heroin) via DER dimensions in individuals with a DSM diagnosis of heroin dependence.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 330 males with heroin dependence completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Obsessive-Compulsive Drug Use Scale-Form Heroin (OCDUS-Form Heroin), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS).
   Results: The results revealed that CT had no direct relations to the subscales of heroin craving, but it indirectly was related to all three subscales of heroin craving via one of the DER dimensions named limited access to emotion regulation strategies (Strategies) after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that Strategies may be related to heroin craving in individuals with heroin dependence who have CT. This proposes that treatment and prevention attempts focused on training the use of effective emotion regulation strategies may be useful to reduce heroin craving in individuals with heroin dependence who have experienced a history of CT.

AB BackgroundAdolescents face major developmental tasks such as increasing individuation and establishing autonomy. These developmental tasks increase demands on adolescent self-control, hereby putting youth with poor effortful control at risk for psychopathology. Specific parenting behaviors might be warranted to buffer against this risk.ObjectiveThis study was designed to examine parenting-related risk and protective factors in the associations between effortful control and adolescent psychopathology. We hypothesized that youth with poor effortful control require more parental involvement (i.e., lower autonomy granting) to help complete these developmental tasks and subsequently avoid psychopathology.MethodsVia adolescent self-reports (N=809), associations between effortful control, perceived parenting (i.e., psychological control and autonomy support), and externalizing (i.e., interpersonal aggression and rule-breaking) and internalizing problems (i.e., depressive and anxiety problems) were examined.ResultsRegression analyses supported our hypothesis in boys: higher levels of autonomy support exacerbated the negative association between effortful control and rule-breaking. In contrast, in girls this was the case for lower levels of autonomy support. For both genders, low autonomy support and psychological control exacerbated negative associations between effortful control and internalizing problems. No buffering effects of parenting were found.ConclusionsLow effortful control is associated with psychopathology in adolescents, but parenting can affect this association in several ways, depending on the type of psychopathology and the adolescent's gender. Future research should focus on finding optimal' levels of parental control that can help avoid psychopathological problems in youth with poor effortful control.

AB Introduction: Depression is a highly prevalent problem in adolescence, with great clinical and social relevance. Recent models of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence underscore that the relationships between stress, cognitive vulnerabilities, and depressive symptoms are bidirectional. In addition, according to cognitive therapy models, cognitive vulnerabilities are organized hierarchically, with deep schemas guiding more superficial cognitive processes such as rumination. The present study examines the longitudinal predictive relationships between two levels of cognitions (early maladaptive schemas and rumination), stressors, and depression. Method: A sample of 584 Spanish adolescents (262 girls; mean age = 15.99, SD = 1.10) completed measures of depression, stressors, rumination, and three early maladaptive schema domains (disconnection and rejection, impaired autonomy and other-directedness) over 4 intervals of 4 months. Path analysis was used to test the hypotheses of the study. Results: Disconnection and rejection domain systematically predicted an increase in depression, new stressors, and rumination over time. In addition, depressive symptoms predicted an increase of disconnection/rejection scores at all time points. Finally, from Time 2 on, stressors predicted an increase in all schema domains. Discussion: The outcomes suggest the importance of the disconnection and rejection schema domain. These results are important to understand the mechanisms underlying stress and depression in adolescents.

AB BackgroundPsychological problems, symptoms, and disorders among children and adolescents are on the rise. Typical problems include externalizing disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance induced disorders, aggressive behavior, including mobbing and bullying and internalizing disorders like anxiety, depression or eating disorders. The aim of the present study was the development of target-group-oriented school-based prevention tools to address these health-related problems.MethodsIn ademand analysis, the structural requirements for school-based prevention tools were assessed by semi-structured interviews with focus groups of 20 pedagogues from 3schools. Then, the materials were developed within 3 feedback rounds.ResultsBased on the results of the demand analysis, we developed acard set with poster exhibition with 10posters for the school building and then public space which should be accessiblefor students, pedagogues and parents. Additionally, we created a card set with 60 short exercises forlessons with students of the 5th to 12th grade.ConclusionThe prevention offer Healthy learning. Together was developed in collaboration with students, pedagogues and headmasters. The process and effectiveness evaluation will be published elsewhere. The offer is now available as published card set with 10posters and 60exercises entitled Gemeinsam Gesund Lernen - Kartenset zur Stressreduktion und Forderung des Klassenzusammenhalts.

AB Objective: This study compared children with and without current musculoskeletal (MSK) problems on key indices of child psychological adjustment and parental well-being. Research Method: Prevalence estimates of psychological problems were compared for children ages 2-17 years with and without current MSK problems in the 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health. Multivariate logistic regression analyses examined the effects of MSK problem severity on the risk of psychological concerns. Results: Population level differences in prevalence estimates were observed in psychological difficulties. Children with MSK problems were disproportionally affected by anxiety problems, depression, behavioral/conduct problems, and ADHD compared to children without MSK problems. Compared to children with mild MSK problems, children with severe MSK problems were 2.74 times more likely to have anxiety problems (95% CI [1.35, 2.86], p < .05). No other significant differences were found among children with mild, moderate, or severe MSK problems. Regarding parental well-being, compared to children without MSK problems, children with MSK problems were more likely to have mothers and fathers who often experience parenting stress/aggravation and have poor physical and mental health. Conclusions: Children with MSK problems are vulnerable to psychological difficulties that can affect their learning, development, and quality of life. Psychological screening and ensuring that these children receive effective mental health treatments should be a priority in pediatric health care settings. Consideration of parental physical and mental health is recommended in the assessment and treatment of children with MSK problems.
   Impact and Implications
   The current study provides population prevalence estimates of concurrent psychological problems and musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions in children using the 2011/12 National Survey of Children's Health, the largest national survey of child health available. Children with mild, moderate, and severe MSK problems have significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, conduct/behavioral problems, and ADHD than their peers without MSK problems. Children with severe MSK problems are more likely to have anxiety problems than children with mild MSK problems, but no other differences in the odds of psychological problems were found between children with mild, moderate, or severe MSK problems. Screening for emotional and behavioral health concerns and ensuring that all children affected by MSK problems receive appropriate and effective mental health services regardless of problem severity should be a priority in pediatric health care settings. Consideration of parenting stress and poor parental physical and mental health in relation to child psychological functioning and the therapeutic process is recommended.

AB Objective: This study intended to classify subtypes of Korean adolescents with suicidal ideation based on mental health problems and to explore the relationship between such subtypes and individual-, school- and community-level factors. Method: Data from high school freshmen who participated in the 2013 school-based mental health screening test and data about school and community variables obtained from public sources were combined and analyzed. A multilevel latent profile analysis using mental health issues as class indicators that included several predictors was conducted. Results: Three latent profiles were identified: Group 1 (6.5%) had high scores for both the internalizing and externalizing problems; Group 2 (40.2%) had high scores for internalizing problems, such as depression and mood related symptoms; and Group 3 (53.3%) had lower scores for all mental health problems compared to Groups 1 and 2. Gender, peer conflict, family conflict and academic problems were significant predictors at the individual level; school dropout rate was a significant school-level variable; and percent of youth in the total population, availability of mental health services, number of social welfare facilities and percentage of the total budget devoted to education/welfare were significant community-level variables. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that adolescents with suicidal ideation can be classified into several distinct subtypes based on mental health problems. These profiles and their associated covariates will aid in the establishment of youth suicide prevention policies.

AB The current study examined the mediating effect of maternal negative expressiveness as well as the moderating effects of infant inhibitory control (IC) in the association between maternal childhood emotional abuse (CEA) and infant behavior problems. Drawing from 207 families from mainland China, 2-wave data were reported in this study when the infants were 6 months (T1) and 14 (T2) months. Mothers (Mean age = 32.85 years, SD = 4.04) reported their CEA on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) at T1, and their negative expressiveness on the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire (SEFQ) at T2. The Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and a reverse categorization task were used to measure infant behavior problems and IC at T2, respectively. The results showed that T1 maternal CEA, rather than physical and sexual abuse, uniquely predicted T2 negative expressiveness. Maternal negative expressiveness significantly mediated the positive relations of maternal CEA and infant externalizing, internalizing and dysregulation problems. In addition, the moderated mediation model showed that the association between maternal negative expressiveness and infant dysregulation problems was moderated by infant IC. Specifically, the mediating pathway from maternal CEA to dysregulation problems through maternal negative expressiveness was significant, only for infants with poor IC. The results were robust even after controlling for family socioeconomic status (SES), maternal childhood physical and sexual abuse. The importance of mediating and moderating processes in understanding the effect of maternal emotional abuse during childhood on infant behavior problems is discussed.

AB Background Three well-established intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) involved in cognitive-affective processing include the cognitive control network (CCN), default mode network (DMN), and salience and emotional network (SEN). Despite recent advances in understanding developmental changes in these ICNs, the majority of research has focused on single seeds or networks in isolation with limited age ranges. Additionally, although internalizing psychopathologies (IPs), such as anxiety and depression, are often characterized by maladaptive cognitive-affective processing styles, it is not clear how IP history influences age-related changes in brain networks. Method The current study aimed to characterize the normative development of the CCN, DMN, and SEN across a large age-span (7-29 year olds) of typically developing (TD) individuals (n = 97). We also explore how age may impact differences in network connectivity between TD individuals and patients with IPs (n = 136). Results Among TD individuals, DMN and CCN connectivity strengthened with age, whereas connectivity between the SEN and ventromedial prefrontal cortex weakened across development. When exploring group (IP vs. TD) differences, the IP group was characterized by greater connectivity between the CCN and cerebellum and between the SEN and caudate from childhood to early adulthood, relative to TD individuals. In addition, patients with IPs, versus TD individuals, exhibited reduced connectivity between the SEN and medial frontal gyrus from adolescence to adulthood. Conclusions The current findings shed light on differential age-related changes in brain network patterns among psychiatrically free, TD individuals and those with internalizing disorders, and may provide plausible targets for novel mechanism-based treatments that differ based on developmental stage.

AB This study examined family disruption in the form of jailed parents' housing instability in the year leading up to their most recent incarceration, including periods of homelessness with and without their children, and links between parental housing instability and children's behavior problems. Using the Family Stress Proximal Process Model to understand the links between stressors related to family disruption and child outcomes, the study analyzed data from interviews and surveys with 165 jailed fathers and mothers with young children (age 2-6 years) regarding jailed parents' reports of housing instability during the 12 months prior to their incarceration and child behavior problems. Analyses showed that housing instability, homelessness, and recidivism in jailed parents were relatively common, with a significant proportion of the disruptions occurring with young children, although many disruptions involved parental absence from children. Results indicated that the more months that parents lived with their children prior to incarceration in jail during the past year, the less housing instability the parents experienced. Additionally, multiple regression analyses revealed that more housing instability experienced by parents in the year leading up to their incarceration in jail were associated with elevations in children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. These results have implications for future research that explores family disruption as a mechanism in understanding recidivism and homelessness among adults and risk for child behavior problems in families affected by parental incarceration.

AB In the present study, we examined whether profiles of temperamental features in adolescence (a) predict internalizing and externalizing symptoms in early adulthood, and (b) differ in family processes (i.e., cohesion, conflict) during early adolescence. Participants were 662 youth (72% male; 76% White). Mothers reported on family cohesion and conflict during participants' early adolescence (ages 12-14, Time 1). Youth completed measures of temperament in middle adolescence (ages 16, Time 2), and of their symptoms in middle adolescence (Time 2), late adolescence (age 19, Time 3), and early adulthood (age 22, Time 4). Latent profile analysis identified three temperamental profiles: low positive mood, low rhythmicity, and well-regulated. Individuals in the low rhythmicity profile reported higher levels of externalizing symptoms compared to the well-regulated profile. No between-profile differences were found for internalizing symptoms. Mothers of youth in the low positive mood and low rhythmicity profiles reported higher levels of family conflict than the well-regulated profile. In addition, mothers of youth in the low positive mood profile reported lower levels of family cohesion than the well-regulated profile. Research implications of the study findings are presented.

AB The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between adolescent-parent communication and adolescent internalizing problems. Both gender of the adolescent and gender or the parent were considered. An additional goal was to explore whether coping skills mediated this relationship. The sample included a community sample of 980 U.S. high school students. Surveys were administered during three annual assessment waves in seven public high schools during the spring of 2007 (Time 1), 2008 (Time 2), and 2009 (Time 3). Path analysis results indicated significant direct effects only for same-sex adolescent-parent dyads. For boys, adolescent-father communication predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms. Coping did not mediate these relationships. For girls, adolescent-mother communication predicted anxiety symptoms. Further, this relationship was mediated by humor coping. Adolescent-mother communication also predicted depressive symptoms via instrumental social support for girls. These results align with social learning theory and suggest that family-based interventions with same-sex adolescent-parent dyads are warranted to prevent internalizing problems in adolescents.

AB In parent socialization research, it has been suggested that the specific practices parents apply to regulate different domains or areas of adolescents' lives be examined to add greater specificity to domain-general studies of parenting styles or patterns and to better understand the link between parenting practices and adolescent adjustment. We examined from adolescents' perspectives the parenting practices their mothers and fathers used when regulating different issues in different areas of adolescents' lives. We examined 18 issues (e.g., grades, platonic friendship; smoking, fighting with siblings, choice of future career), classified into the moral, conventional, personal, and prudential domains, and multifaceted issues (issues that share features of more than one domain). We also examined whether domain variations in parenting practices are related to adolescents' social and academic competence; self-esteem; internalizing, externalizing, attention, and total problems. Adolescents between 13 to 18 years of age (N=182; M=16.01 years of age; SD=1.25) were interviewed (50 to 75min) about the parenting practices their mothers and fathers employ for different issues. Adolescents also completed questionnaires on demographics and on their social and academic competence; self-esteem; internalizing, externalizing, attention, and total problems. Adolescent adjustment associated with some parenting practices (e.g., punishment) were domain-specific (e.g., positive in moral domain but negative in prudential domain). However, certain parenting practices (e.g., verbal hostility, coercion) were related to negative adjustment and others to positive adjustment (e.g., monitoring) irrespective of domains. The present study advances theoretical propositions regarding domain-specificity and domain generality of parenting practices.

AB Background Mental illness is among the most common causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability in childhood. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has shown significant benefit in mental health; however, evidence of its effectiveness in youth is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of MBSR plus usual care versus usual care alone for reducing mental health symptoms in youth. Methods A two-arm, mixed methods, randomized cluster-controlled trial of 12-18 year olds who were residents of CASA House, a voluntary residential treatment program for adolescents, between January 2011 and March 2013 (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01307943). Interventions Treatment terms were randomized to usual care, or MBSR plus usual care, which included eight MBSR sessions of 2 hr/week. Outcomes The primary outcome was impact on emotions and behavior at the end of the program, using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2). Secondary outcomes included perceived stress levels, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. Results A total of 85 participants were randomized to either the MBSR arm (n = 45) or control arm (n = 40). Significant differences in favor of MBSR were found on Teacher ratings of the Internalizing Problems (p = .038) and Adaptive Skills subscales (p = .022) on the BASC-2. No significant differences were found on other outcomes. A post hoc analysis found that the MBSR arm had a significantly shorter time to discharge (p = .02). Conclusion The results of this study indicate that MBSR is effective for improved coping with internalizing problems and adaptive emotional skills in our sample. Future studies should focus on larger, longer-term studies in youth.

AB Background Theoretically, insecure attachment and negative parental behaviors are risk factors for childhood anxiety. However, few empirical studies have examined their relative contribution including differences between mothers and fathers. To date, only one study has examined a mediational model including these factors, albeit in a nonclinical sample. Method This study ameliorates this limitation by investigating direct and indirect relations between maternal and paternal attachment and behaviors, and clinical anxiety in children (mean age 9.6 years). The study recruited 54 families. Anxiety symptoms were measured by the Spielberger State-trait Inventory for Children, attachment relationships by the Security Scale, and parental behaviors using the Rearing Behavior Questionnaire. Results Neither insecure attachment relationship with mother nor maternal negative behavior was a significant predictor of anxiety in children. However, insecure attachment to father accounted for a significant proportion of variance in anxiety, and also fully mediated the relationship between paternal rejection and anxiety. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the relative contribution of risk factors and the importance of including fathers when investigating the development and maintenance of childhood anxiety.

AB Physiological synchrony, or concordance, among caregiver-child dyads involves the matching of biological states. Understanding this process is critical for enhancing our knowledge of the ways that the caregiver-child relationship supports child development. However, the meaning of physiological synchrony for child adjustment is poorly understood. This study examined physiological synchrony in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of parasympathetic activity, between 87 mothers (M age = 35.30 years, SD = 6.71 years) and their preadolescent children (M age = 10.36 years, SD = 1. 19 years, 52.9% girls). Dyads, all of which were from economically impoverished backgrounds, participated in 3 tasks that varied in the level of interaction that was required between the partners. Mothers self-reported their own depressive symptoms and rated their children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Physiological synchrony was generally strongest in tasks requiring the greatest levels of interaction among partners. Further, RSA synchrony was positive in the context of low levels of maternal depressive and child internalizing symptoms, and negative in the context of high levels of such symptoms, though results varied by task. Child externalizing symptoms did not moderate the RSA concordance process. The results identify both proximal and distal contexts in which physiological synchrony occurs, which ultimately broadens our understanding of the meaning and significance of parent-child physiological synchrony.

AB Despite the high prevalence and substantial costs of early life stress (ELS), the mechanisms through which ELS confers risk for psychopathology are poorly understood, particularly among youth who are in an earlier stage of the transition through puberty. We sought to advance our understanding of the link between ELS and psychopathology by testing whether rumination mediates the relation between ELS and symptoms of psychopathology in youth in the early stages of puberty, and whether sex moderates this mediation. We assessed levels of ELS, both brooding and reflection subtypes of rumination, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 170 youth in the early stages of puberty (56% girls) ages 9-13years. Brooding, but not reflection, mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Importantly, however, sex moderated the relation among ELS, brooding, and symptoms. Specifically, brooding mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms for girls, but not for boys. Findings support the formulation that brooding is a mechanism linking ELS to multiple forms of behavioral and emotional problems exclusively in girls in the early stages of puberty.

AB Among the 90% of adolescents involved in juvenile justice who have experienced traumatic victimization, a sub-group may be at highest risk due to histories of multiple types of interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma, termed polyvictims. Latent class analyses (LCA) have identified polyvictimized subgroups in several studies of adolescents and adults, but only one study of traumatic victimization has been conducted with justice-involved youth (Ford et al. 2013). The current investigation replicates and extends that study's findings using LCA to assess a wider range of victimization- and nonvictimization-related adversities and emotion dysregulation, DSM-5 symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and behavioral health problems, such as substance use, anger, depression, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation. In a sample of juvenile detainees three latent classes were identified: mixed adversity (MA; n=327), violent environment (VE; n=337), and polyvictimization (PV; n=145). In contrast to MA youth, PV youth were more likely to report exposure to all forms of adversity, and in contrast to both MA and VE youth, exposure to maltreatment and family violence, and higher levels of emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and depression/anxiety symptoms, somatic complaints, and suicidality. VE youth (vs. MA youth) were more likely to report exposure to violence and non-interpersonal traumas, and were higher on some forms of emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, anger and substance use. Findings suggest that most justice-involved youth have experienced substantial adversity, with almost one in five identified as a polyvictim having experienced multiple adversities, including impaired caregivers, and evidencing the most severe problems in emotion dysregulation and PTSD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms.

AB Offspring of mothers diagnosed with major depression are at increased risk for a wide range of psychological problems. Previous research has shown that individual differences in personality development can be informative for predicting risk and resilience to psychopathology, especially within at-risk populations. In the present study, we examined whether individual differences in offspring personality development during early to middle childhood could account for the association between maternal depression and offspring behavior problems later in childhood. Participants included 64 offspring of mothers diagnosed with major depression and 68 offspring of healthy comparison mothers. Personality was assessed via parent report at ages 3, 4, 5, and 9. Offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed at age 9 via parent and teacher report. Results of latent growth curve models indicated that offspring Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness mediated the link between early maternal depression and later childhood behavior problems, though results varied across maternal and teacher reports. Findings suggest that individual differences in youth personality and personality development are important predictors of emerging psychopathology among offspring of mothers diagnosed with depression.

AB Previous research has suggested that behavioral comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in autism. The present study aimed to trace the respective origins of autistic and general psychopathologic traitsand their associationto infancy. Measurements of autistic traits and early liability for general psychopathology were assessed in 314 twins at 18months, ascertained from the general population using birth records. 222 twins were re-evaluated at 36months. Standardized ratings of variation in social communication at 18months were highly heritable and strongly predicted autistic trait scores at 36months. These early indices of autistic liability were independent from contemporaneous ratings of behavior problems on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (which were substantially environmentally-influenced), and did not meaningfully predict internalizing or externalizing scores on the Achenbach Scales of Empirically Based Assessment at 36months. In this general population infant twin study, variation in social communication was independent from variation in other domains of general psychopathology, and exhibited a distinct genetic structure. The commonly-observed comorbidity of specific psychiatric syndromes with autism may arise from subsequent interactions between autistic liability and independent susceptibilities to other psychopathologic traits, suggesting opportunities for preventive amelioration of outcomes of these interactions over the course of development.

AB Background: Several studies show that language problems, child behavior problems, and parental stress can co-occur in children. Still, little is known about how these domains are related in toddlers with a language disorder (LD).
   Aims: This study examined relations between language problems, child behaviour problems, and parental stress in toddlers with LD and if these relations differ for children with different types of LD.
   Method: Data of 185 children with LD (mean age 38 months) were collected using Routine Outcome Monitoring. Children were divided into two groups: presence of receptive and expressive problems (REP) and expressive problems only (EP). Relations were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling.
   Results: A better receptive language was associated with less teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. A better expressive vocabulary was associated with more parent-reported internalizing problems and more teacher-reported externalizing problems. No relation was found between language and parental stress. Associations between language, behavior, and parental stress did not differ for children with REP or children with EP.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that when specific language domains are examined, the pattern of associations between language and behavior becomes more complex, because relations exist between specific language domains and behavior, but not between all of them.

AB Children from Latino migrant farmworker (LMFW) families are one of the most educationally disenfranchised and marginalized populations of students in the United States. These children face similar disadvantages to other low-income immigrant families, but often experience unique contextual stressors due to high mobility that places them at high risk for mental health problems, risk-taking behaviors, and poor academic engagement. Despite these high vulnerabilities few researchers have focused their efforts on LMFW children specifically, or addressed resilience factors in particular. Ego-resiliency is an enduring psychological construct reflecting how individuals overcome day-to-day challenges. We used a convergent mixed method cross-sectional design to examine the effects of LMFW children's (N = 66, ages 6-18, Mage = 12.79) depressive and conduct problems on their academic efficacy/mastery, and whether ego-resiliency counteracted these relations. Ego-resiliency was negatively associated with depression and conduct problems, and positively related to academic efficacy/mastery. Conduct problems were negatively related to academic efficacy/mastery, but depression was not. Ego-resiliency also moderated the relation of depression to academic efficacy/mastery. Qualitative results provided a deeper explanation of contributing factors to LMFW children's adjustment, how adjustment problems affected their academic success, and the coping mechanisms and resilience factors used by LMFW children to overcome difficult experiences.

AB Youth in child welfare often experience emergency shelter care, a type of congregate setting, while a permanent placement is arranged. The present longitudinal study explored the impact of initial emergency shelter placement on long-term externalizing behavior (i.e., aggression, delinquency) and internalizing symptom (i.e., anxiety, depression) trajectories, and whether kinship involvement moderated the effect of shelter placement on behavioral outcomes. The sample consisted of 282 youths (55.3% male) with an average age of 9.90 years (SD = 2.37); 36.9% experienced an emergency shelter placement. Data were collected from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. Caseworkers completed the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths, which measured youths' behavioral outcomes. Results suggested that shelter care was not associated with externalizing behavior trajectories. However, shelter care was associated with internalizing symptoms among children with less kinship involvement. Results from this study suggest that best practices for shelter care should leverage kinship involvement.

AB Background Research reveals longitudinal bidirectional associations between changes in academic achievement and psychopathological symptoms. However, little is known about developmental changes in the magnitude of these associations, from childhood to adolescence. Methods Participants were 648 Chinese children (347 males) who were followed from Grade 5 (mean age: 11.18 years) to Grade 9. Academic achievement and two types of symptoms (externalizing, depressive) were assessed annually. Structural equation modeling was used to examine longitudinal bidirectional associations between achievement and psychopathological symptoms, and developmental changes in effect sizes. Models were estimated using cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM), as well as random intercepts cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM). Results The data supported the hypothesized academic incompetence and adjustment erosion effects, as well as the hypothesized developmental change in the academic incompetence effect whereby prior achievement's effects on subsequent externalizing increased with age. Results were similar for both genders and unaffected by inclusion of common risk factors as covariates. Conclusions There are bidirectional associations between symptoms and achievement that change markedly across the transition into adolescence. Interpreting the effects using a developmental perspective, changes in reciprocal effects may be dynamic. The findings suggest that targeting both psychopathology and low academic achievement is worthwhile, but that distinct treatment effects will be found in childhood versus adolescence.

AB Aim We aimed to study tuberous sclerosis-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) in children and adolescents with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Method Retrospective and prospective cohort study conducted at a Paediatric Neurology Unit of an Italian Tertiary Care Hospital. Clinical and neuroimaging data were reviewed. Scores for neurological and epilepsy outcomes (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, Paediatric Version and Early Childhood Epilepsy Severity Scale modified), semi-structured interviews (authorized Italian version of the TAND checklist and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) and questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) were applied at last follow-up. Results Thirty-two patients with TSC (age range 1-19y) were enrolled. Eighty-eight per cent had at least one TAND and 47% had intellectual disability. The TAND checklist showed internalizing problems in 25.8% of cases (vs 41.9% by CBCL), and externalizing problems in 41.9% (vs 9.7% by CBCL). TAND prevailed in patients with de novo mutation of TSC2, high tuber load, and severe neurological and epilepsy outcomes. Interpretation In our cohort, 78% of patients had more than four TAND behavioural problems; nevertheless, they did not show a constant and specific neuropsychiatric profile. Clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological features were associated with several TAND. The TAND checklist appeared more effective than the CBCL, particularly in detecting externalizing problems. What this paper adds
   The Tuberous sclerosis-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) checklist is an effective tool for TAND screening. The TAND checklist helps define psychopathological and neuropsychiatric aspects in paediatric patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TAND were found in 88% of patients with TSC, whilst 78% had more than four TAND. TAND distribution depends on different clinical and neuroradiological features.

AB Objective: This study examined the differential relationship of externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, social context, and their interactions to three developmental indicators of smoking involvement: onset (age), amount of smoking, and dependence symptomatology. Method: Participants (n = 504, 73% male) from a high-risk community-based longitudinal study were followed from age 12-14 to young adulthood (18-20). Smoking involvement was conceptualized as a process involving differences in (a) age of onset of smoking, (b) amount of smoking at age 18-20, and (c) level of nicotine dependence symptomatology at age 18-20. Survival analysis was used to predict onset of smoking, regression for smoking level, and zero-inflated Poisson regression for nicotine dependence. Results: Externalizing (teacher report) and internalizing behavior (youth self-report), prior to the onset of smoking, predicted different components of smoking and nicotine dependence in young adulthood. Parental smoking predicted all levels of smoking involvement. Peer smoking was related to early onset of smoking, but not higher levels of smoking involvement. Externalizing and internalizing behavior interacted to predict nicotine dependence level, with higher levels of internalizing behavior predicting higher levels of dependence symptoms, even at low levels of externalizing behavior. Conclusions: Externalizing and internalizing behavior and social context are independent and interacting risk factors that come into play at different points in the developmental process occurring between smoking onset and dependence. This study provides important information for theoretical models of smoking progression and shows that different types of risk should be targeted for prevention at different points in smoking progression.

AB Objective: Physical educators' implicit theory of children's deviant behavior in primary education was investigated and compared with diagnostic criteria. Method: A total of 60 physical education (PE) teachers reported deviant behaviors during lessons. Experts sorted these behaviors together with the official diagnostic criteria into categories based on perceived similarity in content. Results: Hierarchical cluster analysis on the derived similarity matrix among the behaviors suggested that PE teachers focus more on attention problems, disobedience, and aggressiveness when internalizing behaviors, such as anxiety and low energy, were less reported. Conclusion: PE teachers may be important and useful informants on children's behavior in school settings.
