AB Very preterm birth (VPT; <32 weeks of gestation) has been associated with an increased risk to develop cognitive and socio-emotional problems, as well as with increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorder, both with childhood and adult onset. Socio-emotional impairments that have been described in VPT individuals include diminished social competence and self-esteem, emotional dysregulation, shyness and timidity. However, the etiology of socio-emotional problems in VPT samples and their underlying mechanisms are far from understood. To date, research has focused on the investigation of both biological and environmental risk factors associated with socio-emotional problems, including structural and functional alterations in brain areas involved in processing emotions and social stimuli, perinatal stress and pain and parenting strategies. Considering the complex interplay of the aforementioned variables, the review attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between very preterm birth, socio-emotional vulnerability and psychopathology. After a comprehensive overview of the socio-emotional impairments associated with VPT birth, three main models of socio-emotional development are presented and discussed. These focus on biological vulnerability, early life adversities and parenting, respectively. To conclude, a developmental framework is used to consider different pathways linking VPT birth to psychopathology, taking into account the interaction between medical, biological, and psychosocial factors.

AB This study examines the association between parents' resolution of their adolescent child's diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and the health and mental adjustment of the adolescents themselves. Parents of 75 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were interviewed using the Reaction to Diagnosis Interview. Parents and adolescents completed questionnaires regarding the child's physical health, self-management of the disease, and behavioral and emotional problems. Physicians reported adolescents' HbA1c levels. Results showed that adolescents whose fathers were resolved with the diagnosis exhibited better diabetes self-management and adolescents whose mothers were resolved with the diagnosis exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems. The findings highlight the different role of mothers and fathers in the treatment of adolescents with diabetes and provide a basis for clinical intervention that focuses not only on adolescent health, but also on parental state of mind regarding the resolution with the disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Specific learning disorders (SLDs) are a group of neuropsychological disorders which reduce a child's ability to read and/or write and/or use numbers. Internalizing disorders, and in particular anxiety, has been reported as a relatively common comorbidity in children with reading difficulties. We conducted this study in order to test if school experience (in terms of perceived support from the teacher) is associated with the development of anxiety.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with SLDs (age: 8-13) were compared to 32 healthy subjects of the same age. All subjects filled the scale to measure anxiety derived from the Self-Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA); results were compared using non-parametric statistics after verifying that scores were not normally distributed.
   RESULTS: Patients more often had a clinically significant level of anxiety (Mann Whitney U Test; P<0.001). We found a significant inverse correlation between a school experience perceived as positive and anxiety (Spearman's rho=- 0.925; P<0.001), while no significant correlation was found for sex, age, timeliness of diagnosis or time since diagnosis.
   CONCLUSION: Although these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies, the role of school experience for children with SLDs seems highly relevant also for their psychological well-being.

   CONSIDERATIONS; CHILDHOOD NEURODEVELOPMENT; ASSOCIATIONS; ANNOTATIONS;

AB Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is available over the counter in most countries and is widely considered to be safe for use during pregnancy; studies report gestational exposures to acetaminophen that lie in the 46%-65% range. Acetaminophen influences inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms and may predispose to oxidative stress; these and other effects are hypothesized to have the potential to compromise neurodevelopment in the fetal and infant brain. Two ecological studies suggested that population-level trends in the use of acetaminophen were associated with trends in the incidence/prevalence of autism; one of these studies specifically examined acetaminophen use during pregnancy. One large prospective observational cohort study found that gestational exposure to acetaminophen (especially when the duration of exposure was 28 days or more) was associated with motor milestone delay, gross and fine motor impairments, communication impairment, impairments in internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and hyperactivity, all at age 3 years; however, social and emotional developmental behaviors were mostly unaffected. A very recent large cohort study with a 12.7-year follow-up found that gestational exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder, but only when a hyperkinetic disorder was also present. In the light of existing data associating acetaminophen use during pregnancy and subsequent risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, this new finding suggests that the predisposition, if any, is toward the hyperkinetic syndrome rather than to autism. In summary, the empirical data are very limited, but whatever empirical data exist do not support the suggestion that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy increases the risk of autism in the offspring.

AB We examined whether maltreatment experienced in childhood and/or adolescence prospectively predicts young adult functioning in a diverse and well-characterized sample of females with childhood-diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (N = 140). Participants were part of a longitudinal study and carefully evaluated in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood (M-age = 9.6, 14.3, and 19.7 years, respectively), with high retention rates across time. A thorough review of multisource data reliably established maltreatment status for each participant (M-kappa = 0.78). Thirty-two (22.9%) participants experienced at least one maltreatment type (physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect). Criterion variables included a broad array of young adult measures of functioning gleaned from multiple-source, multiple-informant instruments. With stringent statistical control of demographic, prenatal, and family status characteristics as well as baseline levels of the criterion variable in question, maltreated participants were significantly more impaired than nonmaltreated participants with respect to self-harm (suicide attempts), internalizing symptomatology (anxiety and depression), eating disorder symptomatology, and well-being (lower overall self-worth). Effect sizes were medium. Comprising the first longitudinal evidence linking maltreatment with key young adult life impairments among a carefully diagnosed and followed sample of females with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, these findings underscore the clinical importance of trauma experiences within this population.

AB Although the negative impact of marital conflict on children has been amply documented, few studies have examined the process of risk in a long-term, longitudinal design. We examined parent-child attachment security as a mechanism that may account for the impact of interparental conflict on children's long-term risk of internalizing problems. Sixty-two community mothers, fathers, and children were followed from ages 2 to 10. Parents reported on their conflicts when their children were 2. Trained observers produced parent-child attachment security scores (Attachment Q-Set, Waters, 1987), based on lengthy naturalistic observations of the child with each parent. Parents rated children's internalizing problems at age 10. A conditional process model and bootstrap approach were implemented to examine conditional indirect effects of conflict on child internalizing problems through attachment security for girls versus boys. Maladaptive marital conflict (destructive strategies, severity of arguments) increased internalizing problems 8 years later due to the undermined security for girls, whereas negative emotional aftermath of conflict (unresolved, lingering tension) increased internalizing problems for both boys and girls. The emotional aftermath of conflict is often overlooked, yet it appears to be a key dimension influencing emotional security in the family system, with significant consequences for children's development.

AB This prospective longitudinal study examines the long-term influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure in utero. We hypothesized that (a) prenatal IPV increases risk for internalizing and externalizing problems as well as for a profile of dysregulated cortisol reactivity, and (b) patterns of cortisol hyper- and hyporeactivity are differentially associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. The participants were 119 10-year-old children. Their mothers reported their IPV experiences and distress during pregnancy. Child and maternal reports of internalizing and externalizing problems as well as lifetime IPV exposure were obtained. Salivary cortisol was assessed at baseline, 20 min, and 40 min after challenge. The results partially supported our hypotheses: Exposure to IPV during pregnancy predicted child-reported internalizing and externalizing problems, mother ratings of child externalizing problems, and a profile of high cortisol secretion before and after stress challenge. The results were significant above and beyond the influence of maternal distress during pregnancy and IPV that occurred during the child's life. In addition, a profile of high cortisol secretion was associated with maternal reports of child internalizing behaviors. Findings support the growing consensus that prenatal stress can lead to lasting disruptions in adaptation and highlight the need for more longitudinal examinations of prenatal IPV exposure.

AB Risk factors for the childhood development of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms are not well understood, despite a high prevalence and poor clinical outcomes associated with this co-occurring phenotype. We examined inherited and environmental risk factors for co-occurring symptoms in a sample of children adopted at birth and their birth mothers and adoptive mothers (N = 293). Inherited risk factors (i.e., birth mothers' processing speed and internalizing symptoms) and environmental risk factors (i.e., adoptive mothers' processing speed, internalizing symptoms, and uninvolved parenting) were examined as predictors for the development of internalizing-only, externalizing-only, or co-occurring symptoms using structural equation modeling. Results suggested a unique pattern of predictive factors for the co-occurring phenotype, with risk conferred by adoptive mothers' uninvolved parenting, birth mothers' slower processing speed, and the birth mothers' slower processing speed in tandem with adoptive mothers' higher internalizing symptoms. Additional analyses indicated that when co-occurring-symptom children were incorporated into internalizing and externalizing symptom groups, differential risk factors for externalizing and internalizing symptoms emerged. The findings suggest that spurious results may be found when children with co-occurring symptoms are not examined as a unique phenotypic group.

AB Internalizing symptoms during adolescence and beyond is a major public health concern, particularly because severe symptoms can lead to the diagnosis of a number of serious psychiatric conditions. This study utilizes a unique sample with a complex statistical method in order to explore Gene x Environment interactions found in internalizing symptoms during adolescence. Data for this study were drawn from a longitudinal prevention intervention study (n = 798) of Baltimore city school children. Internalizing symptom data were collected using self-report and blood or saliva samples genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0 microarrays. A major depression polygenic score was created for each individual using information from the major depressive disorder Psychiatric Genetics Consortium and used as a predictor in a latent trait-state-occasion model. The major depressive disorder polygenic score was a significant predictor of the stable latent trait variable, which captures time-independent phenotypic variability. In addition, an early childhood stressor of death or divorce was a significant predictor of occasion-specific variables. A Gene x Environment interaction was not a significant predictor of the latent trait or occasion variables. These findings support the importance of genetics on the stable latent trait portion of internalizing symptoms across adolescence.

AB Although extant research documents the negative consequences of harsh and lax discipline for youth, little empirical attention has been devoted to understanding the impact when parents utilize both strategies. As such, the current study was designed to explore the interaction of harsh and lax discipline on youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms in three developmental periods (early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence). Participants were 615 parents (55 % female) and one of their 3-17 year old children (45 % female). Parents provided reports of their harsh and lax parenting tactics as well as offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regression analyses were utilized to examine the relations between the interaction of harsh and lax parenting on youth symptoms. The interaction between harsh and lax discipline was significantly related to youth internalizing, but not externalizing, problems in the both the young and middle childhood samples and marginally significant in the adolescence sample: seesaw discipline-a novel construct indicative of high levels of both harsh and lax discipline-was associated with the highest levels of youth internalizing problems. Parents who engage in seesaw parenting have children and adolescents who are more likely to evidence internalizing symptoms. Such findings may inform prevention and intervention efforts that target dysfunctional discipline.

AB The present study examined the associations between emerging adults' perceived parental psychological control and autonomy support, and their autonomy, relatedness and internalizing difficulties in Italy and the U.S. The participants included 494 Italian and 414 U.S. college students, between 18 and 28 years of age (Mean = 21.58, SD = 2.18). Our findings showed that dependency-oriented psychological control had no significant direct associations with autonomy, relatedness or internalizing difficulties. Moreover, the association between parental autonomy support and internalizing problems was fully intervened by autonomy and relatedness, whereas the association between achievement-oriented psychological control and anxiety and depressive symptoms was partially intervened by autonomy and relatedness. Finally, although parental psychological control and autonomy support had similar effects on maladjustment across the two countries, relatedness appeared to play a more central role as an intervening variable for anxiety in the Italian group than in the U.S. group. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of examining parents' contributions to emerging adults' internalizing problems via autonomy support and psychological control across cultures.

AB This study examined cumulative risk, temperament traits, and their interplay as predictors of internalizing, externalizing, and sleep problems in at-risk toddlers. Participants were 104 low-income mother-toddler dyads recruited from women, infants, and children sites in a large city. The sample was primarily African American, and mothers were 21 years of age or younger at the child's birth. The dyads were assessed when the toddlers were approximately 18 months old and again at 24 months of age. Though all toddlers were from low-income families with young mothers, the families varied in the degree to which other contextual risk factors were present. A cumulative risk index was calculated based on five contextual factors: maternal education, neighborhood dangerousness, social support, household overcrowding and single parenting. In multiple regressions, cumulative risk predicted sleep and externalizing problems. In addition, negative affectivity predicted all three domains of problem behaviors, effortful control predicted fewer externalizing problems, and surgency predicted fewer internalizing problems. Moreover, low negative affectivity buffered the association between cumulative risk and both internalizing and sleep problems. These findings suggest that it is important to consider children's temperament traits in conjunction with the constellation of family risks when designing prevention programs to reduce the prevalence of behavior problems early in life.

AB The popularity of electronic (e-) cigarettes has greatly increased recently, particularly in adolescents. However, the extent of psychiatric comorbidity with adolescent e-cigarette use and dual use of conventional (combustible) and e-cigarettes is unknown. This study characterized psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent conventional and e-cigarette use. Ninth grade students attending high schools in Los Angeles, CA (M age = 14) completed self-report measures of conventional/e-cigarette use, emotional disorders, substance use/problems, and transdiagnostic psychiatric phenotypes consistent with the NIMH-Research Domain Criteria Initiative. Outcomes were compared by lifetime use of: (1) neither conventional nor e- cigarettes (non-use; N = 2557, 77.3%); (2) e-cigarettes only (N = 412, 12.4%); (3) conventional cigarettes only (N = 152, 4.6%); and (4) conventional and e-cigarettes (dual use; N = 189, 5.6%). In comparison to adolescents who used conventional cigarettes only, e-cigarette only users reported lower levels of internalizing syndromes (depression, generalized anxiety, panic, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder) and transdiagnostic phenotypes (i.e., distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, rash action during negative affect). Depression, panic disorder, and anhedonia were higher in e-cigarette only vs. non-users. For several externalizing outcomes (mania, rash action during positive affect, alcohol drug use/abuse) and anhedonia, an ordered pattern was observed, whereby comorbidity was lowest in non-users, moderate in single product users (conventional or e-cigarette), and highest in dual users. These findings: (1) raise question of whether emotionally-healthier ('lower-risk') adolescents who are not interested in conventional cigarettes are being attracted to e-cigarettes; (2) indicate that research, intervention, and policy dedicated to adolescent tobacco-psychiatric comorbidity should distinguish conventional cigarette, e-cigarette, and dual use.

AB Maternal postpartum depression has been shown to be one of the main predictors of externalizing and internalizing behaviors in toddlers and adolescents. Research suggests that presence of such behaviors can be observed as early as infancy. The current study uses longitudinal data from 247 mothers to examine the relationship between postpartum depressive symptoms at 8 weeks and the infant's externalizing and internalizing behaviors at 12 months. In unadjusted linear regression models, there were associations between postpartum depressive symptoms and infant externalizing behaviors (beta = 0.082, SE = 0.032, p = 0.012) and internalizing behaviors (beta = 0.111, SE = 0.037, p = 0.003). After controlling for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, race, education, home ownership, smoking status in the postpartum period, marital status, parenting stress, and happiness from becoming a parent, the associations between postpartum depressive symptoms and infant externalizing (beta = 0.051, SE = 0.034, p = 0.138) and internalizing behaviors (beta = 0.077, SE = 0.040, p = 0.057) were reduced and became non-significant. Furthermore, in these models the total amount of variance explained was 17.2% (p < 0.0001) for externalizing behaviors and 10.5% (p < 0.01) for internalizing behaviors; the only significant predictor of externalizing behaviors was maternal age (beta = -0.074, SE = 0.030, p = 0.014), and of internalizing behaviors was white non-Hispanic ethnicity (beta = -1.33, SE = 0.378, p = 0.0005). A combined effect of the confounding factors seems to explain the finding of no significant independent association between postpartum depressive symptoms and infant externalizing and internalizing behaviors.

AB Internalizing difficulties are one of the most widely documented consequences of child maltreatment. However, there is a need for studies delineating the factors that account for this association. Despite research showing that alexithymia is associated with both child maltreatment and internalizing problems, the role of alexithymia in the link between child maltreatment and internalizing problems has not received much attention in the literature. The current study evaluated whether a history of child maltreatment was associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness in emerging adulthood, and whether alexithymia partially accounted for these associations. Participants included 339 emerging adults ranging between 18 and 25 years of age (M=19.00, SD=1.26, 51.3% male). Exposure to child maltreatment (i.e., physical abuse, physical neglect, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect) was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and loneliness symptoms. Tests of indirect effects suggested that associations between emotional neglect and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were partially explained by alexithymia. However, alexithymia did not account for any other associations between the remaining four maltreatment types and internalizing problems. Findings highlight the need for further evaluation of the factors that might account for associations between child maltreatment and internalizing difficulties. Future directions and implications for interventions are reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study extends prior research examining the association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) features and child physical abuse (CPA) risk. We hypothesized that: (1) high CPA risk parents (compared to low CPA risk parents) would more often report clinically elevated levels of BPD features; (2) high CPA risk parents with elevated BPD features would represent a particularly high-risk subgroup; and (3) the association between elevated BPD features and CPA risk would be partially explained by emotion regulation difficulties. General population parents (N = 106; 41.5% fathers) completed self-report measures of BPD features, CPA risk, and emotion regulation difficulties. Results support the prediction that BPD features are more prevalent among high (compared to low) CPA risk parents. Among the parents classified as high CPA risk (n = 45), one out of three (33.3%) had elevated BPD features. In contrast, none of the 61 low CPA risk parents reported elevated BPD symptoms. Moreover, 100% of the parents with elevated BPD features (n = 15) were classified as high-risk for CPA. As expected, high CPA risk parents with elevated BPD features (compared to high CPA risk parents with low BPD features) obtained significantly higher scores on several Child Abuse Potential Inventory scales, including the overall abuse scale (d = 1.03). As predicted, emotion regulation difficulties partially explained the association between BPD features and CPA risk. Findings from the present study suggest that a subset of high CPA risk parents in the general population possess clinically significant levels of BPD symptoms and these parents represent an especially high-risk subgroup. Interventions designed to address BPD symptoms, including emotion regulation difficulties, appear to be warranted in these cases. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Pattern of Diagnosis and Co-occurring Symptoms in Adopted Children With
   Autism Spectrum Disorder
SO PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CATCH-UP; SLEEP; PREVALENCE
AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications.
   METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates.
   RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

AB The effects of current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions on emotion regulation are relatively unknown. Many conceptualize trisD as a disorder of emotion dysregulation, and clinicians often fear that emotion regulation impairments will not change with stand-alone PTSD treatments, particularly for individuals with pre-existing emotion regulation difficulties. The present study examined changes in emotion regulation (expressive suppression, cognitive reappraisal, negative mood regulation) with prolonged exposure (PE) therapy or sertraline, specifically examining whether those with higher pre-existing emotion regulation difficulties improved over treatment on these indices. Individuals with chronic PTSD (N = 200) received 10 weeks of PE or sertraline and were followed through 6-month follow-up. Emotion regulation was assessed at pre- and post-treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Individuals with poorer initial emotion regulation showed greater improvement on all indices of emotion regulation, regardless of which treatment they received. Changes occurred during active treatment and were maintained over follow-up. These findings have both theoretical and clinical implications, arguing that emotion regulation is not impaired across all individuals with PTSD and that PE and sertraline effectively address emotion regulation difficulties.

AB Family-centered prevention programs are understudied for their effects on adolescent depression, despite considerable evidence that supports their effectiveness for preventing escalation in youth problem behavior and substance use. This study was conducted with 2 overarching goals: (a) replicate previous work that has implicated the Family Check-Up (FCU), a multilevel, gated intervention model embedded in public middle schools, as an effective strategy for preventing growth in adolescent depressive symptoms and (b) test whether changes in family conflict may be an explanatory mechanism for the long-term, protective effects of the FCU with respect to adolescent depression. This trial was conducted with 593 ethnically diverse families who were randomized to intervention (offered the FCU) or middle school as usual. Complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis revealed that engagers in the FCU evidenced less growth in depressive symptoms and family conflict from 6th through 9th grade, and post hoc analyses indicated that the FCU is related to lower rates of major depressive disorder. The second set of analyses examined family conflict as a mechanism of change for families who participated in the FCU. Families who reported short-term intervention benefits had significantly less escalation in family conflict over the middle school years; in turn, growth in family conflict explained risk for adolescent depressive symptoms.

AB The authors compared the protective effects of 3 sources of perceived social support-from family members, friends, and school personnel-on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents exposed to rocket attacks. Data were based on 362 Israeli adolescents (median age = 14), chronically exposed to rockets from the Gaza Strip, for whom robust effects of exposure on internalizing and externalizing symptoms were reported during the 2009-2010 period (Henrich & Shahar, 2013). New analyses revealed that perceived family social support assessed in 2009 buffered against the effect of exposure to rocket attacks on depression, aggression, and severe violence during 2009-2010. Findings are consistent with a human-ecological perspective exposure to political violence and encourage the employment of family-based preventive interventions in afflicted areas.

AB This study analyzes the discursive construction of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and self in relation to a socioculturally shared understanding of moral norms. Thirteen Finnish youth aged 11 to 16 diagnosed with ADHD were interviewed during this discourse analysis study. The youth accounted for their culturally undesirable behavior, performance and traits through three different types of accounts: (1) externalizing personal responsibility due to a compelling medical condition, (2) internalizing personal responsibility through moral self -condemnation, and (3) distancing oneself from the socially imposed stereotypes and stigmas related to ADHD. This study challenges dominant understanding of young people with a diagnosis of ADHD and contributes to our understanding of how ADHD is constructed in their lives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examined proximal outcomes of a mental health home visiting model for two populations at risk for child maltreatment: families with young children referred by child protective services (CPS) and at-risk pregnant women (Prenatal) referred by community agencies. Family- and caregiver-level outcomes were measured using the Family Assessment Form (FAF). Families (n = 215) showed significant improvement in all eight family functioning factors over the course of their participation in mental health home visiting services. Initially, CPS referred families (n = 84) scored higher on the FAF measure of Interactions between Caregivers, indicating greater conflict between caregivers in the family. Prenatal referred families (n = 131) were at greater risk initially on Housing. Prenatal-referred families demonstrated greater risk reduction on measures of Supports to Caregivers, Developmental Stimulation, Caregiver Personal Characteristics and Housing. In addition, all families demonstrated significant improvements in functioning on 11 of 12 items comprising the Caregiver Personal Characteristics factor. Overall, CPS-referred families scored at higher risk on items reflecting externalizing problems, while Prenatal-referred families showed greater improvement on items reflecting internalizing problems. This model was successful in reducing risk factors and promoting protective factors for CPS-referred and Prenatal at-risk families. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the risk factors of delinquent behavior in children's homes in Japan and the co-occurrence of externalizing problem behavior and internalizing problem behavior. Eight hundred and nine children (436 boys, 373 girls were recruited from such homes. Childcare workers from these homes completed sets of questionnaires. Our results found significant relationships between delinquent behavior and gender [odds ratio (OR) = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (Cl), 1.16-238], age (OR = 125; 95% CI, 1.16-135), parent-child conflict (OR = 2.79; 95% Cl, 1.45-5.36), neglect (OR = 1.43; 95% Cl, 1.03-2.11), and aggressive behavior (OR =1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12). Results also showed externalizing problem behaviors and internalizing problem behaviors were associated with age (OR = 1.23; 95% Cl, 1.08-1.41), thought problems (OR = 137; 95% CI, 1.17-1.59), attention problems (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-123), and physical abuse (OR = 3.09; 95% Cl, 1.64-5.83). Our study clarifies the predictive factors for delinquency and related internalizing behavior symptoms and externalizing behavior problems. These results indicate that children in children's homes have various problems and require multilevel intervention. Our findings may be used to improve current policies governing children's homes.

AB This study examined the interrelationships between changes in trauma and internalizing symptoms among adolescents in foster care. Using three waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, growth-curve analyses were conducted with a sample of 155 adolescents aged 11-15 in out-of-home care. Findings indicated that the initial level of post-traumatic stress symptoms was significantly associated with the initial level of internalizing symptoms at Wave I and decreases in post-traumatic stress symptoms were significantly associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms from Wave Ito Wave IV. Viewing trauma and internalizing symptoms as interrelated affords increased understanding of ways in which adolescents who have experienced high levels of stress express their needs. As such, it may be clinically beneficial to conduct an evaluation of trauma symptoms for adolescents in foster care, regardless of whether there has been a documented history of a traumatic event. Doing so may provide a more comprehensive view into the underlying influences of adolescent behaviors and help capture a broader clinical picture necessary for effective intervention.

AB We tested whether conduct problems predicted young adult functioning and psychiatric symptoms among women diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during childhood, in the context of 3 potential adolescent mediators: internalizing problems, peer rejection, and school failure and disciplinary problems. We controlled for childhood ADHD severity, IQ, and demographic factors, and in the mediational tests, for adolescent conduct problems. Data came from 140 participants in the Berkeley Girls With ADHD Longitudinal Study. We used bootstrapping methods to assess indirect effects (mediators). Both childhood, F(1, 118) change = 9.00, p = .003, R-2 change = .069, and adolescent, F(1, 109) change = 10.41, p = .002, R-2 change = .083, conduct problems were associated with worse overall functioning during young adulthood, controlling for initial ADHD severity, child IQ, and demographics. Results were similar when predicting psychiatric symptoms. Adolescent school failure and disciplinary problems mediated the relations between childhood conduct problems and both young adult functioning and externalizing problems; adolescent internalizing problems and peer conflict mediated the relation between childhood conduct problems and young adult internalizing problems. As is true for boys, childhood and adolescent conduct problems are associated with poor adult outcomes among girls with ADHD, with school failure and disciplinary problems, internalizing problems, and peer conflict functioning as mediators of these relations.

AB Risk factors for the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) have been well-researched. Comparatively little is known, however, about factors associated with the persistence of CUDs over time. This research explored whether the temporal sequencing of comorbid psychiatric disorders in relation to the onset of the index CUD episode were associated with the length of this episode. Four comprehensive diagnostic assessments were conducted between ages 16 and 30 with a large and regionally representative community sample (n = 816), among which 173 persons were diagnosed with a lifetime CUD. In separate unadjusted analyses, any internalizing disorder and any mood disorder with onset prior to that of the index CUD episode were each significantly and negatively associated with CUD duration. These effects, however, were reduced to trend level in adjusted analyses that controlled for putative confounders. Following the onset of the index CUD episode, the subsequent occurrence of any Axis I disorder, internalizing disorder, externalizing disorder, or other substance use disorder during the index CUD episode was significantly and positively associated with the duration of that episode in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These findings collectively suggest that the presence of internalizing-spectrum disorders prior to the onset of the index CUD episode affords some modest protection against protracted episodes, whereas the emergence of broad-spectrum psychopathology within the index CUD episode, most notably noncannabis substance use disorders, is associated with greater disorder persistence. The relevance of these findings for various motivational models of cannabis addiction is discussed.

AB A randomized controlled experimental pilot study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of life skills training on behavior problems in left-behind children (LBC) in rural China. Sixty-eight LBC were recruited from a middle school in rural China. The intervention group took a ten-week-long life skills training course. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF) were used to evaluate the behavioral problems of the children at three separate intervals: Prior to the intervention, the first week following the intervention, and three months after the intervention. Children in the intervention group showed significant improvement both in the CBCL and the TRF compared to children in the control group. Significant improvements were found in the CBCL total scores, internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior and seven subscales scores (p>0.05). In TRF, similar significant improvements were found, except in internalizing behavior and the subscale of thought problems (p>0.05). The effect of intervention remained the same three months after the intervention. As a pilot study, the life skill training was found to be effective in improving behavior problems in the LBC in rural China, with the exception of thought problems.

AB Self-harm and suicide attempts occur at elevated rates among individuals with bulimia nervosa, particularly among those who have experienced childhood abuse. This study investigated the potential mediating roles of emotion dysregulation and affective intensity in the relationship between these variables in 125 women with bulimia nervosa. Analyses revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between sexual and emotional abuse with both self-harm and suicide attempts. Negative affective intensity mediated the relationship between abuse and suicide attempts. The findings may advance the understanding of mechanisms underlying suicide-related behaviors in women with bulimia nervosa who experienced abuse and suggest potential clinical targets.

AB Background: Children whose mothers report partner violence and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at risk for behavior dysfunctions.
   Aim: To examine the mediating effects of maternal PTSD symptoms on the relationship of parenting behaviors to child internalizing and externalizing behavior dysfunctions.
   Findings: Maternal PTSD symptoms have a partial mediating effect on the relationship between inconsistent discipline and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Maternal PTSD symptoms have a fully mediating effect on the relationship between poor supervision and child internalizing behaviors.
   Conclusions: There is a need to identify women who report partner violence and are at high risk for PTSD and intervene early to prevent problematic parenting and resulting child behavior problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Preschoolers with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AMID) are at increased risk for the development of comorbid conduct disorder (CD) and depression. Early predictors of serious adverse outcomes within this population include parenting characterized by high levels of negativity and low levels of positivity, maternal depression, and child emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Parent child interaction therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based treatment for oppositional defiant disorder and CD that has also been shown to improve comorbid child internalizing symptoms and maternal depression by enhancing parenting and improving the parent child relationship. PCIT-emotion development (PCIT-ED) is an adaptation for depressed preschoolers, grounded in developmental literature, which teaches parents to become "emotion coaches" for their children, in an effort to build child ER skills. In this paper, we describe the iterative process by which we implemented and adapted PCIT-ED based on our experiences treating nine children with ADHD. We present three case examples that exemplify our process in adapting the PCIT-ED manual. This work suggests that PCIT with parent emotion coaching (PCIT-ECo) may be a promising treatment approach for young children with ADHD. Future research will need to examine this adaptation relative to standard PCIT to determine whether our integration of parent emotion coaching results in added improvement in child ER, internalizing and externalizing problems, and functional impairment.

AB Background:Previous research is discrepant with respect to the prevalence of internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) samples. Moreover, few studies have examined the combined influence of demographic and disease-related risk factors for internalizing symptoms. This study described rates of depressive, anxiety, and overall internalizing symptomatology in a multisite sample of youth with established IBD diagnoses. Additionally, the study examined risk factors for elevated depressive, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms, including those in demographic (i.e., family income and sex) and disease (i.e., disease activity and functional disability) domains.
   Methods:One hundred sixty-one youth (aged 11-18 yr) with established IBD diagnoses, primarily inactive disease, prescribed oral medications, and who were not taking corticosteroids were recruited from outpatient Gastroenterology Clinics at 3 children's hospitals. This article reflects a secondary analysis of data collected from 2 larger studies examining oral medication adherence and psychosocial functioning in pediatric IBD. After providing written consent/assent, participants completed questionnaires assessing demographics, functional disability, and internalizing symptoms. Medical records were reviewed for disease information and clinical disease activity ratings.
   Results:Only 13% of the sample reported clinically elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms. Perceived functional disability, but not clinical disease activity, was associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher overall internalizing symptomatology.
   Conclusions:Current results highlight the need to look beyond disease severity and examine the perception of functional disability of patients with IBD when seeking to identify youth at risk for internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety.

AB Accurate assessment of psychological self-concept in early childhood relies on the development of psychometrically sound instruments. From a developmental perspective, the current study revised an existing measure of young children's psychological self-concepts, the Child Self-View Questionnaire (CSVQ; Eder, 1990), and examined its psychometric properties using a sample of preschool-age children assessed at approximately 4 years old with a follow-up at age 5 (N = 111). The item compositions of lower order dimensions were revised, leading to improved internal consistency. Factor analysis revealed 3 latent psychological self-concept factors (i.e., sociability, control, and assurance) from the lower order dimensions. Measurement invariance by gender was supported for sociability and assurance, not for control. Test-retest reliability was supported by stability of the psychological self-concept measurement model during the preschool years, although some evidence of increasing differentiation was obtained. Validity of children's scores on the 3 latent psychological self-concept factors was tested by investigating their concurrent associations with teacher-reported behavioral adjustment on the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale-Short Form (SCBE-SF; LaFreniere & Dumas, 1996). Children who perceived themselves as higher in sociability at 5 years old displayed less internalizing behavior and more social competence; boys who perceived themselves as higher in control at age 4 exhibited lower externalizing behavior; children higher in assurance had greater social competence at age 4, but displayed more externalizing behavior at age 5. Implications relevant to the utility of the revised psychological self-concept measure are discussed.

TI Amygdala reactivity to sad faces in preschool children: An early neural

AB Background: Elevated negative affect is a highly salient risk factor for later internalizing disorders. Very little is known about the early neurobiological correlates of negative affect and whether they associate with developmental changes in negative emotion. Such information may prove critical for identifying children deviating from normative developmental trajectories of negative affect and at increased risk for later internalizing disorders. The current study examined the relationship between amygdala activity and negative affect measured concurrently and approximately 12 months later in preschool-age children.
   Method: Amygdala activity was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 31 medication naive preschool age children. Negative affect was measured using parent report both at the time of scan and 12 months later.
   Results: Negative affect at baseline was positively correlated with right amygdala activity to sad faces, right amygdala activity to happy faces, and left amygdala activity to happy faces. Right amygdala activity to sad faces also positively predicted parent-reported negative affect 12 months later even when negative affect reported at baseline was controlled.
   Conclusions: The current findings provide preliminary evidence for amygdala activity as a potential biomarker of persistent negative affect during early childhood and suggest future work examining the origins and long-term implications of this relationship is necessary.

AB Low back pain (LBP) is common already in adolescence, and many risk indicators including both psychosocial and lifestyle factors have been recognized. Our purpose was to assess whether the co-occurrence of psychosocial (externalizing and internalizing) problems and lifestyle factors (leisure time physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, smoking, and overweight/obesity) associate with LBP at 16 years cross-sectionally or with new LBP at 18-year follow-up.
   The study population, drawn from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, consisted of 1625 participants (712 boys and 913 girls) who completed a questionnaire on potential explanatory factors at 16 years and on LBP at 16 and 18 years. The outcome measure was 'reporting LBP' or 'consultation for LBP' during the past 6 months. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was utilized to study the co-occurrence of the explanatory factors.
   Among both genders, four clusters were found. Externalizing behaviour problems were associated with 'reporting LBP' (RR 1.5, boys 1.4, girls) and 'consultation for LBP' (RR 1.6 for both genders) at baseline among both genders. In addition, the cluster of multiple risk behaviours was associated with both 'reporting LBP' (RR 1.3) and 'consultation for LBP' (RR 2.5) and the obese cluster with 'consultation for LBP' (RR 1.7) among girls. Externalizing behaviour problems at 16 years predicted 'consultation for LBP' at 18 years among girls (RR 3.6).
   Our results stress the role of psychosocial factors in reporting and seeking care for adolescent LBP.

AB Theories of temperament suggest that individual differences in affective reactivity (e.g., negative affectivity) may confer risk for internalizing psychopathology in youth and that self-regulatory aspects of temperament (e.g., effortful control) may protect against the deleterious effects of high negative affective reactivity. However, no study to date has examined how the relationship between temperament and youth internalizing psychopathology may be moderated by stress. The current study used a prospective longitudinal design to test the interaction of temperament (e.g., negative affectivity and effortful control) and stressors as a predictor of youth (ages 7-16; 56 % female; N = 576) depressive and anxious symptoms over a 3-month period. Findings show that at low levels of stress, high levels of effortful control protect against the development of depressive and anxious symptoms among youth with high levels of negative affectivity. However, at high levels of stress, this buffering effect is not observed. Gender and grade did not moderate this relationship. Overall, findings extend current understanding of how the interaction of individual psychosocial vulnerabilities and environmental factors may confer increased or decreased risk for depressive and anxious symptoms.

AB The cognitive model posits that negative appraisals play an important role in posttraumatic stress disorder, in children as well as in adults. This study examined correlates of negative appraisals in relation to trauma exposure and their relationship to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 414 Sri Lankan adolescents, aged 12 to 16, living in areas impacted in varying degrees by the 2004 tsunami. In 2008, participants completed measures of negative appraisals, lifetime traumatic events, posttraumatic stress symptoms, internalizing symptoms, ongoing adversity, and social support. The majority (70 %) of the participants reported multiple traumatic events; 25 % met DSM-IV criteria for full or partial PTSD. Adolescents who had experienced more severe events, abusive events, greater cumulative trauma, or greater current adversity reported more negative appraisals. In regression analyses controlling for known risk factors such as female gender, cumulative trauma, ongoing adversity, and low social support, negative appraisals were the best predictor of PTSS, explaining 22 % of the variance. This relationship appeared specific to PTSS, as negative appraisals did not predict internalizing symptoms. Findings confirm the link between negative cognitions concerning traumatic events and persistent PTSS in adolescents, but longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether appraisals contribute to symptom maintenance over time.

AB Very few studies have investigated the longitudinal trajectory of depression and anxiety related symptomatology among child victims of maltreatment or among those at risk for maltreatment. The current study examined latent class trajectories of anxiety/depression symptoms in a sample of 1354 (n = 657 boys, n = 697 girls) victimized or at risk children using data collected from the Longtitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Four trajectory groups were identified labeled low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing. This study also sought to investigate predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in the three more pathological groups (i.e., moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing) was predicted by a greater number of maltreatment allegations, more visits to a primary care physician for psychological issues, less perceived support by primary maternal caregiver, and lower rated popularity of the child. Implications for early identification of child maltreatment victims in primary health care settings was discussed.

AB This study examined the stability of internalizing and externalizing problems from age 1.5 to 6 years, while taking into account developmental changes in the presentation of problems. The study comprised a population-based cohort of 7,206 children (50.4 % boys). At ages 1.5, 3, and 6 years, mothers reported on problem behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5). At each age we performed latent profile analysis on the CBCL/1.5-5 scales. Latent transition analysis (LTA) was applied to study the stability of problem behavior. Profiles of problem behavior varied across ages. At each age, 82-87 % of the children did not have problems whereas approximately 2 % showed a profile of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. This profile was more severe (with higher scores) at 6 years than at earlier ages. A predominantly internalizing profile only emerged at 6 years, while a profile with externalizing problems and emotional reactivity was present at each age. LTA showed that, based on profiles at 1.5 and 3 years, it was difficult to predict the type of profile at 6 years. Children with a profile of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems early in life were most likely to show problem behavior at 6 years. This study shows that the presentation of problem behavior changes across the preschool period and that heterotypic continuity of problems is very common among preschoolers. Children with co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems were most likely to show persisting problems. The use of evidence-based treatment for these young children may prevent psychiatric problems across the life course.

AB The utility of the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5) and the Caregiver Teacher Report Form (C-TRF) to the Serbian children is largely unknown and has not been studied. An aim of this study was to examine rates and distribution of emotional and behavioral problems among 4 to 6-year-old children in the Serbia. Country differences between our Serbian sample and the original U.S. sample, gender differences, and cross informant agreement between teachers and parents were also to be examined. The CBCL/1.5-5 and the C-TRF was completed by parents and teachers respectively on 512 preschoolers in the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Internal consistency of the scales was analyzed using Cronbach alpha (alpha). The comparison of behavioral/emotional syndromes raw scores was performed by t test. CBCL/1.5-5 prevalence rate of the Total Problems score in the clinical range was 13.4%, while the C-TRF prevalence rate for girls was 9.8% and for boys 8.8%. Our findings revealed that parent reported more problems than teachers on almost all scales across gender with the mean cross-informant correlation of 0.24. This study documents gender differences, with boys scoring significantly higher than girls on all externalizing related problem scales on both questionnaires, but with no gender differences on internalizing problems on either questionnaire. Results support the applicability of the Serbian version of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF and can be recommended for use in clinical and research settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB We hypothesized that the double hit conferred by sex and diagnosis increases the risk for internalizing disorders in adolescent females with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a sample of 32 adolescents with ASD and 32 controls, we examined the effects of sex, diagnostic factors, and developmental stages on depression and anxiety. A 3-way interaction revealed that females with ASD exhibited greater depressive symptoms than males with ASD and female controls particularly during early adolescence; therefore, females with ASD might have a unique combination of genetic, hormonal, and psychosocial vulnerabilities that heighten their risk for depression during early adolescence. Additionally, the ASD group reported high levels of separation anxiety and panic in late adolescence, possibly indicating atypical development of independence.

AB Higher levels of parental knowledge about youth activities have been associated with lower levels of youth risky behavior. Yet little is known about how parental knowledge fluctuates during early adolescence and how those fluctuations are associated with the development of problem behavior. We use the term lability to describe within-person fluctuations in knowledge over time with higher lability indicating greater fluctuations in knowledge from year-to-year. This longitudinal study of rural adolescents (N = 840) investigated if change in parental knowledge across four waves of data from grades 6 to 8 is characterized by lability, and if greater lability is associated with higher youth substance use, delinquency, and internalizing problems in grade 9. Our models indicated that only some of the variance in parental knowledge was accounted for by developmental trends. The remaining residual variance reflects within-person fluctuations around these trends, lability, and measurement and occasion-specific error. Even controlling for level and developmental trends in knowledge, higher knowledge lability (i.e., more fluctuation) was associated with increased risk for later alcohol and tobacco use, and for girls, higher delinquency and internalizing problems. Our findings suggest that lability in parental knowledge has unique implications for adolescent outcomes. The discussion focuses on mechanisms that may link knowledge lability to substance use. Interventions may be most effective if they teach parents to consistently and predictably decrease knowledge across early adolescence.

Findings suggest that youth with primary TTM score more comparably to youth with tics than those with OCD on internalizing and externalizing symptom measures. Compared to the OCD group, youth in the TTM group reported lower levels of anxiety and depression. Parents of youth in the TTM group also reported fewer internalizing, externalizing, attention, and thought problems than those in the OCD group. Youth with TTM did not significantly differ from those with primary Tic disorders on any measure. Findings suggest that pediatric TTM may be more similar to pediatric tic disorders than pediatric OCD on anxiety, depression, and global internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB The link between sexual maturation, or pubertal timing, in girls and adolescent depressive symptoms is well-documented, but the underlying processes remain unclear. We examined whether sexual harassment, which has previously been linked to both pubertal timing and depressive symptoms, mediates this link, using a two-wave longitudinal study including 454 girls in 7th (M (age) = 13.42, SD = .53) and 8th grade (M (age) = 14.42, SD = .55). Pubertal timing was linked to depressive symptoms in both age groups, and predicted an increase in depressive symptoms among the 7th graders. Sexual harassment significantly mediated the link between pubertal timing and depressive symptoms among the 7th, but not the 8th grade girls. Together, our findings suggest that one way to prevent depressive symptoms among early-maturing girls could be to address sexual harassment in preventive intervention in early adolescence.

AB Adolescents are especially prone to risky behavior and to the emergence of psychological disorders like substance abuse, anxiety and depression. However, there is a sex (or gender) difference in this vulnerability, with females being more prone to developing internalizing disorders and males being more likely to engage in risky behavior and drug use. While several researchers have proposed that there is a relationship between corticolimbic circuit development and adolescent vulnerability, the current proposed models do not take sex differences into account. In this review, we explore recent findings from both human and rodent studies of sex differences during adolescence. In particular, we consider epidemiological studies on the factors that contribute to the development of substance abuse and internalizing disorders, laboratory studies on reward-related and decision-making behavior, and neuroanatomical studies on the development of several structures in the corticolimbic circuit (i.e., prefrontal cortex [PFC], amygdala and striatum). We then integrate these recent findings into models of adolescent vulnerability to substance use that have previously not addressed sex differences. Lastly, we discuss methodological considerations for the interpretation and design of studies on sex (or gender) differences during adolescence while highlighting some opportunities for future investigations.

AB Purpose: To explore how attitudes, norms, behaviors, responses to early life experiences, and protective factors influence pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection risks from the perspectives of current and former foster youth to inform the development of prevention strategies.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured individual qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of 22 current/former foster youth aged 15-21 years (63% female; average age = 18.6 years). We then used Theoretical Thematic Analysis to systematically analyze the data for key themes related to sexual health in four categories: 1) norms and attitudes, 2) responses to early life experiences, 3) protective factors, and 4) youth-driven intervention ideas.
   Results: Participants reported a range of sexual experience levels, varied sexual orientations, and also reported varied life experiences prior to and during foster care. We detected several norms and attitudes that likely contribute to risks of early pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. These included that one can tell by looking whether a partner is trustworthy or has a sexually transmitted infection, that condoms aren't necessary with long-term or infrequent partners or if birth control is used, and that teen pregnancy is an inevitable event. With respect to responses to early life experiences, youth frequently described difficulties dealing with strong emotions in the context of romantic and/or sexual relationships; many attributed these difficulties to early experiences with biological family members or in foster care. Participants linked emotion regulation difficulties with struggles in trust appraisal, effective communication, and impulsive behaviors. Youth also described a variety of protective factors that they felt helped them prevent sexual risk behaviors or improved their lives in other respects. Finally, participants endorsed factors likely to improve intervention acceptability and efficacy, including an open, non-judgmental group-based environment, involvement of peer mentors, and inclusion of caregiver and caseworker training components.
   Conclusions: Trauma-informed, tailored intervention strategies which address key norms and attitudes and provide broad-based assertiveness and emotion regulation skills are likely to be the most effective strategies to reduce risks of teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections among teens in foster care. Group-based interventions that involve peer mentors and caregiver and caseworker components may be especially acceptable and effective for teens in foster and/or kinship care. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB From an evolutionary perspective, adaptations of an organism to its early environment are essential for survival. The occurrence of early life perturbation, coincident with increased developmental plasticity, provides a unique opportunity for such adaptations to become programmed and persist throughout life. However, adaptations that are beneficial to maintaining homeostasis in one's early environment may result in extreme response strategies that confer vulnerability or dysfunction later in life. This review summarizes recent findings in human and animal studies demonstrating that early life pain results in a hypo-sensitive/hyper-sensitive phenotype in response to acute and persistent pain and stress later in life. Changes in cognition and immune function in response to early life pain have also been observed. Recent data on the neural mechanisms underlying these long-term changes are discussed, as well as potential strategies to minimize the impact of early life pain.

AB Four different models have been generally proposed as plausible etiological explanations for the relation between personality and psychopathology, namely, the vulnerability, complication, pathoplasty, and spectrum or continuity model. The current study entails a joint investigation of the continuity, pathoplasty, and complication models to explain the nature of the associations between early maladaptive traits and psychopathology over time in 717 referred and community children (54.4% girls), aged from 8 to 14 years. Across a 2-year time span, maladaptive traits and psychopathology were measured at three different time points, thereby relying on comprehensive and age-specific dimensional operationalizations of both personality symptoms and psychopathology. The results demonstrate overall compelling evidence for the continuity model, finding more focused support for pathoplasty and complication effects for particular combinations of personality symptoms and psychopathology dimensions. As expected, the continuity associations were found to be more robust for those personality-psychopathology associations that are conceptually closer, such as the emotional instability/introversion-internalizing problems association and the disagreeableness-externalizing problems association. Continuity associations were also stronger when personality was considered from a maladaptive rather than from a general trait perspective. The implication of the findings for the treatment of psychopathology and personality symptoms are briefly discussed.

AB This study investigated the role of the interaction between prosocial behavior and contextual (school and neighborhood) risk in children's trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems at ages 3, 5, and 7. The sample was 9,850 Millennium Cohort Study families who lived in England when the cohort children were aged 3. Neighborhood context was captured by the proportion of subsidized (social rented) housing in the neighborhood and school context by school-level achievement. Even after adjustment for child-and family-level covariates, prosocial behavior was related both to lower levels of problem behavior at school entry and to its trajectory before and after. Neighborhood social housing was related to the trajectory of problem behavior, and school-level achievement to lower levels of problem behavior at school entry. The negative association between prosocial and problem behavior was stronger for children attending low-performing schools or living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The adverse "effect" of low prosocial behavior, associated with low empathy and guilt and with constricted emotionality, on internalizing and externalizing problems appears to be exacerbated in high-risk contexts.

AB Depression symptoms are associated with impairments in functioning and have substantial health and economic consequences. Universal substance misuse prevention programs have shown effects on non-targeted mental health-related symptoms, but long-term effects are understudied. This cluster randomized controlled trial examined effects of both the LifeSkills Training (LST) and Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP 10-14) interventions, delivered during seventh grade, on age 22 young adult depression symptoms. The study was conducted in US rural Midwestern communities with a randomly-selected sample from a larger study (N = 670). Experimental conditions were LST+SFP 10-14, LST-only, and a control condition. Effects on age 22 depression symptoms were hypothesized as mediated through effects on age 21 relationship problems and illicit use of substances. Structural equation modeling with manifest and latent variables was conducted to test hypotheses; the intervention conditions were combined and compared with the control condition because analyses indicated a comparable pattern of effects between intervention conditions. Significant indirect intervention effects were found on age 22 depression symptoms via effects on the mediating variables (indirect effect: beta = -0.06, 95 % CI [-0.10, -0.01], p = 0.011). Effect sizes for the young adult variables were between d = 0.17 and 0.29, which can be considered small, but nontrivial, especially in the context of public health benefits. Results support scaled-up implementation of school-based and family-focused universal substance misuse preventive interventions.

AB The aim of the present study was to gain new insights into the dark and bright sides of identity formation with a sample of 1851 Japanese adolescents and emerging adults, applying a three-dimensional model of identity formation (i.e., commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment). By means of cluster analysis, we identified five statuses that strongly resembled statues extracted in prior research with Western youth: achievement, foreclosure, moratorium, diffusion, and searching moratorium. We found that each status reported a distinct profile in terms of personality and psychosocial problems. Importantly, we found that the searching moratorium status was adaptive in adolescence but not in emerging adulthood. These results suggest that the five statuses are replicable in Japanese adolescents and emerging adults, and that the searching moratorium status presents a combination of the bright and dark sides whose prevalence varies with age. Clinical implications for identity research and intervention programs are discussed. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The measurement of aggression in its different forms (e.g., physical and verbal) and functions (e.g., impulsive and instrumental) is given little attention in subjects with developmental disabilities (DD). In this study, we confirm the factor structure of the Children's Scale for Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (C-SHARP) and demonstrate measurement invariance (consistent performance across clinical groups) between clinic-referred groups with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We also provide evidence of the construct validity of the C-SHARP. Methods: Caregivers provided C-SHARP, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Proactive/Reactive Rating Scale (PRRS) ratings for 644 children, adolescents, and young adults 2-21 years of age. Five types of measurement invariance were evaluated within a confirmatory factor analytic framework. Associations among the C-SHARP, CBCL, and PRRS were explored. Results: The factor structure of the C-SHARP had a good fit to the data from both groups, and strict measurement invariance between ASD and non-ASD groups was demonstrated (i.e., equivalent structure, factor loadings, item intercepts and residuals, and latent variance/covariance between groups). The C-SHARP Problem Scale was more strongly associated with CBCL Externalizing than with CBCL Internalizing, supporting its construct validity. Subjects classified with the PRRS as both Reactive and Proactive had significantly higher C-SHARP Proactive Scores than those classified as Reactive only, who were rated significantly higher than those classified by the PRRS as Neither Reactive nor Proactive. A similar pattern was observed for the C-SHARP Reactive Score. Conclusions: This study provided evidence of the validity of the C-SHARP through confirmation of its factor structure and its relationship with more established scales. The demonstration of measurement invariance demonstrates that differences in C-SHARP factor scores were the result of differences in the construct rather than to error or unmeasured/nuisance variables. These data suggest that the C-SHARP is useful for quantifying subtypes of aggressive behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults with DD.

AB This study investigated parenting behaviors of mothers and fathers of clinically anxious preschool children (with or without depressive comorbidity) and healthy comparison children. Studies assessing children from early school age onwards have found that parental control, rejection, and inconsistent discipline are associated with the presence of children's internalizing symptoms/disorders. Despite the scarcity of studies investigating these associations at preschool age, we assumed that findings with older children would also apply to children in this age group. In a cross-sectional study we assessed N = 176 children of preschool age (M = 5; 2 years) and both of their parents. A diagnostic interview (Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment) was conducted to determine children's psychiatric diagnoses, yielding the following results: a group of n = 67 children with pure anxiety disorders (AD group), a group of n = 38 children with anxiety disorders with depressive comorbidity (AD/DC group), and a comparison group of n = 71 children without psychiatric disorders. Both parents completed the German extended version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire. We evaluated maternal depressive symptoms and children's temperament as further correlates. All variables that differed significantly between groups were entered into multinomial logistic regression analyses to test which variables predict group membership. When comparing each of the two anxiety groups with the comparison group we obtained the following results: (1) Inconsistent paternal discipline and maternal depressive symptoms increased and children's positive affectivity decreased the probability of children of being in the AD group rather than in the comparison group. (2) Maternal overinvolvement, maternal depressive symptoms and children's negative affectivity increased and children's positive affectivity decreased the probability of children of belonging to the AD/DC group rather than to the comparison group. When comparing the two anxiety groups with each other, we found that inconsistent paternal discipline increased and children's negative affectivity decreased the probability of children of being in the AD group rather than in the AD/DC group. The results suggest that paternal parenting behaviors show different associations with internalizing disorders at preschool age than maternal parenting behaviors. This underlines the importance of including fathers in the prevention and treatment of internalizing disorders at preschool age.

AB Objective: Recent studies have highlighted the impact of coexisting mental health problems in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). No twin studies to date have reported on individuals meeting diagnostic criteria of ASD. This twin study reports on the etiological overlap between the diagnosis of ASD and emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, and conduct problems measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Method: Genetic and environmental influences on the covariance between ASD and coexisting problems were estimated, in line with the correlated risks model prediction. Phenotypic causality models were also fitted to explore alternative explanations of comorbidity: namely, that coexisting problems are the result of or result in ASD symptoms; that they increase recognition of ASD; or that they arise due to an over-observation bias/confusion when differentiating between phenotypes.
   Results: More than 50% of twins with broad spectrum/ASD met the borderline/abnormal levels cut-off criteria for emotional symptoms or hyperactivity, and approximately 25% met these criteria for the 3 reported problems. In comparison, between 13% and 16% of unaffected twins scored above the cut-offs. The phenotypic correlation between ASD and emotional symptoms was explained entirely by genetic influences and accompanied by a moderate genetic correlation (0.42). The opposite was true for the overlap with conduct problems, as nonshared-environmental factors had the strongest impact. For hyperactivity, the best-fitting model suggested a unidirectional phenotypic influence of hyperactivity on ASD.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest a possible effect of hyperactivity on identification of ASD. The lack of genetic influences on conduct problems ASD overlap further supports the genetic independence of these 2 phenotypes. Finally, the co-occurrence of emotional symptoms in ASD, compared to other co-occurring problems, is completely explained by common genetic effects.

AB In this study we investigated whether witnessing violence and violence victimization were associated with children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and examined the mediating role of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in these relationships. Secondary data analysis was conducted using 3 waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Path analyses were conducted to test direct and indirect effects of violence exposure on behavior problems, using 2,064 children (ages 8-15 years) reported to Child Protective Services for maltreatment. Being a victim of violence in the home was directly associated with more internalizing (beta = .06, p = .007) and externalizing behavior problems (beta = .07, p = .002), whereas witnessing violence was not directly related to either internalizing (beta = .04, p = .056) or externalizing behavior problems (beta = .03, p = .130). PTS symptoms mediated the effects of witnessing violence and violence victimization on internalizing behavior problems (beta = .02, p = .002). Our findings suggest that PTS symptoms may be a mechanism underlying the association between violence exposure and internalizing behavior problems (R-2 = .23), underscoring the potential importance of assessing PTS symptoms and providing targeted trauma-focused interventions for children exposed to violence at home.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across the life span. We sought to identify medical and behavioral problems associated with a history of a parent-reported diagnosis of depression in a large sample of school-aged children and adolescents with ASD.
   METHODS: A sample of 1272 participants (aged 6-17 years; mean [SD]: 9.56 [2.79] years) from the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network consortium were divided into "ever-depressed" (n = 89) and "nondepressed" (n = 1183) groups on the basis of caregiver endorsement of children's current or previous diagnoses of depression.
   RESULTS: In total, 7.0% of children with ASD (4.8% of those aged 6-12 years and 20.2% of those aged 13-17 years) were reported to have a history of a depression diagnosis. Positive depression history was associated with greater chronological age, higher IQ, and Asperger disorder diagnosis. After controlling for age, IQ, and within-spectrum categorical diagnosis, the ever-depressed group exhibited significantly greater rates of seizure disorders (odds ratio = 2.64) and gastrointestinal problems (odds ratio = 2.59) and trend-level differences in aggression, somatic complaints, and social impairments. The groups did not differ in autism severity, repetitive behaviors, sleep problems, eating problems, self-injurious behavior, or current intervention use.
   CONCLOSIONS: Co-occurring depression is a particularly common problem in higher-functioning older children within the Autism Treatment Network. Our findings indicate that children with ASD and a history of a depression diagnosis are more likely to also have co-occurring medical problems, although the presence and direction of causality is unclear.

AB Individuals exposed to childhood adversities (CA) present with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties in later life, which have been identified as risk and maintenance factors for psychopathologies. However, it is unclear if CA negatively impacts on ER capacity per se or whether observed regulation difficulties are a function of the challenging circumstances in which ER is being deployed. In this longitudinal study, we aimed to clarify this association by investigating the behavioral and neural effects of exposure to common moderate CA (mCA) on a laboratory measure of ER capacity in late adolescence/young adulthood. Our population-derived samples of adolescents/young adults (N = 53) were administered a film-based ER-task during functional magnetic resonance imaging that allowed evaluation of ER across mCA-exposure. mCA-exposure was associated with enhanced ER capacity over both positive and negative affect. At the neural level, the better ER of negative material in those exposed to mCA was associated with reduced recruitment of ER-related brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and temporal gyrus. In addition mCA-exposure was associated with a greater down-regulation of the amygdala during ER of negative material. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the effects of mCA on the emergence of resilience in adolescence are discussed.

AB Excessive internet use has been linked to psychopathology. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental risks underpinning internet use and their relation to psychopathology is important. This study aims to explore the genetic and environmental etiology of internet use measures and their associations with internalizing disorders and substance use disorders. The sample included 2,059 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) young adult twins from the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS). Younger participants reported more frequent internet use, while women were more likely to use the internet for interpersonal communication. Familial aggregation in frequency of internet use' was entirely explained by additive genetic factors accounting for 41% of the variance. Familial aggregation in frequency of use after 11 pm', using the internet to contact peers', and using the internet primarily to access social networking sites' was attributable to varying combinations of additive genetic and shared environmental factors. In terms of psychopathology, there were no significant associations between internet use measures and major depression (MD), but there were positive significant associations between frequency of internet use' and frequency of use after 11 pm' with social phobia (SP). Using the internet to contact peers' was positively associated with alcohol abuse, whereas using the internet to contact peers' and using the internet primarily to access social networking sites' were negatively associated with cannabis use disorders and nicotine symptoms. Individual differences in internet use can be attributable to varying degrees of genetic and environmental risks. Despite some significant associations of small effect, variation in internet use appears mostly unrelated to psychopathology.

AB Adolescents' sleep duration was examined as a moderator of the association between perceived discrimination and internalizing (anxiety, depression) and externalizing symptoms. Participants were 252 adolescents (mean: 15.79years; 66% European American, 34% African American) who reported on their perceived discrimination (racial and general) and adjustment. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Moderation effects were evident. The lowest levels of internalizing symptoms were observed for adolescents with longer sleep duration in conjunction with lower levels of perceived racial discrimination. Further, general perceived discrimination was associated more strongly with externalizing behaviours for youth with shorter versus longer sleep. Findings highlight the importance of sleep as a bioregulatory system that can ameliorate or exacerbate the effects of discrimination on youths' adjustment.

AB The aims of the present study were to (a) examine the factor structure of the Self-Report Coping Scale in a sample of Chinese early adolescents and (b) explore associations between coping and socioemotional functioning in this sample. Participants were N= 569 elementary school students (307 boys) in Grades 4 to 6. Participants completed a measure of coping in response to an argument with a friend. Students' functioning across multiple domains was assessed using self, peer, and teacher reports. Results suggested a five-factor model of coping in Chinese early adolescents (problem solving, seeking social support, internalizing, externalizing, distancing). In support of predictions, internalizing and distancing coping were positively related to adjustment indices, whereas seeking social support and problem-solving coping were negatively related to outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of the important role of coping for adolescents' adjustment across multiple domains and in relation to recent shifts in traditional Chinese cultural values.

AB This study investigated the mediation role played by children's executive function in the relationship between exposure to mild maternal depressive symptoms and problem behaviors. At ages 2, 3, and 6 years, 143 children completed executive function tasks and a verbal ability test. Mothers completed the Beck Depression Inventory at each time-point, and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at child age 6. Longitudinal autoregressive mediation models showed a mediation effect that was significant and quite specific; executive function (and not verbal ability) at age 3 mediated the path between mothers' depressive symptoms (but not general social disadvantage) at the first time-point and children's externalizing and internalizing problems at age 6. Improving children's executive functioning might protect them against the adverse effects of exposure to maternal depressive symptoms. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The purpose of the present article is to examine the multiple ways in which the private lives of professionals are affected by involvement with child abuse intervention and prevention. Using a descriptive-phenomenological perspective and 40 in-depth interviews with professionals to present a model based on qualitative data, we studied the ways in which child abuse professionals conceptualize, understand, and integrate their experiences into their personal and family lives. We find that the process of internalizing child abuse knowledge occurs in two domains: One affirms or denies the existence of the phenomenon; the other concerns the strategies used to contend with the effects of working in abuse. Knowledge of child abuse is toxic, in the sense that it serves as a catalyst leading to the alteration of one's self-perception and parental identity. We present a typology of self-alteration resulting from child abuse knowledge and describe the mechanism of this change.

AB Although several studies have addressed developmental trajectories from childhood to adolescence of internalizing/externalizing problems, limited attention has been given to underweight children. Two groups were recruited for this study from a community sample: underweight (Ug, N = 80, 50% female) and normal weight (NWg, N = 80, 50% female) to examine the developmental trajectories of body mass index and emotional-behavioral functioning of underweight children from the age two years, and their risk of eating disorder at early adolescence. The study was organized over four waves, each of three years. Pediatricians measured BMI, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Eating Disorders Inventory-Referral Form (EDI-3-RF). Our results showed that children in the two groups recorded different BMI trajectories over time. In NWg, male and female subjects started from a higher BMI at T1 than their peers. In Ug, internalizing and externalizing problems in males and females remained higher than their peers at all points of assessment. Males and females in Ug scored higher than those in NWg on EDI-3-RF total score. Our results indicate a need for effective physical and psychological assessment of underweight children in community samples to prevent psychological difficulties and eating disorders in adolescence.

AB Background: Serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) variants have been extensively studied in psychiatric disorders. Although gender effects have been reported, they have not been comprehensively reviewed.
   The aim of our study was to summarize literature findings on 5-HTTLPR and gender differences in affective disorders.
   Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO databases was performed for dates until January 2015. The included articles (n=78) analyzed the association between 5-HTTLPR and affective spectrum disorders, taking into account gender. The quality of each study was assessed through STROBE and CONSORT.
   Results: 5-HTTLPR modulation of affective disorders varied by gender. The S allele (or SS genotype) seemed to be differently associated with an increased risk of depression, depressive symptoms, anxiety traits and symptoms, and symptoms of internalizing behavior among women and an increased risk of aggressiveness, conduct disorder and symptom counts of externalizing behavior among men. Moreover, the presence of stressful life events reinforced the association. Interestingly, these differences seemed to begin with adolescence and were not consistent among the elderly, suggesting a plausible role of hormonal fluctuations.
   Limitations: The review is limited by the small number of included papers, due to the paucity of information in the literature regarding 5-HTTLPR and gender.
   Conclusions: 5-HTTLPR variants may exert a differential modulation on a number of features depending on gender. Further studies are needed to more deeply investigate the effect of 5-HTTLPR x gender on the modulation of affective disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present and discuss a novel research approach, the baseline target moderated mediation (BTMM) design, that holds substantial promise for advancing our understanding of how genetic research can inform prevention research. We first discuss how genetically informed research on developmental psychopathology can be used to identify potential intervention targets. We then describe the BTMM design, which employs moderated mediation within a longitudinal study to test whether baseline levels of intervention targets moderate the impact of the intervention on change in that target, and whether change in those targets mediates causal impact of preventive or treatment interventions on distal health outcomes. We next discuss how genetically informed BTMM designs can be applied to both microtrials and full-scale prevention trials. We use simulated data to illustrate a BTMM, and end with a discussion of some of the advantages and limitations of this approach.

AB The central objective of the current study was to evaluate how executive functions (EF), and specifically cognitive flexibility, were concurrently and predictively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Adolescents (N=220) and their parents participated in this longitudinal investigation. Adolescents' EF was assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) during the initial assessment, and symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders were reported by mothers and youths concurrently and 2 years later. Correlational analyses suggested that youths who made more total errors (TE), including both perseverative errors (PE) and nonperseverative errors (NPE), concurrently exhibited significantly more depressive symptoms. Adolescents who made more TE and those who made more NPE tended to have more anxiety symptoms 2 years later. Structural equation modeling analyses accounting for key explanatory variables (e.g., IQ, disruptive behavior disorders, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder) showed that TE was concurrently associated with parent reports of adolescent depressive symptoms. The results suggest internalizing psychopathology is associated with global (TE) and nonspecific (NPE) EF difficulties but not robustly associated with cognitive inflexibility (PE). Future research with the WCST should consider different sources of errors that are posited to reflect divergent underlying neural mechanisms, conferring differential vulnerability for emerging mental health problems.

AB Background: Emerging research suggests significant positive associations between bullying and substance use behaviors. However, these studies typically focused either on the link between substance use and bullying perpetration or victimization, and few have conceptualized bullying perpetration and/or victimization as mediators. Objective: In this study, we simultaneously tested past bullying perpetration and victimization as mediational pathways from retrospective report of parenting styles and global self-esteem to current depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems. Methods: Data were collected from a college sample of 419 drinkers. Mediation effects were conducted using a bias-corrected bootstrap technique within a structural equation modeling framework. Results: Two-path mediation analyses indicated that mother and father authoritativeness were protective against bully victimization and depression through higher self-esteem. Conversely, having a permissive or authoritarian mother was positively linked to bullying perpetration, which in turn, was associated with increased alcohol use, and to a lesser degree, more alcohol-related problems. Mother authoritarianism was associated with alcohol-related problems through depressive symptoms. Three-path mediation analyses suggested a trend in which individuals with higher self-esteem were less likely to report alcohol-related problems through lower levels of bullying victimization and depression. Conclusions/Importance: Results suggested that bullying perpetration and victimization may, respectively, serve as externalizing and internalizing pathways through which parenting styles and self-esteem are linked to depression and alcohol-related outcomes. The present study identified multiple modifiable precursors of, and mediational pathways to, alcohol-related problems which could guide the development and implementation of prevention programs targeting problematic alcohol use.

AB Prenatal stress negatively affects fetal development, which in turn may affect infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and behavioral functioning. We examined effects of exposure to a traumatic stressor in families [ intimate partner violence (IPV)] on both infants' HPA axis reactivity to stress and their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Infants (n = 182, 50% girls, (x) over bar age = 11.77 months) were exposed to a laboratory challenge task designed to induce frustration and anger (i.e. arm restraint). Saliva samples were taken pre-task and 20 and 40 min post-task and then assayed for cortisol. Mothers reported on their pregnancy and postpartum IPV history, current mental health, substance use and their infants' behaviors. Structural equation modeling revealed that prenatal, but not postnatal, IPV was independently associated with infant cortisol reactivity and problem behavior. Maternal mental health predicted infant behavioral functioning but not infant HPA axis reactivity. These findings are consistent with the prenatal programing hypothesis; that is, early life stress affects later risk and vulnerability for altered physiological and behavioral regulation.

AB This study explores the transmission of trauma in 30 Middle Eastern refugee families in Denmark, where one or both parents were referred for treatment of PTSD symptoms and had non-traumatized children aged 4-9 years. The aim of the study was to explore potential risk and protective factors by examining the association between intra-family communication style regarding the parents' traumatic experiences from the past, children's psychosocial adjustment and attachment security. A negative impact of parental trauma on children might be indicated, as children's Total Difficulties Scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were significantly higher than the Danish norms. A negative association between children's attachment security as measured by the Attachment and Traumatization Story Task and higher scores on the SDQ Total Difficulties Scale approached significance, suggesting that the transmission of trauma may be associated with disruptions in children's attachment representations. Furthermore a significant association between parental trauma communication and children's attachment style was found.

AB Most existing research on children adopted internationally has focused on those adopted as infants and toddlers. The current study longitudinally tracked several outcomes, including cognitive, behavioral, emotional, attachment, and family functioning, in 25 children who had been internationally adopted at school age (M=7.7 years old at adoption, SD=3.4, range=4-15years). We examined the incidence of clinically significant impairments, significant change in outcomes over the three study points, and variables that predicted outcomes over time. Clinically significant impairments in sustained attention, full-scale intelligence, reading, language, executive functioning, externalizing problems, and parenting stress were common, with language and executive functioning impairments present at higher levels in the current study compared with past research focusing on children adopted as infants and toddlers. Over the three study points, significant improvements across most cognitive areas and attachment functioning were observed, though significant worsening in executive functioning and internalizing problems was present. Adoptive family-specific variables, such as greater maternal education, smaller family size, a parenting approach that encouraged age-expected behaviors, home schooling, and being the sole adopted child in the family were associated with greater improvement across several cognitive outcomes. In contrast, decreased parenting stress was predicted by having multiple adopted children and smaller family sizes were associated with greater difficulties with executive functioning. Child-specific variables were also linked to outcomes, with girls displaying worse attachment and poorer cognitive performance and with less time in orphanage care resulting in greater adoption success. Implications for future research and clinical applications are discussed.

AB This study examined how a Korean family with temporary immigrant status in the United States employed ideological discourses on languages to make sense of their experiences. The parents initially accepted but later rejected ideologies on children's learning of English. English-as-a-legitimate-language ideology in the United States and English-as-linguistic-capital ideology challenged the parents' efforts to teach their children Korean. The focal child showed a sign of internalizing the language ideologies dominant at school. This study urges educators to pay attention to immigrant parents' perspectives on their children's language experiences and the impact of English-only ideology on the experiences of transnational families and children.

AB This study tested a theoretical relationship between trauma exposure, youth coping strategies and peer, family and community level factors on psychological distress and well-being among 399 trauma-affected youth in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze paths and to assess differences in relationships by gender. Psychological distress was measured by self-reports of internalizing problems (depression and anxiety), externalizing problems (aggression and behavioral problems) and somatic complaints (pain without medical cause). Self-reports of happiness, hope and self-esteem were measures of well-being. Findings from this study suggest gender differences in how individual coping strategies and external factors explain mental health resilience in trauma-affected youth. Problem-focused coping strategies were associated with higher psychological distress in both boys and girls. Use of avoidance was associated with better well-being in girls and boys and use of faith-based coping strategies was associated with better well-being in boys. Use of both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies (coping flexibility) resulted in lower psychological distress in boys and girls. The home environment including closeness to family, caregiver post traumatic stress disorder and violence in the home was associated with psychological distress and well-being. Having close peer relationships, village safety and enrollment in school benefited well-being. Results from these SEM of resilience suggest that interventions should (1) work to build the coping repertoire of youth, (2) support reduction in psychological distress through improved family relationships and caregiver mental health and (3) target improved well-being through support of positive peer and community relationships and school enrollment.

AB From the very first efforts to analyze children and adolescents to the present day, child and adolescent analysis has been denigrated in the analytic community. It has been viewed as "women's work" and regarded as clinically inferior to the analysis of adults. It has been seen as less important for understanding the psyche and in the training of psychoanalysts. This attitude is rationalized by observations that children and adolescents engage psychological material differently than adults do, so that, it is claimed, child and adolescent analysis is severely limited compared to adult analysis with regard to the material available for analysis. Beliefs that children require socialization lead some child analysts to indoctrinate children and sacrifice a respectful exploratory and uncovering approach. The situation of child analysis reflects larger social phenomenona, namely childism and sexism, the prejudices against children and women, as these prejudices are elaborated in our culture. Like others, child analysts respond to being the objects of prejudice by both isolating ourselves, reacting against the prejudice, and internalizing the prejudice. This paper includes clinical and institutional illustrations of these prejudices in action.

AB Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious in treating both internalizing and
   [GRAPHIC]
   externalizing disorders in youth. As a result, there is an increasing demand among consumers for CBT, unfortunately, community clinical settings are not adequately equipped to competently adopt and sustain CBT practice. Large-scale, system-wide changes are necessary to transform usual care treatment systems. Fortunately, there is a rich, burgeoning literature that documents barriers to dissemination and implementation of EVBP's. Present system limitations include a need for greater system-wide collaboration, more effective and efficient delivery of training and supervision, better alternatives to quality assurance methods that include pay for performance initiatives, documentation of clinical outcomes that CBT delivers, and innovations to mental health financing methods. Furthermore, psychologists must consider new ways to actively market, promote and brand CBT to change provider attitudes, influence practitioner behavior, and transform treatment as usual. Psychologists have a unique opportunity to transform the delivery of mental health services to youth.

AB The present study examined emotion regulation as a potential mechanism in the relationship between Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among 50 inpatient adolescents receiving psychiatric care at an inpatient mental hospital. PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses and bias-corrected bootstrapping techniques supported emotion dysregulation as a mechanism underlying the association between PTSD and depression symptoms. These findings support the notion that adolescents with clinical levels of PTSD symptoms may engage in ineffective emotion regulation strategies, such as emotional avoidance and suppression, which may, in turn, be associated with increased depression. Findings and implications are discussed.

AB Compared to those without disabilities, individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are at increased risk of experiencing victimization across the lifespan. In this chapter, we discuss the progression of victimization from child abuse in early childhood, to bullying during the school-age years, and finally to criminal victimization in adulthood. We begin with a discussion of the notion that victimization is a lifelong concern for individuals with IDD. We then describe the methodological difficulties in establishing reliable definitions and prevalence rates for specific forms of victimization. After noting these limitations, we discuss three types of victimization in greater detail. In terms of child abuse, we discuss the prevalence of abuse among children with disabilities, while also discussing risk factors and potential prevention and intervention strategies. Next, we discuss the experiences of bullying of adolescents with IDD, while providing information on why these students are at increased risk and which prevention and intervention strategies might be implemented to reduce bullying of students with IDD. Finally, we discuss criminal forms of victimization experienced by adults with IDD, while noting specific risk factors that increase risk and the importance of prevention and intervention strategies. We end this chapter with a call for additional longitudinal victimization investigations to better understand the lifespan perspective of victimization and the relation between risk factors and experiences; an emphasis on the relation between disability etiology and experiences of victimization; and a focus on resilience and well-being of individuals with IDD who experience victimization.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder in adolescence and results severe impairment. Few psychosocial interventions aim at ADHD in adolescence and are rarely evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, an intervention combining adolescent-directed problem-solving and organizational skills training with behavioral parent and teacher training has been developed. Its efficacy in comparison to waiting list and active controls is reported.
   One hundred thirteen adolescents (mean age = 13.99 years) with ADHD were randomly assigned to the training, a waiting list or an active control condition (progressive muscle relaxation [PMR]). Parents and teachers rated ADHD symptoms, academic enablers, and comorbid problems before and after. Results: The training significantly reduced ADHS symptoms and parent-and teacher-rated internalizing problems and increased teacher rated academic enablers compared to waiting list controls. Compared to active controls, results were in the range of small nonsignificant effects. A skills training is an efficacious treatment for adolescent ADHD, however, not significantly superior to PMR. Contrasts between both interventions need to be further investigated.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 and the Caregiver /Teacher Report Form are one of the most widely internationally recognized instruments to evaluate desadaptative behaviors which may affect the current and future development of preschool children. The psychometric behavior of both instruments was evaluated in a socioeconomically diverse sample of 550 Chilean preschool children. In general, it was observed an analog behavior of both compared to the one obtained with studies in other societies. The confirmatory factor analysis showed a suitable adjustment of the original bifactor model. However, in the CBCL, the scores obtained are higher than in most of the countries and, comparatively, in both instruments, a greater effect of gender was observed. The findings obtained are analyzed and, normative and conceptual suggestions are given for the use of both instruments in preschool children in our country.

AB Many children with anxiety disorders live in communities with limited access to treatment. Attention bias modification training, a promising computer-based treatment for anxiety disorders, may provide a readily accessible treatment. Recent evidence suggests that a form of ABMT combining visual-search for positive stimuli with features to enhance learning, memory and treatment engagement reduces anxiety in children. The present study builds upon this research by comparing parent-implemented, visual-search attention training to positive stimuli (ATP) (N = 22) with a waitlist control group (WLC) (N = 19) in children living in regional communities. Diagnostic, parent-and child-reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms and broad internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems were assessed pre-and post-condition. Children in the WLC completed visual-search ATP after the wait period and all participants completed a follow-up assessment six-months after treatment. At post-treatment/ wait period, children in the ATP condition showed greater improvements on clinician-and parent-report measures compared to children in the WLC. Similar post-treatment outcomes as those found for the ATP condition were observed at the six-month follow-up after all children had received ATP. Moreover, children who showed greater verbalization of explicit attention strategies related to positive search (assessed during treatment) achieved greater reductions in anxiety severity at post-treatment and six-month follow-up. Attention training towards positive stimuli using enhanced visual-search procedures appears to be a promising treatment for reaching anxious children living in regional communities.

AB The study presented describes severity and conditions of various psychiatric symptoms in children from families seeking refuge in Germany 2007-2009 and registered in the province of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Mothers of 58 children (aged 12 years on average, 23 girls, 33 boys) answered the items of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991). First, the burden of disease among refugee children was compared to standard burdens of German children. Second, the extent of symptoms was predicted by person- and context-related factors. Internalizing symptoms were predicted by more proximal factors, such as parental burden of stress and parental education. Externalizing symptoms and social problems were rather predicted by the length of stay in Germany, the reason for migration, the school career and parental education. On one hand, the study underscores the immediate need for intervention among refugee parents and children. On the other hand, structural factors in the country of arrival (length of stay, schooling) play an important role.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the performance of executive functions in children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on internalizing and externalizing associated comorbid symptoms. 45 children aged 8 to 14 with ADHD were assessed with executive function tests. The results showed that the group of children with internalizing symptoms has underperformed in relation to organization and planning and motor inhibition, and the group of children with externalizing symptoms underperformed motor inhibition compared to children without comorbid symptoms, which would indicate that the analyzed variables allow collaborating with the diagnostic evaluation process of the disorder. Be able to describe the executive function disorder performance in relation to various comorbid associations would enable a better understanding of the entity and an adequate differential diagnosis.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of parental and personal characteristics on children's internalizing/externalizing problems. Further, this study aimed to examine personal characteristics (self-esteem, peer relations) as mediators in the relation between parenting and internalizing/externalizing problems. In order to address these questions, this study used a cross-sectional design. The sample included 588 pre-adolescents and adolescents (10-14 years old) and their mothers. Children completed the My Memories of Upbringing Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (child report), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Friendship Quality Questionnaire, and the Harter's Self Perception Profile (Social acceptance subscale), while mothers completed The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent report). Results support a model for the influence of both direct and indirect effects on children's internalizing/externalizing problems.

Social and relational data was examined on 22 fourth-grade elementary school students. Results of bivariate (Pearson) correlations indicate that internalizing problems demonstrated a positive relationship with verbal and relational bullying and externalizing problems demonstrated a positive relationship with physical, verbal, and relational victimization. The authors discuss implications and strength-based strategies for bullying prevention.

The expected interaction between time and condition was such that participants in the PCIT group experienced a significantly greater decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior problems compared to participants in the TAU group. This interaction was not significant regarding parenting stress or child abuse potential between the PCIT and TAU conditions. There was a significant increase in positive caregiver skills from pretreatment to posttreatment for the PCIT group; however, there was not a significant decrease in caregiver negative talk.

AB Introduction: Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common type of pediatric idiopathic generalized epilepsy, characterized by multiple seizures of typical absence, with typical EEG pattern consisting in bilateral synchronous and symmetrical discharges of generalized 3 Hz spike-wave (SWDs).
   Recently, some researchers have suggested that the underlying epileptogenic mechanism of absence seizures selectively involves the frontal cortical circuits, also supported by video-electroencephalography data(3). These data may be considered as a new window in CAE comprehension and management, particularly about symptoms different from seizure that children affected may present.
   In this light, aim of the present study is evaluating the presence of internalizing problems in prepubertal children affected by CAE.
   Material and methods: 18 patients (10 females, 8 males) ranging age from 8-11 years (mean age 9.36 +/- 1.32) affected by typical CAE were recruited. Control group was composed by 43 subjects (32 females, 11 males) (mean age 8.54 +/- 2.01). All subjects were screened for internalizing symptoms with SAFA-A scale and CDI test.
   Results: The two groups were comparable for age (p= 0.117) and sex distribution (p= 0.251). CAE children showed significantly higher score than controls for anxiety (p< 0.001) and depressive symptoms screening tests (p< 0.001) (Table 1).
   Conclusions: Results of present study suggest the importance of screening for anxiety and depressive signs in CAE children, in order to optimize their management beyond the exclusive idea to control and stop epileptic seizure only.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the reliability and ability of the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory to discriminate parents in an Italian sample who are physically child abusive and physically nonabusive parents. The CAP Inventory and measures on parenting stress (PSI-SF) and parents' attributions of child adjustment (CBCL) were administered in a sample of 37 abusive and 102 nonabusive parents in an Italian sample: Both groups of the respondents were similar in age, gender, marital status, and education. The Abuse scale showed adequate internal consistency (alpha = .86) and 52 items significantly discriminate between abusive and nonabusive parents. Moreover, the mean score of abusive parents (M = 194.5) was significantly higher than the mean score of nonabusive parents (M = 78) and the Abuse scale was correlated with parenting stress and parental perceptions of maladjustment in children (in terms of internalizing and externalizing symptoms). Finally, with the cutoff suggested in the original version of the CAP Inventory (Milner, 1986) when abusive and nonabusive groups are compared (166), the Abuse scale correctly classified 70.3% of the abusive group and 100% of the nonabusive group. These results showed adequate reliability and validity of the Abuse scale for Italy.

AB This study examined the impact of posttraumatic symptoms and self-reported abuse on the MMPI-2-RF among female inmates (N = 212). Posttraumatic symptoms were related to demoralization and internalizing dysfunction. MMPI-2-RF scales related to behavioral and externalizing problems, conduct problems, anxiety, anger, fear, guilt, unusual beliefs, somatic complaints, ineffectiveness, stress, family problems, and social isolation were associated with posttraumatic symptoms and abuse. Findings indicate that the MMPI-2-RF has utility for examining the impact of abuse and posttraumatic symptoms in incarcerated women. Using a standardized instrument to examine the effects of trauma provides useful information for treatment management and planning.

AB Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, restricted interests, and repetitive patterns of behavior. This study examined quality of life (QoL) and related clinical factors in children with ASD, compared to children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), children with asthma, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: QoL was assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQLTM 4.0). Additionally, parents of the children provided sociodemographic information and filled out an evaluation questionnaire, child behavior check list (CBCL), and Turgay DSM-IV Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (T-DSM-IV-S). Results: The physical health, psychosocial health, social functioning, and scale total score of the ASD group were significantly lower than those of the three comparison groups. The school functioning score domain was lower in the ASD group than in the asthma and HC groups. In contrast, the emotional functioning domain assessments did not reveal statistically significant differences between the ASD group and the comparison groups. In the ASD group, the total problem score, inattention, and hyperactivity scores were significantly higher than both the asthma and HC groups, and the internalizing scores were higher than the healthy group. Conclusion: The poor QoL is most likely due to functional losses and problem behaviors related to ASD and may negatively affect not only children with ASD but also the whole life of the family.

AB Although numerous studies document a link between child sexual abuse and later sexual assault perpetration in men, little research has examined why this relationship exists. One potential mechanism may be emotional regulation difficulties. The current study utilizes a college sample of 132 men to examine the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties on the relationship between experiencing child sexual abuse and later sexual aggression. Although emotion regulation difficulties in general was not significantly related to sexual aggression, one facet, impulse control difficulties, emerged as a significant mediator of the relationship between child sexual abuse and sexual aggression. Intervention programs should focus on the care that children receive following sexual abuse, with particular emphasis on how emotion regulation abilities may be impacted.

AB This study examines the relationship between violence exposure and early substance use as mediated by trauma symptoms. The Assessment of Liability and Exposure to Substance Use and Antisocial Behavior Scale was used to assess violence exposure at age 10 and substance use by age 12. Mediation analysis indicated direct relationships between violence exposure and tobacco or illegal drug use and indirect relationships between violence exposure and girls' substance use through trauma symptoms. Practitioners should consider violence exposure as a risk factor for early substance use in high-risk youths and potential gender differences in trauma symptom pathways to early substance use.

AB Despite evidence that adult attachment insecurity has been linked to the perpetration of physical intimate violence, the mechanisms underlying this link need further exploration. The goal of this study was to evaluate the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties in the association between romantic attachment and the use of physical intimate partner violence. To this end, 611 students recruited from Chilean universities completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between dimensions of romantic attachment (anxiety over abandonment and avoidance of intimacy) and physical violence perpetration among both male and female participants. Implications for future research and clinical practice are presented herein.

AB Background: Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been shown to be related to a severe and/or chronic course of depression. This study investigated which psychological processes mediate this relationship.
   Method: A large sample of acute or recovered depressed individuals (N = 340) participated in an online survey assessing characteristics of depression, trauma exposure, and potential mediators (emotion regulation difficulties, attributional style, and attachment).
   Results: The experience of CM was related to more severe depression and more depressive episodes. In multiple mediation models, emotion dysregulation, a depressogenic attributional style, and avoidance in close relationships conjointly mediated the relationship between CM and depression severity as well as number of depressive episodes. However, a significant direct path between CM and depression characteristics remained. Exploratory analyses suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity was an important additional mediator in our sample.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide preliminary evidence for psychological mediators between CM and depression that may be promising targets for interventions tailored for the treatment of depression in this subgroup.

AB Background: Maternal depression and anxiety disorders are risk factors for the development of internalizing disorders in offspring. Maternal attachment has been discussed as one factor accounting for transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate child internalizing behavior at preschool age on a symptomatic and behavioral level and possible links to maternal mental health over time and maternal attachment style insecurity in a sample of postpartum depressed and anxious mothers. Sampling and Methods: Child internalizing behavior at preschool age was rated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), and during a mother-child free-play situation. We focused on child responsiveness as it has been linked to child internalizing behavior. Maternal attachment style insecurity was tested to mediate the link between maternal mental health (assessed postpartum and at preschool age with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders, SCID-I) and child internalizing behavior/child responsiveness. Of the overall sample (n = 58), 28 women were diagnosed with postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV, and 30 were healthy controls. Data were collected 3-9 months after delivery and at preschool age (mean = 4.6 years). Results: At preschool age, children of postpartum depressed and anxious mothers were rated significantly higher on child internalizing behavior by mothers, fathers, and additional caregivers compared to the control group. Child internalizing behavior rated by mothers was influenced by current psychiatric symptoms; maternal attachment style insecurity did not mediate this link. During interaction, children in the clinical group displayed significantly less child responsiveness compared to the control group. Maternal attachment style insecurity mediated the relationship between maternal mental health over time and child responsiveness. Conclusions: The results emphasize the need for interventions focusing on mother-child interaction and maternal attachment. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Cannabis is the illicit substance most widely used by adolescents. Certain personality traits such as impulsivity and sensation seeking, and the subjective effects experienced after substance use (e.g. euphoria or relaxation) have been identified as some of the main etiological factors of consumption. This study aims to categorize a sample of adolescent cannabis users based on their most dominant personality traits (internalizing and externalizing profile). Then, to make a comparison of both profiles considering a set of variables related to consumption, clinical severity and subjective effects experienced. From a cross-sectional design, 173 adolescents (104 men and 69 women) aged 13 to 18 asking for treatment for cannabis use disorder in an Addictive Behavior Unit (UCAD) from the hospital were recruited. For the assessment, an ad hoc protocol was employed to register consumption, the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MAGI) and the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) 49 item short form were also administered. Factor analysis suggested a two-profile solution: Introverted, Inhibited, Doleful, Dramatizing (-), Egotistic (-), Self-demeaning and Borderline tendency scales composed the internalizing profile, and Submissive (-), Unruly, Forceful, Conforming (-) and Oppositional scales composed the externalizing profile. The comparative analysis showed that the internalizing profile has higher levels of clinical severity and more subjective effects reported than the externalizing profile. These results suggest the need to design specific intervention strategies for each profile.

AB Adolescence is a time of increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems due to intense changes in many aspects of physical and psycho-social functioning. The starting point for the research presented in this paper is the Achenbach's multivariate statistical approach exploring the incidence of various problems specific to adolescence. The specific purpose of the paper was to examine the incidence of various psychopathological problems in younger adolescents: anxiety/depression, alienation, physical difficulties, aggression, rule-breaking, social issues, opinion and attention issues, as well as the incidence of specific groups of internalised and externalised problems. The paper also considered gender differences with regard to incidence of individual problems, and the relations between internalised and externalised problems. The results were also compared with the standard values established on a sample of Croatian children and adolescents investigated in the research conducted by Rudan et al. (2005).
   A total of 937 primary school students in the seventh and eighth grades from Zadar (476 female and 461 male adolescents) of an average age of 13 years participated in the research. The incidence of various problems was investigated with the use of the Youth Self-Report rating scale (YSR, Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). The results obtained for the entire sample show that adolescents exhibit a greater incidence of estimated internalised problems in comparison to externalised problems. The gender differences analysis shows that the incidence of estimated internalised problems is greater in female than in male adolescents. By examining the gender differences occurring in individual syndromes, the results exhibit differences in the incidence of the anxiety/depression and physical difficulties (more common in female adolescents) and rule-breaking - delinquency (more common in male adolescents). Furthermore, the research showed significant positive relations between internalised and externalised problems, and based on the comparison with the standard values established in previous research on adolescents (Rudan et al., 2005), this research shows a mild increase in the incidence of various estimated problems in adolescents.

AB Adolescent girls today suffer from internalizing problems such as somatic symptoms and mental health problems at higher rates compared to those of previous decades, and effective interventions are warranted. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of participating in an 8-month dance intervention. This qualitative study was embedded in a randomized controlled trial of a dance intervention for adolescent girls with internalizing problems. A total of 112 girls aged 13-18 were included in the study. The dance intervention group comprised 59 girls, 24 of whom were strategically chosen to be interviewed. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach. The experiences of the dance intervention resulted in five generic categories: (1) An Oasis from Stress, which represents the fundamental basis of the intervention; (2) Supportive Togetherness, the setting; (3) Enjoyment and Empowerment, the immediate effect; (4) Finding Acceptance and Trust in Own Ability, the outcome; and (5) Dance as Emotional Expression, the use of the intervention. One main category emerged, Finding Embodied Self-Trust That Opens New Doors, which emphasizes the increased trust in the self and the ability to approach life with a sense of freedom and openness. The central understanding of the adolescent girls' experiences was that the dance intervention enriched and gave access to personal resources. With the non-judgmental atmosphere and supportive togetherness as a safe platform, the enjoyment and empowerment in dancing gave rise to acceptance, trust in ability, and emotional expression. Taken together, this increased self-trust and they discovered a new ability to "claim space.'' Findings from this study may provide practical information on designing future interventions for adolescent girls with internalizing problems.

AB This cross-sectional study examined the hypothesis that parent-child emotion dialogues among interparental violence (IPV) exposed dyads (n = 30; 4-12 years) show less quality than dialogues among nonexposed dyads (n = 30; 4-12 years). Second, we examined whether parental posttraumatic stress symptoms and parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were associated with the quality of the dialogues. As expected, in the IPV-exposed group, quality of mother-child emotion dialogues was of lesser quality; dyads often showed a lack of elaboration in their dialogue; mothers showed less sensitive guidance; and children showed less cooperation and exploration, compared to dialogues, dyads, mothers, and children in the nonexposed group. Although maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and maternal history of ACEs were significantly higher in the IPV-exposed families than in the nonexposed families, these variables were not associated with the quality of emotion dialogues. Clinical implications and study limitations are discussed.

AB Background: Several recent studies highlighted that both attachment insecurity and emotion regulation difficulties form a key part of conceptual models of anorexia nervosa (AN), but they had never been analyzed in the same controlled study. Method: This study examined the attachment states of mind, assessed by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), and emotion regulation difficulties, measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), among 25 girls with AN diagnosis aged 14-18 years (M age=16.52, SD=1.23), and 25 general population controls, matched for gender, age, years of education and SES. Results. The AN group reported both significantly higher attachment insecurity (75% vs 46%, Fisher Exact Test, p=.04), dismissing (Ds) in particular (chi(2)=6.41, df=2, p=.03), and difficulties with emotion regulation than non-clinical controls. Two AAI's scales connected to Ds classification-idealization of mother and lack of recall-were significantly correlated to lack of emotional awareness and clarity. Conclusions. Our results provide support for conceptualization of AN emphasizing the role of attachment insecurity and emotional dysregulation in the development and maintenance of this restrictive type of eating disorder. These findings may have implications for treatment programs which may prove more fruitful integrating attachment-based intervention with clinical work focused on development of emotion regulation abilities.

AB Background: Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often found after repeated experiences of violence in childhood and adolescence, and it includes, additional to PTSD core symptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, instable relationships, and a high rate of comorbidity. Many therapists have concerns about the use of exposure-based treatments in this patient group. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; [Resick et al., 2007]) in its cognitive-only version (CPT-C) represents an effective alternative method, which does not need formal exposure. Besides presenting this method, the authors give an overview of evaluative studies and describe the application of this technique by a case example. Case Report: The patient sought out treatment after childhood sexual abuse. Besides PTSD, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The authors describe the use of CPT-C interventions, the course of treatment, treatment results, and demonstrate special features in the treatment of complex PTSD. Conclusions: The cognitive version of CPT, the CPTC, allows quitting formal exposure and is as effective as exposure-based methods. Therefore, CPT-C should be broader implemented in PTSD treatment, especially in the treatment of complex PTSD.

AB Peer interaction contributes strongly to children's development and learning, but the processes by which peer interaction is shaped in preschool classrooms, particularly classrooms in rural communities, are largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the patterns of peer interaction in rural preschool classrooms as a way to extrapolate how children influence each other in their day-to-day social interaction. Included in this study were 270 preschoolers (Mean age = 53 months, SD = 3.2) from 61 preschool classrooms located in rural communities that primarily served children from low-income families. Results of actor-partner interdependence models demonstrate significant homophily effects of children's learning related behaviors and language and literacy skills, after accounting for gender and problem behavior homophily. The similarity of learning-related behaviors between a dyad mediated the relationship between their problem behaviors and the frequency of peer interaction. Children's language and literacy skills were similar to the skills of their peers with whom they interacted more often toward the end of the academic year. These findings have implications for understanding and improving peer interaction in rural preschool classrooms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND
   Attachment is one of the more important developmental aspects for predicting a person's level of adaptation and mental health. Previous research in this area suggests a relationship between insecure attachment and behavioural disorders, deviations as well as depression and other affective disorders. The goal of this study was to determine the relationships between adolescents' attachment patterns and aggression as well as internalisation and externalisation of problems - expressed as a tendency to assume the role of the victim or the perpetrator. We hypothesised that insecure patterns of attachment foster both aggression (as a personality feature) and a tendency towards mental health issues, through increasing the frequency of entering the role of a victim or a perpetrator.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   One hundred and twenty individuals aged 14-19 took part in the study, mainly high school and university students. The study was conducted in groups, with the consent of participants and their parents. The following methods were used to assess the variables: The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and the Mini Direct and Indirect Aggression Inventory (Mini-DIA).
   RESULTS
   Our results suggest that a relationship exists between aggressiveness and trust in the relationship with one's mother, as well as between hostility and alienation with regards to one's mother and father. Insecure attachment is a significant risk factor for mental health disorders, and it fosters both externalisation and internalisation behaviours.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We interpret the results as suggesting that attachment organisation plays an important role in a wide array of aspects of adolescent psychosocial development.

AB Unaccompanied refugee minors in Europe are at high risk of developing mental health problems and experiencing poor quality of life. However, there have been few studies on psychiatric disorders, behavioral problems, and quality of life among these adolescents. Furthermore, previously conducted studies in different European countries have reported inconsistent findings. This study investigated the frequency of emotional and behavioral problems in unaccompanied refugee minors residing in youth welfare institutions in Germany, using data from both self-reports and caregiver reports. Additionally, health-related quality of life was investigated, using caregiver reports only. Data on 191 male refugees, between the ages of 12 and 20 from 24 different countries of origin, living in 16 youth welfare institutions in Germany were included in the analysis. Residents completed the self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for the detection of emotional and behavioral problems, while caregivers completed the teacher version. Caregivers additionally completed a questionnaire on health-related quality of life domains, and provided general sociodemographic information. The results of the SDQ and the questionnaires on health-related quality of life were compared with age-matched norms, using t tests and chi(2) tests. According to both self-reports and caregiver reports, the rates of internalizing problems (emotional problems and peer relationship problems) in this sample were significantly higher than in norms, with frequencies ranging from 35 to 61%. By contrast, externalizing problems were rated as significantly lower than for norms, particularly hyperactivity with frequencies ranging from only 4 to 7%. Both sets of informants reported high levels of prosocial behavior. Caregivers and residents gave similar ratings on most measures but differed for conduct problems, with the ratings by the former corresponding to norms while those by the latter being significantly lower. Health-related quality of life was rated by caregivers as being poorer than in the normative sample; the only exception was found in the domain of peer relationships, where participants showed average results. The findings of this study confirm that unaccompanied refugee minors are a highly vulnerable group, and suggest that mental health screenings should be done regularly in the youth welfare institutions that care for them. It is important to use culturally sensitive instruments and multi-informant methods to detect problems despite possible differences between caregiver and self-reports. Appropriate support systems should be developed and implemented, including access to mental health care as well as psychosocial and educational interventions within schools and youth welfare institutions. Thus, the health and quality of life of these young people can be improved as they adjust to life in the resettlement countries and develop a future perspective.

AB Aim: The Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale (SCBE-30) is a 30-item questionnaire designed to assess preschoolers' behavioral problems (externalizing and internalizing) and social competence. It is widely used in the developmental research. This study aims to contribute to the adaptation and validation of the Portuguese version of the teachers' short form of the SCBE-30 (Psychol. Assess. 8:369-777, 1996).
   Method: Participants were 361 children from 3 to 6 years old whose preschool teachers completed the SCBE-30. For external validation purposes children completed arithmetic and theory of mind tasks, and parents completed a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analysis did not confirm the 10-item-subscale solution of the original SCBE-30 version. Instead, a five-item-subscale was found as a better solution.
   Discussion: The reduced 15-item version replicates the three-factor structure, shows good psychometric properties and meets external validation criteria. Further research should focus on the invariance of the factor structure of the SCBE-30 between cultures.

AB This study aims to contribute to the scientific debate about the evaluation of the intervention in infant mental health and presents the main results after one year of intervention based on integrated types of treatments (psychodynamic psychotherapy for the child/adolescent, parental support and observation and assessment of family interactions). Furthermore, the study aims to explore the use of the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP) as a new assessment tool for planning the of treatments. The sample consists of 23 children and adolescents, aged between 4 and 17 years old, and their families, attending the Infancy, Adolescence and Family Service, Local Health Unit 16 of Padua due to their psychopathological problems. In order to assess their psychological conditions we used the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to evaluate psycho-behavioral problems and the LTP to assess family interactions. The CBCL was used at the time of the diagnostic assessment (T0) and after 12 months of treatment (T12). Concerning the application of LTP, the sample was divided randomly in two groups: one where LTP was used in two different time intervals during therapy (T0 and T12) and another one where it was used in three different time intervals during therapy (T0, T6 and T12) with a video-feedback intervention at time T6. Results report a favorable outcome in regards of the gravity of patients' symptoms, displaying, after one year of treatment, a statistical significant decrease in the clinical level of internalizing symptoms. In terms of family interactions, results show stability within the family patterns except for a statistically significant deterioration in the management of interactive mistakes. Regarding the use of LTP as evaluator of the above intervention, the study shows that the assessment of family's interactions during long-term psychotherapy helps clinicians focus the intervention on those aspects that remain dysfunctional. These results and the possible interpretations, however, emphasize the need for further studies on this topic.

AB Objective: Longitudinal studies on headaches often focus on the identification of risk factors for headache occurrence or "chronification". This study in particular examines psychological variables as potential predictors of headache remission in children and adolescents.
   Methods: Data on biological, social, and psychological variables were gathered by questionnaire as part of a large population-based study (N=5,474). Children aged 9 to 15 years who suffered from weekly headaches were selected for this study sample, N=509. A logistic regression analysis was conducted with remission as the dependent variable. In the first step sex, age, headache type, and parental headache history were entered as the control variables as some data already existed showing their predictive power. Psychological factors (dysfunctional coping strategies, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, somatosensory amplification) were entered in the second step to evaluate their additional predictive value.
   Results: Highly dysfunctional coping strategies reduced the relative probability of headache remission. All other selected psychological variables reached no significance, ie, did not contribute additionally to the explanation of variance of the basic model containing sex and headache type. Surprisingly, parental headache and age were not predictive. The model explained only a small proportion of the variance regarding headache remission (R-2=0.09 [Nagelkerke]).
   Conclusion: Successful coping with stress in general contributed to remission of pediatric headache after 2 years in children aged between 9 and 15 years. Psychological characteristics in general had only small predictive value. The issue of remission definitely needs more scientific attention in empirical studies.

Baseline survey data from parti-cipants (N = 213; 135 men and 78 college women) completing a mandated, brief alcohol intervention were utilized. Representative of the self-medication model, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms mediated the early sexual abuse/problem drinking relationship. Two psychological vulnerability factorsemotion dysregulation and dissociative tendencieswere incorporated into self-medication findings via more advanced mediational models. Results highlighted that problem drinking increased as dissociative tendencies increased, and relations between the vulnerability factors and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were in an unexpected direction.

AB The new DSM-5 dimensional framework of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) features severity ratings of social communication (SC) and restrictive/repetitive behaviors (RRB) and little research has been conducted since its inception. There has been a recent increase in the administration and adoption of broadband behavior-rating scales by clinicians, to ascertain a summary of the client's behavior, including use with children on the autism spectrum. One such widely utilized accepted instrument is the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd ed. (BASC-2), a multidimensional measure to assess internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as adaptive functioning for individuals 2-25 years of age. The current study examined and compared the Parent Rating Scale (PRS) and Teacher Rating Scale (TRS) of the BASC-2 for children on the DSM-5 autism spectrum in order contribute novel information to the BASC-2 literature. Utilizing a sample of 67 children and adolescents with ASD, the PRS and TRS of the BASC-2 were compared using paired sample t-tests to assess for differences in parent- versus teacher-reported behavior patterns. Mean parent ratings for atypicality, functional communication, and withdrawal, and mean teacher ratings for atypicality and withdrawal, were clinically elevated. Mean parent and teacher ratings for adaptability and social skills, and mean teacher ratings for functional communication were in the at-risk range. Parent ratings of adaptability, functional communication, and social skill were significantly more severe than teacher ratings of these same subscales. Implications of these results for the assessment of children and adolescents with ASD are suggested.

AB Background: Literature has demonstrated the adaptive function of identity development and parenting toward manifestation of problem behaviors in adolescence. These dimensions act on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Methods: The objective is to investigate the relationship between identity status, parenting, and adolescent problems, which may manifest through internalized (phobias, obsessions, depression, eating disorders, entropy) and externalized modes (alcohol use and school discomfort). The research involved 198 Italian students (104 males and 94 females) in the 4th year (mean = 16.94 years, standard deviation = 0.35) and 5th year (mean = 17.94 years, standard deviation = 0.43) of senior secondary schools, who live in Caltanissetta, a town located in Sicily, Italy. The research lasted for 1 school year. The general group consisted of 225 students with a mortality rate of 12%. They completed an anamnestic questionnaire to provide 1) basic information, 2) alcohol consumption attitude in the past 30 days, and 3) their beliefs about alcohol; the "Ego Identity Process Questionnaire" to investigate identity development; the "Parental Bonding Instrument" to measure the perception of parenting during childhood; and the "Constraints of Mind" to value the presence of internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Data show that identity status influences alcohol consumption. Low-profile identity and excessive maternal control affect the relational dependence and the tendency to perfectionism in adolescents. Among the predictors of alcohol use, there are socioeconomic status, parental control, and the presence of internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusion: Family is the favored context of learning beliefs, patterns, and values that affect the broader regulatory social environment, and for this reason, it is considered the privileged context on which to intervene to reduce the adolescents' behavior problems. This deviance could be an external manifestation of the difficulty in management of internalizing symptoms in adolescence.

AB Rumination has a crucial role in the onset, severity and maintenance of depression in adolescent and adult populations. The Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) is the most widely self-report instrument used to assess individual differences in the tendency to engage in ruminative responses style. This paper aims to test the factor structure of the 10-item RRS and the gender-based measurement invariance, in a community sample of adolescents, using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Participants were 542 adolescents (53% females) with a mean age of 14 years old (SD = 1.75) from middle and secondary schools (years of education's mean = 9.46, SD = 1.60) in Portugal. Results confirm the two-factor structure of the RRS composed by brooding and reflection dimensions (GFI = .93, CFI = .90, TLI = .87, SRMR = .05, RMSEA = .11, 90% C.I. [0.092 to 0.121]) and the invariance across gender (GFI = .91, CFI = .89, TLI = .85, RMSEA = .08, 90% C.I. [0.069 to 0.090], p < .001). RRS and their dimensions presented a good internal reliability (Brooding: alpha = .80; Reflection: alpha = .75; RRS total: alpha = .85). Brooding and reflection dimensions revealed moderate correlations with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms (p < .001). Multiple Regression Analysis through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) showed that brooding is significantly and strongly associated with internalizing symptoms (p < .001). Female adolescents reported more levels of rumination than male adolescents. Overall, these findings support the usefulness of the Portuguese version of RRS and suggest that this short version is an economical, valid and reliable measure to assess ruminative response styles in adolescence.

AB Children whose parents seek help for partner violence (PV) victimization are at an increased risk for internalizing and externalizing behavioral health problems. The literature has examined this phenomenon primarily among children of battered women. This study examines the sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral health of children whose fathers have sought help for PV victimization and compares them to children of men from the general population. Children whose fathers sought help for PV victimization were less likely to live with their fathers. Bivariate analyses showed that children of male victims had elevated scores in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-related areas of behavioral health; many of these findings remain in multivariate analyses, especially among older children. The implications of the results are discussed for researchers and social service practitioners.

AB Theories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate emotional processes, including difficulties utilizing adaptive emotion regulation strategies, as critical to the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) veterans report high levels of combat exposure and PTSD. We aimed to extend findings suggesting that emotion regulation difficulties are a function of PTSD, rather than combat trauma exposure or common comorbidities, to OIF/OEF/OND veterans, in order to inform models of PTSD risk and recovery that can be applied to returning veterans. We tested differences in emotion regulation, measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, among trauma-exposed veterans with (n=24) or without PTSD (n=22) andhealthy civilian comparison participants (n=27) using multivariate analyses of covariance, adjusting for major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and demographic variables (age, sex, and ethnicity). Veterans with PTSD reported more use of expressive suppression and more difficulties with emotion regulation than veterans without PTSD and healthy comparison participants.Groups did not differ on cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest the key role of PTSD above and beyond trauma exposure, depression, and anxiety in specific aspects of emotion dysregulation among OIF/OEF/OND veterans. Interventions that help veterans expand and diversify their emotion regulation skills may serve as helpful adjunctive treatments for PTSD among OIF/OEF/OND veterans.

AB Background: Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder with a close link to childhood social phobia (SP). Our studies compare behavioral problem profiles in children and adolescents with SM and SP and control groups and assess the comorbidity patterns of SM and SP. Methods: Participants aged 3-18 years with SM (n = 95), SP (n = 74) and internalizing disorders (INT, n = 46) and a typically developing control group (CG, n = 119) were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL); adolescents were additionally assessed with the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Comorbidity was assessed in SM and SP participants with a diagnostic interview. Results: SP was detected in 94% of children with SM. SM participants showed different behavioral and psychiatric symptoms than SP: they were more frequently affected by lifetime separation anxiety disorder (SM: 45%, SP: 26%) and oppositional defiant disorder (SM: 22%, SP: 5%), and less by generalized anxiety disorder (SM: 6%, SP: 20%) and major depression (SM: 12%, SP: 26%). Adolescents with SM showed high rates of agoraphobia (SM 27%; SP 10%) and more social problems (YSR), and were more withdrawn (CBCL, YSR) than those with SP alone. Specific behavioral problems of SM and SP compared to INT and CG were observed. Conclusion: SM and SP represent separate but closely related disorders, distinct from other INT and CG, with specific patterns of lifetime comorbidities. (c) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The aim of this study was to examine the association between self-consciousness and internalizing problems in adolescents, and to analyze moderating effects of family dimension. Research sample included 294 adolescents aged 14 - 21 years. Respondents completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russel, 1996), the Scale of Social Anxiety and Stage-fright (Kondas, 1978), The Self-Consciousness Scale (Fennigstein et al., 1975), The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (Olson, 2010) and Family Communication Scale (Olson & Barnes, 2010). Direct association between self-consciousness and internalizing symptoms was not found. However, results confirmed the moderating effect of family dimensions. Family cohesion moderates the relationship between private self-consciousness and loneliness; and public self-consciousness and social anxiety in boys. Family communication and adaptability moderates the relationship between public self-consciousness and social anxiety in girls. Findings indicate that family relations may serve either a risk or protective role in association with adolescent maladjustment, dependent on the family dimension and gender.

ID IMMIGRANT CHILDREN; MENTAL-HEALTH; AMERICAN; ADOLESCENTS; ADJUSTMENT
AB To help define future research direction and enhance educational service for children from Asian and Latino immigrant backgrounds, this review examines research investigating social competence with reference to host and heritage language skills. A targeted search obtained 14 peer-reviewed studies published from 1994 to 2014 focusing on children aged from birth to 12 years. Social competence is mainly measured by four dimensions: externalizing behaviours, internalizing behaviours, social skills and relationships with others. The evidence suggests that English proficiency levels are positively associated with social skills and parent-child relationships are of higher quality when parent-child heritage language difference is minimal. However the findings are mixed regarding how English levels are associated with externalizing, internalizing behaviours and relationships with others and how heritage language levels are associated with social competence. This review makes a set of recommendations for future research including assessment of participants' language proficiency with language tests and examination of emotional factors in the relationship between English and social competence. The implications of the findings are also discussed for educators.

AB The purpose of this study was to elucidate mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of trauma-related distress. This study investigated whether betrayal trauma (BT; abuse by a person close to the victim) and specific parenting attitudes and behaviors among mothers with child abuse histories predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children. Mothers and children (ages 7-11) were recruited for a project on parenting and stress (N = 72). Maternal betrayal trauma predicted both internalizing (beta = 0.33, p < .01) and externalizing symptoms (beta = 0.25, p < .05) even when controlling for mothers' trauma-related symptoms. Negative attitudes toward limit setting predicted externalizing symptoms (beta = -0.33, p < .05). Poorer communication (beta = -0.39, p < .05) but higher parenting satisfaction (beta = 0.38, p < .01) predicted internalizing symptoms. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing maternal trauma and parenting characteristics as part of interventions with symptomatic children.

AB Although research has documented the detrimental effects of maternal trauma on child behavior (Lambert, Holzer, & Hasbun, 2014), the role of extended family support in potentially mitigating the effects of intergenerational transmission of trauma is not clearly understood. With a diverse community sample of 52 trauma-exposed mothers and their children between the ages of 7 and 12, we investigated relationships between kinship social support, maternal trauma exposure severity, maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, and child behavioral problems. Results showed that kinship social support was negatively related to maternal trauma exposure severity, maternal PTSD symptom severity, child internalizing behaviors, and child externalizing behaviors. Additionally, kinship social support moderated the relationship between maternal trauma exposure severity and child internalizing behaviors. These results have implications in the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting diverse families facing trauma that incorporate extended family networks.

AB With a prevalence of 5-8%, specific developmental disorders of speech and language are among the most common developmental disorders. Impaired language skills strongly influence other areas of development. Owing to the essential importance of language abilities for different aspects of life, developmental language disorders impair not only the educational but also the social and emotional development of children and they continue into adolescence and adulthood. Not only the affected children and adolescents themselves, but also their families are heavily strained by social impairments and mental health problems. This paper gives an overview of the psychosocial stress in affected children and adolescents and their families. It is assumed that about 30% of children with developmental language disorders meet other psychiatric diagnoses, too. They are at increased risk for comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders. Thus, children with developmental language impairments more often show attention deficits, emotional problems, and aggressive behavior. Furthermore, their higher risk for difficulties with peers becomes increasingly more important in adolescence. The affected children and adolescents have difficulties in building friendships and are more often victims of defamation (bullying) than their peers. In comparison with the general population, parents of children with developmental language disorders show higher values in stress and depression. These higher values are particularly affected by the lack of acceptance and support by the social environment. Moreover, mothers of children with developmental language impairments show more disappointment and feelings of aggression based on the developmental problems of their children. Additionally, conflicts occur more frequently in these families. Possible causes of psychosocial stress in developmental language disorders are discussed. For example, possible causes of emotional problems in children with developmental language disorders are difficulties in the control of emotional processes, frequent failure, frustration, a lack of acceptance of schoolmates, low joy for learning, and reduced belief in their own competence. There are not enough therapeutic services adapted to the particular situation of the affected children, and most of them are based on written or oral language. The additional emotional and behavioral problems, as well as problems with peers, in children and adolescents with developmental language disorders require speech therapy as well as psychotherapeutic treatments to ensure optimal support. Moreover, work with parents should be implemented, and parent training appears to be particularly effective. Future research should investigate the association between the severity and extent of symptoms, the psychosocial stress of affected children, and the strain of their parents.

TI Evaluating Dosage Effects for the Positive Action Program: How
   Implementation Impacts Internalizing Symptoms, Aggression, School
   Hassles, and Self-Esteem

AB Positive Action (PA) is a school-based intervention for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., academic achievement, school engagement). PA has a long history of documented success achieving these aims, making it an Evidence Based Practice (EBP). Intervention research on EBP's has established the importance of implementation fidelity, especially with regard to program dosage; failure to properly implement an EBP can have negative consequences on targeted outcomes, especially if participants are exposed to a low dosage of the program (e.g., fewer lessons than specified). Much of the current research on PA has neglected to examine how program dosage impacts PA's effect on targeted outcomes. Using propensity score models, multiple imputation, and a 2-level hierarchical linear model, the current study fills this gap and examines how different dosages of PA as measured by years participating in PA and number of PA lessons, impacts adolescent internalizing symptoms, aggression, perceptions of school hassles, and self-esteem over a 3-year period. The current sample included middle school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 (N = 5,894). The findings indicate that students who received 3 years of the PA intervention and a high number of PA lessons had a significantly higher self-esteem score than those who received 0 years of PA or zero lessons. Participants who received 1 year of PA also reported significantly lower school hassle scores than those who received 0 years. Dosage had no statistically significant effects on aggression or internalizing score. Implications are discussed.

AB Ethnic minority families in Europe are underrepresented in mental health care-a profound problem for clinicians and policymakers. One reason for their underrepresentation seems that, on average, ethnic minority families tend to perceive externalizing and internalizing child behavior as less problematic. There is concern that this difference in problem perception might limit intervention effectiveness. We tested the extent to which ethnic differences in problem perception exist when ethnic minority families engage in mental health service and whether lower levels of problem perception diminish parenting intervention effects to reduce disruptive child behavior. Our sample included 136 mothers of 3- to 8-year-olds (35% female) from the 3 largest ethnic groups in the Netherlands (43% Dutch; 35% Moroccan; 22% Turkish). Mothers reported on their child's externalizing and internalizing behavior and their perception of this behavior as problematic. They were then randomly assigned to the Incredible Years parenting intervention or a wait list control condition. We contrasted maternal reports of problem perception to teacher reports of the same children. Moroccan and Turkish mothers, compared with Dutch mothers, perceived similar levels of child behavior problems as less problematic, and as causing less impairment and burden. Teacher problem perception did not vary across children from different ethnic groups. Importantly, maternal problem perception did not affect parenting intervention effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior. Our findings suggest that ethnic differences in problem perception exist once families engage in treatment, but that lower levels of problem perception do not diminish treatment effects.

AB Compared to natives, immigrants have been reported to display either more (migration morbidity) or fewer (immigrant paradox) adjustment problems. We examined these two perspectives using a meta-analysis from 51 studies (N = 224,197), reporting internalizing, externalizing, and academic outcomes among immigrant children and youth in Europe. Overall, migration morbidity was better supported than the immigrant paradox. Migration morbidity was supported for (a) externalizing outcomes in Northern Europe and adolescent samples; (b) academic outcomes for low SES and fewer girls across samples; (c) internalizing outcomes in Western Europe and preadolescent samples. Cultural diversity and long-term residence of immigrants are favorable factors for the paradox in externalizing outcomes, whereas immigrant family reunion was predictive for the paradox in internalizing and academic outcomes. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.

AB In early childhood, parents play an important role in children's socioemotional development. As such, parent training is a central component of many psychological interventions for young children (Reyno & McGrath, 2006). Maternal depressive symptoms have consistently been linked to maladaptive parenting behaviors (e.g., disengagement, intrusiveness), as well as to lower parent training efficacy in the context of child psychological intervention, suggesting that mothers with higher symptomatology may be less able to be adapt their behavior according to situational demands. The goal of the current study was to examine both maternal and child factors that may influence maternal behavioral adaptability. Ninety-one mothers and their toddlers (M = 23.93 months, 59% male) participated in a laboratory visit during which children engaged in a variety of novelty episodes designed to elicit individual differences in fear/withdrawal behaviors. Mothers also completed a questionnaire battery. Maternal behavioral adaptability was operationalized as the difference in scores for maternal involvement, comforting, and protective behavior between episodes in which mothers were instructed to refrain from interaction and those in which they were instructed to act naturally. Results indicated that when children displayed high levels of negative affect in the restricted episodes, mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms were less able to adapt their involved behavior because they exhibited low rates of involvement across episodes regardless of instruction given. The current study serves as an intermediary step in understanding how maternal depressive symptoms may influence daily interactions with their children as well as treatment implementation and outcomes, and provides initial evidence that maternal internalizing symptoms may contribute to lower behavioral adaptability in the context of certain child behaviors due to consistent low involvement.

AB Early attachment has both protective and risk factors as regards later mental health. In Finland, insecure-avoidant-type attachment is overrepresented. Does this indicate a risk for emotional and behavioural problems at preschool age? In this study, we examined and compared the association between attachment and mental health in Finnish singletons and twins. The attachment of 27 singletons and 58 twins with both parents had previously been examined at the age of 18 months using Preschool Assessment of Attachment criteria. At the age of 4, the children's emotional and behavioural symptoms were assessed using Child Behavior Checklist questionnaires reported by parents. The mothers and fathers reported significantly more behavioural and emotional problems at preschool age in singletons than in twins. Insecure-avoidant-type attachment to the mother was significantly associated with higher scores concerning withdrawal, somatic problems and total internalising symptoms among singleton preschoolers, whereas among twins, no such correlations were observed. The results thus suggest that twinship is a protective factor in the trajectory from toddler avoidant attachment to internalising problems at preschool age.

AB This study examines the mediating role of effortful control between reactive temperament traits (negative affectivity and extraversion) and children's internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems. The sample was composed of 424 non-clinical children from 3 to 6 years of age (60% male). Use of a structural equation model revealed effortful control-mediated relations between reactive temperament traits and behavioural problems. Nevertheless, uniquely and directly, negative affect predicted externalizing problems and extraversion predicted internalizing problems. Assessment of invariance by children's sex showed that the mediating role of effortful control tends to be stronger for externalizing problems in boys than in girls. Results showed no significant age differences. According to these results, effortful control as a method of self-regulation seems to be an essential process through which reactive temperament traits affect a child's psychological adjustment.

AB A literature survey on new developments in the area of video games and psychotherapy of children and adolescents was conducted. Despite the omnipresence of computers and the internet, development of therapeutic games seems rather slow. The video game Treasure Hunt was introduced in 2008 to support treatment of children with internalizing and externalizing disorders. Camp Cope-A-Lot was developed for treatment of anxious children, whereas the self-help game SPARX is directed at depressed adolescents. Rage-Control is a biofeedback game for children with anger problems. The game Zoo U aims to assess and train social skills of primary school children. Ricky and the Spider for young children with obsessive compulsive disorder is meant to support the cognitive-behavioural treatment of these patients. Clash Back is a French game for adolescents with externalizing problems. Possible reasons for the relatively slow development of therapeutic games are the high methodological demands concerning an evaluation as well as the high costs of game development. Nonetheless, computers and the internet are bound to influence psychotherapy with children and adolescents in the long run.

AB By means of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) it was assessed how much children who are attended to a child guidance center suffer from behavior problems and emotional distress. Furthermore, the interaction between straining and supporting influences was examined. Results show that symptom severity lies in the range of clinical significance. Children of divorced parents show more internalizing as well as externalizing problems than children of nuclear families. High social integration is correlated with lower psychic symptomatic yet, this finding was dependent on family situation: While frequency to meet friends in children from nuclear families was correlated with lower symptomatic, this effect could not be found in children of divorced parents.

AB ObjectiveThe impact that congenital heart disease (CHD) has on the neurodevelopment of children with Down syndrome (DS) is unknown and potentially has implications for targeted early intervention. This study assessed the relationship between CHD that required surgery in the first year of life and neurodevelopmental, behavioral and emotional functioning outcomes in children with DS.
   MethodsA retrospective chart review of 1092 children (0-18 years) with DS who visited a single institution from 8/08-8/13 was performed. Children who underwent at least one of nine neurodevelopmental (cognitive, language, developmental) or academic tests were included in the analysis (N=178). Cohort was age-divided into infants/toddlers (0-2 years), preschoolers (3-5 years), and school age/adolescent (6-18 years). Test scores of children with DS who underwent cardiac surgery in the first year of life were compared to children with DS without CHD. T test, chi-square and Mann Whitney U tests were used where appropriate.
   ResultsInfants/toddlers with cardiac surgery had lower scores for receptive (P=.01), expressive (P=.021) and composite language (P<.001) compared to those with no CHD. Preschoolers with cardiac surgery had lower language scores and lower visual motor scores, although not statistically significant. In school age children with cardiac surgery there were no differences in IQ scores, language scores, or academic achievement scores compared to those without CHD. Also at school-age there was no difference in the incidence of ADHD, executive function or on internalizing and externalizing behavior scores.
   ConclusionChildren with DS undergoing cardiac surgery during the first year demonstrated poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes as infants/toddler but had no difference at school age compared to children with DS without CHD. These results will guide early interventions to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with DS and will help with family counseling after CHD repair.

AB Do children born after assisted reproductive techniques (ART; IVF/ICSI) display more mental health issues or social and cognitive developmental problems at 7-8 years than naturally conceived (NC) controls, and does child gender play a role?
   ART children do not differ with regard to mental health or social and cognitive developmental problems when compared with controls, but some gender-specific differences do exist.
   Systematic reviews have not found any evidence of delays in neurocognitive or sensorimotor development in ART children. However findings on the effect of the type of ART treatment (IVF versus ICSI) on the offspring's physical and mental development have not been uniform. Knowledge of the role of child gender in ART research is scarce.
   This prospective follow-up study compares mental health and social and cognitive developmental problems between 7-8-year-old ART and NC children, controlling for the father's age, length of the parents' partnership, mother's parity, child's gestational age, and the need of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Further, within the ART group, we analysed whether the treatment type (IVF versus ICSI) and the child's gender are associated with the mental health and developmental outcomes.
   In this study, 255 singleton ART children (IVF and ICSI) were compared with 278 NC children on parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and social (social skills and peer relations) and cognitive development (executive functioning, perception, memory, and language). Within the ART group, 164 IVF and 76 ICSI children were compared on the same outcomes. Statistics included analyses of covariates (ANCOVA) with group main effects, group and gender interaction effects, and Bonferroni >post hoc tests.
   ART and NC children did not differ generally in terms of their internalizing and externalizing symptoms or in the number of social and cognitive developmental problems (Group main effects,P > 0.05), but gender-specific group differences existed. The ART boys showed lower levels of cognitive problems than the NC boys, whereas ART girls showed higher levels of cognitive problems than the NC girls (Group x Gender-interaction effects with Bonferroni post hoc tests on mother-reports, P < 0.01). Further, unlike in the NC group, where boys showed more externalizing symptoms and social and cognitive developmental problems than girls (Group x Gender-interaction effects with Bonferroni post hoc tests for both parents' reports,P < 0.05), gender differences were not found in the ART group. Within the ART group, IVF and ICSI children did not differ in terms of mental health or developmental outcomes, and no significant gender differences emerged.
   The information on children's mental health and development was based on parental reports only. The dropout rate between the child's first year and the school age assessments was very high for fathers (57.4%) and substantial for mothers (30.1%), and the participating group was biased for older age of both parents and for better education of the fathers.
   The findings indicate the importance of considering child gender in learning about multiple developmental outcomes among children born after ART.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between allergic diseases and internalizing disorders has not been well characterized with regard to multiple allergic diseases or longitudinal study. The objective of this study was to examine the association between multiple allergic diseases in early childhood with validated measures of internalizing disorders in the school-age years.
   METHODS: Children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study underwent skin testing and examinations at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 years. At age 7, parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), a validated measure of childhood behavior and emotion. The association between allergic diseases at age 4, including allergic rhinitis, allergic persistent wheezing, atopic dermatitis, and allergic sensitization, and BASC-2 internalizing, anxiety, and depression T scores at age 7 was examined by logistic and linear regression, adjusting for covariates.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 546 children with complete information on allergic disease and BASC-2 outcomes. Allergic rhinitis at age 4 was significantly associated with elevated internalizing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-5.8), anxiety (aOR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.6), and depressive scores (aOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.7-6.5) at age 7. Allergic persistent wheezing was significantly associated with elevated internalizing scores (aOR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2-6.3). The presence of > 1 allergic disease (aOR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.7-7.6) and allergic rhinitis with comorbid allergic disease(s) (aOR: 4.3; 95% CI: 2.0-9.2) at age 4 had dose-dependent associations with internalizing scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children with allergic rhinitis and allergic persistent wheezing at age 4 are at increased risk of internalizing behaviors at age 7. Furthermore, multiple allergic diseases had a dose-dependent association with elevated internalizing scores.

AB Introduction. Previous studies indicated an association between behavior problems (internalizing, externalizing) and glycemic control (HbA1c) in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study is to examine if this association is mediated by self-confidence and mismanagement of diabetes. Methods. Problem behavior was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Mediating variables were assessed using the Confidence in Diabetes Self-Care-Youth and Diabetes Mismanagement Questionnaire. HbA1c was derived from hospital charts. Bootstrap mediation analysis for multiple mediation was utilized. Results. 88 youths with T1D, age 11-15 y, participated. The relation between both overall problem behavior and externalizing behavior problems and HbA1c was mediated through confidence in diabetes self-care and mismanagement (a(1)b(1) + a(2)b(2) path; point estimate = 0.50 BCa CI 95% 0.25-0.85; a(1)b(1) + a(2)b(2) path; point estimate = 0.73 BCa CI 95% 0.36-1.25). Conclusions. Increased problem behavior in youth with T1D is associated with elevated HbA1c and mediated by low self-confidence and diabetes mismanagement. Screening for problem behavior and mismanagement and assisting young patients in building confidence seem indicated to optimize glycemic control.

AB Mental health problems in childhood and adolescence are widespread. Current results from longitudinal studies give inconsistent information about the trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems. Studies show inconsistent prevalence rates of mental health problems depending on gender and age as well as between self-and parent report. So far, little is known about the developmental course of mental health problems over the entire childhood and adolescence period in Germany. The aim of the present study was to identify the trajectories of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence for (a) different psychiatric disorders, (b) for boys and girls separately, and (c) for self-and parent report. The longitudinal BELLA study is the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey among children and adolescents (KiGGS). Data of 3,256 participants of the BELLA study aged between 7 and 19 years from up to four measurement points were analyzed to estimate the trajectories of depression (CES-DC), anxiety disorders (SCARED-5), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Conners Global Index), and conduct disorder (CBCL) using mixed models for longitudinal data. According to parent report, 11.2% of the children and adolescents showed clinically relevant symptoms of depression, 10.6% of anxiety, 5.7% of ADHD, and 12.2% of conduct disorder. According to self-report 16.1% showed clinically relevant symptoms of depression, 15.1% of anxiety, and 2.0% of ADHD. Over the entire period of childhood and adolescence, symptoms of ADHD and conduct disorder decreased and were more frequent in boys, whereas internalizing problems (depression and anxiety) increased and were about twice as high in girls compared with boys. Furthermore, girls rated their internalizing problems approximately 10% higher than their parents did (depression: 20.8% vs. 12.3%; anxiety: 21.4% vs. 12.3 %). The prevalence rate for internalizing problems among boys was about 10% for the parent as well as self-report. For boys, parents indicated more symptoms of ADHD than their children themselves (7% vs. 4.3 %). For girls, there was no difference between parent and child report (2%, respectively). Prevalence rates for parent-rated conduct disorder were about 12% for girls and boys. A substantial percentage of children and adolescents in Germany show clinically relevant symptoms in any developmental stage. The trajectories of mental health problems over the entire childhood and adolescence period differ between depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, and conduct disorder as well as between parent and self-report. Children's gender and age influence the developmental course meaningfully. These aspects should be taken into account for future prevention programs, diagnostics, and interventions.

AB Mental disorders during childhood and adolescence negatively affect young people's development and can give rise to long-term consequences. Child and adolescent mental disorders also yield longstanding costs to society that are multiplied by the loss of economic productivity in adulthood. Longitudinal studies have associated externalizing behavior problems with subsequent risk behaviors such as substance use, delinquency, violence, or financial struggles multiple times. Regarding German children and adolescents, only little is known about the subsequent risk behaviors associated with externalizing behavior problems in childhood and adolescence. This study reports on the long-term consequences in early adulthood based on data from the longitudinal BELLA study (the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents). We examined a sample of N = 629 children and adolescents aged 12-17 years with externalizing behavior problems. Data were taken from the BELLA study at baseline and a follow-up assessment conducted 6 years later. The risk of externalizing behavior problems in childhood and adolescence for long-term consequences (problematic alcohol use, illegal drug use, delinquency, propensity to violence, financial struggles) in early adulthood was assessed by means of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Population-attributable risk percentages were calculated to evaluate the degree to which externalizing behavior problems are accountable for the occurrence of long-term consequences. Several multiple logistic regressions were computed with each of the risk behaviors as outcome and with age, gender, socioeconomic status, and internalizing problems as control variables. German children and adolescents with externalizing behavior problems (n = 116) significantly more often reported long-term consequences in early adulthood than did children and adolescents without externalizing behavior problems. Six years later, 27.6% (n = 32) of the children and adolescents with externalizing behavior problems reported problematic alcohol use and 13.8% (n = 16) illegal drug use. Further, 19% (n = 22) showed delinquency, 41.4% (n = 48) showed propensity to violence, and 29.3% (n = 34) reported financial struggles. After controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and internalizing problems, the at-risk group for problematic alcohol use, delinquency, and propensity to violence included boys with externalizing behavior problems from families with a lower socioeconomic status. Illegal drug use was correlated with externalizing behavior problems only. Financial struggles correlated with older age and lower socioeconomic status. Up to 16.5% of the cases with long-term consequences could be ascribed to externalizing behavior problems. These findings illustrate the necessity to identify children and adolescents at risk and to place greater emphasis on early prevention services.

AB Supporting other human beings is a fundamental aspect of human societies. Such so-called prosocial behavior is expressed in helping others, cooperating and sharing with them. This article gives an overview both of the development of prosocial behavior across childhood and of the relationship between prosociality and externalizing and internalizing problems. Especially externalizing problems are negatively associated with prosocial behavior, whereas the relationships with prosocial behavior are more heterogeneous for internalizing problems. Studies investigating developmental trajectories demonstrate that prosocial behavior and externalizing problems are not opposite ends of a continuum. Rather, they are two independent dimensions that may also co-occur in development. The same applies to internalizing problems, which can co-occur with pronounced prosociality as well as with low prosociality.

AB Children of mothers with depressive symptoms often have high cortisol levels. Research shows that various child characteristics (e.g., attachment pattern, internalizing behaviours, and temperament) moderate this association. We suggest that these characteristics share common variance with emotion regulation strategy. Therefore, we examine infant emotion regulation strategy as a moderator of the association between maternal depressive symptoms and infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. We hypothesize that infants who utilize more independent emotion regulation strategies and have mothers who report higher depressive symptoms will exhibit elevated cortisol levels. Participants were 193 mothers and infants (15months old) recruited from the community. Self-reported maternal depressive symptoms were assessed. Infant independent regulatory behaviours (withdrawal, wandering away, distraction, scanning, orienting to another object) were coded in the context of a Toy Frustration Task. Infant cortisol was collected via saliva samples at baseline, +20, and +40minutes. Results indicate that infant emotion regulation strategy moderates the relation between mothers' self-reported depressive symptoms and infant total cortisol output (AUC(G)) and cortisol reactivity (AUC(I)). Infants who employed more independent regulatory behaviours and have mothers with higher depressive symptoms experience greater cortisol secretion. We discuss the findings in relation to parent-infant interactions and the adaptive nature of emotion regulation strategies, as they relate to HPA regulatory capacities.

AB In this paper, we report (1) trajectories in adopted Chinese children's behavior problems over six years, (2) how pre-adoption adversity predicted Wave 1 behavior problems and the rate of behavioral change in subsequent Waves, and (3) the predictive importance of age at adoption relative to four psychosocial measures of pre-adoption adversity. Four waves (across six years) of data on 1285 adopted children (M-age (at adoption) = 16.40 months, SD = 15.40; M-age = 4.89 years, SD = 2.96 at Wave 1) were collected from adoptive mothers with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). At Wave 1, data on age at adoption, and four psychosocial measures of pre-adoption adversity were collected: physical signs/symptoms (e.g., sores) of deprivation, developmental delays at arrival, refusal/avoidance behaviors, and crying/clinging behaviors during the first three weeks of adoption. Multilevel modeling yielded three key findings: First, the adopted Chinese children's CBCL scores increased over time. Second, signs/symptoms, refusal/avoidance and crying/clinging behavior predicted differences in the adopted children's Internalizing, Externalizing and Total CBCL scores at study entry; developmental delays at arrival predicted differences in Internalizing and Total CBCL scores at study entry. Crying/clinging scores also predicted rates of change in Internalizing and Total CBCL scores. Refusal/avoidance scores also predicted rates of change in Internalizing, Externalizing and Total CBCL scores. Finally, the four psychosocial measures of pre-adoption adversity outperformed age at adoption as predictors of CBCL scores at study entry and the rate of change in CBCL scores in subsequent Waves.

AB This study investigated the influence of the DRD4 gene and the perinatal environment on child temperament in 5-year-old twins. Participants were 94 twin or triplet sets (101 girls, 89 boys). Parents completed questionnaires about children's birth complications (BC) when children were 1 or 2 years old and temperament questionnaires assessing negative emotionality (NE) when children were 5. DRD4 genotype was determined from children's buccal cells. A significant interaction between BC and DRD4 genotype predicted children's NE. For children without the DRD4 7-repeat allele, those with more moderate BC had high levels of NE; those with the fewest moderate BC showed significantly less NE. This did not hold for children with the 7-repeat allele. Additionally, minor BC significantly predicted NE for all children, regardless of genotype, whereas severe BC did not. This study underlines the importance of including NE during the preschool years as a possible risk outcome for birth complications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Selective mutism (SM) is a debilitating condition in which a child does not speak in social situations where speech is expected. The clinical conceptualization of SM has been debated historically, with evidence pointing partly to anxious and oppositional behavior profiles. Behavioral characteristics were examined in a clinical sample of 57 youth formally diagnosed with selective mutism. Parents rated children across internalizing and externalizing behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist. Eighteen highly rated items were subjected to exploratory and then confirmatory factor analysis. Anxiety and oppositional behavior factors were derived. The anxious behavior profile was associated with social anxiety disorder symptoms, social problems, and aggressive behaviors but not oppositional defiant disorder symptoms. The oppositional behavior profile was associated with aggressive behaviors, oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, social problems, and inversely to social anxiety disorder symptoms. Results are consistent with emerging research regarding subgroups of children with SM. Behavior profiles are discussed as well with respect to assessment and treatment implications.
   Learning outcomes: Readers will learn about the nature of children with selective mutism as well as behaviors that differentiate anxious and oppositional behavior profiles. Items that comprise anxious and oppositional behavior profiles are presented. These item profiles may have ramifications for assessment and treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines use of the Jesness Inventory-Revised (JI-R) in the juvenile delinquency assessment context. The JI-R was identified by Hoge and Andrews(2010) among several standardized personality tests that are useful as part of a best-practice comprehensive juvenile forensic assessment. The JI-R is particularly relevant in forensic contexts with respect to identifying personality characteristics associated with juvenile delinquency. It is proposed that the JI-R can be integrated into the contemporary risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model of correctional assessment and rehabilitative programming and its application for juvenile delinquents. Studies suggest that the Jesness Inventory may identify an antisocial orientation dimension associated with dynamic risk-need factors in youths that influence criminal or delinquent behavior and that can be targeted for intervention. The JI-R also assesses internalizing psychological problems that may identify responsivity factors relevant for disposition and treatment planning in forensic contexts. This article identifies some technical limitations of the JI-R, including the issue of item overlap. The questionable effectiveness of this instrument in detecting response bias, especially underreporting, is also considered. Directions for future research are suggested.

SO ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Art therapy; externalizing; internalizing; painting; psychological
   problems
ID CHILDREN
AB Objective: The internalizing and externalizing problems relating to childhood and adolescent have always been significant. Because there is special considerations in establishing communication with them and hence, the therapeutic methods for these problems must take into account these considerations. As establishing a therapeutic relationship is an important component of effective counseling, it seems that art therapy may help alleviate these problems. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of art therapy in reducing internalizing and externalizing problems of adolescent girls (14 18 years old).
   Method: This is a semi-experimental study carried out in the form of a pre-test/post-test design with control group. The population of this study includes female students of Gole Laleh School of Art in district 3 of Tehran, Iran, out of which 30 students with internalizing problems and 30 individuals with externalizing problems were selected through targeted sampling. Students were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Experimental groups participated in 6 painting sessions designed based on Art therapy theories and previous studies. The material used for diagnosis of the problems in posttest and pretest was an Achenbach self-assessment form.
   Results: Data were analyzed using a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our results showed that Art therapy significantly reduced internalizing problems (F = 17.61, P < 0.001); however, its effect in reducing externalizing problems was not significant (F = 3.93, P = 0.06).
   Conclusion: Art therapy as a practical therapeutic method can be used to improve internalizing problems. To reduce externalizing problems, more sessions may be needed. Thus, future studies are required to insure these findings.

AB A substantial number of children with anxiety disorders do not improve following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recent effectiveness studies have found poorer outcome for CBT programs than what is typically found in efficacy studies. The present study examined predictors of treatment outcome among 181 children (aged 8-15 years), with separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, who participated in a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial of a 10-session CBT program in community clinics. Potential predictors included baseline demographic, child, and parent factors. Outcomes were as follows: a) remission from all inclusion anxiety disorders; b) remission from the primary anxiety disorder; and c) child- and parent-rated reduction of anxiety symptoms at post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up. The most consistent findings across outcome measures and informants were that child-rated anxiety symptoms, functional impairment, a primary diagnosis of social phobia or separation anxiety disorder, and parent internalizing symptoms predicted poorer outcome at post-treatment. Child-rated anxiety symptoms, lower family social class, lower pretreatment child motivation, and parent internalizing symptoms predicted poorer outcome at 1-year follow-up. These results suggest that anxious children with more severe problems, and children of parents with elevated internalizing symptom levels, may be in need of modified, additional, or alternative interventions to achieve a positive treatment outcome.

AB Objectives: To examine whether high intellectual ability, in comparison to average or lower performance, reflects the consequences of sleep-disordered breathing and limits behavioral benefit observed 6 months after adenotonsillectomy.
   Methods: Children aged 3-12 years (n = 147) recruited from otolaryngology practices at two hospitals and assessed with Conners' Parent Rating Scales and an age range-appropriate intellectual measure, the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale at baseline and 6 months after clinically-indicated adenotonsillectomy. Subjects were classified as having high (IQ >= 110), average (90 <= IQ < 110), or low (IQ < 90) cognitive ability.
   Results: After adenotonsillectomy, improvements in Conners' internalizing, externalizing, hyperactivity, and cognitive domains were observed across IQ groups (main effects for time, all p < 0.01 or better), with no evidence for differential improvements among the groups (no significant time by IQ group interactions). The magnitude of behavioral improvement among children with high IQ resembled that observed among the other two groups. Changes in the Conners' domains were not significantly correlated with baseline IQ, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index z-score, or respiratory disturbance index.
   Conclusion: Behavioral function can improve after adenotonsillectomy even among children with relatively high intellectual ability at baseline. Diagnosis and treatment with expectation of neurobehavioral benefit should be considered among high-performing children as readily as it is more traditionally among their lower-performing peers.

AB This study assessed the developmental links between children's working memory development and their relations with teachers and peers across 2 years of kindergarten and early elementary school. Kindergarten and first grade children, N = 1109, 50 % boys, were followed across 2 school-years. Children were assessed across 3 waves, in the fall and spring of the first school-year (within school-year), and finally in the spring of the second school-year. Working memory was assessed using a visuo-spatial working memory task. The developmental links between working memory and child-reported teacher-child relationship quality (warmth and conflict) and peer-nominated likeability and friendedness were assessed using autoregressive cross-lagged models. Lower working memory scores were related to increases in teacher-child conflict and decreases in teacher-child warmth one school-year later, in addition to decreases in likeability by peers within the same school-year. Conversely, teacher-child conflict was negatively associated with the development of working memory across the studied period. Path estimates between working memory and social relational factors were similar for boys and girls. Findings show developmental links between working memory and social-relational factors and vice versa. These results suggest that children's working memory development can be fostered through pro-social relations with teachers in early elementary school children.

AB Peer interactions and executive function play central roles in the development of healthy children, as peer problems have been indicative of lower cognitive competencies such as self-regulatory behavior and poor executive function has been indicative of problem behaviors and social dysfunction. However, few studies have focused on the relation between peer interactions and executive function and the underlying mechanisms that may create this link. Using a national sample (n = 1164, 48.6 % female) from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), we analyzed executive function and peer problems (including victimization and rejection) across three waves within each domain (executive function or peer problems), beginning in early childhood and ending in middle adolescence. Executive function was measured as a multi-method, multi-informant composite including reports from parents on the Children's Behavior Questionnaire and Child Behavior Checklist and child's performance on behavioral tasks including the Continuous Performance Task, Woodcock-Johnson, Tower of Hanoi, Operation Span Task, Stroop, and Tower of London. Peer problems were measured as a multi-informant composite including self, teacher, and afterschool caregiver reports on multiple peer-relationship scales. Using a cross-lagged design, our Structural Equation Modeling findings suggested that experiencing peer problems contributed to lower executive function later in childhood and better executive function reduced the likelihood of experiencing peer problems later in childhood and middle adolescence, although these relations weakened as a child moves into adolescence. The results highlight that peer relationships are involved in the development of strengths and deficits in executive function and vice versa.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with interpersonal dysfunction during childhood and adolescence, yet little is known about the romantic relationships of young women with childhood ADHD. In the present study, we draw from a longitudinal sample of girls followed prospectively into young adulthood, comparing those with (n = 114) and without (n = 79; comparisons) childhood ADHD in terms of their risk for physical victimization by an intimate partner (physical IPV; e.g., slapping, punching) by 17-24 years of age. We examined ADHD both diagnostically and dimensionally, at the same time establishing reliable indicators of young adult physical IPV. Externalizing and internalizing problems, and academic achievement during adolescence, were tested as potential mediators. Overall, participants with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD experienced more physical IPV than did comparisons (30.7 % vs. 6.3 %). In parallel, IPV was associated with higher levels of childhood ADHD symptomatology (d = 0.73). Young women with persistent ADHD stood the highest risk of experiencing IPV (37.3 %), followed by those with transient ADHD (19.0 %) and those never-diagnosed (5.9 %). Academic achievement measured during adolescence was a significant partial mediator of the childhood ADHD symptomatology-young adult IPV relationship, even with control of sociodemographic, psychiatric, and cognitive factors, including childhood reading and math disorders. Findings indicate that in young women, childhood ADHD is a specific and important predictor of physically violent victimization in their intimate relationships. This vulnerable population requires IPV prevention and intervention, with academic empowerment as a key target.

AB The primary purpose of the current study was to test a model examining the process by which parent dispositional mindfulness relates to youth psychopathology through mindful parenting and parenting practices. The universality of the model across youth at three developmental stages was examined: young childhood (3-7 years; n = 210), middle childhood (8-12 years; n = 200), and adolescence (13-17 years; n = 205). Overall, participants were 615 parents (55 % female) and one of their 3-to-17 year old children (45 % female). Parents reported on their dispositional mindfulness, mindful parenting, positive and negative parenting practices and their child's or adolescent's internalizing and externalizing problems. Consistent findings across all three developmental stages indicated that higher levels of parent dispositional mindfulness were indirectly related to lower levels of youth internalizing and externalizing problems through higher levels of mindful parenting and lower levels of negative parenting practices. Replication of these findings across families with children at different developmental stages lends support to the generalizability of the model.

AB According to the Social Information Processing Model of children's adjustment, children develop general interpretation styles for future social events based on past social experiences. Previous research has shown associations between interpretations of social situations and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. This study investigated whether bullies, victims, bully-victims, and uninvolved children interpreted ambiguous human interactions differently in terms of bullying and whether these interpretations generalized to abstract non-human interactions. Participants were 390 children (49% girls, M-age=10.3 years) who completed self-report measures of bullying and victimization. In addition, they indicated whether video fragments of positive, negative, or ambiguous interactions between humans, animals, and abstract figures depicted bullying situations. Bully-victims reported more bullying than victims and uninvolved children in ambiguous abstract figure, animal, and human fragments and in positive animal fragments. Children who bully did not differ from the other groups. These findings indicate that interpretations of bullying generalized from ambiguous human interactions to more abstract ambiguous animal and abstract figure interactions. Implications for further research and practice were discussed. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields from non-ionizing radiation and adverse human health effects remains controversial. We aimed to explore the association of environmental radiofrequency-electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) exposure with neurobehavioral function of children. A subsample of 123 boys belonging to the Environment and Childhood cohort from Granada (Spain), recruited at birth from 2000 through 2002, were evaluated at the age of 9-11 years. Spot electric field measurements within the 100kHz to 6GHz frequency range, expressed as both root mean-square (S-RMS) and maximum power density (S-MAX) magnitudes, were performed in the immediate surrounds of childres dwellings. Neurocognitive and behavioral functions were assessed with a comprehensive battery of tests. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used, adjusting for potential confounders. All measurements were lower than reference guideline limits, with median S-RMS and S-MAX values of 285.94 and 2759.68W/m(2), respectively. Most of the cognitive and behavioral parameters did not show any effect, but children living in higher RF exposure areas (above median S-RMS levels) had lower scores for verbal expression/comprehension and higher scores for internalizing and total problems, and obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders, in comparison to those living in areas with lower exposure. These associations were stronger when S-MAX values were considered. Although some of our results may suggest that low-level environmental RF-EMF exposure has a negative impact on cognitive and/or behavior development in children; given limitations in the study design and that the majority of neurobehavioral functioning tasks were not affected, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn.

AB Child sexual abuse (CSA) continues to be a significant problem with significant short and long term consequences. However, extant literature is limited by the reliance on retrospective recall of adult samples, single-time assessments, and lack of longitudinal data during the childhood and adolescent years. The purpose of this study was to compare internalizing and externalizing behavior problems of those with a history of sexual abuse to those with a history of maltreatment, but not sexual abuse. We examined whether gender moderated problems over time. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) at ages 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 (N = 977). The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. Maltreatment history and types were obtained from official Child Protective Services (CPS) records. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to assess behavior problems over time by maltreatment group. Findings indicated significantly more problems in the CSA group than the maltreated group without CSA over time. Internalizing problems were higher for sexually abused boys compared to girls. For sexually abused girls internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems increased with age relative to boys. This pattern was similar among maltreated but not sexually abused youth. Further efforts are needed to examine the psychological effects of maltreatment, particularly CSA longitudinally as well as better understand possible gender differences in order to best guide treatment efforts.

AB Few studies have examined the relative impact of co-occurring child characteristics on problematic feeding behavior. The aim of the current study was to assess the relative contributions of parent-perceived child characteristics in multivariable models of child feeding behavior. One hundred sixty-one mothers reported on their child's feeding behavior and a number of key child characteristics. These characteristics were entered into controlled multivariable models of child feeding behavior, using child and parent frequency domains of the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS; W. Crist etal., ) as outcome measures. Child feeding problems were positively associated with food neophobia and external behavioral and social issues, but not with most domains of temperamental difficulty or sensory sensitivity. Feeding problem frequency was associated with externalizing symptoms whereas parental perceptions of problems and coping were associated with social-interaction problems in the child. Population feeding problems appear to be external and interactive problems rather than driven by innate or internalizing factors. The association with externalizing symptoms suggests that feeding problems at this level may fall within a wider profile of challenging behavior; however, the existence of problematic feeding behaviors may constitute a challenge for parents only when the child's social interactions also are seen to be deficient.
   RESUMEN Trasfondo: Pocos estudios han examinado el impacto relativo de caracteristicas concurrentes del nino sobre conductas de alimentacion problematicas. El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar las contribuciones relativas de las caracteristicas del nino tal como son percibidas por el progenitor en modelos de variables multiples de conductas de alimentacion del nino. Metodos: 161 mamas reportaron acerca de la conducta de alimentacion de sus ninos y un numero de caracteristicas claves del nino. Estas caracteristicas fueron recogidas dentro de controlados modelos de variables multiples de conducta de alimentacion del nino, usando dominios de frecuencia de progenitores y ninos de la Escala de Evaluacion de Conducta Pediatrica de Alimentacion (BPFAS) como medidas de resultado. Resultados: Los problemas de alimentacion del nino fueron positivamente asociados con la neofobia a la comida y asuntos externos sociales y de conducta, pero no con la mayor parte de los dominios de la dificultad temperamental o la sensibilidad sensorial. La frecuencia de los problemas de alimentacion fue asociada con los sintomas de externalizacion, mientras que las percepciones de los progenitores acerca de los problemas y la forma de arreglarselas fueron asociadas con problemas de interaccion social en el nino. Conclusiones: Los problemas de alimentacion en la poblacion parecen ser problemas externos e interactivos, en vez de problemas basados en factores innatos o de internalizacion. La asociacion con sintomas de externalizacion sugiere que los problemas de alimentacion a este nivel pudieran encajar dentro del perfil mas amplio de una conducta desafiante. Sin embargo, la existencia de conductas de alimentacion problematicas pudiera constituir solamente un reto para los progenitores cuando las interacciones sociales del nino son tambien vistas como deficientes.
   RESUME Contexte: Peu d'etude ont examine l'impact relatif de caracteristiques simultanees de l'enfant sur le comportement alimentaire problematique. Le but de cette etude etait d'evaluer les contributions relatives des caracteristiques percues par le parent chez des modeles multi-variables de comportement alimentaire. Methode: 161 meres ont fait etat du comportement alimentaire de leur enfant et d'un nombre de caracteristiques cles de l'enfant. Ces caracteristiques ont ete entrees dans des modeles multivariables controles de comportment alimentaire de l'enfant, en utilisant des domaines de frequence de l'enfant et du parent de l'Echelle d'Evaluation du Comportement Pediatrique Alimentaire (en anglais Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale [BPFAS]) en tant que mesures de resultat. Resultats: Les problemes alimentaires de l'enfant sont lies de maniere positive a la phobie de la nourriture et a des problemes externes de comportement et sociaux, mais non pas a la plupart des domaines de difficultes de temperament ou de sensibilite sensorielle. La frequence des problemes alimentaires est liee a des symptomes externalisant, alors que les perceptions parentales des problemes et de la maniere de les aborder etaient liees a des problemes sociaux et a des problemes d'interaction chez l'enfant. Conclusions: Les problemes alimentaires semblent etre externes et des problemes d'interaction, plutot que des problemes conduits par des facteurs innes et internalisant. Le lien avec les symptomes externalisants suggere que les problemes alimentaires a ce niveau pourraient s'averer du domaine d'un plus grand profil de comportement difficile. Cependant, l'existence de comportements alimentaires problematiques peut egalement constituer un defi pour les parents lorsque les interactions sociales de l'enfant sont aussi percues comme etant defectueuses.
   ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Hintergrund: Nur wenige Studien haben den relativen Einfluss von gleichzeitig vorliegenden kindlichen Eigenschaften auf problematisches Futterungsverhalten untersucht. Das Ziel der Studie war es, die relativen Beitrage der von den Eltern wahrgenommenen kindlichen Eigenschaften in multivariablen Modellen zum Futterungsverhalten zu bewerten. Methoden: 161 Mutter berichteten uber das Futterungsverhalten bei ihren Kindern und uber eine Reihe wichtiger Eigenschaften der Kinder. Diese Eigenschaften wurden in kontrollierten multivariablen Modellen zum Futterungsverhalten bei Kindern eingeschlossen. Fur die Erfassung der abhangigen Variable wurden die Haufigkeitsskalen fur Kinder und Eltern aus der Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) verwendet. Ergebnisse: Futterungsprobleme bei Kindern waren positiv mit Lebensmittelneophobie und externalen Verhaltens-und sozialen Aspekten assoziiert, jedoch nicht mit den meisten problematischen Temperamentscharakteristika oder sensorischer Empfindlichkeit. Die Haufigkeit der Futterungsprobleme wurde mit Externalisierungssymptomen assoziiert, wahrend die elterlichen Problemwahrnehmungen und die Bewaltigung mit sozialen Interaktionsproblemen beim Kind assoziiert wurden. Schlussfolgerungen: Futterungsprobleme in der Bevolkerung scheinen externe und interaktive Probleme zu sein und sich eher weniger durch angeborene oder internalisierende Faktoren erklaren lassen. Die Assoziation mit Externalisierungssymptomen legt nahe, dass Futterungsprobleme in diesem Ausma ss mit einem gro ss eren Umfang an herausforderndem Verhalten einhergehen. Allerdings stellt das Vorhandensein von problematischen Futterungsverhalten nur dann eine Herausforderung fur die Eltern dar, wenn die soziale Interaktion des Kindes als mangelhaft erachtet wird.

AB We examined perceived parental styles, emotion socialization practices and emotion dysregulation among fathers from a community sample in order to understand the intergenerational transmission of normative parenting behaviors. The sample consisted of 217 fathers of school-age children ranging in age from 6 to 12 years. We used a cross-sectional design. The fathers completed a set of self-report questionnaires including parental boding instrument, difficulties in emotion regulation scale, and coping with children's negative emotion scale. The findings indicated that fathers' perceived parental care of their own parents (G1) was negatively linked to fathers' (G2) non-supportive responses to negative emotions shown by their children (G3) through its negative association with the father's (G2) emotion regulation difficulties, whereas fathers' perceived parental overprotection of their own parents (G1) was positively linked to fathers' (G2) non-supportive responses to negative emotions shown by their children (G3) through its positive associations with the fathers' (G2) emotion regulation difficulties. The current study contributed to the further understanding of individual differences in fathers' emotion socialization practices. The findings potentially shed lights on prevention and intervention efforts regarding limiting the expansion of maladaptive emotional parenting behaviors across generations.

AB Comorbid externalizing/internalizing symptoms among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often result in psychosocial distress. The current study examined how routines may be related to comorbid symptoms in children with ASD hospitalized for acute psychiatric care (n = 45) and a group of age/gender-matched typically developing peers (n = 45). Measures of routines, behavioral problems, and parental adjustment were completed by parents. Multiple regression analyses revealed a correlation between parental adjustment and internalizing symptoms among children, and a quadratic relation between routines and internalizing symptoms for the ASD group. A quadratic relation was also observed for routines and externalizing symptoms for the ASD group, whereas only parental adjustment emerged as a significant predictor of externalizing symptoms for the typically developing group. Implications for conceptualizing routines and treatment in the context of ASD are discussed.

AB This paper studies the discriminative capacity of CBCL/1A1/2-5 (Manual for the ASEBA Preschool-Age Forms & Profiles, University of Vermont, Research Center for Children, Youth, & Families, Burlington, 2000) DSM5 scales attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety and depressive problems for detecting the presence of DSM5 (DSM5 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, APA, Arlington, 2013) disorders, ADHD, ODD, Anxiety and Mood disorders, assessed through diagnostic interview, in children aged 3-5. Additionally, we compare the clinical utility of the CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 scales with respect to analogous CBCL/1A1/2-5 syndrome scales. A large community sample of 616 preschool children was longitudinally assessed for the stated age group. Statistical analysis was based on ROC procedures and binary logistic regressions. ADHD and ODD CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 scales achieved good discriminative ability to identify ADHD and ODD interview's diagnoses, at any age. CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 Anxiety scale discriminative capacity was fair for unspecific anxiety disorders in all age groups. CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 depressive problems' scale showed the poorest discriminative capacity for mood disorders (including depressive episode with insufficient symptoms), oscillating into the poor-to-fair range. As a whole, DSM5-oriented scales generally did not provide evidence better for discriminative capacity than syndrome scales in identifying DSM5 diagnoses. CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 scales discriminate externalizing disorders better than internalizing disorders for ages 3-5. Scores on the ADHD and ODD CBCL/1A1/2-5-DSM5 scales can be used to screen for DSM5 ADHD and ODD disorders in general populations of preschool children.

AB Most adolescents are placed in residential youth care (RYC) because of severe psychosocial strains and child maltreatment, which represent risk factors for developing mental disorders. To plan RYC units and ensure that residents receive evidence-based psychiatric interventions, it is necessary to obtain reliable and valid prevalence estimates of mental disorders in this population. However, there is a lacuna of research on diagnoses derived from standardized clinical interviews. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and comorbidity of mental disorders applying diagnostic interviews in an entire population of adolescents living in RYC in Norway. All young people in RYC were invited to participate in the study. Eighty-six RYC institutions with 601 eligible adolescents were included and 400 adolescents, 12-20 years old, participated in the study, yielding a response rate of 67 %. Anonymous Child Behaviour Checklist scores for 141 (70 %) of the declining residents were also available, allowing diagnoses according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for 541 youths to be estimated. Diagnoses were assessed by trained interviewers with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment interview (CAPA). Seventy-six point two per cent (71.5-80.8 CI 95 %) of adolescents received at least one 3-month DSM-IV diagnosis. Prevalence rates for internalizing psychiatric disorders were higher than for behavioural disorders. Comorbidity was high between these two groups. Mental disorders were prevalent among children and youth in RYC. Our results create major concerns and challenge the existing organization of the RYC system.

AB The death of a parent or sibling (family bereavement) is associated with mental health problems in approximately, 25 % of the affected children. However, it is still unknown whether mental health problems of family-bereaved adolescents are predicted by pre-existing mental health problems, pre-loss family functioning, or multiple bereavements. In this study, a prospective longitudinal assessment of change in mental health following bereavement was done in a large representative sample from the 'Tracking Adolescents Individual Lives Survey' (TRAILS). This is a four-wave prospective cohort study of Dutch adolescents (n = 2230) of whom 131 (5.9 %) had experienced family bereavement at the last wave (T4). Family-bereaved adolescents reported more internalizing problems, within 2 years after family bereavement, compared to the non-bereaved peers, while taking into account the level of internalizing problems before the bereavement. A clinically relevant finding was that 22 % new cases were found in family-bereaved, in comparison to 5.5 % new cases in non-bereaved. Low SES predicted more internalizing problems in family-bereaved but not in non-bereaved adolescents. Family functioning, reported by the adolescent, did not predict mental health problems within 2 years. Multiple family bereavements predicted fewer externalizing problems. In conclusion, internalizing problems increase in adolescents after family bereavement in comparison to non-bereaved and these can be predicted by pre-loss factors. Awareness among professionals regarding the risks for aggravation of mental health problems after family loss is needed.

AB This study investigated the effects of kinship foster care on mental health outcomes among African American youth. Longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents involved in the child welfare system provided multilevel data on African American youth (n = 225) placed into foster care. Current caregivers reported on youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms immediately following placement into out-of-home care, as well as 18 months later. Path analysis tested a theoretical model that compared placements with kin to other formal out-of-home arrangements in context of setting characteristics, including aspects of caregiver and neighborhood disorder. Results suggested significant increases in internalizing symptoms over time for youth with more baseline mental health problems, as well as those placed in more distressed neighborhoods. Increased externalizing symptoms occurred among youth with greater baseline behavior problems, those placed in more problematic neighborhoods, and youth who experienced a placement change between assessments. Additionally, a combination of placement characteristics predicted increases in externalizing problems; youth placed in kinship foster care with older caregivers in poorer health exhibited greater increases in externalizing problems. Findings highlighted important contextual considerations for out-of-home placement among African American youth.

AB Peer victimization is a significant risk factor for a range of negative outcomes during adolescence, including depression and anxiety. Recent research has evaluated individual characteristics that heighten the risk of experiencing peer victimization. However, the role of emotional clarity, or the ability to understand one's emotions, in being the target of peer victimization remains unclear. Thus, the present study evaluated whether deficits in emotional clarity increased the risk of experiencing peer victimization, particularly among adolescent girls, which, in turn, contributed to prospective levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. In the present study, 355 early adolescents (ages 12-13; 53 % female; 51 % African American) who were part of the Adolescent Cognition and Emotion project completed measures of emotional clarity, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and measures of peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Moderation analyses indicated that deficits in emotional clarity predicted greater peer victimization among adolescent girls, but not adolescent boys. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that deficits in emotional clarity contributed to relational peer victimization, which, in turn, predicted prospective levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescent girls, but not boys. These findings indicate that deficits in emotional clarity represent a significant risk factor for adolescent girls to experience relational peer victimization, which, in turn, contributed to prospective levels of internalizing symptoms. Thus, prevention programs should target deficits in emotional clarity to prevent peer victimization and subsequent internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls.

AB Using a sample of 1,163 adolescents from four middle schools in China, this study explores the intervening process of how adolescent maltreatment is related to delinquency within the framework of general strain theory (GST) by comparing two models. The first model is Agnew's integrated model of GST, which examines the mediating effects of social control, delinquent peer affiliation, state anger, and depression on the relationship between maltreatment and delinquency. Based on this model, with the intent to further explore the mediating effects of state anger and depression and to investigate whether their effects on delinquency can be demonstrated more through delinquent peer affiliation and social control, an extended model (Model 2) is proposed by the authors. The second model relates state anger to delinquent peer affiliation and state depression to social control. By comparing the fit indices and the significance of the hypothesized paths of the two models, the study found that the extended model can better reflect the mechanism of how maltreatment contributes to delinquency, whereas the original integrated GST model only receives partial support because of its failure to find the mediating effects of state negative emotions.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between early childhood professionals' (ECPs) stress regulation (using salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase [AA] measurements), work engagement and the quality of their pedagogical work in integrated special day-care groups. Participants were 89 ECPs from 21 integrated special day-care groups located in Helsinki, Finland. The special educational needs of children (who were between 3 and 6years of age) in these groups varied from language disorders and self-regulation difficulties to severe disabilities. Data was collected by using work engagement surveys, salivary cortisol and AA measurements and observational assessments of pedagogical work. This study is novel, in that it combines approaches from different disciplines to investigate work-related well-being among ECPs. Our findings demonstrate the close relationship between ECPs' stress regulation and the quality of pedagogical work in teams. Whilst ECPs' high work engagement was associated with better-quality pedagogical work, we did not find any associations between different biomarkers and work engagement. Our study highlights the importance of teamwork, not only as fundamental to high-quality early childhood special education, but also in supporting the well-being of ECE professionals. The findings can be applied in future studies and can be used to inform intervention aiming to enhance working conditions in day-care centres.

AB Objective: Most research on irritability and child psychopathology has focused on depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, and/or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Less is known about relationships between child anxiety and irritability and moderators of such associations.
   Method: Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine associations between anxiety severity and irritability in a large sample of treatment-seeking youth with anxiety disorders (N = 663, aged 7-19 years, mean = 12.25 years), after accounting for comorbid depressive disorders and ODD. Additional analyses examined whether associations were moderated by child gender, age, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) status.
   Results: There was a direct link between child anxiety and irritability even after accounting for comorbid depressive disorders and ODD. Links between child anxiety and irritability were robust across child gender and age. Furthermore, relationships between child anxiety and irritability were comparable across youth with and without GAD, suggesting that the anxiety-irritability link is relevant across child anxiety disorders and not confined to youth with GAD.
   Conclusion: Findings add to an increasing body of evidence linking child irritability to a range of internalizing and externalizing psychopathologies, and suggest that child anxiety assessment should systematically incorporate irritability evaluations. Moreover, youth in clinical settings displaying irritability should be assessed for the presence of anxiety. Treatments for childhood anxiety may do well to incorporate new treatment modules as needed that specifically target problems of irritability.

AB Background. Depression and anxiety persist within and across diagnostic boundaries. The manner in which common v. disorder-specific genetic and environmental influences operate across development to maintain internalizing disorders and their co-morbidity is unclear. This paper investigates the stability and change of etiological influences on depression, panic, generalized, separation and social anxiety symptoms, and their co-occurrence, across adolescence and young adulthood.
   Method. A total of 2619 twins/siblings prospectively reported symptoms of depression and anxiety at mean ages 15, 17 and 20 years.
   Results. Each symptom scale showed a similar pattern of moderate continuity across development, largely underpinned by genetic stability. New genetic influences contributing to change in the developmental course of the symptoms emerged at each time point. All symptom scales correlated moderately with one another over time. Genetic influences, both stable and time-specific, overlapped considerably between the scales. Non-shared environmental influences were largely time- and symptom-specific, but some contributed moderately to the stability of depression and anxiety symptom scales. These stable, longitudinal environmental influences were highly correlated between the symptoms.
   Conclusions. The results highlight both stable and dynamic etiology of depression and anxiety symptom scales. They provide preliminary evidence that stable as well as newly emerging genes contribute to the co-morbidity between depression and anxiety across adolescence and young adulthood. Conversely, environmental influences are largely time-specific and contribute to change in symptoms over time. The results inform molecular genetics research and transdiagnostic treatment and prevention approaches.

AB In the antiretroviral era, youth perinatally infected with HIV (PHIV+) are surviving into adulthood and are at risk for emotional and behavioural problems. Few studies of these problems have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries and even fewer in sub-Saharan Africa. The aims of this study were to provide a quantitative description of emotional and behavioural problems in a group of PHIV+ youth (n=78) in South Africa compared with a group of demographically matched HIV-negative controls (n=30) and to identify correlates of emotional and behavioural problems. A cross-sectional study was conducted employing participants from community and hospital-based clinics. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Several measures were used to assess demographic, biological, cognitive and contextual correlates of problem behaviours. Youth were compared by HIV status on demographic, cognitive and contextual variables as well as the Total Problems and subscale scores of the CBCL. Multivariate comparisons of the influence of contextual and cognitive variables on CBCL Total Problems scores were performed using a stepwise linear regression analytic procedure. In this study, there were no significant differences in between-group comparisons for the prevalence of Internalizing, Externalizing and Total Problems in the PHIV+ youth and control group at the clinical and borderline cut-off ranges of the CBCL. Caregiver depression was the only significant predictor of greater Total Problems scores in the full model, after controlling for age and gender (F=8.57, df=5.102, P<.01). An interaction between HIV status and caregiver depression was observed (t=-2.20, P=.03), with follow-up within-group analyses confirming that caregiver depression predicted greater Total Problems scores both in HIV-negative youth (=0.61, P<.001), and to a lesser extent, in HIV-positive youth (=0.25, P<.001). This study highlights the need for adequate screening of depression in the caregivers of HIV-infected youth.

TI Yoga-based Psychotherapy Groups for Boys Exposed to Trauma in Urban
   Settings
SO ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-BENEFITS; CHILDREN; SCHOOL
AB Background Children who experience abuse and neglect and are exposed to adverse life events are at risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. They may display variable internalizing and externalizing symptoms, such as posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and aggression. Yoga may be able to regulate body-brain pathways that cause stress following traumatic experiences, thereby reducing adverse mental and physical sequelae.
   Objective The objective of this preliminary study is to examine changes in functioning following meetings of a yoga-based psychotherapy group (YBPG) for boys with a history of interpersonal trauma exposure.
   Methods/Design The study was a prospective, intervention cohort study.
   Setting The study occurred at an urban-based mental health center focusing on treatment of children exposed to interpersonal trauma in their communities and families.
   Participants Participants were 10 boys, aged 8-12 y, who primarily were African-Americans (70%) and who had a history of trauma.
   Intervention The YBPG was a 12-wk, yoga-based, group therapy, integrated with mental health treatment that was trauma informed and evidence-based.
   Outcome Measures Measures of attendance and interpersonal functioning-the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale 2 (BERS-2) and patient satisfaction surveys were collected. The pre- and post-YBPG, paired t test; Wilcoxon's signed rank test; and effect sizes were calculated to assess change in interpersonal functioning following the YBPG, as reported by the parents and children.
   Results The BERS-2 scores yielded clinically and statistically significant mean improvements on the parents' ratings of participants' (1) Interpersonal Strength, Intrapersonal Strength, and Family Involvement scores, with mean improvements on those subscales being 1.4 (P = .007), 1.9 (P = .012), and 1.4 (P = .045) points, respectively; and (2) Strength Index scores, with a mean improvement of 8.7 (P = .004). The effect size was in the large range. In addition to significant improvements posttreatment, the parents' mean rating score of their children's functioning was closer but still lower than the children's self-reports on all subscales. The attendance rate for the YBPG was among the highest for group therapies at the center.
   Conclusions The study provided preliminary evidence for the feasibility of YBPG as an effective intervention for boys exposed to trauma in urban settings.

ID PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; CHILDREN; VERSION; VALIDITY; PARENT; SDQ
AB Background The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assesses behavioural adjustment in children aged 3 to 16 years. To ascertain the appropriateness of the scale for a specific population, it is important to examine whether the distinctiveness of the scale dimensions can be verified empirically.
   Aims Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test explicitly which of three models better explain our data, and whether model fit was improved by the addition of method factors.
   Methods Parents of 411 Singaporean kindergartners completed the SDQ.
   Results A four-factor multi-trait multi-method model (Prosocial, Conduct, Hyperactivity, Internalizing and two method factors) provided the best fit to the data. There was strong evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. However, differences in configural loading pattern indicated gender-related differences in the mapping of the SDQ items.
   Discussion Differences in factor structure across countries and gender may reflect differing conceptions of the underlying dimensions, as well as differences in normative expectations. However, our findings may allow its use as a screening tool to identify Singaporean children at risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that early adversity is linked to methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, NR3C1, which is a key regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Yet no prior work has considered the contribution of methylation of NR3C1 to emerging behavior problems and psychopathology in childhood. This study examined the links between methylation of NR3C1 and behavior problems in preschoolers. Data were drawn from a sample of preschoolers with early adversity (n=171). Children ranged in age from 3 to 5years, were racially and ethnically diverse, and nearly all qualified for public assistance. Seventy-one children had child welfare documentation of moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6months. Structured record review and interviews in the home were used to assess early adversity. Parents reported on child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Methylation of NR3C1 at exons 1(D), 1(F), and 1(H) were measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing from saliva DNA. Methylation of NR3C1 at exons 1(D) and 1(F) was positively associated with internalizing (r=.21, p<.01 and r=.23, p<.01, respectively), but not externalizing, behavior problems. Furthermore, NR3C1 methylation mediated effects of early adversity on internalizing behavior problems. These results suggest that methylation of NR3C1 contributes to psychopathology in young children, and NR3C1 methylation from saliva DNA is salient to behavioral outcomes.

AB Despite the burgeoning scientific literature examining the sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) construct, very little is known about the clinical presentation of SCT. In clinical cases where SCT is suspected, it is critical to carefully assess not only for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but also for other comorbidities that may account for the SCT-related behaviors, especially internalizing symptoms and sleep problems. The current case study provides a clinical description of SCT in a 7-year-old girl, offering a real-life portrait of SCT while also providing an opportunity to qualitatively differentiate between SCT and ADHD, other psychopathologies (e.g. depression, anxiety), and potentially related domains of functioning (e.g. sleep, executive functioning [EF]). Jessica was described by herself, parents, and teacher as being much slower than her peers in completing schoolwork, despite standardized testing showing Jessica to have above average intelligence and academic achievement. Jessica's parents completed rating scales indicating high levels of SCT symptoms and daytime sleepiness, as well as mildly elevated EF deficits. More research is needed to determine how to best conceptualize, assess, and treat SCT, and Jessica's case underscores the importance of further work in this area.

AB Objective: Several developmental models of borderline personality disorder (BPD) emphasize the role of disrupted interpersonal relationships or insecure attachment. As yet, attachment quality and the mechanisms by which insecure attachment relates to borderline features in adolescents have not been investigated. In this study, we used a multiple mediational approach to examine the cross-sectional interplay between attachment, social cognition (in particular hypermentalizing), emotion dysregulation, and borderline features in adolescence, controlling for internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Methods: The sample included 259 consecutive admissions to an adolescent inpatient unit (M-age = 15.42, SD = 1.43; 63.1% female). The Child Attachment Interview (CM) was used to obtain a dimensional index of overall coherence of the attachment narrative. An experimental task was used to assess hypermentalizing, alongside self-report measures of emotion dyregulation and BPD.
   Results: Our findings suggested that, in a multiple mediation model, hypermentalizing and emotion dysregulation together mediated the relation between attachment coherence and borderline features, but that this effect was driven by hypermentalizing; that is, emotion dysregulation failed to mediate the link between attachment coherence and borderline features while hypermentalizing demonstrated mediational effects.
   Conclusions: The study provides the first empirical evidence of well-established theoretical approaches to the development of BPD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships between emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide. One hundred forty-eight undergraduates completed a brief structured interview and self-report measures of emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, and NSSI and suicidal behaviors. Results indicated a significant indirect effect of emotion dysregulation on NSSI via internalizing symptoms and on suicide attempts via NSSI. Findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the indirect association between emotion dysregulation and NSSI and suicidal behaviors. Implications for the potential utility of targeting internalizing symptoms as well as emotion dysregulation in interventions addressing NSSI and suicidal behaviors are discussed.

AB AIM Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of the study was to characterize the DMD neuropsychiatric profile fully and to explore underlying genotype/phenotype associations.
   METHOD One hundred and thirty males with DMD (mean age 9y 10mo, range 5-17y) in four European centres were included and completed IQ assessment and a neurodevelopmental-screening questionnaire. Of these, 87 underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment using structured diagnostic interview and parent-reported questionnaires.
   RESULTS The overall mean score on the neurodevelopmental questionnaire was significantly abnormal compared with the general population of children (p<0.001). On average, intelligence was below the population mean, with intellectual disability observed in 34 males (26%). Autistic spectrum disorder was identified in 18 (21%), hyperactivity in 21 (24%), and inattention in 38 (44%). Clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems were observed in 21 (24%) and 13 (15%) respectively. Over a third of males scored more than two measures of emotional, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental problems. Males with mutations at the 30 end of the DMD gene affecting all protein isoforms had higher rates of intellectual disability and clusters of symptoms.
   INTERPRETATION Males with DMD are at very high risk of neuropsychiatric disturbance, and this risk appears to increase with mutations at the 30 end of the gene. Patterns of symptom clusters suggest a DMD neuropsychiatric syndrome, which may require prompt evaluation and early intervention.

AB Emerging research suggests that early exposure to environmental adversity has important implications for the development of brain regions associated with emotion regulation, yet little is known about how such adversity translates into observable differences in children's emotion-related behavior. The present study examines the relationship between geocoded neighborhood crime and urban pre-adolescents' emotional attention, appraisal, and response. Results indicate that living in a high-crime neighborhood is associated with greater selective attention toward negatively valenced emotional stimuli on a dot probe task, less biased appraisal of fear on a facial identification task, and lower rates of teacher-reported internalizing behaviors in the classroom. These findings suggest that children facing particularly high levels of environmental threat may develop different regulatory processes (e.g. greater use of emotional suppression) than their peers from low-crime neighborhoods in order to manage the unique stressors and social demands of their communities.

AB This study examined three models testing directional associations between children's adjustment problems (internalizing and externalizing problems) and teacher-child relationship quality (closeness, conflict, and dependency) over one school term. The relationship-driven model tested the hypothesis that teacher-child relationship quality contributes to prospective levels of adjustment problems. The child-driven model tested the hypothesis that children's adjustment problems contribute to prospective relationship quality. The transactional model tested the hypothesis that adjustment problems and relationship quality are reciprocally related over time. These models were tested with a sample of low-income, ethnically diverse children in kindergarten to grade 3 who were assessed at three time points over one school term (winter, early spring, and late spring). Overall, the child-driven model best explained the directional associations between adjustment problems and conflictual and dependent teacher-child relationships. When children showed higher levels of externalizing problems, they subsequently experienced more conflict in their relationships with their teachers. When children showed more internalizing problems they experienced more prospective dependency in their relationships with their teachers. Adjustment problems and teacher-child closeness were modestly related within time but not across time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB During the school years, family and school are contexts in which risk and protection mechanisms for favorable or unfavorable trajectories regarding the development of children are engendered. Early adaptive disabilities, expressed in high levels of emotional and/or behavior problems, have been associated with unfavorable trajectories. The present study aimed to test a prediction model of behavior problems in schoolchildren, having as variable support predictors to the development and adversity in family contexts, as well as the existence of school complaints, indicating adversity in the school context. Sixty children aged 7 to 11 years and their mothers participated in this study and they were recruited in a public elementary school and in a university clinic of psychology. The instruments used in this study were: Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices - Special Scale, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Family Environment Resources Inventory (Recursos do Ambiente Familiar - RAF), Family Life subscale from the Adverse Events Scale (Escala de Eventos Adversos - EEA). Data collection took place at the clinic and school. The data were analyzed by means of multiple linear regression, verifying the power of prediction of behavioral outcomes considering the environment variables. The results indicated school adversity as the main predictor of attention problems, social problems and aggressive behavior. Family adversity was associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Two modalities of family support (daily regular routine and leisure activities in free time) seemed to prevent behavior problems. These are home resources amenable to intervention.

AB Despite a general perception that violent or scary television creates anxiety in children, the research literature is small and disparate. A meta-analysis quantifies the impact of scary television and film on children's internalizing emotions (fear, anxiety, sadness, and sleep problems). Scary television has a relatively small impact on children's internalizing emotions (r=.18) overall, and this association was not significantly moderated by whether the televised material was factual (e.g., news) or fictional or contained violence. Children under 10 were more susceptible to scary TV. The overall result contrasts with the dramatic effects found for individual children within studies, suggesting that research is needed to unpick the factors that moderate the effect that scary television has on children.

AB Prior research has provided evidence that in children sleep and behavior are related. We aimed to determine the association between naturalistic daily variations in sleep and behavioral functioning. African American children, 5.4 +/- 1.7 years old, living on the south side of Chicago participated in a repeated measures study to assess this sleep -behavior link. Data was obtained from three separate two-week periods of 24 -hour actigraphy and the parental version of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children. Canonical correlations analyses were applied to investigate the relation between individual changes in sleep and behavior.
   After 1 -month, weekday average sleep duration primarily related to internalizing behaviors, while within -child variability of sleep related to behavioral changes which may involve internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Week -weekend differences in sleep associated with maladaptive social skills. Over a 6 -week period, sleep onset latency and sleep offset latency related to behavioral symptoms and maladaptive skills. Over a period of 3 -months, sleep associated with symptomatic behaviors while the adverse impact of within -child variability of sleep attenuated. Alternatively, the week -weekend differences in bedtime, wake-up time, wake after sleep onset and sleep onset latency in particular related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Findings showed that poor sleep related to dysfunctional behaviors. While maladaptive at the beginning, they may develop into symptomatic behaviors with potentially internalizing characteristics. As time goes on, individual changes in sleep onset and offset might be important clinical markers of a chronic 'social dysregulation'. Continued sufficient and regular sleep may improve daytime and nighttime behavioral regulation in early childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many adolescents are exposed to violence in their schools, communities and homes. Exposure to violence at high levels or across multiple contexts has been linked with emotional desensitization, indicated by low levels of internalizing symptoms. However, the long-term consequences of such desensitization are unknown. This study examined emotional desensitization to violence, together with externalizing problems, as mediators of the relationship between exposure to violence in pre-adolescence and violent behavior in late adolescence. A community sample of youth (N = 704; 48 % female; 76 % African American, 22 % Caucasian) reported on their exposure to violence in multiple settings at ages 11, 13 and 18. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at ages 11 and 13; violent behavior was measured at age 18. Structural Equation Modeling showed that exposure to high levels of violence at age 11 was associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (quadratic effect) at age 13, as was exposure to violence across multiple contexts (linear effect). In turn, fewer internalizing problems and more externalizing problems at age 13 predicted more violent behavior at age 18. The results suggest that emotional desensitization to violence in early adolescence contributes to serious violence in late adolescence.

AB Somatic complaints in children and adolescents may be considered part of a broader spectrum of internalizing disorders that include anxiety and depression. Previous research on the topic has focused mainly on the relationship between anxiety and depression without investigating how common somatic symptoms relate to an underlying factor and its etiology. Based on the classical twin design with monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together, our study aimed to explore the extent to which the covariation between three phenotypes in adolescent girls and boys can be represented by a latent internalizing factor, with a focus on both common and specific etiological sources. A population-based sample of twins aged 12-18 years and their mothers and fathers (N = 1394 families) responded to questionnaire items measuring the three phenotypes. Informants' ratings were collapsed using full information maximum likelihood estimated factor scores. Multivariate genetic analyses were conducted to examine the etiological structure of concurrent symptoms. The best fitting model was an ACE common pathway model without sex limitation and with one substantially heritable (44 %) latent factor shared by the phenotypes. Concurrent symptoms also resulted from shared (25 %) and non-shared (31 %) environments. The factor loaded most on depression symptoms and least on somatic complaints. Trait-specific influences explained 44 % of depression variance, 59 % of anxiety variance, and 65 % of somatic variance. Our results suggest the presence of a general internalizing factor along which somatic complaints and mental distress can be modeled. However, specific influences make the symptom types distinguishable.

AB This study traces the developmental course of irritability symptoms in oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) from ages 3-5 and examines the psychopathological outcomes of the different trajectories at age 6. Method. A sample of 622 3-year-old preschoolers (311 were boys), followed up until age 6, was assessed yearly with a semi-structured diagnostic interview with parents and at age 6 with questionnaires answered by parents, teachers and children. Results. Growth-Mixture-Modeling yielded five trajectories of irritability levels for the whole sample (high-persistent 3.5 %, decreasing 3.8 %, increasing 2.6 %, low-persistent 44.1 % and null 46.0 %). Among the children who presented with ODD during preschool age, three trajectories of irritability symptoms resulted (high-persistent 31.9 %, decreasing 34.9 % and increasing 33.2 %). Null, low-persistent and decreasing irritability courses in the sample as a whole gave very similar discriminative capacity for children's psychopathological state at age 6, while the increasing and high-persistent categories involved poorer clinical outcomes than the null course. For ODD children, the high-persistent and increasing trajectories of irritability predicted disruptive behavior disorders, comorbidity, high level of functional impairment, internalizing and externalizing problems and low anger control at age 6. Conclusions. Irritability identifies a subset of ODD children at high risk of poorer longitudinal psychopathological and functional outcomes. It might be clinically relevant to identify this subset of ODD children with a high number of irritability symptoms throughout development with a view to preventing comorbid and future adverse longitudinal outcomes.

AB This study examined ethnic identity development and its association with child functioning among 4-5 year old Latino children. Six hundred seventy-four Mexican and Dominican American children participated in an ethnic identity interview, and teachers and mothers reported on children's externalizing, internalizing and adaptive behavior functioning. Results are consistent with social identity developmental theory in suggesting that ethnic identity is emerging at this young age. Moreover, various components of ethnic identity were associated with better adaptive behavior and fewer externalizing and internalizing problems, particularly as reported by teachers. Findings were robust across child gender and ethnicity (i.e., country of origin). During early childhood, ethnic identity may be an important protective factor that can promote the behavioral functioning of Latino children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The goal of this study is to investigate differences in executive function (EF) in children with different levels of disruptive behavior problems (DBP). Methods: Ninety-three children between 7 and 12 years old with DBP were compared to 63 normally developing peers on a battery of EF tasks that varied in the amount of required emotion regulation ('hot' EF). Results: Differences in EF were found between DBP and comparison groups as indexed by hot EF tasks. Self-reported emotion scales, in conjunction with physiological recordings of heart rate, confirmed that emotions were elicited during hot EF. Conclusions: Results suggest that difficulties in hot EF underlie externalizing problem behaviors in middle childhood.

AB Background Depressive disorder is recognized as recurrent or chronic in the majority of affected individuals; but literature is not consistent about determinants of the disorder course. Aims To analyse the relationships between familial, personal and environmental characteristics in different life phases and their effects on the chronicity of depression in a population-based sample. Methods It was a longitudinal panel study with three waves (W1-W3) for 651 adult men and women with diagnosis of minor/major depression or dysthymia at W1 of the Swedish PART (mental health, work and relations) study. Risk factors and co-morbidities were assessed with questionnaires. The main outcome was an episode of minor/major depression or dysthymia at 10-12 years of follow-up (W3). Liability for depressive episodes was determined using exploratory structural equation modelling (SEM), following a path approach with step-wise specification searches. Results Most of the risk factors determined, directly or indirectly, depression severity at W3. Somatic trait anxiety, partner loss and other negative life events at W1, depressive symptoms at W2, and life difficulties and other dependent life events at W3 had direct effects on the outcome. Conclusions SEM model revealed complex and intertwined psychopathological pathways leading to chronicity of depression, given previous episodes, which could be assembled in two main mechanisms: a depressive-internalizing path and an adversity path comprised of life events. Pathways are simpler than those of depression occurrence, emphasizing the relevance of personality factors as depression determinants, and excluding disability levels, co-morbidities and social support. These novel findings need to be replicated in future studies.

AB Depression and anxiety (internalizing disorders) are the largest contributors to the non-fatal health burden among young people. This is the first meta-analysis to examine the joint efficacy of universal, selective, and indicated preventive interventions upon both depression and anxiety among children and adolescents (5-18 years) while accounting for their co-morbidity. We conducted a systematic review of reviews in Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, from 1980 to August 2014. Multivariate meta-analysis examined the efficacy of preventive interventions on depression and anxiety outcomes separately, and the joint efficacy on both disorders combined. Meta-regressions examined heterogeneity of effect according to a range of study variables. Outcomes were relative risks (RR) for disorder, and standardized mean differences (Cohen's d) for symptoms. One hundred and forty-six randomized controlled trials (46 072 participants) evaluated universal (children with no identified risk, n = 54) selective (population subgroups of children who have an increased risk of developing internalizing disorders due to shared risk factors, n = 45) and indicated prevention (children with minimal but detectable symptoms of an internalizing disorder, n = 47), mostly using psychological-only strategies (n = 105). Reductions in internalizing disorder onset occurred up to 9 months post-intervention, whether universal [RR 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.60], selective (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.85) or indicated (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.78). Reductions in internalizing symptoms occurred up to 12 months post-intervention for universal prevention; however, reductions only occurred in the shorter term for selective and indicated prevention. Universal, selective and indicated prevention interventions are efficacious in reducing internalizing disorders and symptoms in the short term. They might be considered as repeated exposures in school settings across childhood and adolescence. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42014013990.)

AB Objective: To identify the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems among preschoolers from the city of Salvador, state of Bahia, Brazil, and their associations with maternal mental health and family characteristics.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 349 children aged 49 to 72 months, randomly selected from 20,000 households representing the range of socioeconomic and environmental conditions in Salvador. In 1999, we assessed sociodemographic variables and family environment characteristics. In 2001, we used the Child Behavior Checklist to measure and describe the frequencies of behavior problems. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis to estimate associations between family and maternal factors and prevalence of behavior problems.
   Results: The overall prevalence of behavior problems was 23.5%. The prevalence of internalizing problems was 9.7%, and that of externalizing problems, 25.2%. Behavior problems were associated with several maternal mental health variables, namely: presence of at least one psychiatric diagnosis (odds radio [OR] 3.01, 95%Cl 1.75-5.18), anxiety disorder (OR 2.06, 95%Cl 1.20-3.46), affective disorder (OR 2.10, 95%Cl 1.21-3.65), and mental health disorders due to use of psychoactive substances (OR 2.31, 95%Cl 1.18-4.55).
   Conclusion: The observed prevalence of child behavior problems fell within the range reported in previous studies. Maternal mental health is an important risk factor for behavior problems in preschool aged children.

AB Background: Behavioral sleep problems are common in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and longitudinal studies have found sleep problems to be both a predictor and outcome of internalizing and externalizing problems. We investigated the potential bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and internalizing/externalizing problems.
   Methods: Children with ADHD, aged 5-13 years, were recruited from 21 pediatric practices across Victoria, Australia (N=270). Across a 12-month period, at three time points, parents reported on their child's sleep problems (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) and emotional and behavioral functioning (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Data were analyzed using autoregressive cross-lagged panel models.
   Results: Sleep problem severity and emotional/behavioral problem severity were very stable across the 12-month period. Sleep problems at baseline predicted emotional problems at six months (r=0.17, p <0.01), and emotional problems at baseline predicted sleep problems at six months (r=0.07, p < 0.05). However, there was no predictive relationship between sleep problems and emotional problems from 6-12 months. No bidirectional relationship was observed between sleep problems and conduct problems.
   Conclusions: In children with ADHD, there is weak evidence of a bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and emotional problems. These symptoms are also very stable over time; therefore, the best treatment approach to improve overall functioning may be to target both sleep and emotional functioning in these children.

AB Shame is a powerful self-conscious emotion that can interfere with healthy psychological functioning. We examined the validity of the Compass of Shame Scale (CoSS), a self-report measure designed to assess shame regulation styles. In this paper, the construct validity of the Dutch version and two newly developed subscales of the CoSS were investigated in a survey of 324 adolescents. The results confirmed that the Dutch version and the two new subscales have satisfactory psychometric qualities. We also studied the higher level factor structure of the CoSS for measuring shame by introducing the concepts of internalizing and externalizing shame-coping styles and the results support the observation that the CoSS measures maladaptive neurotic internalizing shame regulation, as well as externalizing shame regulation.

AB Background: Sexual minority youth, especially girls, are at risk for alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use when these substances are examined individually. However, little is known about concurrent use of these substances (i.e., three-substance use) in relation to sexual orientation. Objectives: The present study compared profiles of past year alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use between SMGs and heterosexual girls. In addition, because internalizing and externalizing symptoms are associated with substance use, we examined whether sexual orientation was associated with substance use profile over and above co-occurring psychopathology. Methods: Mixture modeling was used to identify patterns of alcohol (including binge drinking), cigarette, and marijuana use in the past year using a cross-sectional sample of urban adolescent girls (Pittsburgh Girls Study; N = 2,064; mean age = 17). Approximately 8% (n = 173) of the girls endorsed a lesbian or bisexual identity. Results: Five substance using classes were identified: low-level substance use (72%), marijuana use (5%), cigarette use (8%), alcohol use (8%), and three-substance use (7%). SMGs were at an increased risk for substance use than heterosexual girls, particularly three-substance use (OR = 6.69, p < .001), cigarette use (OR = 6.26, p < .001), and marijuana use (OR = 3.86, p < .001) classes. Substance use patterns were regressed on sexual orientation, internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety), and externalizing symptoms (i.e., conduct problems, oppositional defiant disorder). The disparities remained robust after controlling for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Conclusions/Importance: Clinicians and researchers should be aware of potential three-substance use among SMGs. Substance use interventions for SMG may benefit from targeting risk factors that cut-across several substances, particularly externalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Structural models of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms have gained empirical support but await greater empirical scrutiny on issues such as reconciliation between competing models, evidence for gender differences, and delineation of external correlates. More extensive validation evidence is particularly necessary in consideration of their incorporation in psychiatric nomenclature. Methods: We fitted previously proposed, but competing, models to ODD symptoms assessed with the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Shaffer etal., 2000, J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 39, 28) in a community sample and then fitted the best-fitting model in a replication sample (combined N=730, M-age=9.89, SD=0.75). Analyses also examined potential classes based on resulting subfactors, gender differences, longitudinal associations with later behavioral problems, and concurrent personality associations. Results: Burke's (2010) two-factor model composed of Irritability and Oppositionality subfactors best fit the data. Irritability and Oppositionality showed convergent and divergent patterns of association with personality traits at T1 and with externalizing and internalizing problems at T2. Latent class analyses revealed three classes (low severity, irritable/combined, and oppositional) which showed parallel divergence in externalizing and internalizing problem comorbidity. These findings were largely robust across gender and samples. Conclusions: These findings support Irritability/Oppositionality subfactors of ODD in two mixed-gender samples, demonstrate strong evidence for a lack of gender differences in such subfactors, and demonstrate their convergent and divergent validity in emergent latent classes, later behavioral problems, and personality correlates.

AB Using data from 810 women entering the Department of Women's Justice Services in the Cook County Jail (Chicago) from 2010 to 2013, this study examines patterns of trauma exposure and the relationship between trauma exposure and mental disorders. Female detainees averaged 6.1 (SD = 4.90) types of trauma in their lifetimes, with greater trauma exposure associated with earlier age of trauma onset, more recent trauma exposure, and higher rates of fear for life or injury. Higher rates of trauma exposure were also correlated with higher rates of past-year symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder as well as other internalizing, externalizing, and substance use disorders. Behavioral health programming for female detainees in jail settings should include more trauma-sensitive mental health and substance use disorder treatments.

AB The social-emotional functions associated with Machiavellianism have been widely examined. However, no study has explored the relations among Machiavellianism, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems in adolescents. In samples from Chinese adolescents (N = 413), we examined how Machiavellianism is related to internalizing and externalizing problems. Results indicated that (a) Machiavellianism was positively associated with hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and peer relationship problems; (b) sex of the participant may moderate the relations between Machiavellianism and peer relationship problems, with the positive correlation is stronger for girls than for boys; (c) emotional symptoms partially mediated the effect of Machiavellianism on hyperactivity, and partially mediated the effect of Machiavellianism on conduct problems. Additionally, results also indicated girls scored significantly higher than boys on emotional symptoms, and there is a general tendency that boys reported higher Machiavellianism than girls.

AB Objective: The present study aimed to assess the direct and indirect impacts of the metacognition, emotional schema and emotion regulation in prediction of post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptom.
   Method: Participants consisted of 678 high school students from earthquake-stricken areas of eastern Azerbaijan selected from Varzaghan,Ahar and Hells by multistage cluster sampling. PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR), Metacognition Questionnaire Adolescent Version (MCQ-A), Leahy Emotional Schema Scale (LESS) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were utilized for data collection. SPSS software and LISREL software were used for data analysis.
   Results: The results of SEM and path analysis indicated the direct and indirect (through emotion regulation) impacts of metacognition and also indirect (through emotion regulation) impact of emotional schema on PTS symptom. Model examination presented the good fitness of the proposed theoretical model.
   Conclusions: Consistent with metacognitive model and also emotional schema model, results of this study indicated the impact of metacognition and emotional schema on post-traumatic stress symptom through emotion regulation. This finding emphasizes that both metacognitive and emotional factors are important in explanation of PTS symptom. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction
   The capacity to understand one's own actions and those of others in terms of cognitive and affective mental states (i.e., reflective functioning or mentalizing) is thought to play a critical role in both typical and atypical development. To date, however, no self-report tool is available for assessing reflective functioning ability in French-speaking samples. The first aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and validity of the reflective functioning questionnaire (RFQ) in French-speaking adolescents and adults. Secondly, we investigate whether low levels of reflective functioning were associated with non-suicidal self-injury.

   130 adolescents (66 females, Mage = 15.72, SDage = 1.74) and 253 adults (168 females, Mage = 23.10, SDage = 2.56) completed a French translation of the RFQ and a battery of self-reported questionnaires to assess a set of clinical (alexithymia; borderline traits; internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and psychological (empathy; mindfulness) variables.
   Results
   The current results showed configural invariance of the original two-factor structure of the RFQ across French-speaking adolescents and adults and satisfactory reliability and construct validity of the two subscales. Furthermore, we observed that recent episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury were associated with lower levels of reflective functioning in the adult, but not in the adolescent, sample.
   Discussion
   The present research has methodological and clinical implications in that it provides the first evidence that the RFQ can be used to reliably assess reflective functioning in French-speaking population. The study further shows that impaired ability to consider mental states that lie behind behaviors might play a role in non-suicidal self-injury, at least in adults.

AB Although caffeine is commonly consumed during pregnancy, there are few reports on the association of in utero caffeine exposure with offspring cognition or behavior during childhood. We evaluated the association of maternal serum paraxanthine, caffeine's primary metabolite, at < 20 and a parts per thousand yen26 weeks' gestation with the child's intelligence quotient (IQ) and problem behaviors at ages 4 and 7 years among 2,197 mother-child pairs. The mothers were controls from a case-control study of caffeine metabolites and spontaneous abortion that was nested within the Collaborative Perinatal Project (multiple US sites, 1959-1974). Associations of paraxanthine (adjusted for maternal age, race, education, smoking, prepregnancy weight, gestational age at blood draw, and child sex) with mean IQ were assessed by linear regression and associations with problem behaviors by logistic regression. Paraxanthine concentration at a parts per thousand yen26 weeks' gestation manifested an inverted-J-shaped association with child's IQ at age 7 years, with a peak difference (vs. undetectable) of 0.65 points at 750 A mu g/L (66th percentile) and a decrement thereafter. Paraxanthine at < 20 weeks was linearly associated with internalizing behavior at age 4 years (for a 500-A mu g/L increase, odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.5). None of the remaining 12 associations approached statistical significance. We conclude that over a range of values applicable to most pregnant women, there was no meaningful association of serum paraxanthine level with childhood IQ or problem behaviors.

AB Background: In adolescence, internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive, and withdrawn) and externalizing (e.g., aggressive, oppositional, delinquent, and hyperactive) symptoms are related with alcohol use. However, the directionality among internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and alcohol use during adolescence is equivocal. Moreover, gender differences and similarities among these behaviors are not definitive in existing literature. Objectives: This study examined longitudinal relationships between internalizing and externalizing symptoms and past-month alcohol use among adolescent boys and girls. Methods: Using longitudinal survey data from a study of community-dwelling adolescents (n = 724), we estimated cross-lagged structural equation models to test relations between internalizing and externalizing symptoms (as measured by the Youth Self Report, YSR [Achenbach, 1991]) and self-report alcohol use in the past month among adolescents. Gender differences were tested in a multiple group structural equation model. Results: Alcohol use at age 12 was a predictor of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 15 for both boys and girls. With regard to gender differences, girls demonstrated an association between internalizing symptoms and drinking at age 12, whereas boys showed a stronger association between externalizing symptoms and drinking at age 18. Conclusions/Importance: Early alcohol use is problematic for youth, and results of this study lend support to prevention programs for youth. Preventing or curbing early drinking may offset later externalizing and internalizing symptoms, as well as ongoing alcohol use, regardless of gender.

AB Although treatment engagement is considered important to achieve positive outcomes, it is still not well known why some girls in detention are more engaged in treatment than others. This is the first study to examine to what extent psychopathology and self-perceived quality of life (QoL) are related to treatment engagement. Participants were 108 detained girls (M-aga = 16.21) who completed standardized questionnaires about mental health problems and QoL, and were interviewed with a structured diagnostic interview to assess DSM-IV psychiatric disorders. One and two months after this baseline assessment, the girls reported how much they engaged in treatment. The results showed low levels of treatment engagement and no significant changes in treatment engagement over time. Overall, detained girls with internalizing disorders reported higher treatment engagement scores, while the reverse was true for girls with externalizing disorders. Regarding QoL, the girls with greater satisfaction about their physical and psychological health and about their environment reported higher treatment engagement, while the opposite was true for the domain of social relationships. Our findings emphasize the need for strength-based and motivational approaches and techniques in residential treatment programs for girls, in order to enable change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population. We explored individual and contextual factors that relate to anxiety in adolescents and young adults with ASD who also experience bullying victimization. Participants included 101 mothers of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ASD. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and anxiety in children with ASD, as well as parenting stress as a potential moderator of that relationship. Findings indicate that parenting stress moderates the association between bullying victimization and anxiety. The severity of anxiety was most strongly associated with bullying victimization when mothers reported high levels of stress. Implications for interventions that assist parents with coping and address bullying victimization are discussed. (C) 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Externalizing disorders are the most common and persistent forms of maladjustment in childhood. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to reduce externalizing symptoms in two disorders: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositive Defiant Disorder (ODD). The efficacy of CBT to improve social competence and positive parenting and reduce internalizing behaviors, parent stress and maternal depression was also explored. The database PsycInfo, PsycARTICLES, Medline and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies. Twenty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that the biggest improvement, after CBT, was in ODD symptoms (-0.879) followed by parental stress (-0.607), externalizing symptoms (-0.52), parenting skills (-0.381), social competence (-0.390) and ADHD symptoms (-0.343). CBT was also associated with improved attention (-0.378), aggressive behaviors (-0.284), internalizing symptoms (-0.272) and maternal depressive symptoms (-0.231). Overall, CBT is an effective treatment option for externalizing disorders and is also associated with reduced parental distress and maternal depressive symptoms. Multimodal treatments targeting both children and caregivers' symptoms (e.g. maternal depressive symptoms) appear important to produce sustained and generalized benefits.

AB Therapeutic alliance has been considered an important factor in child psychotherapy and is consistently associated with positive outcomes. Nevertheless, research on alliance in the context of child trauma therapy is very scarce. This study examined the relationships between child therapeutic alliance and psychopathology in an empirically supported child trauma therapy model designed to address issues related to trauma with children and their caregivers. Specifically, we examined the extent to which the child's psychopathology would predict the establishment of a positive alliance early in treatment, as well as the association between alliance and outcome. Participants were 95 children between the ages of 7 and 12 and their caregivers, who went through a community-based Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program in Canada. Caregivers filled out the CBCL prior to assessment and following treatment. Children and therapists completed an alliance measure (TASC) at three time points throughout treatment. Symptomatology and child gender emerged as important factors predicting alliance at the beginning of treatment. Girls and internalizing children developed stronger alliances early in treatment. In addition, a strong early alliance emerged as a significant predictor of improvement in internalizing symptoms at the end of treatment. Our findings indicate that symptomatology and gender influence the development of a strong alliance in trauma therapy. We suggest that clinicians should adjust therapeutic style to better engage boys and highly externalizing children in the early stages of therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined improvement in emotion regulation throughout Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and the degree to which improvement in emotion regulation predicted improvement in symptoms. Traumatized children, 7-12 years (69.9% female), received TF-CBT. Data from 4 time periods were used: pre-assessment (n = 107), pre-treatment (n = 78), post-treatment (n = 58), and 6-month follow-up (n = 44). Questionnaires measured emotion regulation in the form of inhibition and dysregulation (Children's Emotion Management Scales) and lability/negativity and emotion regulation skill (Emotion Regulation Checklist), as well as child-reported (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children) and parent-reported (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children) posttraumatic stress, and internalizing and externalizing problems (Child Behaviuor Checklist). To the extent that children's dysregulation and lability/negativity improved, their parents reported fewer symptoms following therapy. Improvements in inhibition best predicted improvements in child-reported posttraumatic stress (PTS) during clinical services, but change in dysregulation and lability/negativity best predicted improvement in child-reported PTS symptoms at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, statistically significant improvements of small effect size were found following therapy, for inhibition, dysregulation, and lability/negativity, but not emotion regulation skill. These findings suggest that emotion regulation is a worthy target of intervention and that improvements in emotion regulation can be made. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Objectives:
   Risk for substance use disorders is widely studied, but relatively less is known about risk of early substance use initiation. Childhood aggression has been identified as predictive of early substance use initiation, although it typically is measured as a heterogenous mix of behaviors that may underestimate the magnitude of this relationship. The purpose of this study was to extend prior research by investigating the relationship of distinct aggressive behaviors with early substance use initiation among youths with family histories of substance use disorders.
   Methods:
   Children (ages 10 to 12 years) with a family history of substance use disorder were tested on a variety of potential risk factors and monitored for substance use initiation prospectively at 6-month intervals. By age 14, 41 youth initiated substance use and 78 had not. Comparisons were made examining predictive relationships between specific aggressive behaviors, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and social adjustment with early initiation of substance use (extending the approach of Ernst and colleagues).
   Results:
   Children who had assaulted people and had school discipline problems due to aggressive behavior were at increased odds of early substance use initiation. Even in the context of family history of substance use disorder, individual differences in childhood aggression confer increased risk for early substance use initiation.
   Discussion:
   Even in the context of family history of substance use disorder, individual differences in childhood aggression and thought problems confer increased risk for early substance use initiation.

AB The process of diagnosis and treatment planning for adolescents requires clinicians to integrate information about various domains of functioning especially: clinical signs and symptoms, social cognition and family functioning. In the current study we applied an integrative analytic approach to mirror case conceptualization by clinicians. Our analyses were performed on the data gathered from the 328 inpatient adolescents. We used a broad range of measures of social-cognitive constructs, family functioning and parent-and self-reported psychopathology. Using a combination of variable-based (PCA) and person-centered (LCA) analyses we determined class membership of adolescents based on variation in social cognition, psychopathology, and family functioning. We identified five latent classes: two internalizing groups, two externalizing groups and a severe psychopathology group. Patterns of general hyperfunctioning (characterized by hypermentalizing and hypervigilance to emotional stimuli) and hypofunctioning (manifested in under-mentalizing and under-reactivity to emotional stimuli), can be observed in these groups.

AB The present study examined the longitudinal relations between body mass index (BMI) and internalizing symptoms among youth ages 10-17. Adolescents were selected from Statistics Canada's National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Latent growth curve modeling was used to investigate: 1) whether initial level (at age 10) or change in BMI were associated with changes in internalizing symptoms; and, 2) whether initial level or change in internalizing symptoms were associated with changes in BMI across adolescence. Associations between trajectories differed for boys and girls. Boys who started out with higher BMI experienced more internalizing symptoms across early- to mid-adolescence, but not more depressive symptoms at ages 16 and 17. For girls, there was a bidirectional relation between BMI and internalizing symptoms which persisted into later adolescence. Results suggest the bidirectional relation between BMI and internalizing symptoms is more salient for girls than for boys. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Although empathetic distress (i.e., taking on a friend's emotional distress as one's own) has been examined as a "cost of caring" especially common among girls, relations with adjustment remain untested. The current study tested associations of empathetic distress with friendship quality, depression, and anxiety. Adolescents (N = 300, ages 12-18) reported on their perceived experience of empathetic distress following a conversation with a friend about problems. The study also considered youths' emotional engagement in friends' positive life events, referred to as empathetic joy. Results indicated that girls reported greater empathetic distress and empathetic joy compared with boys. Findings also suggest that although empathetic distress may have positive implications for youths' friendship adjustment, this may come at the expense of emotional well-being. In contrast, empathetic joy was associated with greater positive friendship quality and fewer internalizing symptoms. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB This longitudinal study aimed to examine the association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and academic motivation by gender, and whether positive school and family factors would be associated with academic motivation, in spite of the presence of such symptoms. Study participants were predominantly economically disadvantaged youths aged 13-15 years in a Northeastern US urban public school system. The Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) served as the basis for a survey undertaken in 2003 and 2004 with information being used from students who participated at both time points (N = 643). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms were negatively associated with academic motivation, while anxiety was positively related to academic motivation in both genders. Teacher support, school attachment and parental control were positively related to academic motivation even in the presence of internalizing problems. The negative association of depressive symptoms with academic motivation may be potentially decreased by attachment to school. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB This study examines the associations of child temperament with overweight/obesity and breakfast habits. Participants were 17,409 five-year-olds whose mothers partake in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), and completed a questionnaire at the child's 5th birthday. Temperament was assessed as externalizing, internalizing and sociable temperament. Breakfast habits differentiated between every day, 4 to 6 times a week, and 0 to 3 times a week. The child's weight status was determined by Body Mass Index-percentiles and categorized as normal weight versus overweight/obese. Children with externalizing temperament had higher odds of being overweight and higher odds of not eating breakfast daily. Children high in internalizing temperament had higher odds of not eating breakfast daily, but not of being overweight. Children with average scores of sociability were more prone to being overweight but had normal breakfast habits. All results were adjusted for key confounders. That five-year-olds high in externalizing temperament had a higher risk to be overweight adds important information to the literature. The association of externalizing temperament with child breakfast habits so early in life is intriguing, as parents mostly control eating patterns in children that young. Mechanisms mediating this association should be explored.

AB The transition to motherhood is widely viewed as a significant life stage for women (Bailey, 1999; Byrne, 2006; McMahon, 1995). However, this process has not been explored in transracially adopted women who, in addition to making sense of how their adoption story impacts their self-concept as mothers, must also negotiate issues related to ethnicity, race, and ethnic and racial identities that emerge in relation to mothering a child of color. Interviews with 15 Korean American women who were adopted as children by White European American families and who were mothers or intended to be mothers to a multiracial (Asian and White) child were analyzed to develop a grounded theory model of the effects of becoming a mother on the development of ethnic and racial identities. Two interactive processes emerged: Reflecting with Intention and Reframing and Taking Action, which captured connections between the women's own childhood development and their children's imagined future development in relation to ethnicity and race. Reflecting with Intention described how the mothers' sense of responsibility and anticipation of their child's needs catalyzed reflection upon their own developmental experiences and an associated intention and motivation to foster more positive experiences for their children. This led to the second cycle of Reframing and Taking Action, where the mothers actively sought to increase their cultural knowledge, reframed their earlier experiences in relation to the benefits for their children, worked more actively to resist internalizing racism, and engaged more frequently in ethnic and racial affinity-based experiences.

AB Sibling relationships are a unique and powerful context for children's development, characterized by strong positive features, such as warmth and intimacy, as well as negative qualities like intense, potentially destructive conflict. For these reasons, sibling interactions may be both a risk and a protective factor for the development and maintenance of emotional and behavioral dysfunction. We review evidence indicating that sibling interactions are linked to internalizing and externalizing symptoms and identify possible mechanisms for these associations. Sibling conflict contributes uniquely to symptomatology and may be particularly problematic when accompanied by lack of warmth, which is generally associated with decreased internalizing and externalizing problems. On the other hand, greater warmth can be associated with heightened externalizing symptoms for later-born children who may model the behavior of older siblings. Although it will be important to monitor for increased sibling collusion, several intervention studies demonstrate that it is possible to reduce conflict and increase warmth between brothers and sisters, and that improving sibling interactions can teach children social-cognitive skills that are beneficial in other relationships (e.g., friendships). Developing brief assessment tools differentiating normative from pathogenic sibling conflict would assist clinical decision making. Future intervention work could provide a more stringent test of the hypothesis that strengthening sibling relationships improves children's socio-emotional adjustment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Data on students' perceptions of teacher social support, academic functioning, and social-emotional functioning were collected from a sample of 796 7th and 8th grade middle school students using the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS; Malecki, Demaray, & Elliott, 2000), Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) and school records, and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Second Edition, Adolescent Version, (BASC-2 SRP-A; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004). The purpose of the current study was to examine possible gender differences in perceptions of the frequency and importance of different types of teacher support and the related academic and social-emotional outcomes. Girls rated Emotional and Appraisal Support as more important than did boys. Teacher Emotional Support was significantly and positively related to grade point average (GPA) for boys and girls. For girls only, Emotional and Informational Support were significantly related to ITBS Reading scores, and Emotional, Informational, and Instrumental Support were significantly related to ITBS Math scores. Regarding social-emotional variables, Emotional Support was significantly and negatively related to School Problems, Internalizing Problems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, and overall Emotional Symptoms and positively related to Personal Adjustment for both boys and girls. Furthermore, Emotional Support from teachers was more strongly related to Inattention/Hyperactivity for girls than boys. These results emphasize the importance of providing teacher social support, especially emotional support, to students in early adolescence and recognizing gender differences in the function of specific types of teacher support.

AB The goal of this study was to identify meaningful groups of sixth graders with common characteristics based on teacher ratings of assets and maladaptive behaviors, describe dropout rates for each group, and examine the validity of these groups using students' self-reports. The sample consisted of racially diverse students (n = 675) attending sixth grade in public schools in Northeast Georgia. The majority of the sample was randomly selected; a smaller group was identified by teachers as high risk for aggression. Based on teacher ratings of externalizing behaviors, internalizing problems, academic skills, leadership, and social assets, latent profile analysis yielded 7 classes that can be displayed along a continuum: Well-Adapted, Average, Average-Social Skills Deficit, Internalizing, Externalizing, Disruptive Behavior with School Problems, and Severe Problems. Dropout rate was lowest for the Well-adapted class (4%) and highest for the Severe Problems class (58%). However, students in the Average-Social Skills Deficit class did not follow the continuum, with a large proportion of students who abandoned high school (29%). The proportion of students identified by teachers as high in aggression consistently increased across the continuum from none in the Well-Adapted class to 84% in the Severe Problems class. Students' self-reports were generally consistent with the latent profile classes. Students in the Well-Adapted class reported low aggression, drug use, and delinquency, and high life satisfaction; self-reports went in the opposite direction for the Disruptive Behaviors with School Problems class. Results highlight the importance of early interventions to improve academic performance, reduce externalizing behaviors, and enhance social assets.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess whether observed emotional frequency (the proportion of instances an emotion was observed) and intensity (the strength of an emotion when it was observed) uniquely predicted kindergartners' (N = 301) internalizing and externalizing problems. Analyses were tested in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework with data from multireporters (reports of problem behaviors from teachers and parents) and naturalistic observations of emotion in the fall semester. For observed positive emotion, both frequency and intensity negatively predicted parent-or teacher-reported internalizing symptoms. Anger frequency positively predicted parent-and teacher-reported externalizing symptoms, whereas anger intensity positively predicted parent-and teacher-reported externalizing and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. The findings support the importance of examining both aspects of emotion when predicting maladjustment.

AB Objective: This study focused on whether a brief family-based intervention for toddlers, the Family Check-Up (FCU), designed to address parent management skills and prevent early conduct problems, would have collateral effects on maternal depressive symptoms and subsequent child emotional problems. Method: Parents with toddlers were recruited from the Women, Infants, and Children Nutritional Supplement Program based on the presence of socioeconomic, family, and child risk (N = 731). Families were randomly assigned to the FCU intervention or control group with yearly assessments beginning at child age 2. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at child ages 2 and 3. Child internalizing problems were collected from primary caregivers, alternative caregivers, and teachers using the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 7.5 and 8.5. Results: Structural equation models revealed that mothers in families randomly assigned to the FCU showed lower levels of depressive symptoms at child age 3, which in turn were related to lower levels of child depressed/withdrawal symptoms as reported by primary caregivers, alternative caregivers, and teacher at ages 7.5-8.5. Conclusions: Findings suggest that a brief, preventive intervention improving maternal depressive symptoms can have enduring effects on child emotional problems that are generalizable across contexts. As there is a growing emphasis for the use of evidence-based and cost-efficient interventions that can be delivered in multiple delivery settings serving low-income families and their children, clinicians and researchers welcome evidence that interventions can promote change in multiple problem areas. The FCU appears to hold such promise.

AB We investigated whether synchrony at a physiological level (i.e., real-time correspondence of biological indices between two individuals) related to observed levels of dyadic attunement (i.e., levels of connectedness, joint attention, and reciprocity), and whether these measures could distinguish between mother-child dyads with and without clinical levels of externalizing behavioral problems. Eighty-three clinical and 35 nonclinical dyads (7-12 years-old) discussed a contentious topic preceded and followed by a positive topic while their heart rates were recorded. Changes in dyadic attunement from the last discussion relative to the first were taken as an index of how well dyads 'repaired' their relationship. Results showed that clinical dyads had lower levels of dyadic attunement across all discussions compared to nonclinical dyads. Evidence that physiological synchrony could distinguish clinical from nonclinical dyads, however, was merely suggestive. Physiological synchrony was sensitive to the emotional context of the discussions as more dyads demonstrated physiological synchrony in the last compared to the first discussion. Moreover, dyads who demonstrated physiological synchrony also showed higher levels of repair. The outcomes of this study suggest that physiological synchrony between mothers and their children is sensitive to emotional context during interactions, and particularly during periods of repair when dyads more actively reconnect with each other after a negative interaction.

AB This study explored the relation between adolescent reports of parental religious socialization (i.e., cultural socialization, promotion of mistrust, and pluralism) and their religious out-group evaluations, externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Crosssectional data were obtained from 730 12- to 15-year old Belgian adolescents through questionnaires. Results from multilevel and ordinary linear regression analyses indicated that pluralism was associated with higher religious out-group evaluations whereas promotion of mistrust was associated with lower religious out-group evaluations and higher externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Cultural socialization interacted with the importance adolescents give to religion to influence youth externalizing behaviors. Despite its limitations, this study presents a complex picture of the association between religious socialization practices and adolescent outcomes and offers an alternative pathway to understand parental religious socialization.

AB Previous studies have examined sex differences in physiological responding, including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity in response to changing stimulus conditions involving situation specific or gender related cues, in children and adolescents. The present study examined whether RSA reactivity moderates the relation between aggression and internalizing symptoms and whether there are sex differences in this effect. Participants were 82 adolescents (M age = 12.1 years; 44 girls) from the general middle-school population. Peer nominations assessed aggression and internalizing symptoms, and RSA reactivity (defined as change in RSA from baseline to task) was recorded while participants anticipated and responded to an 85 dB signaled white-noise burst. For girls, internalizing symptoms were associated with aggression only if girls showed low RSA reactivity from baseline to task; there was no effect for boys. This association was absent when girls showed high RSA reactivity. Thus, child sex appears to influence not only levels of physiological responding but also relations of physiological responding to comorbidity of adjustment problems.

AB The present study examined the link between problematic gambling and gambling related cognitions (GRCs) in a large sample of adolescents with (N = 266) and without (N = 1,738) special education needs (SEN) between the ages of 14 and 18 years attending several high schools in eastern central Ontario. The adolescents with SENs were identified as having various learning disorders and/or internalizing and externalizing problems [e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]. All adolescents completed a self-report questionnaire package that included the GRC Scale (GRCS; Raylu and Oei in Addiction 99:757-769, 2004), as well as measures of problem gambling, negative affect, and ADHD symptomatology. Results showed that adolescents with SEN hold more erroneous beliefs about gambling and had a higher risk of developing problematic patterns of gambling behaviour than their typically developing peers. Moreover, the GRCS subscales were found to be strong predictors of problem gambling among adolescents both with and without SEN, accounting for a substantial amount of the variance even when controlling for the effects of age, gender, ADHD, and negative affect. It is suggested that intervention and prevention programs aimed at adolescent gambling need to give particular attention to those with SEN.

AB Children with ADHD often demonstrate a pattern of emotional lability characterized by sudden and intense shifts in affect. Emotional lability has been linked to emotional and behavioral problems in children with and without ADHD, but few studies have examined emotional lability over time. This study examined the effects of emotional lability over time on the behavioral and emotional difficulties of children with and without ADHD using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology. One hundred and two children aged 8-12 years (56 with ADHD and 46 without ADHD) and their parents completed baseline measures of the children's behavioral and emotional difficulties. Parents then completed a 28-day 3-times daily EMA assessment protocol to rate their child's emotional lability. Results suggested that emotional lability was associated with internalizing and/or externalizing diagnoses independent of ADHD diagnostic status, but was not directly associated with ADHD. Hierarchical regression analyses supported ADHD diagnostic status as a moderator of the association of greater EMA-derived emotional lability with children's behavioral difficulties, such that greater emotional lability was associated with greater behavioral difficulties among children with ADHD but not among children without ADHD. Results indicated that greater emotional lability was directly linked with greater emotional difficulties and that this relation was not moderated by ADHD diagnostic status. Overall, this study suggested that emotional lability is related to emotional difficulties independent of ADHD, but is differentially related to behavioral difficulties among children with and without ADHD.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether the extent of improvement in self-regulation achieved between ages 4 and 6 years is associated with the level of behavioral problems later in childhood. Participants were 4-year-old children (n = 510) attending preschools in South Australia. Children's level of self-regulation was assessed using the parent-completed Devereux Early Childhood Assessment when children were aged 4, 5, and 6. Children's level of behavioral problems was assessed using total, internalizing, and externalizing scores on parent-and teacher-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) when children were 6 years old. Random effects regression was used to describe the changes to children's self-regulation between 4 and 6 years. Linear regression models were then used to determine the strength of the association between the extent of self-regulation improvement and level of behavioral problems. Greater improvement in self-regulation, adjusted for family characteristics and baseline self-regulation scores, was associated with lower levels of parent-(B = -3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-4.49, -2.65]) and teacher-rated SDQ total difficulties scores at 6 years (B = -2.42, 95% CI [-3.50, -1.34]). These effects remained after adjustment for level of parent-rated behavioral problems at 4 years. Similar effects were found for internalizing and externalizing scores at age 6 years. The results highlight the importance of improvements in self-regulation from 4-6 years for childhood behavioral problems during the early school years. Children with lower levels of improvement in self-regulation early in life are at risk for higher levels of behavioral problems both at home and at school.

AB In this study, we assessed the stability over time of child, parent, and teacher reports of school climate using one widely used assessment that provides forms for child, parents, and teachers: the School Development Program-School Climate Surveys. To assess whether measures of school climate from multiple informants differentially predict child outcomes, we examined concurrent and predictive associations of each of these sources of data with children's peer victimization (child report) and internalizing and externalizing problems (parent and teacher reports). Participants included 1237 elementary school children and their parents (n = 1082), and teachers (n = 964). Data were collected in the fall and spring across two academic years (4 waves of data). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the sub-dimensions for each informant version of the scales adequately fit a single factor model that was invariant over time and for child sex. Differences in informant source were important in predicting child outcomes. Implications for targets for improving school climate are discussed.

AB A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

AB Objective: The psychometric properties of the Motor Behavior Checklist (MBC) were examined. Method: A normative database of primary students (N = 841), rated by their physical educators in school settings, were used to investigate the construct validity of the MBC, the internal consistency, the reproducibility, and the interrater agreement. Results: Psychometric results supported the model. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a second-order model with two (Externalizing and Internalizing) broadband domains and seven problems scales: Lack of Attention (10 items), Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (14 items), Rules Breaking (7 items), Low Energy (4 items), Stereotyped Behaviors (2 items), Lack of Social Interaction (10 items), and Lack of Self-Regulation (12 items). Conclusion: Although MBC for children is not a diagnostic tool itself, it can provide valid complementary information on attentional, emotional, and developmental problems in children when used by physical educators in school settings.

AB The prevalence of both mental and physical health concerns among children in foster care is elevated compared to the general population; however, less is known about the overlap between the behavioral/mental health needs of children in foster care with significant medical issues. The purpose of this study was to examine the mental/behavioral health needs and adaptive behavior of children in medical foster care (MFC), a unique group of children in foster care with medically fragile conditions. Two sequential studies were conducted. In the first study, focus groups were conducted with MFC parents (n = 10), MFC nurses and social workers (n = 8), and foster care case managers (n = 9). The themes that emerged from the focus groups indicated externalizing behaviors and feeding issues were common concerns and there were a number of challenges for MFC parents to receive timely services to address mental health needs. In a follow-up study, 36 MFC parents were surveyed using the Child Behavior Checklist, the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment, the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, and the Parenting Stress Index. Results indicated that on average parents perceived children's externalizing, internalizing, and feeding behaviors to fall within typical limits; however, a significant portion of the parents rated their child's behavior in the clinical range. Parents indicated significantly below average adaptive behavior. On average, parents did not report elevated stress levels. Findings from this study suggest that mental health needs among the MFC population are similar to the general foster care population; however, there is a lot of variability in this group and individualized assessment is needed.

AB Parenting behaviors are associated with children's internalizing symptoms, however, it is not often examined which factors could possibly influence this relationship. The goals of this study were twofold. One goal was to examine whether the association between parenting and children's internalizing symptoms would increase if parenting behaviors were assessed behaviorally and in a context where the child displayed specific anxious behaviors. Another goal was to examine whether this relationship was influenced by the age and gender of the child, and by possible parenting differences between mothers and fathers. These questions were examined in a sample of 211 children aged 4-12 years; 140 community children and 71 clinically referred anxious children. Parents completed questionnaires regarding children's internalizing symptoms and parenting behaviors (positive reinforcement, punishment, force, reinforcement of dependency, and modeling/reassurance). In line with expectations, more punishment and less modeling/reassurance by parents were related to more internalizing symptoms in children. Child gender, child age, parent gender and clinical anxiety status were not found to influence the relationship between parenting and children's internalizing symptoms. Our results suggest that paternal parenting is as important as maternal parenting with respect to children's internalizing symptoms, and therefore, fathers could be included in child treatment as well.

AB A number of studies of marital conflict have examined both parent- and child-reports of marital conflict and child outcomes, but additional research is needed to provide evidence for potential mechanisms of action explaining the association between marital conflict and child internalizing and externalizing outcomes. In the present study (N = 330 2-parent/child triads), we show that the connectedness of the parent-child relationship (as reported by parents, but not children) significantly mediated the effect of marital conflict on children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Our findings suggest that children's perceptions are important when trying to understand the impact of marital conflict, but our results suggest that parent reports provide important, incremental insight and should not be overlooked.

AB This study examined Chinese American immigrant couples' marriage conflict, and the relations among socioeconomic incorporation, marital conflict, and their school-age children's behavior problems. A total of 230 parents (81 % mothers, 19 % fathers) as the participating parent provided demographic and background information, rated their own marital conflict and their children's behavioral problems. Findings indicated that: (a) the score of Chinese American immigrant couples' marital conflict was low, child exposure to conflict was much lower than frequency of marital conflict; (b) marital conflict mediated the relation between socioeconomic incorporation and children's behavioral problems. We found that frequency of marital conflict partially mediated the relationship between maternal education level and children's internalizing problems; it also totally mediated the relationship between maternal education level and children's externalizing problems; child exposure to conflict totally mediated the relationship between family estimated per capita income and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. The results promote understanding of family processes that influence the relationships between family socioeconomic incorporation, marital conflict, and children's behavioral problems among Chinese American immigrant families.

AB Disagreement between parents and adolescents on the internalizing problems of adolescents poses a threat to diagnoses based on both parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing problems. In this article, we analyze ethnic differences in parent-adolescent agreement on internalizing disorders as reported in a diagnostic interview. A two-phase study design was used. In the first phase, a large sample of adolescents was screened for internalizing disorders using the Youth Self-Report. In the second phase, adolescents from each ethnic group (native Dutch, Surinamese Dutch, Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch) were selected, with half scoring in the borderline/clinical range and half in the normal range. Diagnostic interviews were subsequently conducted with 348 parents and adolescents. Moroccan Dutch parents reported fewer internalizing disorders compared with native Dutch parents. Combining parent and adolescent reports therefore resulted in a lower amount of internalizing disorders among Moroccan Dutch adolescents. Results furthermore showed that (parent- and adolescent-reported) internalizing diagnoses were related to mental health service use in all ethnic groups. Professionals in the field should be sensitive to possible discrepancies between parents and adolescents when diagnosing adolescents' internalizing disorders, in particular, because underreports of internalizing disorders among parents might contribute to lower levels of mental health service use among adolescents belonging to certain ethnic groups.

AB Positive Action is a school-based program that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., school engagement, academic achievement). Although a number of studies have shown that Positive Action successfully achieves these goals, few studies have evaluated the program's effectiveness in rural schools. Given that rural youth are at an increased risk for risky behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use), this is a critical gap in the existing Positive Action research base. The current study assesses the impact of Positive Action on change rates of self-esteem, school hassles, aggression, and internalizing symptoms in a group (N = 1246, 52 % female) of ethnically/racially diverse (27 % White, 23 % African American, 12 % mixed race/other, 8 % Latino, 30 % as American Indian) middle school youth (age range 9-20) located in two violent, low-income rural counties in North Carolina. One county engaged in Positive Action over the 3-year study window while the other county did not. Following multiple imputation and propensity score analysis, 4 two-level hierarchical linear models were run using each of the outcome measures as dependent variables. The results indicate that the program generates statistically significant beneficial effects for youth from the intervention county on self-esteem scores and school hassles scores. Although the program generates beneficial effects for intervention youth on the change in aggression scores, the finding is not statistically significant. The finding on the change in internalizing scores shows a non-significant detrimental effect: the youth from the comparison county have lower internalizing scores than those from the intervention county. Implications are discussed.

AB Sexual minorities are more likely than heterosexuals to engage in unhealthy eating behaviors.
   The purpose of this study is to examine sexual minority stressors and internalizing symptoms as predictors of unhealthy eating behaviors among sexual minority youths.
   We used longitudinal data from 1461 sexual minority youths in the Growing Up Today Study, across ages 14-28 years. We hypothesized that sexual minority stressors would predict unhealthy eating behaviors, in part due to internalizing symptoms. Linear regression models fit via generalized estimating equations were stratified by gender and sexual orientation.
   Significant positive and inverse associations between stressors and eating behaviors were detected among females and males, with more significant associations among females. Associations were attenuated by up to 71 % for females and 12 % for males when internalizing symptoms were added to the models.
   Sexual minority stressors predicted unhealthy eating behaviors overall and more so for some sexual orientation and gender groups; associations were partially explained by internalizing symptoms. The conceptual model appears to best describe the experiences of bisexual females. Findings have clinical implications for adolescent health.

AB Objective To measure the benefits to household caregivers of a psychotherapeutic intervention for adolescents and young adults living in a war-affected area.
   Methods Between July 2012 and July 2013, we carried out a randomized controlled trial of the Youth Readiness Intervention a cognitive behavioural intervention for war-affected young people who exhibit depressive and anxiety symptoms and conduct problems in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Overall, 436 participants aged 15-24 years were randomized to receive the intervention (n = 222) or care as usual (n = 214). Household caregivers for the participants in the intervention arm (n = 101) or control arm (n = 103) were interviewed during a baseline survey and again, if available (n = 155), 12 weeks later in a follow-up survey. We used a burden assessment scale to evaluate the burden of care placed on caregivers in terms of emotional distress and functional impairment. The caregivers' mental health - i.e. internalizing, externalizing and prosocial behaviour - was evaluated using the Oxford Measure of Psychosocial Adjustment. Difference-in-differences multiple regression analyses were used, within an intention-to-treat framework, to estimate the treatment effects.
   Findings Compared with the caregivers of participants of the control group, the caregivers of participants of the intervention group reported greater reductions in emotional distress (scale difference: 0.252; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.026-0.4782) and greater improvements in prosocial behaviour (scale difference: 0.249; 95% CI: 0.012-0.486) between the two surveys.
   Conclusion A psychotherapeutic intervention for war-affected young people can improve the mental health of their caregivers.

AB This study examined the relationship between community adversity and childhood internalizing and externalizing problems, and whether this relationship is moderated by service utilization and race. The study involved 3225 children ages 2-17, and their caregivers, who participated in the second cohort of the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Bivariate correlation and regression analysis indicate that childhood internalizing problems were correlated with sex and community adversity. Children externalizing problems were correlated with race, sex, service utilization, and community adversity. Childhood internalizing and externalizing problems were highly correlated. Regression analysis reveals a strong relationship between community adversity and childhood externalizing problems. Service utilization was found to significantly and positively moderate the relationship between community adversity and externalizing problems. While a strong correlation between race and childhood externalizing problems exist, race did not moderate the relationship between community adversity and externalizing problems. Internalizing problems were excluded from the regression analysis since it did not correlate with any of the moderator variables. The findings are discussed and the study limitations are examined. Implications for child welfare practice, policy, and research are highlighted.

AB This study examined multiple determinants of discrepancies between mother and child reports of problem behavior. In 5,414 6-year-olds, child problem behavior was assessed by self-report using the Berkeley Puppet Interview and by maternal report using the Child Behavior Checklist. Patterns in mother-child reports were modeled using latent profile analysis. Four profiles, differing in problem level, and the direction and magnitude of mother-child discrepancies, were identified: one profile representing agreement (46 %), another representing slight discrepancies (30 %), and two representing higher problem levels and more discrepancies. In the latter two profiles either children (11 %) or mothers (13 %) reported more problems. Compared to the first profile, the second was predominantly characterized by a positive family environment, the third by child cognitive difficulties, and the fourth by harsh discipline and poor family functioning. Knowledge about specific child/family characteristics that contribute to mother-child discrepancies can help to interpret informants' reports and to make diagnostic decisions.

AB Adolescence is a phase of the lifespan associated with widespread changes in emotional behavior thought to reflect both changing environments and stressors, and psychological and neurobiological development. However, emotions themselves are complex phenomena that are composed of multiple subprocesses. In this paper, we argue that examining emotional development from a process-level perspective facilitates important insights into the mechanisms that underlie adolescents' shifting emotions and intensified risk for psychopathology. Contrasting the developmental progressions for the antecedents to emotion, physiological reactivity to emotion, emotional regulation capacity, and motivation to experience particular affective states reveals complex trajectories that intersect in a unique way during adolescence. We consider the implications of these intersecting trajectories for negative outcomes such as psychopathology, as well as positive outcomes for adolescent social bonds.

The children completed Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (PHSCS), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). Following 4-8 weeks of MPH treatment, the parents completed T-DSM-IV-S and the clinician completed Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I). This study included 54 children (18 girls, 36 boys; mean age 9.32 +/- 0.21 years old). The sample was divided in "good responders" (GR) and "poor responders" (PR) regarding the response criteria defined by authors.
   Results: The PR group had significantly higher rates of anxiety disorders, higher internalizing scores and lower PHSCS scores compared to GR. Comorbid anxiety disorders, elimination disorders and negative self-concept were found to predict poor MPH response by multiple regression analysis.
   Conclusions: The results point to the need for additional interventions in the presence of comorbid anxiety, incontinence or poor self-concept in children with ADHD.

AB Psychological symptoms related with violence and its relationship with internalizing and externalizing problems among 10th grade students in Istanbul
   Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of gender, self-destructive behavior (self-harming behaviors-[SHB] and suicidal ideation/attempts-[SI/A]), lifetime substance use (tobacco, alcohol and any drug) and psychological variables (depression, anxiety, anger and impulsivity) with having psychological symptoms after experiencing or witnessing any violence, serious assault or battery event among 10th grade students in Istanbul/Turkey.
   Methods: Online self-report survey was conducted based on 4957 10th grade students selected according to multi-stage sampling in 45 schools from 15 districts of Istanbul.
   Results: Risks of assault from a peer, physical fight within last year, bearing arms, disciplinary punishment and problems with the law were higher in the group with psychological symptoms (GPS). Together with SHB and SI/A, lifetime tobacco and any drug use, male gender, depression, anxiety, and anger predicted the GPS.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that with a single and simple question, high risk group of GPS can be determined, followed and offered proper help for both internalizing problems and externalizing behaviors, whether or not they are consequences of the victimization.

   SCALE; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; ETIOLOGY; CHILDREN
AB Objective: Premonitory sensations or urges (PUs) are described as characteristic sensory phenomena preceding tics, which are often described as unpleasant. They occur in 90% of patients affected by Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS). They may be localized (around the area of tic) or generalized (covering a wide area of the body). The PUs can be measured by the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS). In this study we translated the PUTS scale into Italian and then assessed children and adolescents/young people (CYP) with GTS using the scale. Methods: GTS patients were assessed at the initial interview and after 7 years to evaluate the PUs, and the correlations of the PUTS scores with tic severity, severity of comorbid disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]), and a variety of coexisting psychopathologies. Results: A total of 95 patients were studied. We successfully translated the PUTS into Italian, and our results indicated that our translated version had good psychometric properties. Results demonstrated that the CYP had PUs at both interviews, but that older CYP were more consistent in reporting PUs than younger CYP (i.e., PUTS scores increased with age). We found no correlations between PUTS score and tic severity at either interview. We found a statistical significant correlation between PUTS score and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) at both interviews; Moreover both the PUTS and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) scores increased significantly, whereas the Yale Global Tic Severity Rating Scale (YGTSS) score decreased significantly. We found no relationships between PUTS scores and anxiety, depression, ADHD, and externalizing/internalizing behavioral scores. Conclusions: Our results suggest the the Italian translation of the PUTS has good psychometric properties. Although both younger (<10 years of age) and older CYP (10 years of age) reported PUs, the scores at the initial interview were statistically significantly lower than at follow-up. Moreover, in CYP >10 years of age, the PUs correlated with obsessions and compulsions (CY-BOCS scores).

AB Background: Stress biomarkers of the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) can be measured via alpha-amylase (AA) and cortisol and cortisone in saliva. Objectives were to determine 1) the response patterns of cortisol, cortisone, and AA under both circadian conditions and the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C), 2) which reactivity index is most suitable to differentiate internalizing or externalizing disorders from controls, and to explore 3) the interaction between AA and cortisol in the presence of internalizing or externalizing disorders.
   Methods: Saliva samples (n = 2893) from children with internalizing (n = 55) or externalizing disorders (n = 33) and healthy children (n = 81) were analyzed for cortisol, cortisone, and AA under circadian conditions and TSST-C.
   Results: Circadian rhythm of three biomarkers did not differ between diagnostic groups. Age and gender were significant predictors for cortisol and awakening time influenced all three biomarkers significantly. TSST-C responses appeared sequentially in the order of AA, cortisol, and cortisone. Trajectories of cortisol and cortisone responses, not in AA, were significantly lower in children with internalizing or externalizing disorders than in healthy children. Cortisol percentage increase appeared to be the most suitable reactivity index to detect the difference between the diagnostic groups. Internalizing disorders had a negative association between AA decrease and cortisol increase (beta =.199, p <.05, R-2 =.304). Externalizing disorders had a positive association between AA baseline and cortisol increase (beta =.229, p <.05, R-2 =.304).
   Conclusion: An altered HPA-axis response during stress might result from chronic allostatic load in internalizing disorders and underaroused stress response system in externalizing disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Compared to externalizing problem behavior, European and American research has indicated the danger of developing internalizing symptoms, especially in migrant children and adolescents. However, further specific risk factors in relation to internalizing disorders, for example gender aspects, were often found.
   Subjects and methods The present study investigates a child and adolescent psychiatric health care population (N=6,269) from 2005 to 2011 in Germany. Around 50% were diagnosed with internalizing disorders (N=3,706). Logistic regressions indicated whether migration background, such as ethnicities, or contextual factors could predict internalizing disorders.
   Results Ethnicity or migration background had only a minor influence on internalizing disorders, with the exception of those of Asian origin. Generally, the influence of other environments was much stronger than migrant's characteristics such as gender, living in a single-parent family setting, medium educational background of parents, average or above average intelligence level of children, psychopathological problems of family members, abnormal parenting practice or acute burden living conditions. Interactions between migration background and risk factors were only visible in abnormal parenting practice or abnormal environments.
   Conclusions Possibly, migrant children are currently not sufficiently supplied with psychiatric health services. Crosscultural as well as familial aspects should increasingly be considered in psychiatric work with children showing internalizing symptoms.

AB From the family system approach, families are collections of individuals organized into an integrative system, in which choices and behaviors of members are interdependent and mutually reinforced. However, the fact that prior family studies, especially in Chinese context, derived their findings from a single party may cause problems of method variance and response biases. Against this background, the current study adopted the actor-partner interdependence model approach (APIM) to investigate respective effects of family socialization in the form of parenting and family processes on child outcomes in terms of internalizing and externalizing symptoms concurrently from a sample of Chinese parent-child dyads. Results generally supported effects of family socialization on child outcomes, but varying in magnitudes depending on an actor effect or a partner one to be counted, and which family socialization factor being emphasized, as well as the internalizing or the externalizing symptoms as the outcome, all of which were verified by tests of critical ratio differences and model comparisons for parameters invariance. Implications, future research directions and limitations of the study are briefly discussed.

AB To examine the relationship between Chinese students' three-domain competences (academic, personal-social, career competence) and their problems in key schools and regular schools from East, Central, and West China, we performed SEM with academic/personal-social/career competences, internalizing problems (including depression and anxiety) and externalizing problems in 18,164 Grade 10-12 students. The MANOVA revealed there were significant differences in regions and types of schools on the six study variables. Additionally, the SEM results demonstrated that students' academic and personal-social competence negatively predicted their internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas career competence negatively predicted internalizing problems but positively predicted externalizing problems. Moreover, the model comparisons indicated personal-social competence was the strongest predictor of internalizing problems, and academic competence was the strongest predictor of externalizing problems. Therefore, our findings provide effective theoretical support for intervention models that are aimed the reduction of problems by enhancing competences.

AB This study investigated the relationship between acculturation and psychological problems in Turkish and Moroccan young adults living in the Netherlands. A sample of 131 healthy young adults aged between 18 and 24 years old, with a Turkish or Moroccan background was recruited using snowball sampling. Data on acculturation, internalizing and externalizing problems, beliefs about psychological problems, attributions of psychological problems and barriers to care were collected and analyzed using Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression. Three acculturation classes were identified in moderately to highly educated, healthy Turkish or Moroccan young adults: integration, separation and diffusion. None of the participants in the sample were marginalized or assimilated. Young adults reporting diffuse acculturation reported more internalizing and externalizing problems than those who were integrated or separated. Separated young adults reported experiencing more practical barriers to care than integrated young adults. Further research with a larger sample, including young adult migrants using mental health services, is required to improve our understanding of acculturation, psychological problems and barriers to care in this population. Including experiences of discrimination in the model might improve our understanding of the relationship between different forms of acculturation and psychological problems.

AB The long-term impacts of failing to establish autonomy and relatedness within close friendships are poorly understood. Adolescent behaviors undermining autonomy and relatedness in friendships at 13 were examined as predictors of friendship competence at 18 and depressive symptoms and social withdrawal at 21. A diverse community sample of 184 adolescents participated in self-, peer, and observational assessments. Teens' inability to establish autonomy and connection with friends at 13 predicted decreases in friendship competence at 18 (=-.20, p=.02). Direct links to increase in depressive symptoms (=.34, p<.001) and social withdrawal (=.18, p=.03) were observed, with friendship competence partially mediating these relations. Results highlight the importance of problematic adolescent peer relationships as risk factors for the development of young adult internalizing symptoms.

AB The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a widely-used, parent-completed measure of children's emotional and behavioral functioning. Previous research has shown that the PSC and its subscales are generally responsive to patient progress over the course of psychiatric treatment. In this naturalistic study, we examined the performance and utility of the five-item PSC Internalizing Subscale (PSC-IS) as an assessment of routine treatment in outpatient pediatric psychiatry. Parents and clinicians of 1,593 patients aged 17 or younger completed standardized measures at intake and three-month follow-up appointments. Comparisons between PSC-IS scores and clinician-reported diagnoses, internalizing symptoms, and overall functioning showed acceptable levels of agreement. Change scores on the PSC-IS were also larger among patients with internalizing diagnoses than those with non-internalizing diagnoses. As a brief measure of internalizing symptoms, the PSC may be particularly useful to mental health clinicians treating youth with depression and anxiety as a quality assurance or treatment outcome measure.

AB Exposure to violence during adolescence is a highly prevalent phenomenon associated with a range of deleterious outcomes. Theoretical literature suggests that emotion dysregulation is one consequence of exposure to violence associated with the manifestation of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and borderline personality (BP) pathology. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relation between exposure to violence and both PTSS and BP pathology in a sample of 144 adolescents (age 10- to 17-years; 51 % male; 55 % African American) admitted to a psychiatric residential treatment center. Exposure to violence was associated with greater emotion dysregulation, which, in turn, was associated with greater PTSS and BP pathology. Furthermore, emotion dysregulation mediated the associations between exposure to violence and both PTSS and BP pathology. Findings suggest the importance of assessing and treating emotion dysregulation among violence-exposed adolescents in psychiatric residential treatment.

AB Children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) are at high risk for adjustment problems, especially internalizing disorders. Few evidence-based interventions are available to address internalizing behavior problems in this population. An efficacy trial compared outcomes for 4-6 year old children randomly assigned to a program designed to address the effects of exposure to IPV with those allocated to a waitlist comparison condition. Mothers (N = 120) and children from the United States and Canada were assessed at baseline, 5 weeks later (post-intervention) and at 8-month follow-up. The evaluation compared rates of change over time for child internalizing problems. Results were analyzed using both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approaches. ITT analyses indicated the program reduced internalizing problems for girls at follow-up. PP analyses indicated the program reduced internalizing problems for both boys and girls at post-intervention. In this study, child internalizing problems were significantly reduced through an intervention for the mother and the child.

AB Research investigating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and co-occurring disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression has surged in popularity; however, the developmental relations between ADHD and these comorbid conditions remain poorly understood. The current paper uses a developmental psychopathology perspective to examine conditions commonly comorbid with ADHD during late childhood through adolescence. First, we present evidence for ADHD and comorbid disorders. Next, we discuss emotion regulation and its associations with ADHD. The role of parenting behaviors in the development and maintenance of emotion regulation difficulties and comorbid disorders among children with ADHD is explored. An illustrative example of emotion regulation and parenting over the course of development is provided to demonstrate bidirectional relations among these constructs. We then present an integrated conceptual model of emotion regulation as a shared risk process that may lead to different comorbid conditions among children with ADHD. Implications and directions for future research are presented.

AB Children of parents with mental illness have an elevated risk of developing a range of mental health and psychosocial problems. Yet many of these children remain mentally healthy.
   The present study aimed to get insight into factors that protect these children from developing internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Several possible individual, parent-child, and family protective factors were examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a sample of 112 adolescents. A control group of 122 adolescents whose parents have no mental illness was included to explore whether the protective factors were different between adolescents with and without a parent with mental illness.
   Cross-sectional analyses revealed that high self-esteem and low use of passive coping strategies were related to fewer internalizing and externalizing problems. Greater self-disclosure was related to fewer internalizing problems and more parental monitoring was related to fewer externalizing problems. Active coping strategies, parental support, and family factors such as cohesion were unrelated to adolescent problem behavior. Longitudinal analyses showed that active coping, parental monitoring, and self-disclosure were protective against developing internalizing problems 2 years later. We found no protective factors for externalizing problems. Moderation analyses showed that the relationships between possible protective factors and adolescent problem behavior were not different for adolescents with and without a parent with mental illness.
   The findings suggest that adolescents' active coping strategies and parent-child communication may be promising factors to focus on in interventions aimed at preventing the development of internalizing problems by adolescents who have a parent with mental illness.

AB This study aimed to test if the preference for using certain types of defense mechanisms, according to Ihilevich and Gleser's (1969, 1986) perspective, is associated with personality styles, proposed by Millon (1993), and also, aimed to test if both constructs give a contribution to the identification of global types of psychological functioning in adolescents. Eight hundred and thirty adolescents, ranging in age from 14 to 19 years (M = 16.64, SD = 1.9) participated in the study. The Portuguese versions of the Defense Mechanisms Inventory for Adolescents and the Millon Adolescents Clinical Inventory were administered. Multiple linear regression analysis and principal component analysis were computed. Results demonstrate an association between defense mechanisms and personality styles and both constructs contribute to the identification of two types of psychological functioning in adolescents: an internalizing type and an externalizing type.

AB In adult attachment research, a group of individuals who convey secure attachments despite recalling difficult early caregiver relationships has been identified. The term earned security refers to individuals in this group, whereas continuous security refers to individuals who convey secure attachments and describe caring early relationships. Evidence on the validity of earned security in adults is mixed-with one longitudinal study showing that earned secure adults, despite contrary recollections, are actually more likely to have experienced positive caregiving than continuous secure adults. There is currently no evidence of earned security in adolescence, and exploring it in this age group may help shed light on the overall problem of the validity of this construct. Therefore, the broad aim of this study was to examine the construct of earned security in a group of inpatient adolescents. First, the authors aimed to identify a group of adolescents with secure attachments and memories of difficult caregiver relationships (i.e., proposed earned secure group) in a sample of 240 inpatient adolescents. Next, to explore external validity, the authors examined whether this group differed from others with regard to internalizing distress and emotion regulation. Findings indicated that a subset of secure adolescents recall difficult caregiving, as has been noted in adults, and that they differ from others with regard to emotion regulation. Despite this preliminary evidence that earned security can be identified in adolescents, the authors conclude with a discussion of the caveats of applying this construct in adolescents as well as adults.

AB Attentional control theory (ACT) proposes that anxiety is associated with executive functioning deficits. The theory has been widely investigated in adults. The current study tested whether symptoms of childhood anxiety and depression were associated with experimentally measured attentional control in the context of non-emotional and emotional stimuli. Sixty-one children (mean age = 9.23 years, range = 8.39-10.41) reported their trait anxiety and depression symptoms and completed three visual search tasks. The tasks used a variant of an irrelevant singleton paradigm and measured attentional capture by task-irrelevant non-emotional (color) and emotional (facial expressions) distractors. Significant attentional capture by both non-emotional and emotional distractors was observed, and was significantly correlated with trait anxiety and symptoms of depression. The strength of relationship between attentional capture and the symptoms did not differ significantly for non-emotional and emotional distractors. The results suggest that symptoms of childhood anxiety and depression are associated with poorer attentional control both in the presence of emotional and non-emotional stimuli, supporting ACT in younger populations. This attentional deficit in the context of non-emotional information might be as central to childhood internalizing symptoms as attentional biases often observed on tasks investigating processing of emotional stimuli.

AB Background: Research has shown that orphans in sub-Saharan Africa are at increased risk for mental health problems. Exposure to maltreatment and HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization are related to orphans' psychological distress. Yet, researchers stress the need for more research in low-income countries to identify which factors of being an orphan may lead to psychological distress.
   Objectives: The present study aims to systematically investigate orphans' experiences of maltreatment and stigmatization to identify factors that relate to their psychological distress.
   Methods: In total, 89 Tanzanian children who had lost at least one parent were compared to 89 matched non-orphans (mean age: 11 years; 51% boys). We measured exposure to maltreatment and perceived stigmatization as an orphan. Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Children's Depression Inventory, the UCLA PTSD Index for Children, and the Reactive-Proactive Questionnaire.
   Results: Orphans reported significantly more experiences of neglect, but not of abuse. A group comparison revealed more depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and aggressive behavior among orphans. Neglect, abuse, and stigmatization correlated with orphans' internalizing and externalizing problems, yet only neglect and stigmatization were related to orphans' depression severity. Perceived stigmatization moderated the relationship between neglect and depression.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that orphans in Tanzania are at increased risk of experiencing neglect. Maltreatment and perceived stigmatization may play a role in orphans' psychological distress. Culturally appropriate and evidence-based interventions may help to prevent maltreatment and stigmatization of orphans.

AB Background: The prevalence of problem behaviours among British adolescents has increased in the past decades. Following Erikson's psychosocial developmental theory and Bronfenbrenner's developmental ecological model, it was hypothesized that youth problem behaviour is shaped in part by social environment. The aim of this project was to explore potential protective factors within the social environment of British youth's for the presentation of disruptive behavioural problems.
   Method: This study used secondary data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, a cohort study of secondary school students. These data were analysed with generalized estimation equations to take the correlation between the longitudinal observations into account. Three models were built. The first model determined the effect of family, school, and extracurricular setting on presentation of disruptive behavioural problems. The second model expanded the first model by assuming extracurricular activities as protective factors that moderated the interaction between family and school factors with disruptive behavioural problems. The third model described the effect of prior disruptive behaviour on current disruptive behaviour.
   Results: Associations were found between school factors, family factors, involvement in extracurricular activities and presence of disruptive behavioural problems. Results from the second generalized estimating equation ( GEE) logistic regression models indicated that extracurricular activities buffered the impact of school and family factors on the presence of disruptive behavioural problems. For instance, participation in sports activities decreased the effect of bullying on psychological distress. Results from the third model indicated that prior acts of disruptive behaviour reinforced current disruptive behaviour.
   Conclusion: This study supports Erikson's psychosocial developmental theory and Bronfenbrenner's developmental ecological model; social environment did influence the presence of disruptive behavioural problems for British adolescents. The potential of extracurricular activities to intervention strategies addressing disruptive behavioural problems of adolescents is discussed.

AB This study examined the efficacy of the attachment-based Circle of Security 20-week intervention in improving child behavioural and emotional functioning. Participants were 83 parents of children (1-7years) referred to a clinical service with concerns about their young children's behaviour. Parents (and teachers, when available) completed questionnaires assessing child protective factors, behavioural concerns, internalizing and externalizing problems, prior to and immediately after the intervention. The following were considered as potential moderators: child gender and age, parent representations, reflective functioning, child attachment indices and severity of presenting problems, prior to treatment. Results showed significant improvement for parent ratings of child protective factors, behavioural concerns, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, all ps<.05, and children with more severe problems showed most improvement. Teachers also reported improvements, but change was significant only for externalizing problems (p=.030). Findings suggest Circle of Security is effective in improving child behavioural and emotional functioning in clinically referred children aged 1-7years.

AB Anxiety is the most prevalent psychiatric disturbance in childhood effecting typically 15-20% of all youth. It has been associated with attachment insecurity and reduced competence in peer relations. Prior work has been limited by including mainly White samples, relying on questionnaires, and applying a cross-sectional design. The present study addressed these limitations by considering how at-risk non-White youth (n=34) responded to the Friends and Family Interview (FFI) in middle childhood and how this linked up with anxiety symptoms and an anxiety diagnosis threeyears later in early adolescence. Five dimensions of secure attachment, namely, (i) to mother, (ii) to father, (iii) coherence, (iv) developmental understanding, and (v) social competence and quality of contact with best friend in middle childhood, were found to correlate significantly (and negatively) with self-reported anxiety symptoms. Linear regression results showed independent influences of female gender, and (low) quality of best friend contact as the most efficient model predicting anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression results suggested a model that included female gender, low social competence, and immature developmental understanding as efficient predictors of an anxiety diagnosis, evident in only 18% of the sample. These results point to the usefulness of after-school programs for at-risk minority youth in promoting peer competence, developmental awareness, and minimizing anxiety difficulties.

AB This study employed a relational post-traumatic stress frame to explore the co-contribution of young children's exposure to violence and caregiver insightfulness on child behavioral outcomes in a high-risk, non-referred sample of caregivers and preschoolers (n=64; mean age 3.83years, SD=.77). Caregiver insightfulness did not have a main effect on child outcomes but did moderate the relation between violence exposure and child behavior across all observed outcomes. Violence-exposed children with non-insightful caregivers demonstrated higher caregiver-rated internalizing and externalizing behaviors and observer-rated negative affect than all other groups. Among children not exposed to violence, insightfulness was not related to children's behavior problems or negative affect, suggesting violence-specific processes. Though cross-sectional, results suggest that the effects of violence and caregiver insightfulness on child outcomes are contingent on one another and that caregiver insightfulness may play a protective role in contexts of violence.

AB A major focus of implementation science is discovering whether evidence-based approaches can be delivered with fidelity and potency in routine practice. This randomized trial compared usual care family therapy (UC-FT), implemented without a treatment manual or extramural support as the standard-of-care approach in a community clinic, to nonfamily treatment (UC-Other) for adolescent conduct and substance use disorders. The study recruited 205 adolescents (M age=15.7 years; 52% male; 59% Hispanic American, 21% African American) from a community referral network, enrolling 63% for primary mental health problems and 37% for primary substance use problems. Clients were randomly assigned to either the UC-FT site or one of five UC-Other sites. Implementation data confirmed that UC-FT showed adherence to the family therapy approach and differentiation from UC-Other. Follow-ups were completed at 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. There was no between-group difference in treatment attendance. Both conditions demonstrated improvements in externalizing, internalizing, and delinquency symptoms. However, UC-FT produced greater reductions in youth-reported externalizing and internalizing among the whole sample, in delinquency among substance-using youth, and in alcohol and drug use among substance-using youth. The degree to which UC-FT outperformed UC-Other was consistent with effect sizes from controlled trials of manualized family therapy models. Nonmanualized family therapy can be effective for adolescent behavior problems within diverse populations in usual care, and it may be superior to nonfamily alternatives.

AB The present study examined anxiety and depressive symptoms in relation to the social functioning of young adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and builds upon prior work by incorporating youths' self-reports of internalizing symptoms and examining distinct anxiety and depression dimensions to increase specificity. Participants were 310 young adolescents (ages 10-14; 71% male, 78% Caucasian) diagnosed with ADHD. Youth provided ratings of anxiety/depression, and parents provided ratings of their own depression. Parents and youth both reported on youths' social skills and perceived social acceptance. Path analyses indicated that above and beyond child demographics, ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder symptom severity, and parents' own depression, self-reported social anxiety and anhedonia were both associated with lower youth-reported social skills and both parent- and youth-reported social acceptance. Negative self-evaluation was associated with poorer parent-reported social skills. Finally, harm avoidance was positively associated with both youth- and parent-reported social skills. A path analysis using comorbid diagnoses (rather than symptom dimensions) indicated that that having a comorbid disruptive behavior disorder or depression diagnosis (but not a comorbid anxiety diagnosis) was associated with poorer parent-reported social functioning. Results demonstrate that the relation between internalizing symptoms and social functioning among young adolescents with ADHD is nuanced, with social anxiety and anhedonia symptoms associated with lower social skills and social acceptance in contrast to harm avoidance being associated with higher ratings of social skills (and unrelated to social acceptance). In terms of comorbid diagnoses, depression is more clearly related than anxiety to poorer social functioning among young adolescents with ADHD. These results point to the importance of attending to specific facets of anxiety and depression in clinical care and future research.

AB Most theoretical models of developmental psychopathology involve a transactional, bidirectional relation between parenting and children's behavior problems. The present study utilized a cross-lagged panel, multiple interval design to model change in bidirectional relations between child and parent behavior across successive developmental periods. Two major categories of child behavior problems, internalizing and externalizing, and two aspects of parenting, positive (use of support and structure) and harsh discipline (use of physical punishment), were modeled across three time points spaced 3 years apart. Two successive developmental intervals, from approximately age 7.5 to 10.5 and from 10.5 to 13.5, were included. Mother-child dyads (N = 138; 65 boys) from a lower income longitudinal sample of families participated, with standardized measures of mothers rating their own parenting behavior and teachers reporting on child's behavior. Results revealed different types of reciprocal relations between specific aspects of child and parent behavior, with internalizing problems predicting an increase in positive parenting over time, which subsequently led to a reduction in internalizing problems across the successive 3-year interval. In contrast, externalizing predicted reduced levels of positive parenting in a reciprocal sequence that extended across two successive intervals and predicted increased levels of externalizing over time. Implications for prevention and early intervention are discussed.

AB The current study investigated the influential role of infant avoidance on links between maternal caregiving behavior and trajectories at risk for psychopathology. A sample of 153 children, selected for temperamental reactivity to novelty, was followed frominfancy through early childhood. At 9 months, infant avoidance of fear-eliciting stimuli in the laboratory and maternal sensitivity at home were assessed. At 36 months, maternal gentle discipline was assessed at home. Children were repeatedly observed in the lab with an unfamiliar peer across early childhood. A latent class growth analysis yielded three longitudinal risk trajectories of social reticence behavior: a high-stable trajectory, a high-decreasing trajectory, and a low-increasing trajectory. For infants displaying greater avoidance, 9-month maternal sensitivity and 36-month maternal gentle discipline were both positively associated with membership in the high-stable social reticence trajectory, compared to the high-decreasing social reticence trajectory. For infants displaying lower avoidance, maternal sensitivity was positively associated with membership in the high-decreasing social reticence trajectory, compared to the low-increasing trajectory. Maternal sensitivity was positively associated with the high-stable social reticence trajectory when maternal gentle discipline was lower. These results illustrate the complex interplay of infant and maternal behavior in early childhood trajectories at risk for emerging psychopathology.

AB Reduced supportive parenting and elevated negative parenting behaviors increase risks for maladaptive social adjustment during early childhood (e.g., Campbell, Shaw, & Gilliom, 2000). However, the magnitude of these risks may vary according to children's individual characteristics, such as sex and temperament. The current study examines whether children's sex and fear reactivity moderate the associations between mothers' observed parenting and children's behavior problems 1 year later. The sample consists of 151 predominantly African American, low-income families with one sibling who is approximately 2 years old and the closest aged older sibling who is approximately 4 years old. Results from fixed-effects within-family models indicate that fear distress (i.e., fearfulness) moderated associations between mothers' observed negative parenting and children's increased behavior problems, such that only those children with mean or higher observed fear distress scores showed increased behavior problems when exposed to mother's negative parenting. Child sex moderated associations between fear approach reactivity (i.e., fearlessness) and mothers' observed supportive parenting. Specifically, low fear approach combined with supportive parenting was associated with fewer behavior problems for boys only. Implications of these findings for preventive intervention are discussed.

AB Psychological disorders co-occur often in children, but little has been done to document the types of conjoint pathways internalizing and externalizing symptoms may take from the crucial early period of toddlerhood or how harsh parenting may overlap with early symptom codevelopment. To examine symptom codevelopment trajectories, we identified latent classes of individuals based on internalizing and externalizing symptoms across ages 3-9 and found three symptom codevelopment classes: normative symptoms (low), severe-decreasing symptoms (initially high but rapidly declining), and severe symptoms (high) trajectories. Next, joint models examined how parenting trajectories overlapped with internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. These trajectory classes demonstrated that, normatively, harsh parenting increased after toddlerhood, but the severe symptoms class was characterized by a higher level and a steeper increase in harsh parenting and the severe-decreasing class by high, stable harsh parenting. In addition, a transactional model examined the bidirectional relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms and harsh parenting because they may cascade over time in this early period. Harsh parenting uniquely contributed to externalizing symptoms, controlling for internalizing symptoms, but not vice versa. In addition, internalizing symptoms appeared to be a mechanism by which externalizing symptoms increase. Results highlight the importance of accounting for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms from an early age to understand risk for developing psychopathology and the role harsh parenting plays in influencing these trajectories.

AB Effectiveness studies of preschool social-emotional programs are needed in low-income, diverse populations to help promote the well-being of at-risk children. Following an initial program efficacy study 2 years prior, 248 culturally diverse Head Start preschool children participated in the current effectiveness trial and received either the Emotion-Based Prevention Program (EBP) or the I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) intervention. Pre-and postdata collection included direct child assessment, teacher report, parent interview, and independent observations. Teachers implementing the EBP intervention demonstrated good and consistent fidelity to the program. Overall, children in EBP classrooms gained more emotion knowledge and displayed greater decreases in negative emotion expressions and internalizing behaviors across the implementation period as compared to children in ICPS classrooms. In addition, cumulative risk, parental depressive symptoms, and classroom climate significantly moderated treatment effects. For children experiencing more stress or less support, EBP produced more successful outcomes than did ICPS. These results provide evidence of EBP sustainability and program effectiveness, as did previous findings that demonstrated EBP improvements in emotion knowledge, regulation skills, and behavior problems replicated under unsupervised program conditions.

AB This study tests competing models of the relation between depression and polysubstance use over the course of adolescence. Participants included a nationwide sample of adolescents (N = 3,604), ages 12 to 17 at study Wave 1, assessed annually for 3 years. Models were tested using cohort-sequential latent growth curve modeling to determine whether depressive symptoms at baseline predicted concurrent and age-related changes in drug use, whether drug use at baseline predicted concurrent and age-related changes in depressive symptoms, and whether initial levels of depression predicted changes in substance use significantly better than vice versa. The results suggest a transactional model such that early polysubstance use promotes early depressive symptoms, which in turn convey elevated risk for increasing polysubstance use over time, which in turn conveys additional risk for future depressive symptoms, even after accounting for gender, ethnicity, and household income. In contrast, early drug use did not portend risk for future depressive symptoms. These findings suggest a complicated pattern of interrelations over time and indicate that many current models of co-occurring polysubstance use and depressive symptoms may not fully account for these associations. Instead, the results suggest a developmental cascade, in which symptoms of one disorder promote symptoms of the other across intrapersonal domains.

AB This study advances understanding of predictors of child abuse and neglect at multiple levels of influence. Mothers, fathers, and children (N = 1,418 families, M age of children = 8.29 years) were interviewed annually in three waves in 13 cultural groups in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States). Multilevel models were estimated to examine predictors of (a) within-family differences across the three time points, (b) between-family within-culture differences, and (c) between-cultural group differences in mothers' and fathers' reports of corporal punishment and children's reports of their parents' neglect. These analyses addressed to what extent mothers' and fathers' use of corporal punishment and children's perceptions of their parents' neglect were predicted by parents' belief in the necessity of using corporal punishment, parents' perception of the normativeness of corporal punishment in their community, parents' progressive parenting attitudes, parents' endorsement of aggression, parents' education, children's externalizing problems, and children's internalizing problems at each of the three levels. Individual-level predictors (especially child externalizing behaviors) as well as cultural-level predictors (especially normativeness of corporal punishment in the community) predicted corporal punishment and neglect. Findings are framed in an international context that considers how abuse and neglect are defined by the global community and how countries have attempted to prevent abuse and neglect.

AB The current study examined the prospective association between child maltreatment and the development of substance use disorder in adolescence with the aim of investigating pathways underlying this relation, as well as genetic moderation of these developmental mechanisms. Specifically, we tested whether youth who experienced maltreatment prior to age 8 were at risk for the development of marijuana dependence in adolescence by way of a childhood externalizing pathway and a childhood internalizing pathway. Moreover, we tested whether variation in FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) CATT haplotype moderated these pathways. The participants were 326 children (n = 179 maltreated; n = 147 nonmaltreated) assessed across two waves of data collection (childhood: ages 7-9 and adolescence: ages 15-18). Results indicated that higher levels of child externalizing symptoms significantly mediated the effect of child maltreatment on adolescent marijuana dependence symptoms for individuals with one or two copies of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype only. We did not find support for an internalizing pathway from child maltreatment to adolescent marijuana dependence, nor did we find evidence of moderation of the internalizing pathway by FKBP5 haplotype variation. Findings extend previous research by demonstrating that whether a maltreated child will traverse an externalizing pathway toward substance use disorder in adolescence is dependent on FKBP5 genetic variation.

AB The experience of child maltreatment is a significant risk factor for the development of later internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety. This risk is particularly heightened after exposure to additional, more contemporaneous stress. While behavioral evidence exists for such "stress sensitization," little is known about the mechanisms mediating such relationships, particularly within the brain. Here we report that the experience of child maltreatment independent of recent life stress, gender, and age is associated with reduced structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a major white matter pathway between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in young adults. We further demonstrate that individuals with lower uncinate fasciculus integrity at baseline who subsequently experience stressful life events report higher levels of internalizing symptomatology at follow-up. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological mechanism linking child maltreatment with later internalizing symptoms, specifically altered structural connectivity within the brain's threat-detection and emotion-regulation circuitry.

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that alterations of the stress response system may be a mechanism by which childhood maltreatment alters risk for psychopathology. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and alters its ability to respond to stress signaling. The aim of the present study was to examine methylation of the FKBP5 gene (FKBP5), and the role of an FKBP5 genetic variant, in relation to childhood maltreatment in a sample of impoverished preschool-aged children. One hundred seventy-four families participated in this study, including 69 with child welfare documentation of moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. The children, who ranged in age from 3 to 5 years, were racially and ethnically diverse. Structured record review and interviews in the home were used to assess a history of maltreatment, other traumas, and contextual life stressors; and a composite variable assessed the number exposures to these adversities. Methylation of two sites in intron 7 of FKBP5 was measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing. Maltreated children had significantly lower levels of methylation at both CpG sites (p < .05). Lifetime contextual stress exposure showed a trend for lower levels of methylation at one of the sites, and a trend for an interaction with the FKBP5 polymorphism. A composite adversity variable was associated with lower levels of methylation at one of the sites as well (p < .05). FKBP5 alters glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness, and FKBP5 gene methylation may be a mechanism of the biobehavioral effects of adverse exposures in young children.

AB The experience of touch is critical for early communication and social interaction; infants who show aversion to touch may be at risk for atypical development and behavior problems. The current study aimed to clarify predictive associations between infant responses to tactile stimuli and toddler autism spectrum, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors. This study measured 9-month-old infants' (N = 561; 58% male) avoidance and negative affect during a novel tactile task in which parents painted infants' hands and feet and pressed them to paper to make a picture. Parent reports on the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP), Internalizing, and Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist were used to measure toddler behaviors at 18 months. Infant observed avoidance and negative affect were significantly correlated; however, avoidance predicted subsequent PDP scores only, independent of negative affect, which did not predict any toddler behaviors. Findings suggest that incorporating measures of responses to touch in the study of early social interaction may provide an important and discriminating construct for identifying children at greater risk for social impairments related to autism spectrum behaviors.

AB Offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (O-BP) is a high-risk cohort for mental illness in general and bipolar disorder (BD) specifically. This review aims to delineate the main clinical features of O-BP, including the psychopathology, interpersonal functioning, temperamental and personality features, neurocognitive deficits and neurobiological dysfunctions. Evidence indicates that several internalizing and externalizing symptoms/disorders are more prevalent in O-BP than in offspring of healthy control parents (O-HC). Furthermore, O-BP exhibits poorer interpersonal functioning than O-HC. Moreover, O-BP also endorses higher activity level, emotionality and behavioral disinhibition compared to O-HC. Besides, O-BP displays greater deficits on memory, cognitive flexibility and social cognition compared to O-HC. Finally, O-BP exhibits dysfunctional modulation in corti-co-subcortical areas, more white matter abnormalities and higher cortisol basal levels compared to O-HC. Overall, these findings are discussed regarding the natural course and potential risk factors or endophenotypes for major mood disorders in general and BD specifically.

AB Despite the fact that children born very preterm or earlier, or at a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) or smaller manifest elevated rates of a number of risk factors that put them at increased risk for peer victimization (e.g., poor motor abilities, lower IQ and higher anxiety and depression), relatively little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of exposure to bullying in this population. Here we review the seven known studies published to date that have investigated peer victimization in those born very preterm or earlier or VLBW or smaller. The majority of these studies have found that these children are at an increased risk of being bullied by peers. Possible risk factors include poorer cognitive functioning, psychiatric disorders, motor difficulties, and functional limitations. However, this field is limited by the use of sub-optimal measures of peer victimization, small sample sizes, and a lack of longitudinal studies. Future research needs to examine the prevalence of bullying and the long-term risks associated with being bullied in those born VLBW and smaller. Regardless of the methodological limitations, parents and teachers should be aware that individuals born VLBW and smaller may be at a higher risk for being bullied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: We examine a coping-process model Agnew (2013) proposed inshis recent extension of general strain theory (GST). We also test whether combining variables conducive to criminal coping increases the chance of detecting their conditioning the effects of strain and negative emotions on coping.
   Methods: We applied structural equation modeling to analyze representative data from two waves of the Korean Youth Panel Survey, collected when respondents were eleventh and twelfth graders.
   Results: Holding the respondent's prior deviance and sociodemographic and theoretical controls constant, we found the criminogenic effect of objective strain on delinquent coping to be fully mediated by the objective strain's cognitive appraisal (i.e., subjective strain) and the emotional outcomes of strain. In addition, anger was found to increase internalizing (drug use) as well as externalizing coping (non-drug delinquency), whereas depression/anxiety was not related to drug use, though it decreased non-drug delinquency. However, we found little evidence that combilling variables conducive to criminal coping is likely to help detect their conditioning effects than using the variables individually.
   Conclusions: This study provides empirical support for the coping-process model of extended GST, including the conceptual distinction between objective and subjective strain, except the suggested combinational method to detect a conditioning effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a 10-year longitudinal study, the developmental course of internalizing and externalizing symptoms was investigated in a group of 98 individuals who exhibited different ego development trajectories from adolescence into emerging adulthood. This study explored whether an increase or a decrease in psychopathological symptomatology was associated with different ego development progressions in conjunction with the use of certain coping behaviors. In general, the study revealed that increases in ego development and the use of adaptive coping behavior were associated with a decrease in symptomatology over time. Ego developmental trajectories with a very steep progression were linked with maladaptive coping and resulted in moreintemalizing and externalizing symptoms and less marked decrease in externalizing symptoms overtime. Consequently, approaches to understanding and explaining psychopathology in the transition period should focus on individuals' self-perceived developmental speeds in psychosocial maturity in order to explain different outcomes in psychopathology.

AB Adolescence can be characterized as a time when aggression, delinquency, and violence (taken together as antisocial behavior) increase. Adolescents who engage in antisocial behavior increase local crime and can create unsafe conditions for families. Understanding the protective factors that mitigate antisocial behavior can help to inform prevention practices. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (n = 1,072, 51.40% female, 39.18% Hispanic, 32.28% Black), we examined how self-control, social support, and neighborhood characteristics were associated with these behaviors. Using latent profile analyses, we categorized neighborhoods based on several dimensions, including violence, disadvantage, and collective efficacy. Then, we examined how self-control and social support were associated with antisocial behavior within and across neighborhoods. Results suggested that self-control was a protective feature in only some types of disadvantaged and dangerous neighborhoods. We discuss findings in terms of implications for programs and policies to mitigate youth violence and delinquency.

AB Early life trauma exposure represents a potent risk factor for the development of mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, deleterious consequences of trauma are exacerbated in youth living in impoverished, urban environments. A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 trauma-exposed, and 21 age-and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma. Intrinsic FC analyses focused on amygdala-medial prefrontal circuitry, a key emotion regulatory pathway in the brain. We discovered reduced negative amygdala-subgenual cingulate connectivity in trauma-exposed youth. Differences between groups were also identified in anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate to amygdala connectivity. Overall, results suggest a model in which urban-dwelling trauma-exposed youth lack negative prefrontal to amygdala connectivity that may be critical for regulation of emotional responses. Functional changes in amygdala circuitry might reflect the biological embedding of stress reactivity in early life and mediate enhanced vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology.

AB The majority of school-age youth experience some form of bullying, and the consequences can have significant impact on a child's or adolescent's social, emotional, and academic functioning The majority of anti-bullying initiatives have focused on schoolwide prevention programs aimed to enhance school climate and a school's response to bullying incidences. Few programs address the socio-emotional functioning of youth who are experiencing significant anxiety and mood problems following exposure to bullying The current paper describes the development of a transdiagnostic behavioral activation and exposure program (Group Behavior Activation Therapy for Bullying) designed to address internalizing problems secondary to bullying Case descriptions and clinical outcomes are reported from a pilot group of 5 youth (ages 12 to 13). Video clips of group demonstrations are included for illustrative purposes. Attendance was strong and group satisfaction ratings indicated the program was feasible and acceptable to conduct in school settings. Initial outcomes suggest that youth experienced benefits in anxiety and depression diagnoses, symptom outcomes, and functional impairment related to bullying However, larger controlled evaluations are required to support any conclusions about treatment efficacy.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand the etiologies, features, and care outcomes of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) in a pediatric setting.
   Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of 32 sequentially referred children for suspected PNESs to a neurology psychology service over a 6-year period. After excluding non-PNES paroxysmal events (related to anxiety or migraine), 29 patients were identified with final diagnosis of PNESs. Charts were examined for presenting symptom data, demographics, comorbidities, neurological diagnoses and investigations, as well as psychological assessment, management, and outcome. Treatment consisted of education around diagnosis and of individual psychological treatment, which, in most cases, was cognitive behavioral therapy up to 14 sessions. Additional mental health services including psychiatric medication, family therapy, and admission to day or inpatient treatment were also utilized in a smaller number of cases. Total treatment periods ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months.
   Results: The majority of patients identified were adolescent (90%), Caucasian (72%), and female (76%). Preceding psychology referral, point of entry into medical care for PNESs was primarily through the emergency department (66%) or outpatient neurology clinic referral (31%). Whereas 39% of parents described significant internalizing symptoms in their child (BASC-2), patients themselves tended to underreport anxiety or depression as demonstrated by only 16% endorsement on the BYI-II. By contrast, MACI personality assessment response patterns for adolescents demonstrated high levels of psychic tension/anxiety (65%), depressive affect (55%), and maladaptive personality traits including inhibition (45%), submissiveness (35%), and introversion (30%). Appropriate psychological treatment was associated with high rates of full remission (no newevents, n=17, 59%) and partial remission (50% or greater reduction in events, n=6, 21%) as self-reported at discharge. Accurate diagnosis and referral to psychology also led to a sevenfold reduction in PNES-related emergency department visits one year after initial psychology visit compared with the preceding year.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that appropriate care for PNESs reduces inappropriate medical investigation and therapy, expedites rates of remission, and decreases health-care utilization in a pediatric setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There is a hypothesis that low socioeconomic status (SES) may explain the link between cannabis use and poorer academic performance and mental health. A key question, therefore, is whether adolescent cannabis use is associated with poorer academic performance and mental health in high SES communities where there is reduced potential for confounding.
   Methods: Youth (n = 254) from an upper middle class community were followed prospectively through the four years of high school (from age 14/15 to age 17/18). Past-year frequency of cannabis use was assessed annually. Official school records of academic performance and self-reported mental health symptoms (externalizing and internalizing symptoms) were assessed in grades 9 and 12.
   Results: Persistent cannabis use across the four years of high school was associated with lower gradepoint average (beta = -0.18, p = .006), lower Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score (beta = -0.13, p = .038), and greater externalizing symptoms (beta = 0.29, p < .001) in 12th grade, but not with greater internalizing symptoms (beta = 0.04, p = .53). Moreover, persistent cannabis use was associated with lower grade-point average (beta = -0.13, p = .014) and greater externalizing symptoms (beta = 0.24, p = .002) in 12th grade, even after controlling for 9th grade levels of these outcomes. Similar associations were observed for persistent alcohol and tobacco use. Effects for persistent cannabis use became non-significant after controlling for persistent alcohol and tobacco use, reflecting the difficulties of disentangling effects of cannabis from effects of alcohol and tobacco.
   Conclusions: Low SES cannot fully explain associations between cannabis use and poorer academic performance and mental health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the real-world effectiveness of a computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol relative to treatment as usual (TAU) among anxious children presenting at community mental health centers.
   MethodsOne hundred children (7-13 years) with clinically significant anxiety were randomized to receive either 12 weekly computer-assisted CBT sessions or TAU for an equivalent duration. Assessments were conducted by independent evaluators at screening/baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 1-month followup (for computer-assisted CBT treatment responders).
   ResultsThere were significant between-group effects favoring thecomputer-assisted CBTcondition on primary anxiety outcomes. Thirty of 49 (61.2%) children randomized to computer-assisted CBT responded to treatment, which was superior to TAU (6/51, 11.8%). Relative to TAU, computer-assisted CBT was associated with greater reductions in parent-rated child impairment and internalizing symptoms, but not child-rated impairment and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance in those receiving computer-assisted CBT was high. Treatment gains in computer-assisted CBT responders were maintained at 1-month followup.
   ConclusionsWithin the limitations of this study, computer-assisted CBT is an effective and feasible treatment for anxious children when used in community mental health centers by CBT-naive clinicians. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the neurofibromin 1 gene at locus 17q11.2. Individuals with NF1 have an increased incidence of learning disabilities, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorders. As a single-gene disorder, NF1 represents a valuable model for understanding gene-brain-behavior relationships. While mouse models have elucidated molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying learning deficits associated with this mutation, little is known about functional brain architecture in human subjects with NF1. To address this question, we used resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) to elucidate the intrinsic network structure of 30 NF1 participants compared with 30 healthy demographically matched controls during an eyes-open rs-fcMRI scan. Novel statistical methods were employed to quantify differences in local connectivity (edge strength) and modularity structure, in combination with traditional global graph theory applications. Our findings suggest that individuals with NF1 have reduced anterior-posterior connectivity, weaker bilateral edges, and altered modularity clustering relative to healthy controls. Further, edge strength and modular clustering indices were correlated with IQ and internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that Ras signaling disruption may lead to abnormal functional brain connectivity; further investigation into the functional consequences of these alterations in both humans and in animal models is warranted.

AB This study examined the relations of maternal warmth, behavioral control, and encouragement of sociability to social, school, and psychological adjustment in migrant children in China. The participants were 284 rural-to-urban migrant children (M age = 11 years, 149 boys) in migrant children's schools and their mothers. Data on parenting were collected from mothers' reports. Data on children's adjustment were collected from multiple sources including peer assessments, teacher ratings, self-reports, and school records. It was found that maternal warmth was associated with children's social and school performance, and that maternal encouragement of sociability was associated with children's psychological adjustment. Maternal behavioral control was not associated with children's adjustment. The results indicate that maternal warmth, behavioral control, and encouragement of sociability may serve different functions in different domains of adjustment among migrant Chinese children.

AB Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) report fatigue in addition to acute and chronic pain, which can decrease overall health-related quality of life (HRQL). The primary objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and HRQL. Given limited prior research, secondary objectives included investigation of associations between fatigue and functional outcomes, including child neurocognitive and social-emotional functioning. Children aged 8 to 16 years (N=32) and a caregiver completed measures of fatigue, HRQL, pain, and neurocognitive and social-emotional functioning. Controlling for pain and number of SCD-related hospitalizations, hierarchical linear regression models were used to determine the impact of child-reported and parent-reported fatigue on child HRQL. Correlational analyses were used to explore the relationship between fatigue and additional child outcomes. Data indicated that children with SCD experience clinically relevant levels of fatigue, which independently predicts lower HRQL. Fatigue was also associated with lower working memory, executive functioning, and higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Given its observed impact on HRQL and relationship to functional outcomes, fatigue may be an important target of clinical, home, or school interventions. This practice may attenuate the burden of fatigue in these patients, and in turn, help improve the quality of life of children living with SCD.

AB Objective: During adolescence, neurobiological maturation occurs concurrently with social and interpersonal changes, including the initiation of alcohol and other substance use. The National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) is designed to disentangle the complex relationships between onset, escalation, and desistance of alcohol use and changes in neurocognitive functioning and neuromaturation. Method: A sample of 831 youth, ages 12-21 years, was recruited at five sites across the United States, oversampling those at risk for alcohol use problems. Most (83%) had limited or no history of alcohol or other drug use, and a smaller portion (17%) exceeded drinking thresholds. A comprehensive assessment of biological development, family background, psychiatric symptomatology, and neuropsychological functioning-in addition to anatomical, diffusion, and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging-was completed at baseline. Results: The NCANDA sample of youth is nationally representative of sex and racial/ethnic groups. More than 50% have at least one risk characteristic for subsequent heavy drinking (e.g., family history, internalizing or externalizing symptoms). As expected, those who exceeded drinking thresholds (n = 139) differ from those who did not (n = 692) on identified factors associated with early alcohol use and problems. Conclusions: NCANDA successfully recruited a large sample of adolescents and comprehensively assessed psychosocial functioning across multiple domains. Based on the sample's risk profile, NCANDA is well positioned to capture the transition into drinking and alcohol problems in a large portion of the cohort, as well as to help disentangle the associations between alcohol use, neurobiological maturation, and neurocognitive development and functioning.

AB In the present study, we examined the effect of stigma priming on a psychological screening in two separate experiments with African Americans who had juvenile court contact. Results of the first experiment showed that asking adolescents to state their racial group membership had no effect on self-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In the second experiment, adolescents primed by making racial identity attitudes salient reported higher levels of oppositional defiant, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, but not conduct disordered behavior, when compared with peers in a control group. Three racial identity profiles were identified: (a) Miseducation-Pro-Black, (b) Low Race Salience, and (c) Multiculturalist. Only the Low Race Salience profile was shown to be associated with stigma priming vulnerability in a forensic mental health screening.

AB This article examines associations between the Great Recession and 4 aspects of 9-year olds' behavior-aggression (externalizing), anxiety/depression (internalizing), alcohol and drug use, and vandalism-using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth cohort drawn from 20 U.S. cities (21%, White, 50% Black, 26% Hispanic, and 3% other race/ethnicity). The study was in the field for the 9-year follow-up right before and during the Great Recession (2007-2010; N = 3,311). Interview dates (month) were linked to the national Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), calculated from a national probability sample drawn monthly to assess consumer confidence and uncertainty about the economy, as well as to data on local unemployment rates. Controlling for city-fixed effects and extensive controls (including prior child behavior at age 5), we find that greater uncertainty as measured by the CSI was associated with higher rates of all 4 behavior problems for boys (in both maternal and child reports). Such associations were not found for girls (all gender differences were significant). Links between the CSI and boys' behavior problems were concentrated in single-parent families and were partially explained by parenting behaviors. Local unemployment rates, in contrast, had fewer associations with children's behavior, suggesting that in the Great Recession, what was most meaningful for child behavior problems was the uncertainty about the national economy, rather than local labor markets.

AB The 'gaze aversion hypothesis', suggests that people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) avoid mutual gaze because they experience it as hyper-arousing. To test this hypothesis we showed mutual and averted gaze stimuli to 23 mixed-ability preschoolers with ASD (M Mullen DQ = 68) and 21 typically-developing preschoolers, aged 2-5 years, using eye-tracking technology to measure visual attention and emotional arousal (i.e., pupil dilation). There were no group differences in attention to the eye region or pupil dilation. Both groups dilated their pupils more to mutual compared to averted gaze. More internalizing symptoms in the children with ASD related to less emotional arousal to mutual gaze. The pattern of results suggests that preschoolers with ASD are not dysregulated in their responses to mutual gaze.

AB Traumatic childhood events are associated with a wide range of negative physical, psychological and adaptive outcomes over the life course and are one of the few identifiable causes of psychiatric illness. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be at increased risk for both encountering traumatic events and developing traumatic sequelae; however, this topic has been understudied. This review considers the rationale for examining traumatic events and related symptomology in individuals with ASD and summarizes the limited research on this topic. A conceptual framework for understanding the interplay of ASD, trauma and traumatic sequelae is proposed and recommendations for future research presented.

AB To examine the mediating effect of family functioning on the relation between maternal and adolescent depressive symptoms and determine whether the magnitude of the mediating effect is different for adolescents with and without chronic physical health conditions.
   Data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. A representative survey of 11,813 adolescents and their mothers was included. Maternal and adolescent depressive symptoms were measured using the 12-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Family functioning was measured using the McMaster Family Assessment Device. Multilevel multiple-group path analysis was used to examine potential mediating and moderating effects.
   Family functioning measured when adolescents were 14-15 years mediated the relation between maternal depressive symptoms (measured at 10-13 years) and adolescent depressive symptoms (measured at 16-19 years) for both adolescents with [alpha beta = 0.02 (0.02, 0.03)] and without chronic health conditions [alpha beta = 0.01 (0.00, 0.01)]. These findings provided evidence to suggest mediated moderation, Delta alpha beta = 0.02 (0.01, 0.03), that is, the mediating effect of family functioning was significantly larger for adolescents with chronic health conditions.
   The mediating effect of family functioning in the relation between maternal and adolescent depressive symptoms is larger for adolescents with chronic health conditions. Within the framework of family-centered care, maternal depressive symptoms and family functioning are suitable targets for preventive intervention for adolescents with chronic health conditions.

AB Social/emotional skills in early childhood are associated with education, labor market, and family formation outcomes throughout the life course. One explanation for these associations is that poor social/emotional skills in early childhood interfere with the development of cognitive skills. In this paper, we use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2302) to examine how the timing of social/emotional skills measured as internalizing, externalizing, and attention problem behaviors in early childhood is associated with cognitive test scores in middle childhood. Results show that externalizing problems at age 3 and attention problems at age 5, as well as externalizing and attention problems at both ages 3 and 5, are associated with poor cognitive development in middle childhood, net of a wide array of control variables and prior test scores. Surprisingly, maternal engagement at age five does not mediate these associations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the impact on children of services delivered through a collaborative initiative designed to provide supports to working poor families who are homeless or at immediate risk of becoming homeless. Overall, a number of positive findings can serve to inform the development of promising intervention strategies for children in homeless families and highlight areas for further research. Along with improved housing status, there was a statistically significant improvement in the economic self-sufficiency of the families served, regardless of whether they completed the full programme cycle. In addition, youth self-report data indicated significant improvements in externalizing and internalizing behaviour. The ability to combine programme data with school data for participating children also made it possible to explore school performance outcomes. Although these results did not indicate a change in participants' levels of attendance or reading performance, there was a statistically significant improvement in students' math scores. Moreover, when participating children were compared with a group of students matched on their level of academic performance at baseline who had not received housing or homeless services, no significant differences were detected between groups post-intervention, indicating that services may help reduce the risk of homeless students' falling further behind their peers academically.

AB The present study examined multiple indices of sleep as moderators of the association between peer victimization and adjustment among typically developing adolescents. Participants included 252 adolescents (M = 15.79 years; 66 % European American, 34 % African American) and their parents. A multi-method, multi-informant design was employed to address the research questions. Sleep was assessed objectively with actigraphy (sleep minutes and sleep efficiency) and subjectively with self-reports. Adolescents reported on peer victimization and internalizing symptoms. Externalizing behaviors were examined with mother and father reports. Subjective sleep/wake problems moderated the associations between peer victimization and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. A stronger relation emerged between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms among adolescents who reported higher versus lower levels of sleep/wake problems. Adolescents with elevated sleep/wake problems had higher levels of externalizing symptoms across the range of peer victimization. However, for those with fewer sleep/wake problems, a positive relation between peer victimization and externalizing symptoms was observed. Actigraphy-based sleep minutes and sleep efficiency also moderated the relations between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms. Although peer victimization was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms for all youth, those who reported the lowest levels of such symptoms had longer and more efficient sleep in conjunction with low levels of peer victimization. Findings are novel and highlight the importance of considering both bioregulatory processes and peer relations in the prediction of adolescents' adjustment.

AB Little is known about the developmental outcomes of children's social withdrawal in non-Western societies. The present study examined how two main forms of social withdrawal, social reticence and solitary-passive behavior, in early childhood were associated with adjustment in late childhood in Chinese children (75 boys and 92 girls). Data on reticent and solitary-passive behaviors were collected at 4 years of age from laboratory observations. Follow-up data on school, behavioral, and psychological adjustment were collected at 11 years of age from multiple sources. It was found that whereas reticent behavior mainly predicted later psychological problems such as loneliness and depression, solitary-passive behavior predicted later school incompetence and externalizing problems. The results suggest that reticence and solitary-passive behavior may represent distinct forms of withdrawal that play different roles in maladaptive development in Chinese context.

AB A growing number of studies indicate that posttraumatic cognitions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effects of posttraumatic cognitions on general psychopathology beyond PTSD remain unclear. The current study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the Child Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI-C) and to investigate the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and psychopathology. A community sample of 285 school-aged children and adolescents (aged 9-17, 160 [56.1 %] female) reported their trauma-related cognitions on the CPTCI-C and completed measures of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety. Parents reported their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. We validated a revised version of the CPTCI-C based on the results of confirmatory factor analyses. The resulting evidence suggests that this revised CPTCI-C possesses good internal consistency, fair 6-week temporal stability, and good concurrent validity. In addition to significant correlations between posttraumatic cognitions and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, after controlling for age, gender, and trauma types, both the revised CPTCI-C subscale scores conveyed unique contributions to psychological distress while only the maladaptive appraisals of the trauma remained weakly associated with externalizing problems. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that maladaptive appraisals of the trauma had a direct longitudinal impact on chronic PTSD severity. No mediation effect of posttraumatic cognitions on the relationship between acute and chronic PTSD activity was observed. The implications of our findings are discussed for the specificity of posttraumatic cognitions to posttraumatic internalizing psychopathology and cognitive interventions that target negative trauma-related cognitions.

AB Low self-esteem, lack of interoceptive awareness, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, weight teasing, and internalization of the societal body ideal are known to be associated with binge eating (BE) in adolescents. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate whether these attributes are BE-specific and whether different patterns exist for boys and girls. We assessed BE, internalizing symptoms and psychological factors in 1039 adolescents from a community sample by self-report. Using multinomial logistic regression and controlling for measured height and weight, we compared adolescents with BE with individuals from a healthy control group and adolescents reporting internalizing symptoms. Individuals from the BE-group reported a greater lack of interoceptive awareness and higher body dissatisfaction than individuals from the healthy control group. Additionally, we found a significant interaction between gender and body dissatisfaction. Internalization of the societal body ideal was related to BE when compared to internalizing symptoms. Results suggest, that the lack of interoceptive awareness and body dissatisfaction display substantial associations with BE, and that the latter effect is especially strong in boys. The internalization of societal standards of beauty emerged as a BE-specific factor and this finding emphasizes the role of the societal body ideal in the nature of eating pathology in boys and in girls. Increasing body satisfaction and the acceptance of realistic body ideals might be effective strategies in preventing eating pathology.

AB AimsPsychological comorbidity among children with functional incontinence is high: 20-30% of children with nocturnal enuresis (NE), 20-40% of those with daytime urinary incontinence (DUI) and 30-50% of those with fecal incontinence (FI) have clinically relevant comorbid disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze specific comorbid behavioral symptoms for different subtypes of incontinence in a large group of children.
   MethodsAll 1,001 consecutive children and adolescents (67.5% boys) with a mean age of 8.5 years presented at a tertiary outpatient department between 2004 and 2011 were examined with a full pediatric and child psychiatric assessment. Prevalence of different subforms of incontinence and associated behavioral symptoms were analyzed. The internalizing, externalizing, and total problem scores of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were evaluated.
   ResultsOf all children, 70.1% (702 children) had NE, 36.1% (361 children) had DUI, and 36.8% (368 children) were affected by FI. More than 43% of all children had clinically relevant psychological symptoms (CBCL total score, cut-off at 90th percentile). Children with non-retentive FI had highest rates of clinically relevant psychological symptoms (58.8%). Children with combined subtypes of incontinence (any combination of NE, DUI, and FI) were more affected by psychological comorbidities than children with isolated subtypes (NE or DUI or FI).
   ConclusionsChildren with incontinence have high rates of comorbid behavioral symptomsthree to six times higher than norms. Especially children with FI and combined subtypes of incontinence were affected. As behavioral symptoms and disorders will interfere with incontinence treatment, a general screening is recommended.

Longitudinal data were collected once a year from Grade 3 to Grade 6 (ages 9-12years) for 1,171 children from multiple sources. Shyness-sensitivity positively contributed to social, school, and psychological difficulties over time, with the most consistent effects on peer preference and loneliness. Social and school adjustment negatively contributed to the development of shyness-sensitivity. The initial levels of shyness-sensitivity and social and school adjustment moderated the growth of each other, mainly as a resource-potentiating factor. The results indicate the significance of shyness-sensitivity for adjustment and the role of adjustment in the development of shyness-sensitivity in today's urban Chinese society.

AB Objective: The outcome of institutional youth care for children is heavily debated. This multilevel meta-analysis aims to address the outcome of institutional youth care compared to non-institutional youth care for children of primary school age and early adolescence in economically developed countries. A gain of knowledge in this area may help the decision for referral of children to institutional youth care or other types of care (e.g., foster care or community-based care), and improve outcomes for children in youth care.
   Methods: Of 19 controlled studies (15.526 participants), 63 effect sizes of behaviour problems (externalizing, internalizing, and total), skills (social and cognitive) and delinquency were computed based on comparisons between institutional Evidence-Based Treatment (EBT), institutional Care As Usual (CAU), non-institutional EBT, and non-institutional CAU.
   Results: Institutional CAU showed a small-to-medium negative significant effect compared to non-institutional CAU (d = -0342). Furthermore, children in institutional care showed slightly more delinquent behaviour compared to children in non-institutional care (d = -0.329). Significant moderating effects were also found for study design, year of publication and sex of the child.
   Conclusions: Children receiving non-institutional CAU (mostly foster care) had slightly better outcomes than children in institutional CAU (regular group care). No differences were found between institutional and noninstitutional care when institutional treatment was evidence-based. More research is needed on the conditions that make established treatment methods work in institutional care for (young) children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to replicate a study by Caspi and colleagues, which proposed that the structure of psychopathology is characterized by a general psychopathology factor, in addition to smaller internalizing and externalizing factors. Our study expanded the approach of the original by using continuous adolescent data and testing additional models, including both self-and parent-reported data, to bolster the robustness of the findings. Our findings indicate that the structure of psychopathology is best characterized by a model including a general factor, in addition to smaller internalizing and externalizing factors. These results emphasize the importance of this model for understanding the structure of psychopathology. Given the increasing emphasis on the importance of, and need for, replication, the overall evidence of a general factor seems rather robust.

AB Individuals with the short variant of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene are more susceptible than individuals homozygous for the long allele to the effects of stressful life events on risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. We tested whether individual differences in coping style explained this increased risk for problem behavior among youth who were at both genetic and environmental risk. Participants included 279 children, ages 8-11, from the Children's Experiences and Development Study. Caregivers and teachers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and caregivers and children on children's exposure to harsh parenting and parental warmth in middle childhood, and traumatic events. Children reported how frequently they used various coping strategies. Results revealed that short/short homozygotes had higher levels of internalizing problems compared with long allele carriers and that short allele carriers had higher levels of externalizing problems compared with long/long homozygotes under conditions of high cumulative risk. Moreover, among children who were homozygous for the short allele, those who had more cumulative risk indicators less frequently used distraction coping strategies, which partly explained why they had higher levels of internalizing problems. Coping strategies did not significantly mediate Gene x Environment effects on externalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Numerous cross-sectional studies of school-age children have observed that exposure to manganese (Mn) adversely affects neurodevelopment. However, few prospective studies have looked at the effects of both prenatal and postnatal Mn exposure on child neurodevelopment.
   Methods: We measured Mn levels in prenatal and early postnatal dentine of shed teeth and examined their association with behavior, cognition, memory, and motor functioning in 248 children aged 7, 9, and/or 10.5 years living near agricultural fields treated with Mn-containing fungicides in California. We used generalized linear models and generalized additive models to test for linear and nonlinear associations, and generalized estimating equation models to assess longitudinal effects.
   Results: We observed that higher prenatal and early postnatal Mn levels in dentine of deciduous teeth were adversely associated with behavioral outcomes, namely internalizing, externalizing, and hyperactivity problems, in boys and girls at 7 and 10.5 years. In contrast, higher Mn levels in prenatal and postnatal dentine were associated with better memory abilities at ages 9 and 10.5, and better cognitive and motor outcomes at ages 7 and 10.5 years, among boys only. Higher prenatal dentine Mn levels were also associated with poorer visuospatial memory outcomes at 9 years and worse cognitive scores at 7 and 10.5 years in children with higher prenatal lead levels (>= 0.8 mu g/dL). All these associations were linear and were consistent with findings from longitudinal analyses.
   Conclusions: We observed that higher prenatal and early postnatal Mn levels measured in dentine of deciduous teeth, a novel biomarker that provides reliable information on the developmental timing of exposures to Mn, were associated with poorer behavioral outcomes in school-age boys and girls and better motor function, memory, and/or cognitive abilities in school-age boys. Additional research is needed to understand the inconsistencies in the neurodevelopmental findings across studies and the degree to which differences may be associated with different Mn exposure pathways and biomarkers.

AB IMPORTANCE Several widely held beliefs about child abuse and neglect may be incorrect. It is most commonly assumed that some forms of abuse (eg, physical and sexual abuse) are more harmful than others (eg, emotional abuse and neglect); other assumptions are that each form of abuse has specific consequences and that the effects of abuse differ across sex and race.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether widely held assumptions about child abuse and neglect are valid by testing the hypothesis that different types of child maltreatment (CM) actually have equivalent, broad, and universal effects.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study assessed 2292 racially and ethnically diverse boys (1254 [54.7%]) and girls (1038 [45.3%]) aged 5 to 13 years (mean [SD] age, 9.0 [2.0] years) who attended a research summer camp program for low-income, school-aged children from July 1, 1986, to August 15, 2012. Of these children, 1193 (52.1%) had a well-documented history of maltreatment. Analysis was conducted from September 25, 2013, to June 1, 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Various forms of internalizing and externalizing personality and psychopathologic traits were assessed using multiple informant ratings on the California Child Q-Set and Teacher Report Form as well as child self-reported depression and peer ratings of aggression and disruptive behavior.
   RESULTS Structural analysis showed that different forms of CM have equivalent psychiatric and behavioral effects, ranging from anxiety and depression to rule-breaking and aggression. We also found that nonsexual CM alters 2 broad vulnerability factors, internalizing (beta = 0.185; SE = 0.028; P <.001) and externalizing (beta = 0.283; SE = 0.023; P <.001), that underlie multiple forms of psychiatric and behavioral disturbance. We show that CM has comparable consequences for boys and girls of different races, and our results allowed us to describe a base rate and co-occurrence issue that makes it difficult to identify the unique effects of child sexual abuse.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings challenge widely held beliefs about how child abuse should be recognized and treated-a responsibility that often lies with the physician. Because different types of child abuse have equivalent, broad, and universal effects, effective treatments for maltreatment of any sort are likely to have comprehensive psychological benefits. Population-level prevention and intervention strategies should emphasize emotional abuse, which occurs with high frequency but is less punishable than other types of child maltreatment.

AB Internalizing, pathology is related to alterations in amygdala resting state functional connectivity, potentially implicating altered emotional reactivity and/or emotion regulation in the etiological pathway. Importantly, there is accumulating evidence that stress exposure and genetic vulnerability impact amygdala structure/function and risk for internalizing pathology. The present study examined whether early life stress and genetic profile scores (10 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 4 hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis genes: CRHRI VR3C2, NR3CL and FKBP5) predicted individual differences in amygdala functional connectivity in school-age children (9- to 14-year-olds; N = 120). Whole-brain regression analyses indicated that increasing genetic "risk" predicted alterations in amygdala connectivity to the caudate and postcontral gyms. Experience of more stressful and traumatic life events predicted weakened amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex connectivity. Genetic "risk" and stress exposure interacted to predict weakened connectivity between the amygdala and the inferior and middle frontal gyri, caudate, and parahippocampal gyms in those children with the greatest genetic and environmental risk load, Furthermore, amygdala connectivity longitudinally predicted anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation skills at a later :follow-up. Amygdala connectivity mediated effects of life stress on anxiety and of genetic variants on emotion regulation. The current results suggest that considering the unique and interacting effects of biological vulnerability and ens iromnental risk factors may be key to understanding the development of altered amygdala functional connectivity, a potential factor in the risk trajectory for internalizing pathology.

AB Studies of mental disorder comorbidity have produced an unsynthesized literature with multiple competing transdiagnostic models. The current study attempted to (a) integrate these models into an overarching comorbidity hierarchy, (b) link the resulting transdiagnostic factors to the bifactor model of psychopathology, and (c) investigate predictive validity of transdiagnostic factors for important future outcomes. A series of exploratory structural equation models (ESEMs) was conducted on 12 common mental disorders from a large, 2-wave nationally representative sample, using the bass-ackwards method to explore the hierarchical structure of transdiagnostic comorbidity factors. These Wave 1 factors were then linked with the bifactor model and with mental disorders at Wave 2. Results indicated that common mental disorder comorbidity was structured into an interpretable hierarchy. Connections between the hierarchy's general factor of psychopathology (denoted p), internalizing, and distress were very strong; these factors also linked strongly with the bifactor model's p factor. Predictive validity analyses prospectively predicting subsequent diagnoses indicated that, overall: (a) transdiagnostic factors outperformed disorder-specific variance; (b) within hierarchy levels, transdiagnostic factors where disorders optimally loaded outperformed other transdiagnostic factors, but this differed by disorder type; and (c) between hierarchy levels, transdiagnostic factors where disorders optimally loaded showed similar predictive validity. We discuss implications for hierarchical structure modeling, the integration of multiple competing comorbidity models, and benefits of transdiagnostic factors for understanding the continuity of mental disorders over time.

AB Purpose: The aims of this study were to examine whether the association between childhood adversities and educational attainment in young adulthood can be explained by mental health problems in adolescence and whether associations and pathways differ for boys and girls.
   Methods: Data were used of 2,230 participants from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a Dutch prospective cohort study with a 9-year follow-up. Childhood adversities were measured at age 11 years, mental health problems (i.e., externalizing, internalizing and attention problems with Youth Self-Report) at age 16 years, and educational attainment at age 19 years. Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data, overall and stratified by gender.
   Results: Only among boys, childhood adversities were associated with low educational attainment in young adulthood. Externalizing problems in adolescence explained 5% of the association between childhood adversities and educational attainment. Furthermore, for both boys and girls, externalizing problems in adolescence had a direct effect on educational attainment in young adulthood.
   Conclusions: Among boys, childhood adversities are associated with poorer educational outcomes of young adults. A part of this association runs via adolescent externalizing problems. The results suggest that boys, compared with girls, are less capable to cope with childhood adversities. Monitoring of exposed boys to childhood adversities is of utmost importance.

AB Purpose: Although extensive evidence indicates that being younger within a school cohort is associated with poorer academic functioning, much less is known about such relative age effects (RAEs) for mental health - the focus of the current investigation.
   Methods: Data from 23,379 11- to 13-year-olds attending state-maintained secondary schools in England were analyzed to investigate RAEs on mental health measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Participants were grouped into oldest, middle, and youngest thirds of their academic year based on their month of birth relative to their cohort. Hierarchical linear regression analysis evaluated RAEs and gender-or deprivation-related moderation of such effects.
   Results: Relatively younger adolescents had significantly more emotional symptoms and peer problems compared with relatively older individuals in a year group, although effect sizes were small. These effects were not moderated by gender or deprivation. Impact of mental health difficulties on other aspects of functioning was also greater among relatively younger children. Larger RAEs are observed in the younger cohort (11-12 years) compared with those in the 12- to 13-year-olds, thereby indicating that RAEs might attenuate with age.
   Conclusions: Being relatively younger than classmates is associated with increased internalizing symptoms, poorer peer relationships, and higher impact of mental health difficulties on functioning at school and home. The findings support wider inclusion of relative age in understanding mental health difficulties and its inclusion as a potential risk factor in studies investigating the development of psychopathology, especially for internalizing symptoms. Possible mechanisms of the effects detected are discussed. (C) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by high rates of comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders. One mechanistic account of these comorbidities is that ASD is characterized by impaired emotion regulation (ER) that results in deficits modulating emotional responses. We assessed neural activation during cognitive reappraisal of faces in high functioning adults with ASD. Groups did not differ in looking time, pupilometry, or subjective ratings of faces during reappraisal. However, instructions to increase positive and negative emotional responses resulted in less increase in nucleus accumbens and amygdala activations (respectively) in the ASD group, and both regulation instructions resulted in less change in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in the ASD group. Results suggest a potential mechanistic account of impaired ER in ASD.

AB Knowledge of how parents think about their children's misbehavior is important in understanding the behavioral and emotional problems of children. Relations between parent attributions for child misbehavior and child functioning were examined in a community sample of 163 two-parent families of 9-12-year-old boys and girls. Mother and father attributions were assessed along child-responsible and parent-causal dimensions. Both parent- and child-reported internalizing and externalizing problems were measured. Both mother and father child-responsible attributions predicted parent reports of both child internalizing and externalizing problems. For child self-reported functioning, mother parent-causal attributions negatively predicted child internalizing and externalizing problems, and father child-responsible attributions positively predicted child externalizing problems. The results highlight the importance of measuring different kinds of attributions by mothers and fathers, and of considering both parent and child views of child problems.

AB Previous evidence shows that acute stress changes both amygdala activity and its connectivity with a distributed brain network. Early life stress (ELS), especially emotional abuse (EA), is associated with altered reactivity to psychosocial stress in adulthood and moderates or even reverses the stress-attenuating effect of oxytocin (OXT). The neural underpinnings of the interaction between ELS and OXT remain unclear, though. Therefore, we here investigate the joint effect of ELS and OXT on transient changes in amygdala-centered functional connectivity induced by acute psychosocial stress, using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Psychophysiological interaction analysis in the placebo session revealed stress-induced increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, putamen, caudate and thalamus. Regression analysis showed that EA was positively associated with stress-induced changes in connectivity between amygdala and hippocampus. Moreover, hierarchical linear regression showed that this positive association between EA and stress-induced amygdala-hippocampal connectivity was moderated after the administration of intranasal OXT. Amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in the OXT session correlated negatively with cortisol stress responses. Our findings suggest that altered amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity during psychosocial stress may have a crucial role in the altered sensitivity to OXT effects in individuals who have experienced EA in their childhood.

AB Offspring of parents with chronic pain may be at risk for poorer outcomes than offspring of healthy parents. The objective of this research was to provide a comprehensive mixed-methods systematic synthesis of all available research on outcomes in offspring of parents with chronic pain. A systematic search was conducted for published articles in English examining pain, health, psychological, or family outcomes in offspring of parents with chronic pain. Fifty-nine eligible articles were identified (31 population-based, 25 clinical, 3 qualitative), including offspring from birth to adulthood and parents with varying chronic pain diagnoses (eg, mixed pain samples, arthritis). Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the results from population-based and clinical studies, while meta-ethnography was used to synthesize the results of qualitative studies. Increased pain complaints were found in offspring of mothers and of fathers with chronic pain and when both parents had chronic pain. Newborns of mothers with chronic pain were more likely to have adverse birth outcomes, including low birthweight, preterm delivery, caesarian section, intensive care admission, and mortality. Offspring of parents with chronic pain had greater externalizing and internalizing problems and poorer social competence and family outcomes. No significant differences were found on teacher-reported externalizing problems. The meta-ethnography identified 6 key concepts (developing independence, developing compassion, learning about health and coping, missing out, emotional health, and struggles communicating with parents). Across study designs, offspring of parents with chronic pain had poorer outcomes than other offspring, although the meta-ethnography noted some constructive impact of having a parent with chronic pain.

AB ObjectivesThis study aimed to examine whether respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)a physiological index of children's emotion regulationmoderates the relation between cancer diagnosis and internalizing problems in children.
   MethodsParticipants were twenty-two 7-12-year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 20 age-matched controls. RSA was calculated from cardiac interbeat interval using spectral time-series analysis. t-Scores on the Child Behavior Checklist Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, and Somatic Complaints subscales were computed.
   ResultsRespiratory sinus arrhythmia moderated the relation between diagnostic status and both child somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed symptoms. The positive association between diagnostic status and somatic complaints was significant for children with low RSA but not significant for children with high RSA. This association was also significant for withdrawn/depressed symptoms. Low RSA was associated with more somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed symptoms for children with cancer but not for control participants.
   ConclusionsChildren who have poor emotion regulation abilities may be more vulnerable to the range of stressors associated with the diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship of cancer. Behavioral interventions targeting emotion regulation skills may reduce internalizing symptoms in this population. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The NESARC, a "third-generation" psychiatric epidemiologic survey that integrated detailed measures of alcohol and drug use and problems has been the data source for over > 850 publications. A comprehensive review of NESARC findings and their implications is lacking.
   NESARC was a survey of 43,093 participants that covered alcohol, drug and psychiatric disorders, risk factors, and consequences. Wave 1 of the NESARC was conducted in 2001-2002. Three years later, Wave 2 follow-up re-interviews were conducted with 34,653 of the original participants. Scopus and Pubmed were used to search for NESARC papers, which were sorted into topic areas and summarized.
   The most common disorders were alcohol and posttraumatic stress disorders, and major depression. Females had more internalizing disorders and males had more externalizing disorders, although the preponderance of males with alcohol disorders (the "gender gap") was less pronounced than it was in previous decades. A race/ethnic "paradox" (lower risk among disadvantaged minorities than whites) remains unexplained. Younger participants had higher risk for substance and personality disorders, but not unipolar depressive or anxiety disorders. Psychiatric comorbidity was extensive and often formed latent trans-diagnostic domains. Since 1991-1992, risk for marijuana and prescription drug disorders increased, while smoking decreased, although smoking decreases were less pronounced among those with comorbidity. A nexus of comorbidity, social support, and stress predicted transitions in diagnostic status between Waves 1 and 2. Childhood maltreatment predicted psychopathology. Alcohol and drug use disorders were seldom treated; attitudinal barriers (little perceived need, perceived alcoholism stigma, pessimism about efficacy) were more important in predicting non-treatment than financial barriers.
   Understanding comorbidity and the effects of early stressors will require research incorporating biologic components, e.g., genetic variants and brain imaging. The lack of treatment for alcohol and drug disorders, predicted by attitudinal rather than financial variables, suggests an urgent need for public and professional education to reduce the stigma associated with these disorders and increase knowledge of treatment options.

AB Background/Context: In the United States, there has been an increased trend in parents' utilization of center-based child care. Yet, though research has examined the effects of attending prekindergarten center-based care or the effects of attending center-based care during the kindergarten school year, little is known about the effects of having attended both.
   Purpose/Objective: This study asks three questions: (a) Do children who attend both prekindergarten and kindergarten center-based care have different achievement outcomes, measured at the end of kindergarten? (b) Do children who attend both prekindergarten and kindergarten center-based care have different socioemotional outcomes, measured at the end of kindergarten? (c) Do these relationships differ by individual socio-demographic characteristics?
   Population/Participants: This study utilizes data from the newly released Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 2011 (ECLS-K:2011). The ELLS-K:2011 represents the most contemporary national-level data available to study the educational experiences of young students in the United States. Information was first collected from kindergartners (as well as parents, teachers, and school administrators) from U.S. kindergarten programs in the year 2010-2011.
   Research Design: This study combines secondary data analyses and quasi-experimental methods. There are two achievement outcomes: reading and math. There are five socioemotional outcomes: externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, self-control, approaches to learning, and interpersonal skills. The study begins with a baseline, linear regression model. To address issues pertaining to omitted variable bias, the study employs various fixed-effects models.
   Findings: The findings for the first research question indicated that academic outcomes do not differ for children in both years of center-based care compared to children who attended only one year of center-based care or none at all. As for the second research question, the findings show that multiple years of center-based care is related to increases in problem behaviors and decreases inprosocial behaviors-outcomes that are worsened by the number of years of center-based care attendance. The findings for the third research question suggest some minor differences between boys and girls in zero, one, or two years of center-based care.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This study has brought to surface new ways that center based care attendance might influence children's short-term outcomes. Therefore, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners must base future questions on empirical work concerning how to address children's outcomes across multiple years of care, rather than simply focus exclusively on one year's influence.

AB Sibling relationships have been described as love-hate relationships by virtue of their emotional intensity, but we know little about how sibling positivity and negativity operate together to affect youth adjustment. Accordingly, this study charted the course of sibling positivity and negativity from age 10 to 18 in African American sibling dyads and tested whether changes in relationship qualities were linked to changes in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Participants were consecutively-born siblings [at Time 1, older siblings averaged 14.03 (SD = 1.80) years of age, 48 % female; younger siblings averaged 10.39 (SD = 1.07) years of age, 52 % female] and two parents from 189 African American families. Data were collected via annual home interviews for 3 years. A series of multi-level models revealed that sibling positivity and sibling negativity declined across adolescence, with no significant differences by sibling dyad gender constellation. Controlling for age-related changes as well as time-varying parent-adolescent relationship qualities, changes in sibling negativity, but not positivity, were positively related to changes in adolescents' depressive symptoms and risky behaviors. Like parent-adolescent relationships, sibling relationships displayed some distancing across adolescence. Nevertheless, sibling negativity remained a uniquely important relational experience for African American adolescents' adjustment.

AB BackgroundChildren with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of mental health problems, which in turn are associated with poor glycemic control, diabetes-related complications, and long-term psychiatric morbidity. We tested the efficacy of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program in reducing or preventing mental health problems and improving glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes in a randomized controlled trial.
   MethodsParticipants were recruited from the Diabetes Clinic, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, and randomized to Triple P or standard diabetes care. The primary outcome was child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems 3 and 12 months postrandomization. Secondary outcomes were glycemic control, parent mental health, parenting skills, and family functioning at 3 and 12 months, and glycemic control at 24 months.
   ResultsA total of 76 participants were randomized (38 to intervention and 38 to control), 60 completed 3-month, and 57 completed 12-month assessments. Benefits of Triple P were evident at 3 months for parent mental health, parenting skills, and family functioning (p < 0.05), but not for child mental health or glycemic control, with little effect at 12 months. Prespecified subgroup analyses for children with pre-existing internalizing or externalizing behavior problems indicated greater improvements in child mental health, parent mental health, parenting skills, and diabetes family conflict (p < 0.05), but lower parenting self-efficacy at 3 months. Improvements in parent mental health and parenting competency associated with Triple P were sustained to 12 months for children with pre-existing mental health problems.
   ConclusionsThis study provides some support for the efficacy of Triple P in improving parent and family outcomes, and reducing child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems primarily in children who have pre-existing mental health problems.

AB The purpose of the study was to identify groups of adolescents based on their reported use of different coping strategies and compare levels of depression and anxiety symptoms across the groups. Tenth and eleventh grade public school students (N-982; 51% girls; 66% Caucasian; M age-16.04, SD-0.73) completed a battery of self-report measures that assessed their use of different coping strategies, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Latent profile analysis ([PA) classified the participants into four distinct groups based on their responses on subscales of the COPE inventoi:y (Carver el al_ 1989). Groups differed in amount of coping with participants in each group showing relative preference for engaging in certain strategies over others. Disengaged copers reported the lowest amounts of coping with a preference for avoidance strategies. Independent copers reported moderate levels of coping with relatively less use of support-seeking. Social support-seeking copers and active copers reported the highest levels of coping with a particular preference for support-seeking strategies. The independent copers reported the lowest levels of depressive symptoms compared to the three other groups. The Social Support Seeking and Active Coping Groups reported the highest levels of anxiety. Although distinct coping profiles were observed, findings showed that adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 engage in multiple coping strategies and are more likely to vary in their amount of coping than in their use of specific strategies.

AB Introduction: This study examined the effects of both paternal problem drinking and maternal problem drinking on adolescent internalizing problems (depression and anxiety symptomatology).
   Methods: Surveys were administered to 566 10th and 11th grade students from the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. in the spring of 2007 and again in the spring of 2008.
   Results: Although significant main effects were not observed, significant interactions were found between paternal problem drinking and maternal problem drinking for internalizing problems, especially for boys. In general, these interactions indicated that when paternal problem drinking was high, depression symptomatology and anxiety symptomatology were lower if maternal problem drinking was low.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study highlight the need to consider both paternal and maternal problem drinking when examining the effects that parental problem drinking may have on adolescent adjustment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Although research has documented robust prospective relationships between externalizing symptomatology and subsequent adolescent alcohol use, the extent to which internalizing symptoms such as anxiety may increase risk for alcohol consumption remains controversial. Recent evidence suggests that one possible reason for mixed findings is that separate dimensions of anxiety differentially confer risk for alcohol use. The present study tested two dimensions of anxiety, worry and physiological anxiety symptoms, as predictors of alcohol use and misuse in a longitudinal sample of juvenile offenders.
   Methods: Participants were 818 male juvenile offenders drawn from a larger multi-site, longitudinal study. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models estimated the influence of anxiety symptoms on typical drinking quantity, frequency of binge drinking, and alcohol dependence symptoms.
   Results: Results indicate that physiological anxiety and worry symptoms showed differential relations with alcohol use risk. Physiological anxiety was positively associated with increased risk for typical alcohol involvement, frequency of binge drinking, and alcohol dependence symptoms, whereas worry was negatively associated with all alcohol use outcomes.
   Conclusions: Current findings underscore the importance of considering anxiety as a multidimensional construct when examining the prospective relation between anxiety and adolescent alcohol use risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and gender inequalities in academic achievement have been widely reported in the US, but how these three axes of inequality intersect to determine academic and non-academic outcomes among school-aged children is not well understood. Using data from the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K; N = 10,115), we apply an intersectionality approach to examine inequalities across eighth-grade outcomes at the intersection of six racial/ethnic and gender groups (Latino girls and boys, Black girls and boys, and White girls and boys) and four classes of socioeconomic advantage/disadvantage. Results of mixture models show large inequalities in socioemotional outcomes (internalizing behavior, locus of control, and self-concept) across classes of advantage/disadvantage. Within classes of advantage/disadvantage, racial/ethnic and gender inequalities are predominantly found in the most advantaged class, where Black boys and girls, and Latina girls, underperform White boys in academic assessments, but not in socioemotional outcomes. In these latter outcomes, Black boys and girls perform better than White boys. Latino boys show small differences as compared to White boys, mainly in science assessments. The contrasting outcomes between racial/ethnic and gender minorities in self-assessment and socioemotional outcomes, as compared to standardized assessments, highlight the detrimental effect that intersecting racial/ethnic and gender discrimination have in patterning academic outcomes that predict success in adult life. Interventions to eliminate achievement gaps cannot fully succeed as long as social stratification caused by gender and racial discrimination is not addressed.

AB Research on co-rumination has investigated its relationship with internalizing symptoms, but few studies have addressed underlying maladaptive cognitive-affective processes that may play an important role in the maintenance of this relation. This study examines if Young's schema domains mediate the relation between co-rumination and depression in a community sample of non-clinical young adults. Participants completed the Co-Rumination Questionnaire, Young Schema Questionnaire-L3, and Teate Depression Inventory. Correlations and path analysis were calculated for the full sample and separately by gender. The schema domains of Overvigilance/Inhibition and Other-Directedness fully mediated the relation between co-rumination and depression. When analyses were performed separately for males and females, mediation persisted only for females. Findings suggest that among young women, co-rumination with a friend may be associated with depressive symptoms because of its activation of specific maladaptive cognitive schemas. Better understanding of the content and processes underpinning co-rumination may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of depression.

AB Love has been identified as one of the most important aspects of interpersonal strength. During adolescence, the main social contexts in relation to love are friendships and dating relationships. The aim of this study was to measure the link between romantic relationship experience and personal adjustment, taking into account effects of age and sex, and to analyse the effect of adolescent dating relationship quality on personal adjustment. A total of 3258 Spanish adolescents were surveyed. The results indicated that dating status does not affect adolescent self-esteem, but has a significant effect on internalizing and externalizing behaviours and sexist beliefs. Regarding relationship quality, those adolescents who had a very good-quality relationship reported higher levels of psychological adjustment in terms of the variables measured. Results are discussed according to their utility for positive social development and its links to dating relationship quality during adolescence.

AB Objective: The transgenerational transmission of mental disorders is one of the most prominent risk factors for the development of psychological disorders. Children of mentally ill parents are a vulnerable high risk group with overall impaired development and high rates of psychological disorders. To date there are only a few evidence based intervention programs for this group overall and hardly any in Germany. We translated the evidence based Family Talk Intervention by Beardslee (2009) and adapted it for groups. First results of this pilot study are presented.
   Method: This investigation evaluates a preventive group intervention for children of mentally ill parents. In a quasi-experimental design three groups are compared: an intervention group (Family Talk Intervention group: n = 28), a Wait Control group (n = 9), and a control group of healthy children (n = 40). Mean age of children was 10.41 years and parental disorders were mostly depressive/affective disorders (n = 30), but a small number also presented with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (n = 7).
   Results: Children of mentally ill parents showed higher rates of internalizing/externalizing disorders before and after the intervention compared to children of parents with no disorders. Post intervention children's knowledge on mental disorders was significantly enhanced in the Family Talk Intervention group compared to the Wait Control group and the healthy control group. Parental ratings of externalizing symptoms in the children were reduced to normal levels after the intervention in the Family Talk Intervention group, but not in the Wait Control group.
   Discussion: This pilot study of a group intervention for children of mentally ill parents highlights the importance of psycho-education on parental mental disorders for children. Long-term effects of children's enhanced knowledge about parental psychopathology need to be explored in future studies.

AB Children's anxiety for situations requiring mathematical problem solving, a concept referred to as math anxiety, has a unique and detrimental impact on concurrent and long-term mathematics achievement and life success. Little is known about the factors that contribute to the emergence of math anxiety. The current study builds on the hypothesis that math anxiety might reflect a maladaptive affect regulation mechanism that is characteristic for insecure attachment relationships. To test this hypothesis, 87 children primary school children (M-age = 10.34 years; SDage = 0.63) filled out questionnaires measuring insecure attachment and math anxiety. They all completed a timed and untimed standardized test of mathematics achievement. Our data revealed that individual differences in math anxiety were significantly related to insecure attachment, independent of age, sex, and IQ. Both tests of mathematics achievement were associated with insecure attachment and this effect was mediated by math anxiety. This study is the first to indicate that math anxiety might develop in the context of insecure parent child attachment relationships.

AB Research on psychopathology and experimental studies of sleep restriction support a relationship between sleep disruption and both internalizing and externalizing disorders. The objective of the current study was to extend this research by examining sleep, impulsivity, antisocial personality traits, and internalizing traits in a university sample. Three hundred and eighty six individuals (161 males) between the ages of 18 and 27 years (M = 18.59, SD = 0.98) wore actigraphs for 7 days and completed established measures of disorder-linked personality traits and sleep quality (i.e., Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). As expected, sleep measures and questionnaire scores fell within the normal range of values and sex differences in sleep and personality were consistent with previous research results. Similar to findings in predominantly male forensic psychiatric settings, higher levels of impulsivity predicted poorer subjective sleep quality in both women and men. Consistent with well-established associations between depression and sleep, higher levels of depression in both sexes predicted poorer subjective sleep quality. Bidirectional analyses showed that better sleep efficiency decreases depression. Finally, moderation analyses showed that gender does have a primary role in sleep efficiency and marginal effects were found. The observed relations between sleep and personality traits in a typical university sample add to converging evidence of the relationship between sleep and psychopathology and may inform our understanding of the development of psychopathology in young adulthood.

AB The role of disclosure on psychological well-being of adolescents with child sexual abuse experience was investigated in a subsample of 74 disclosers among 800 adolescents recruited in the community in Hong Kong. The results supported that CSA experiences have differential impact on adolescents' psychological well-being. Family characteristics of the disclosers accounted for only a small amount of the variance in an array of psychological well-being measures. CSA characteristics were robust predictors of disclosers' sexual eroticism and externalizing behavioral symptoms. Disclosers' cognitive appraisal of CSA experience and quality of parental attachment were strong predictors of their self-esteem and internalizing behavioral problems. After controlling for the aforementioned factors, negative disclosure experience still significantly predicted lower self-esteem, higher sexual anxiety, more internalizing behavior, and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder responses. Research to understand the factors that generate negative disclosure experiences is needed for developing effective intervention strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of disclosure.

AB The aim of this study was to examine unique contributions of different dimensions of students' temperament (self-control, positive affectivity and negative affectivity), students' emotional regulation, students' adjustment problems (the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms), and students' perception of parental behavior of their mothers and fathers (parental dimensions of emotionality, acceptance and rejection) in explaining their school success. The sample consisted of 553 students (275 girls and 278 boys) mean age of 13 years. By using hierarchical regression analysis, the results obtained in the subsample of boys revealed a significant and unique contribution of students' temperament, emotional regulation and parental behavior in explaining the variability of school success. Boys who are more prone to anger but are less fearful, who regulate their emotions effectively, and who perceive to be accepted by their mothers and fathers, have higher levels of school success. On the subsample of girls, only emotional regulation has a significant and positive contribution in the explanation of their school success; girls who regulate their emotions effectively have higher grades.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pediatric obesity commonly co-exists with emotional and behavioral disorders, while disturbed cortisol concentrations have been reported in both obese and chronically stressed individuals with anxiety and/or depression. We investigated the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems, reported by both parents and children, in a clinical population of obese children (OC) compared to normal-weight children. We examined the role of cortisol as a potential mediator between obesity and such problems. DESIGN: We compared 110 obese with 31 normal-weight children. The Greek version of the child behavior checklist (CBCL) and the youth self-report (YSR) were used and salivary cortisol was determined serially five times a day. RESULTS: T-scores of internalizing problems (anxiety/depression, social withdrawal, somatic complains) reported by both children (49.3 +/- 12.3 vs. 43.2 +/- 9.1) and mothers (60.6 +/- 11.3 vs. 50.6 +/- 10.4) were significantly higher (p=0.03 and p<0.001, respectively) in the obese than in the lean children. Externalizing problems (delinquency, rule-breaking behaviors) reported only by mothers were significantly higher in the OC (57.2 +/- 10.5 vs. 48.2 +/- 13.3, p=0.003). The cortisol area under the curve (AUC) was significantly smaller (p=0.03) in the OC than in the controls; however, a cortisol correlation with internalizing/externalizing symptoms was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems in a clinical population of OC. A mediation effect of cortisol in the relation between internalizing/externalizing problems and obesity could not be supported.

AB Over the past 20 years, resilience theory has attracted great attention from both researchers and mental health practitioners. Resilience is defined as a process of overcoming the negative effects of risk exposure, coping successfully with traumatic experiences, or avoiding the negative trajectories associated with risks. Three basic models of resilience have been proposed to account for the mechanism whereby promotive factors operate to alter the trajectory from risk exposure to negative consequences: compensatory model, protective model, and inoculation model. Assets and resources are two types of promotive factors found to be effective in decreasing internalizing and externalizing problems. Considering the protective or compensatory role of assets and resources in helping youth be resilient against negative effects of adversity, resilience could be applied to Chinese migrant and left-behind children who are at risk for internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g., delinquent behaviors, cigarette and alcohol use). Additionally, psychological suzhi-based interventions, a mental health construct for individuals that focuses on a strengths-based approach, can be integrated with resilience-based approach to develop more balanced programs for positive youth development.

DE Autism spectrum disorder; Nocturnal enuresis; Daytime urinary
   incontinence; Fecal incontinence; Lower urinary tract symptoms
ID URINARY-INCONTINENCE; BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT; INDIVIDUALS; SYMPTOMS
AB Introduction
   Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and incontinence (nocturnal enuresis (NE), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), fecal incontinence (FI)) are relevant disorders in childhood. In general, children with special needs such as intellectual disability (ID) or ASD are more often affected by incontinence than typically developing children.
   Objective
   In the few studies conducted on children with ASD, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have received more attention than NE, DUI and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of incontinence, LUTS and psychological symptoms/disorders in children with ASD compared to controls.
   Study design
   Forty children with ASD (12 children with infantile or childhood autism, 15 with atypical autism and 13 with Asperger's syndrome) (mean age 11.3 years) and 43 age-matched control children (mean age 10.7 years) were assessed. A questionnaire referring to incontinence and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Pediatric LUTS (ICIQ-CLUTS) were administered. Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18). Child psychiatric ICD-10 diagnoses were based on a structured psychiatric interview (Kinder-DIPS).
   Results
   Children with ASD showed increased rates of NE (30.0% vs 0%) and DUI (25.0% vs 4.7%) compared to controls. Among children with ASD, daytime bladder control (>= 5 years of age: 20.5% vs 0%) and bowel control (>= 4 years of age: 42.5% vs 7.5%) were delayed compared to controls. Children with ASD had a higher LUTS score. Additionally, children with ASD were more often affected by psychological symptoms and disorders. Rates of clinically relevant externalizing symptoms (32.5% vs 0%), internalizing symptoms (67.5% vs 9.3%) and total problem score (70.0% vs 2.1%) were higher in children with ASD than the controls (see table). Children with ASD had more ICD-10 diagnoses than the controls (47.5% vs 4.7%).
   Discussion
   The present study showed that children with ASD are more at risk of DUI and NE than healthy controls. In addition, children with ASD had more LUTS, especially urgency and postponement, and they needed a longer time to become dry and continent. Additionally, according to the parental CBCL questionnaire, children with ASD showed higher rates of clinically relevant psychological symptoms (externalizing and internalizing symptoms), and according to the psychiatric interview, they had higher rates of comorbid psychological disorders.
   Conclusion
   Autism spectrum disorder is an incapacitating disorder with significant impairment in social functioning. In most cases, psychological symptoms and disorders co-occur. Additionally, children with ASD are at a greater risk of being affected by different forms of incontinence and LUTS. Therefore, screening for incontinence and, if indicated, treatment of these disorders is recommended.

AB Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with self-injurious behavior, it is currently unclear what mechanisms may account for this relationship. Sleep disturbances may be relevant as they are common among those with PTSD and are associated with emotion regulation difficulties, which may increase vulnerability to self-injurious behavior. As such, we investigated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behaviors, and the mediating roles of nightmares and insomnia. Hypotheses were tested cross-sectionally in a sample of psychology clinic outpatients (N=255). Participants completed a structured clinical interview assessing PTSD and self-report questionnaires measuring insomnia, nightmares, and self-injurious behaviors (i.e., Have you ever cut, burned, or scratched yourself on purpose?). PTSD was associated with self-injurious behavior after covarying for depression, and nightmare severity mediated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behavior. Findings are consistent with research indicating that sleep disturbances, specifically nightmares, are important predictors of poor outcomes among those with PTSD, and extend this research to suggest their role in self-injurious behaviors as well.

AB Despite evidence documenting high prevalence of family accommodation in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder, examination in other pediatric anxiety disorders is limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that family accommodation is common amongst children with anxiety disorders; however, the impact on clinical presentation and functional impairment has not been addressed. This study assessed the nature and clinical correlates of family accommodation in pediatric anxiety, as well as validating a mechanistic model. Participants included 112 anxious youth and their parents who were administered a diagnostic clinical interview and measure of anxiety severity, as well as questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing symptoms, family accommodation and functional impairment. Some form of accommodation was present in all families. Family accommodation was associated with increased anxiety severity and externalizing behaviors, having a diagnosis of separation anxiety, and increased functional impairment. Family accommodation partially mediated the relationship between anxiety severity and functional impairment, as well as externalizing behaviors and functional impairment. Family accommodation is common in pediatric anxiety disorders, and is associated with more severe clinical presentations and functional impairment. These findings highlight the importance of parental involvement in treatment and the need to specifically target accommodation practices during interventions to mitigate negative outcomes in anxious youth. Further studies utilizing longitudinal data are needed to validate mechanistic models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between racial discrimination, parental functioning, and child adjustment is not well understood. The goal of the present study was to assess parental reports of discrimination in relation to depression and parenting practices, as well as on subsequent child internalizing and externalizing problems in low-income Black families. Data include a subsample of the Early Steps project, a multisite longitudinal study of financial and behaviorally at-risk families. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze our hypothesized model. Excellent model fit was established after removing externalizing problems from the model. As predicted, indirect associations were found from discrimination to parental depression, parenting, and child internalizing problems; and direct associations were found from discrimination to child internalizing problems. The results are consistent with findings suggesting that discrimination is negatively associated with adult well-being; moreover, contribute to the sparse literature on the effects of discrimination beyond the direct recipient. Finally, that parent discrimination was directly associated with child emotional problems suggests the continued need to address and treat discriminatory practices more generally.

AB Background: Trauma from witnessing events such as bombings and killings as well as direct victimization or participation in violence has been associated with psychosocial distress and poor mental health among war-exposed children and adolescents. This study examines the relationship between caregiver mental health and child internalizing (anxiety and depression) symptoms over a 4-year period in postconflict Sierra Leone. Methods: The sample included 118 adolescent Sierra Leonean youth (73% male; mean age = 16.5 years at Time 1) and their caregivers (40% male; mean age = 39.0 at Time 1). To measure depression and anxiety symptoms, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 was used with adults and the Oxford Measure of Psychosocial Adjustment - previously validated for use with children and adolescents in the region - was used to assess youth. A multivariate hierarchical linear model (HLM) for studying change within dyads was implemented to study covariation in internalizing symptoms among caregivers and youth over time; these models also included covariates at the individual, family and community levels. The relationship of caregiver mental health to child's internalizing was tested in a latent variable extension of the HLM. Results: The latent variable extension estimated that a one standard deviation (SD) change in caregiver anxiety/depression was associated with a.43 SD change in youth internalizing (p < .01) over the 4-year period. Family acceptance was negatively related to youth internalizing (p < .001), while community stigma was positively associated (p < .001). Conclusions: The findings highlight an important interplay between caregiver and child mental health within the postconflict setting and the need for psychosocial interventions to extend beyond the individual to account for family dynamics.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the implications of social anxiety symptoms in a community sample of elementary school children in mainland China. Method: Participants were N = 576 children (309 boys, 267 girls; mean age = 11.52 years, standard deviation = 1.21) attending public elementary schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Multisource assessments included child self-reports, teacher ratings, and school records. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses replicated the previously established 3-factor solution for the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised. Social anxiety symptoms were associated with indices of internalizing problems, peer difficulties, and poorer school adjustment. Conclusion: Results are discussed in terms of the implications of social avoidance as a particularly maladaptive component of social anxiety in the collectivistic society of China.

AB Objective To examine the rate of change in body mass index (BMI) percentile across 3 years in relation to emotion identification ability and brain-based reactivity in emotional processing regions.
   Study design A longitudinal sample of 202 youths completed 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging-based facial processing tasks and behavioral emotion differentiation tasks. We examined the rate of change in the youth's BMI percentile as a function of reactivity in emotional processing brain regions and behavioral emotion identification tasks using multilevel modeling.
   Results Lower correct identification of both happiness and sadness measured behaviorally predicted increases in BMI percentile across development, whereas higher correct identification of both happiness and sadness predicted decreases in BMI percentile, while controlling for children's pubertal status, sex, ethnicity, IQ score, exposure to antipsychotic medication, family income-to-needs ratio, and externalizing, internalizing, and depressive symptoms. Greater neural activation in emotional reactivity regions to sad faces also predicted increases in BMI percentile during development, also controlling for the aforementioned covariates.
   Conclusion Our findings provide longitudinal developmental data demonstrating links between both emotion identification ability and greater neural reactivity in emotional processing regions with trajectories of BMI percentiles across childhood.

ID UNITED-STATES; CRITERION VALIDITY; CBCL; TRF
AB Background: The Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL/6-18) is widely used to assess emotional and behavioral problems in children in the USA and Europe. Given that Indonesia has a more traditional culture that is different from the USA and Europe, it is possible that the CBCL is not effective in assessing the emotional and behavioral problems of Indonesian children, due to a difference in culture. Moreover, the validity and reliability of the Indonesian version of the CBCL/6-18 have not been tested. The purpose of this study was therefore to test the validity and reliability of the Indonesian version of the CBCL/6-18.
   Methods: Three hundred and eight mothers of children attending public primary schools participated in this study by completing the self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: All items of the CBCL were positively correlated with total score (0.15-0.59), and total problems score had high internal consistency (r=0.94). The correlations between questionnaire items and the eight subscales of the CBCL ranged from 0.10 to 0.74 and from 0.12 to 0.64 for the internalizing and externalizing scales, respectively (P<0.01). The eight subscales of the CBCL had good internal consistency (0.61-0.87).
   Conclusions: The CBCL/6-18 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure emotional and behavioral problems in Indonesian children aged 6-12 years.

AB This study investigated different environmental and contextual factors associated with maltreated children's adjustment in foster care. Participants included 83 children (52 boys), ages 1-7 years, and their foster caregivers. Quality of interaction with the foster caregiver was assessed from direct observation of a free-play situation; foster caregiver attachment state of mind and commitment toward the child were assessed using two interviews; disruptive behavior symptoms were reported by foster caregivers. Results showed that quality of interaction between foster caregivers and children were associated with behavior problems, such that higher-quality interactions were related to fewer externalizing and internalizing problems. Foster caregivers' state of mind and commitment were interrelated but not directly associated with behavior problems of foster children. Type of placement moderated the association between foster caregiver commitment and foster child behavior problems. Whereas greater foster caregiver commitment was associated with higher levels of adjustment for children in foster families (kin and non-kin), this was not the case in foster-to-adopt families. Finally, the associations between foster child behavior problems and history of maltreatment and placement related-risk conditions fell below significance after considering child age and quality of interaction with the foster caregiver. Findings underscore the crucial contribution of the foster caregiver child relationship to fostering child adjustment and, thereby, have important implications for clinical services offered to this population.

AB Background. Gender differences in the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have motivated the separate study of its risk factors and consequences in men and women. However, leveraging gender as a third variable to help account for the association between risk factors and consequences for AUD could elucidate etiological mechanisms and clinical outcomes.
   Method. Using data from a large, community sample followed longitudinally from 17 to 29 years of age, we tested for gender differences in psychosocial risk factors and consequences in adolescence and adulthood after controlling for gender differences in the base rates of AUD and psychosocial factors. Psychosocial factors included alcohol use, other drug use, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, deviant peer affiliation, family adversity, academic problems, attitudes and use of substances by a romantic partner, and adult socio-economic status.
   Results. At both ages of 17 and 29 years, mean levels of psychosocial risks and consequences were higher in men and those with AUD. However, the amount of risk exposure in adolescence was more predictive of AUD in women than men. By adulthood, AUD consequences were larger in women than men and internalizing risk had a stronger relationship with AUD in women at both ages.
   Conclusions. Despite higher mean levels of risk exposure in men overall, AUD appears to be a more severe disorder in women characterized by higher levels of adolescent risk factors and a greater magnitude of the AUD consequences among women than men. Furthermore, internalizing symptoms appear to be a gender-specific risk factor for AUD in women.

AB Affect integration was operationalized through the Affect Consciousness (AC) construct as degrees of awareness, tolerance, nonverbal expression and conceptual expression of 11 affects. These aspects are assessed through a semi-structured Affect Consciousness Interview (ACI) and separate rating scales (Affect Consciousness Scales (ACSs)) developed for use in research and clinical work with adults with psychopathological disorders. Age-adjusted changes were made in the interview and rating system. This study explored the applicability of the adjusted ACI to a sample of 11-year-old children with internalizing problems through examining inter-rater reliability of the adjusted ACI, along with relationships between the AC aspects and aspects of mental health as symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, social competence, besides general intelligence. Satisfactory inter-rater reliability was found, as well as consistent relationships between the AC aspects and the various aspects of mental health, a finding which coincides with previous research. The finding indicates that the attainment of the capacity to deal adaptively with affect is probably an important contributor to the development of adequate social competence and maybe in the prevention of psychopathology in children. The results indicate that the adjusted ACI and rating scales are useful tools in treatment planning with children at least from the age of 11 years.

AB ObjectiveDespite evidence of elevated risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behavior in youth with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders (CTD), few studies have actually examined that relationship. This study documented the frequency and clinical correlates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample of children and adolescents with CTD (N = 196, range 6-18 years old). The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the Centers for Disease Control.
   MethodYouth and parents completed a battery of measures that assessed co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, child emotional and behavioral symptoms, and impairment due to tics or co-occurring conditions.
   ResultsA structured diagnostic interview identified that 19 youths with CTD (9.7%) experienced suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors, which was elevated compared to 3 youths (3%) who experienced these thoughts in a community control sample (N = 100, range 6-18 years old, P = .03). For youth with CTD, suicidal thoughts and behaviors were frequently endorsed in the context of anger and frustration. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) anxious/depressed, withdrawn, social problems, thought problems, and aggressive behavior subscales, as well as the total internalizing problems scale, were associated with the presence of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors. Suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors were significantly associated with tic symptom severity; tic-related impairment; and obsessive-compulsive, depressive, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders' symptom severity. CBCL anxiety/depression scores mediated the relationship between tic severity and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest that about 1 in 10 youth with CTD experience suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors, which are associated with a more complex clinical presentation and often occur in the presence of anger and frustration. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: This study investigated the association between the religiosity of parents and pre-adolescents, and pre-adolescents' psychiatric problems.
   Method: In a clinic-referred cohort of 543 pre-adolescents at least once referred to a mental health outpatient clinic mental health problems were assessed using self-reports (Youth Self-Report; YSR), parent reports (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL), and teacher reports (Teacher's Report Form; TRF) of child behavioral and emotional problems. Paternal, maternal, and pre-adolescent religiosity were assessed by self-report. MANCOVAs were performed for internalizing and externalizing problems as dependent variables, with maternal religiosity, paternal religiosity, pre-adolescent religiosity, parental religious harmony, and gender as independent variables, and socioeconomic status and divorce as covariates.
   Results: Internalizing problems. Pre-adolescents of actively religious mothers had more internalizing symptoms than pre-adolescents of nonreligious mothers. Harmony and gender did not significantly affect the association between maternal religiosity and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems. No associations between religiosity of pre-adolescents, religiosity of mothers, religiosity of fathers and/or harmony of parents and externalizing problem behavior have been found.
   Discussion and conclusions: Overall, associations between mental health and religiosity were modest to absent. Results are discussed in the context of a clinic-referred cohort, the quest phase of internalizing religious beliefs and role modeling of parents. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB IMPORTANCE Early adversity is an important risk factor that relates to internalizing symptoms and altered brain structure.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the direct effects of early adversity and child internalizing symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety) on cortical gray matter (GM) volume, as well as the extent to which early adversity associates with variation in cortical GM volume indirectly via increased levels of internalizing symptoms.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective investigation of associations between adversity within the first 6 years of life, internalizing symptoms during childhood and early adolescence, and altered brain structure in late adolescence (age, 18-21 years) was conducted in a community-based birth cohort in England (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children). Participants from the cohort included 494 mother-son pairs monitored since the mothers were pregnant (estimated date of delivery between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992). Data collection for the present study was conducted between April 1, 1991, and November 30, 2010; the neuroimaging data were collected between September 1, 2010, and November 30, 2012, and data analyses for the present study occurred between January 25, 2013, and February 15, 2015. Risk factors were adversity within the first 6 years of the child's life (including prenatal exposure) and the child's internalizing symptoms between age 7 and 13 years.
   EXPOSURES Early childhood adversity.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression measured through T1-weighted magnetic resonance images collected in late adolescence.
   RESULTS Among 494 young men included in this analysis, early adversity was directly associated with lower GM volumes in the anterior cingulate cortex (beta = -.18; P = .01) and higher GM volume in the precuneus (beta = .18; P = .009). Childhood internalizing symptoms were associated with lower GM volume in the right superior frontal gyrus (beta = -.20; P = .002). Early adversity was also associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms (beta = .37; P < .001), which, in turn, were associated with lower superior frontal gyrus volume (ie, an indirect effect) (beta = -.08; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.01; P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adversity early in life was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms as well as with altered brain structure. Early adversity was related to variation in brain structure both directly and via increased levels of internalizing symptoms. These findings may suggest that some of the structural variation often attributed to depression might be associated with early adversity in addition to the effect of depression.

AB Objective: Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early developing trait associated with cautiousness and development of clinical depression and anxiety. Little is known about the neural basis of BI and its predictive importance concerning risk for internalizing disorders. We looked at functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), given their respective roles in self-relational and threat processing, in the risk for internalizing disorders, with an emphasis on determining the functional significance of these networks for BI.
   Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR; n = 18) for developing clinical depression and/or anxiety. Whole-brain DMN and SN functional connectivity were estimated for each participant and compared across groups. We also compared the LR and HR groups on levels of BI and anxiety, and incorporated these data into follow-up neurobehavioral correlation analyses.
   Results: The HR group, relative to the LR group, showed significantly decreased DMN connectivity with the ventral striatum and bilateral sensorimotor cortices. Within the HR group, trait BI increased as DMN connectivity with the ventral striatum and sensorimotor cortex decreased. The HR and LR groups did not differ with respect to SN connectivity.
   Conclusion: Our findings show, in the risk for internalizing disorders, a negative functional relation between brain regions supporting self-relational processes and reward prediction. These findings represent a potential neural substrate for behavioral inhibition in the risk for clinical depression and anxiety.

AB Objective: Several studies have documented a range of adjustment problems experienced by peer victimized adolescents, however there has been less research exploring potential sources of support that may offset the negative impact of victimization. The current study explored the association among peer victimization, adjustment problems, connectedness, and parent engagement with the goal of identifying buffers of the associations between physical and relational victimization and adolescents' adjustment problems. Method: Students' (N = 28,104) from 58 high schools self-reported experiences of peer victimization. Self-report measures also assessed connectedness (student connectedness, teacher connectedness), parent engagement, and adjustment problems (internalizing problems, sleep problems, stress problems). Results: Regression analyses indicated that both forms of victimization were associated with adjustment problems across all grades, genders, and races. Interpersonal connectedness was associated with fewer adjustment problems. Despite several statistically significant interactions involving victimization and connection, only 2 interactions demonstrated buffering effects. Specifically, student connectedness was found to attenuate internalizing problems among relationally victimized girls, whereas parent engagement was associated with reduced internalizing problems among relationally victimized boys. Conclusions: Study findings highlight the potential protective influences of connection and parent engagement in the transactional relationship between victimization and adjustment problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the mediational effects of dysfunctional beliefs and difficulties in emotional regulation on children's perception of interparental conflict and subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems. The participants in this study were 335 fifth grade elementary school students in Korea. We hypothesized that the association between children's perceived parental conflict and their internalizing and externalizing problems is mediated by dysfunctional beliefs and difficulty in emotional regulation. The hypothesized model was tested by structural equation modeling (SEM). The hypothesis was supported, and we concluded that children's perceived parental conflict affects children's internalizing problems through dysfunctional beliefs and difficulties in emotional regulation. However, the bootstrap results indicate that the direct path between parental conflict and externalizing problems is not significant, which suggests full mediation of dysfunctional belief in the association between parental conflict and externalizing problems, while dysfunctional belief partially mediated the association between parental conflict and internalizing problems.

AB Using data from the longitudinal Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, the aims of the current study were to examine associations between postnatal maternal heavy alcohol use and toddler behavior problems, taking both observed and unobserved confounding factors into account by employing fixed effects regression models. Postnatal maternal heavy alcohol use (defined as drinking alcohol 4 or more times a week, or drinking 7 units or more per alcohol use episode) and toddler internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were assessed when the toddlers were aged 18 and 36 months. Maternal psychopathology, civil status and negative life events last year were included as time-variant covariates. Maternal heavy alcohol use was associated with toddler internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (p < 0.001) in the population when examined with generalized estimating equation models. The associations disappeared when observed and unobserved sources of confounding were taken into account in the fixed effects models [(p = 0.909 for externalizing behaviors (b = 0.002, SE = 0.021), p = 0.928 for internalizing behaviors (b = 0.002, SE = 0.023)], with an even further reduction of the estimates with the inclusion of time-variant confounders. No causal effect was found between postnatal maternal heavy alcohol use and toddler behavior problems. Increased levels of behavior problems among toddlers of heavy drinking mothers should therefore be attributed to other adverse characteristics associated with these mothers, toddlers and families. This should be taken into account when interventions aimed at at-risk families identified by maternal heavy alcohol use are planned and conducted.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is used to measure psychopathological symptoms in children and adolescents from 4 to 17 years old, but its underlying structure is still a matter of debate. Indeed, on the basis of a systematic review of English and non-English articles conducted using multiple databases, 54 studies reporting on the factor structure of the SDQ were located. The original 5 first-order factor structure is generally supported by exploratory procedures, but support based on confirmatory factor analyses is not clear. We analysed data from 889 youths from the general French population, rated on the SDQ by their teachers. We tested the original model, hierarchical models and bifactor models. The best-fitting model is a bifactor model with the five a priori factors grouped in two global factors (Externalizing Disorders-Hyperactivity and Conduct-and Internalizing Disorders-Peer relationships and Emotions) and one Strength/Prosocial factor. However, we show that the Conduct-Specific factor should not be used in practice in its current state, that the Hyperactivity-Specific factor mainly covers hyperactivity rather than inattention, and that the Peer Problems-Specific factor mainly reflects a preference for solitude. Nevertheless, the measurement model proved to be fully invariant across gender and school levels (kindergarten, primary and secondary schools), with statistically significant differences in latent means between genders only. Beyond computing the five a priori scores when using the teacher ratings of the SDQ, our results prove the usefulness of computing Externalizing Disorders and Internalizing Disorders global scores.

AB Nonlinear measures can capture the complex structure of the heart beating, and recordings taken while the individual performs daily activities may help to understand the cardiac system's output in natural conditions. As healthy systems are characterized by having highly complex outputs, we hypothesized that the cardiac output from high anxious adolescents should be less complex than the output from their low anxious counterparts. In this study ECG was recorded for two hours in 50 adolescents while they performed regular school activities. Fractal dimension (FD), scaling exponents and multiscale entropy were calculated on the interbeat intervals time series. Both FD and entropy were significantly lower in the high-anxious group than the low-anxious group. These results suggest different heart-related regulation in adolescents who suffered from high anxious symptomatology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study sought to examine the association of mental disorders with educational attainment in a community sample.
   Data were from 5001 respondents aged 15-54 in the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), re-interviewed in the 2001-2003 NCS follow-up (NCS-2). Discrete-time survival analysis was used to examine the association of disorders present at baseline (NCS) or having first onset after the baseline (assessed in NCS-2) with educational outcomes among 3954 eligible respondents. Mental disorders were categorized into internalizing fear disorders (simple phobia, social phobia, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia and agoraphobia without panic disorder), internalizing anxiety-misery disorders (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder), externalizing disorders (alcohol and drug use disorders, conduct disorder) and bipolar disorder. Analyses were conducted separately in students and non-students at baseline.
   Among students, baseline bipolar and externalizing disorders, as well as fear, anxiety-misery and externalizing disorders with onset after baseline were associated with lower odds of high school graduation; baseline anxiety-misery disorders with lower odds of going to college; and baseline externalizing disorders and bipolar disorder with onset after baseline with lower odds of college graduation. Among non-students, baseline fear disorders were associated with lower odds of high school graduation and bipolar disorder with lower odds of going to college. Assuming that the regression coefficients represent causal effects, mental disorders accounted for 5.8-11.0 % of high school and 3.2-11.4 % of college non-completion.
   Expanding access to mental health services for youth might have a net positive societal value by helping to prevent some of these adverse educational outcomes.

AB Exposure to childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is associated with elevated rates of mental disorders, sexual risk behavior, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in adulthood. Mental disorders themselves are associated with an increased risk for HIV/AIDs and STIs as well, and thus may mediate the association between CSA and HIV/AIDS and other STIs. The links among CSA, disorders, and STIs are unclear, however. The current study tested the hypothesis that the association of CSA with STIs is mediated by adult transdiagnostic psychopathology. We examined the potential mediating role of transdiagnostic psychopathology factors internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT)-in the association between CSA and receiving a past-year diagnosis of HIV, AIDS, or another STI in a large, national probability sample of adults (N = 34,653). Using indirect effects modeling, we found that 54.4% of the association between CSA and subsequent HIV/AIDS/STI diagnosis operated through transdiagnostic psychopathology. The proposed mediation model was supported, indicating that individuals reporting CSA had higher estimated levels of latent general liabilities for INT and EXT disorders, and it was largely these liabilities that accounted for the link between CSA and heightened risk of adult HIV, AIDS, and STI diagnoses.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether intervention effects of FRIENDS for Life, a school-based prevention program for children with anxiety or depression symptoms, were maintained over a period of 12 months after the intervention in a naturalistic setting.
   Methods. We used a quasi-experimental design, with 339 children in the intervention group and 157 in the control group (aged 8-13 years) in schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We collected self-, teacher, and peer reports of anxiety and depression scores before and after intervention, and 6 and 12 months after intervention, from 2010 to 2012.
   Results. Intervention-group children reported a continuing and significant decrease in anxiety and depression scores compared with the control group. Twelve months after the intervention, participants' anxiety and depression levels were comparable to those of the general population. Girls reported a stronger decrease in anxiety scores than did boys. Teacher reports suggested no effects. Although classmates reported increased internalizing problems in intervention-group children immediately after intervention, these effects disappeared over time.
   Conclusions. FRIENDS for Life, an indicated prevention program, yielded long-lasting and continuing reduction in anxiety and depression problems when implemented in daily school practice.

AB This study examined functional outcomes for children with ADHD by comorbidity status. Children with ADHD (5-13 years) were recruited from 21 pediatric practices and followed up 12 months later (n = 199). Parent and teacher-reported baseline and 12 month surveys measured peer problems, daily functioning, quality of life (QoL), parent mental health, and family QoL. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children IV assessed mental health comorbidities at baseline. Linear regression models were conducted, adjusting for socio-demographics, ADHD severity, and baseline functioning (where possible). In adjusted analyses, children with ADHD and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities had poorer QoL, greater peer problems, and poorer family QoL, compared to children with ADHD alone. The parents of children with ADHD and internalizing and externalizing comorbidities alone, also reported poorer family QoL, compared to children with ADHD alone. Children with ADHD and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities appear particularly vulnerable to poorer functioning.

AB When a child must be removed from the family home, placement with a relative is often sought because kinship care is the least restrictive and most family-like out-of-home placement. Although kinship care has become a preferred option in most U.S. child welfare systems, this preference is often based on "soft evidence" rather than rigorous evaluation of the risks and benefits of kinship care. Therefore, an evaluation of the impact of kinship care on child behavioral problems is needed to guide child welfare practice and policy. In addition, given that children of different ages and in different developmental stages are likely to have varying placement experiences, the evaluation of kinship care should explore the effect of kinship care on child behavioral problems across age groups. To fill these knowledge gaps, we compare the behavioral problems of 584 children in kinship care with those of 470 children in non-kinship care. Moreover, we examine the impact of kinship care on behavioral problems in 2 age groups: younger children (0 to 5 years) and older children (6 to 17.5 years). The analysis uses data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing, and applies propensity score methods to account for selection bias. Results show that older children in kinship care had significant lower levels of externalizing, internalizing, and total behavior problems. However, for younger children, the effects of kinship care on child behavioral problems did not reach statistical significance. The implications for practice, research and policy are discussed.

AB This study aimed to determine the feasibility of translating cognitive behavioral therapy for anxious youth to rural-community settings via tele-psychiatry training. A 20-week group-supervision training program was delivered to ten different groups from different agencies within Northern Ontario. Each group consisted of four to nine clinicians with child therapy background not specific to CBT (n = 78, 51 % social workers, 49 % other mental health disciplines). Clinicians were each required to treat an anxious youth under supervision. Changes in clinician knowledge and youth internalizing symptoms were measured. Northern Ontario clinicians showed significant gains on a child CBT-related knowledge test (t ((1, 52)) = -4.6, p < .001). Although youth treated by these clinicians showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, possible response bias and the lack of a comparison group mandate further studies before generalizing our findings. Nevertheless, training local therapists in anxiety-focused CBT for children via a group supervision based tele-psychiatry model appears to be a feasible and well-received approach to knowledge translation to rural settings.

AB Research conducted in Western cultures such as the United States has shown that shyness is a risk factor in development. Much less is known, however, about the role of shyness during emerging adulthood in China. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between shyness and internalizing (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, and self-harm) and externalizing (e.g., drinking, smoking, and illicit drugs) behaviors in emerging adults in China. Participants included 616 undergraduate students (368 men and 248 women). Results revealed that shyness was positively associated with higher levels of internalizing problems.

AB Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting compound. Several experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that gestational BPA exposure can lead to neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems in early-life, but results have been inconsistent. We previously reported that prenatal BPA exposure may affect child behavior and differently among boys and girls at ages 3-5 years.
   Objectives: We investigated the association of prenatal and early childhood BPA exposure with behavioral outcomes in 7-9 year old minority children and hypothesized that we would observe the same sex-specific pattern observed at earlier ages.
   Methods: African-American and Dominican women enrolled in an inner-city prospective cohort study and their children were followed from mother's pregnancy through children's age 7-9 years. Women during the third trimester of pregnancy and children at ages 3 and 5 years provided spot urine samples. BPA exposure was categorized by tertiles of BPA urinary concentrations. The Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) was administered at ages 7 and 9 to assess multiple child behavior domains. Associations between behavior and prenatal (maternal) BPA concentrations and behavior and postnatal (child) BPA concentration were assessed via Poisson regression in models stratified by sex. These models accounted for potential confounders including prenatal or postnatal urinary BPA concentrations, child age at CBCL assessment, ethnicity, gestational age, maternal intelligence, maternal education and demoralization, quality of child's home environment, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and prenatal mono-n-butyl phthalate concentration.
   Results: The direction of the associations differed between boys and girls. Among boys (n=115), high prenatal BPA concentration (upper tertile vs. lower two tertiles) was associated with increased internalizing (beta=0.41, p < 0.0001) and externalizing composite scores (beta=0.40, p < 0.0001) and with their corresponding individual syndrome scales. There was a general decrease in scores among girls that was significant for the internalizing composite score (beta= -0.17, p=0.04) (n=135). After accounting for possible selection bias, the results remained consistent for boys. Conversely, high postnatal BPA concentration was associated with increased behaviors on both the internalizing composite (beta=0.30, p=0.0002) and externalizing composite scores (beta=0.33, p < 0.0001) and individual subscores in girls but fewer symptoms in boys. These results remained significant in girls after accounting for selection bias.
   Conclusion: These results suggest BPA exposure may affect childhood behavioral outcomes in a sex-specific manner and differently depending on timing of exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Peer victimization is a common and pervasive experience in childhood and adolescence and is associated with various maladjustment symptoms, including internalizing, externalizing, and somatic problems. This variety suggests that peer victimization is multifinal where exposure to the same risk leads to different outcomes. However, very little is known about the relative likelihood of each form of maladjustment. We used a latent profile approach to capture multiple possible outcomes and examined prediction by peer victimization. We also examined the role of peer victimization with regard to stability and change in maladjustment. Maladjustment symptoms and peer victimization were assessed from the participants of the large cohort study TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey in early and mid-adolescence. Latent profile and latent transition analyses were conducted to examine associations between victimization and maladjustment profile and to test the role of victimization in maladjustment profile transitions. Four maladjustment profiles were identified for early adolescence (Low, Internalizing, Externalizing, Comorbid) and three profiles (Low, Internalizing, Externalizing) were identified for mid-adolescence. Internalizing problems were more likely in victimized adolescents than low symptom levels or externalizing problems. Victimized adolescents were at greater risk to develop internalizing problems between early and mid-adolescence than non-victimized adolescents. Peer victimization is multifinal mostly when outcomes are examined separately. If multiple outcomes are tested simultaneously, internalizing problems seem to be the most likely outcome.

AB Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to encompass the full range of neurobehavioral and cognitive dysfunction that may occur as a consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure. There is relatively little research on intervention strategies that specifically target the behavioral problems of children with FASD. Availability and access to services are barriers to timely and effective care for families. The Strongest Families FASD intervention was recently adapted from the Strongest Families "Parenting the Active Child" program to include FASD-specific content delivered via an Internet-based application in conjunction with 11 telephone coaching sessions.
   Objective: Our objectives are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of Strongest Families FASD in reducing externalizing problems (primary outcome), internalizing problems, and parent distress (secondary outcomes) in children aged between 4 and 12 years diagnosed with FASD when compared to a control group with access to a static resource Web page; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of Strongest Families FASD in improving social competence (secondary outcome) in school-aged children aged between 6 and 12 diagnosed with FASD when compared with an online psychoeducation control; and (3) explore parental satisfaction with the Strongest Families FASD online parenting program.
   Methods: Parents and caregivers (N=200) of children diagnosed with FASD who have significant behavioral challenges, ages 4-12, are being recruited into a 2-arm randomized trial. The trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based Strongest Families FASD parenting intervention on child behavior and caregiver distress, compared to a control group receiving access to a static resource Web page (ie, a list of FASD-specific websites, readings, videos, and organizations).
   Results: The primary outcome will be externalizing problems measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Secondary outcomes include (1) internalizing problems and (2) social competence, both measured by the CBCL; and (3) parental distress measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Satisfaction Survey are completed by the intervention group at the end of session 11. Results will be reported using the standards set out in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement.
   Conclusions: It is hypothesized that the Strongest Families FASD intervention group will improve child behavior and parental distress. Caregiver satisfaction is anticipated to be positive. Advancing evidence on the effectiveness and acceptance of distance services can inform policy and adoption of eHealth programs.

AB An integration of family systems perspectives with developmental psychopathology provides a framework for examining the complex interplay between family processes and developmental trajectories of child psychopathology over time. In a community sample of 98 families, we investigated the evolution of family relationships, across multiple subsystems of the family (i.e., interparental, mother-child, father-child), and the impact of these changing family dynamics on developmental trajectories of child internalizing symptoms over 6 years, from preschool age to pre-adolescence. Parent-child relationship quality was observed during lengthy sessions, consisting of multiple naturalistic, carefully scripted contexts. Each parent completed reports about interparental relationship satisfaction and child internalizing symptoms. To the extent that mothers experienced a steeper decline in interparental relationship satisfaction over time, children developed internalizing symptoms at a faster rate. Further, symptoms escalated at a faster rate to the extent that negative mother-child relationship quality increased (more negative affect expressed by both mother and child, greater maternal power assertion) and positive mother-child relationship quality decreased (less positive affect expressed by both mother and child, less warmth and positive reciprocity). Time-lagged growth curve analyses established temporal precedence such that decline in family relationships preceded escalation in child internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that family dysfunction, across multiple subsystems, represents a driving force in the progression of child internalizing symptoms.

AB The main aim of the present study was to examine state levels of loneliness in adolescence. Both concurrent associations and temporal dynamics between social contexts and state levels of loneliness were examined. Data were collected from 286 adolescents (M-age = 14.19 years, 59% girls) by using the Experience Sampling Method. Results showed that adolescents had higher levels of state loneliness when they were alone, compared with being with company. When adolescents were with others, they were most lonely at school and with classmates. Adolescents showed a relief effect when they entered the company of friends after being alone, whereas a spillover effect of solitude was found when adolescents entered the company of family after being alone. Our findings show the dynamics of state loneliness, in that being with classmates increases state loneliness, whereas being with friends reduces loneliness after being alone.

AB Prior research has documented negative, concurrent relations between internalizing symptomatology and academic achievement among adolescents. The present study provided the first rigorous, longitudinal examination of the bi-directional, prospective relations between adolescent internalizing symptomatology and academic achievement. One hundred and thirty adolescents reported depression and anxiety annually from 6th through 10th grades, and GPA records were obtained annually from schools. Results showed that (a) high depression and anxiety at the beginning of a school year predicted lower GPA during that school year, and (b) low GPA in any school year predicted higher depression and anxiety at the beginning of the following school year.

ID BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS; DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; SAMPLE
AB Our purpose was to determine the effects of gender and age on Kosovar YSR scores and the prevalence of self-reported behavioral/emotional problems in Kosovar adolescents based on scores above a cutpoint.
   Participants were 1351 adolescents recruited from secondary schools in seven regions of Kosova who completed the Youth Self-Report.
   The oldest adolescents had the highest scores on many YSR scales. Although Kosova's mean problems scores were not elevated relative to international norms, the percentage of adolescents scoring in the deviant range (borderline + clinical) was much higher than expected for almost all YSR problem scales, including Total Problems (31.2 %), Internalizing (40.8 %), and Externalizing (23.4 %). The 23 % prevalence of elevated scores on Stress Problems was triple the expected 7 % prevalence based on a 93rd percentile cutpoint.
   Results revealed much higher prevalence of psychopathology than would be expected based on international norms, with 25-40 % of Kosovar adolescents scoring in the deviant range on YSR scales, Thus, our research indicates a need for expanding psychiatry services to meet the pressing mental health needs of Kosovar adolescents as well as the importance of considering mental health problems in their social context.

AB Objective. To evaluate the frequency of use and relevance of health-related Internet (HRI) sites and online peer support groups and their association with demographic, disease-related and psychosocial variables in young people with JIA.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, 176 young people (10-27 years of age) with JIA were asked to complete a questionnaire. The frequency of using HRI sites (regarding information, medication use and aspects of JIA relating to social life), online peer contact and perceived relevance of HRI sites and online peer communication were determined. Associations with demographic variables, disease activity, medication, emotional behaviour and coping were also examined.
   Results. Seventy-one per cent of the 142 respondents had used the Internet to search for general information on JIA, but specific topics, such as medication, were searched for less often. Twenty-five per cent of respondents had visited a forum or had contacted peers online. The perceived relevance of HRI sites and online peer contact was rated low (median 2.0 and 1.0, respectively; scale 0-10). Apart from female gender (P<0.01), none of the demographic and disease-related factors were associated with HRI site use. Coping styles, confrontation and reassuring thoughts were associated with increased HRI site use, but only in males. Internalizing and externalizing problem behaviour were not significantly associated.
   Conclusion. The frequency of HRI site use among young people with JIA was less than expected and was considered of low relevance. HRI sites in their present form cannot replace traditional information as an additional source to increase knowledge.

AB Objective/Background: This study aimed to examine the relationship between sleep problems and working memory in children aged 5-13 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Patients/Methods: Children with ADHD were recruited into a randomized controlled trial from 21 paediatric practices in VIC, Australia. Cross-sectional data for intervention and control children were pooled at 6 months post randomization for the current analyses (n = 189). Children who met the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD and had a parent-reported moderate/severe sleep problem that fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a behavioural sleep disorder were recruited into the study. Sleep was assessed by detailed parent (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) and self-reports (Self-Sleep Report). Working memory was measured using the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (low and very low working memory defined as <25th and <10th percentiles, respectively). Analyses were adjusted for child age and gender, internalizing and externalizing comorbidities, and socio-economic status.
   Results: Self-reported sleep problem severity was associated with poorer working memory; for each standard deviation increase in self-reported sleep problems, working memory scores decreased by -3.8 points (95% confidence interval (CI): -6.7, -0.8; p = 0.01). There was some evidence that self-reported sleep problems were associated with low (p = 0.06) and very low working memory (p = 0.01). There was minimal evidence that parent-reported sleep problems were associated with poorer working memory with the exception of bedtime resistance problems.
   Conclusions: Behavioural sleep problems and working memory are associated in children with ADHD, particularly when sleep is assessed by self-report. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of callous-unemotional (CU) traits delineates a subgroup of youth with severe antisocial behavior. However, debate surrounds the best method to assess CU traits. This study examined the factor structure of the parent-reported Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) among high-risk 9-year-olds (N = 540) and its predictive validity over 1 year. Confirmatory factor analysis showed support for a three-factor bifactor model and revised two-factor model using a shortened ICU. Within a three-factor bifactor framework the general CU traits factor and specific uncaring factor scores were related to higher externalizing and lower internalizing behavior problems at ages 9.5 and 10.5. Findings were replicated using teacher-reported outcomes. However, results also suggest the need for item refinement and highlight the utility of a two-factor solution using a shortened ICU. In particular, the meaning of the unemotional items is discussed in relation to the conceptualization of CU traits.

AB Parenting has been conceptualized to mediate or moderate children's adaptation to family stress. Our study expanded the literature to determine, within the adoptive context, how non-child-related family stress (NCR-family stress; e.g., parent's problems at work) and parenting styles were related to internalizing and externalizing problems in school-age girls adopted from China. Using data from the third wave of a longitudinal study, 651 school-age girls were identified for the current analysis. On average, the girls were 9.3 years old (SD = 2.7) and were adopted at 15.6 months (SD = 13.8). Data on NCR-family stress, parenting styles and child behavior problems were collected from the adoptive mothers using the social problem questionnaire, parenting styles and dimensions questions, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18), respectively. After controlling for age at adoption, age, the adoptive mother's education level, household income, and the girls' corresponding behavior problems from the second wave of data (2 years prior), we found that that the association between NCR-family stress and the adopted Chinese girls' internalizing problems and externalizing problems was mediated by authoritarian parenting and moderated by authoritative parenting.

AB The present study examines the unique contributions of the caregiving system to predicting adolescent behavioral problems as well as examining the interplay between the caregiving systems in both parents. Two hundred and sixty six, adolescents (147 females and 119 males; aged 11-19) and their parents completed measure of socio-emotional problems and caregiving representations, respectively. Maternal mental representation of caregiving-self was a significant predictor for internalizing and externalizing problems. The inclusion of paternal mental representations of caregiving-other in the model increased the variance only for externalizing problems. Our findings confirm that mental representations based on inability to perceive others as deserving help, and negative self-perception of abilities and skills to give help predict socio-emotional problems in their adolescents. The implications of the findings for future theoretical and empirical development of research in this field are discussed.

AB We conducted an exploratory research study looking at fathering interactions as they relate to the wraparound care given by the Partnership for Kids or PARK Project, a school-based system of care in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The questions posed by our research focused on how fathers' positive interaction measured by their levels of engagement and accessibility can moderate the effect of the school-based system of care intervention on the mental health outcomes of children with serious emotional disturbances. We found that, although not statistically significant, children's access to their father did have a moderating effect on CBCL scores for internalizing behaviors and total problems. There was very small change in CBCL scores for externalizing behaviors. Further, the moderating effect of father accessibility and father engagement had a lasting effect as a moderator through 12 months into the intervention, especially with regard to internalizing behavior scores.

AB Background Childhood internalizing and externalizing problems are closely related and often co-occur. Directional models have been employed to test how these problems are related, while few studies have tested a third variables model.
   Objective This study investigates whether internalizing and externalizing problems are reciprocally or unidirectionally related, whether these relations can be explained by third variables, and how these relations are associated with onset and stability.
   Methods A community sample of 1,434 children aged 5.08 (SD = 1.25) and their mothers participated in two 1-year interval data waves. Internalizing and externalizing problems were examined with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results Using latent cross-lagged modeling, externalizing problems were found not be related to subsequent internalizing problems, or vice versa. These results were also found when controlling for inadequate parenting, parenting stress, maternal health and social preference. When taking problem level into account, externalizing problems were related to stability of clinical level internalizing problems, even when controlling for third variables inadequate parenting, parenting stress, maternal mental health and social preference.
   Conclusions Strong autoregressive paths for internalizing and externalizing problems were found. Internalizing and externalizing problems do not seem to influence each other over time in the community sample. When investigating relations among internalizing and externalizing problems, it seems to be important to take problem level into account.

AB The current study aimed to describe the prevalence of children of incarcerated parents (COIP) in a sample of homeless/highly mobile children, examine the relationship between parental incarceration and other risk factors, and investigate the effect of parental incarceration on child academic and mental health outcomes. The authors compared COIP (n=45) to children whose parents were never incarcerated (n=93) within a sample of 138, 4- to 7-year-old ethnically diverse children residing in emergency homeless shelters. Children's caregivers provided information about children's history of parental incarceration and other family experiences. Children's teachers reported academic and mental health outcomes in the subsequent school year. Compared to children with no history of parental incarceration, COIP experienced more negative life events. Regression models revealed that a history of parental incarceration was a significant predictor of teacher-reported internalizing problems. These results have implications for the identification and treatment of the highest risk homeless/highly mobile children.

AB In the wake of several highly publicized adolescent suicides attributed to bullying victimization, national attention has been brought to bear on the profound public health problem of bullying. This article reviews the extant literature on the associations between bullying perpetration, victimization, and thoughts of or attempts at suicide and proposes five potential mediators, namely depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, loneliness, and hopelessness, that may explain this relationship. Numerous studies have found empirical support for the interrelations between internalizing behaviors and both bullying perpetration and victimization and suicide. We find that further longitudinal research needs to be conducted to more conclusively determine the role and causal ordering these various psychosocial factors may play in bullying perpetration, victimization, and suicide. Although the research literature implies causal directions among all these potential mediators, untangling the unique influence of bullying perpetration, victimization, and bully victimization on suicide and its mechanisms of action has major research and practice implications.

AB Cyberbullying victimization is an important adolescent health issue. The cross-national study aimed to investigate the prevalence of cyber victimization and associated internalizing, externalizing and academic problems among adolescents in six European countries. A cross-sectional school-based study of 14-17 year-old adolescents (N = 10,930; F/M: 571915211; mean age 15.8 +/- 0.7 years) was conducted in Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Iceland and Greece. In total, 21.4% of adolescents reported cyber victimization in the past 12 months. Reports were more frequent among girls than boys (23.9% vs. 18.5%), and among the older adolescents compared to the younger ones (24.2% vs. 19.7%). The prevalence was highest in Romania and Greece (37.3% and 26.8%) and lowest in Spain and Iceland (13.3% and 13.5%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that cyber victimization was more frequent among adolescents using the internet and social networking sites for two or more hours daily. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that externalizing, internalizing and academic problems were associated with cyber victimization. Overall, cyber victimization was found to be a problem of substantial extent, concerning more than one in five of the studied European adolescents. Action against cyber victimization is crucial while policy planning should be aimed at the prevention of the phenomenon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social competence facilitates social and school adjustment of the individual and has emerged as one of the most important protective factor against the development of behavioral problems. Acquiring skills related to this competence depends largely on the environment and early stimulation, gaining importance the educational intervention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of an early intervention program (Aprender a Convivir) directed towards social competence development of three-year old children. Pretest and postest measures were taken among the participants and the comparison was performed between the control group (n=151) and the experimental group (n=162) through a repeated-measures mixed ANOVA. On the other hand an ANCOVA was carried out in order to eliminate the pretest differences between groups in the case that would be significant. The results indicate a significant improvement in the experimental group compared with the control group in all the social competence (cooperation d=0.32; interaction d=0.65; and social independence d=0.35) and conduct problem (internalizing d=0.63; and externalizing d=0.57) variables analyzed. Sex differences were also found.

AB While both shame and guilt are described as self-conscious emotions, they differ in many ways, including their contextual antecedents and their associations with mental health. A measure that distinguishes proneness to experience shame and guilt is crucial.
   In the present study we present a brief questionnaire to measure shame- and guilt-proneness in children using short concrete items. Specifically, we presented our 12-item Brief Shame and Guilt Questionnaire to Dutch (n = 219) 9-14 year-olds along with measures of internalizing problems (social anxiety, worry) and externalizing problems (aggression and conduct behavior). In addition to self-reports, teacher-reports on the externalizing problems were also collected. Results confirmed the two-factor structure, showed good psychometric properties of the two scales and a good concurrent validity. Specifically, shame-proneness contributed to the prediction of more internalizing problems and guilt-proneness contributed to the prediction of fewer externalizing problems. As such, the Brief Shame and Guilt Questionnaire for Children is a reliable and accessible instrument to administer in children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Co-occurrence of problem behaviors, particularly across internalizing and externalizing spectra, increases the risk of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation and attempt) among youth.
   Methods: We examined differences in psychosocial risk factors across levels of suicidality in a sample of 77 school-based adolescents engaging in both nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and repeated firesetting. Participants completed questionnaires assessing engagement in problem behaviors, mental health difficulties, negative life events, poor coping, impulsivity, and suicidality.
   Results: Adolescents endorsing suicidal ideation reported greater psychological distress, physical and sexual abuse, and less problem solving/goal pursuit than those with no history of suicidality; adolescents who had attempted suicide reported more severe NSSI, higher rates of victimization and exposure to suicide, relative to those with suicidal ideation but no history of attempt. Additional analyses suggested the importance of coping beliefs in protecting against suicidality.
   Conclusions: Clinical implications and suggestions for future research relating to suicide prevention are discussed.

TI Examining social competence, self-perception, quality of life, and

AB Background: Adolescent females with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are an understudied population, yet are also quite vulnerable, due to the increased complexities of social interaction and increased risk for internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Most research literature currently focuses on males with ASD, limiting our understanding of social experiences for females with ASD, and thus the potential to better inform supports and intervention to promote social-emotional functioning. This study examined similarities and differences in selected indicators of social-emotional health (social competence, self-perception, quality of life) and problematic behaviors such as externalizing and internalizing symptoms for adolescent females with and without ASD.
   Methods: This study employed a quantitative design utilizing correlational analysis as well as t test comparisons to examine selected indicators of social-emotional health and problematic symptoms using the Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS), Youth Quality of Life Instrument (YQOL), and the Self-Perceptions Profile for Adolescents (SPPA) for adolescent females with ASD in relation to their typically developing peers.
   Results: Significant differences were found between females with and without ASD in terms of their self-ratings of social-emotional health and problematic behaviors. The no-ASD group rated themselves higher across all areas of social-emotional health. Findings also suggest strong relationships between these constructs, especially for females without ASD. Parent reports of autism symptoms and social-emotional health indicated that as symptoms of autism are more severe, so too was the impact on individuals' social competence.
   Conclusions: Adolescent females with ASD perceive themselves as having lower social competence, self-worth, and quality of life and higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms as compared to their typically developing peers. Parent ratings indicate that higher levels of autism symptoms relate to lower levels of social competence. These findings lend support to the postulate that adolescent females with ASD are more vulnerable than their typically developing counterparts due to the compounded impact of ASD symptoms on social-emotional health and the higher risk for internalizing disorders for adolescent girls. Limitations and implications for further research and intervention are discussed.

AB Objective
   Neurodevelopmental problems (NDPs) may influence the transition from childhood to adolescence. Our aim was to study long-term psychosocial outcomes of NDPs, focusing on ADHD.
   Method
   Data was collected through a telephone interview with parents of twins at ages 9 or 12 years. NDP screen-positive children were clinically assessed at age 15; N = 450. Psychosocial outcome concerning peers, school, internalizing problems, antisocial behavior, alcohol misuse, drug misuse, and impaired daily functioning was examined.
   Results
   Even after controlling for other NDP comorbidity, screen-positivity for ADHD doubled or tripled the odds of later psychosocial problems. When controlling for parental education level, the significant effect of ADHD remained only for antisocial behavior and impaired daily functioning.
   Conclusions
   Signs of NDPs as well as other psychiatric diagnoses at ages 9 or 12 years are associated with a more problematic adolescence. However, despite the presence of comorbidity, early ADHD symptoms stand out as the most important risk factor for later antisocial development and impaired daily functioning.

   DEPARTMENT: A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
LA English
DT Article
DE Behavioral problems; Children; Psychiatric morbidity
ID PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; INDIA
AB BACKGROUND: Behavioral problems in children are one of the most common and rising problems in India. The studies of behavioral problems in children would give us data for mental health planning for children. We can identify children at risk and preventive intervention can be made at the earliest. AIMS: Aim of this study is to determine the proportion of various behavioral problems in children of age 5 to 15 years. Objectives of this study are to find the relationship between behavioral problems and socio-demographic variables and to determine the frequencies of internalizing, externalizing and other behavioral problems. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In this cross sectional study, 400 children in the age group of 5-15 years from the pediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital were selected. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) was used to measure the magnitude of problem behaviors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test/Fishers exact test. RESULTS: The sample included 400 children and out of them 22% had behavioral problems. Out of them 4% of children had internalizing problems, 9.75% had externalizing problems and 8.25% had other problems (Social and attention). Regarding the frequency of psychiatric disorders, conduct disorder was the most common problem (2.75%). Externalizing problems were prevalent in males while internalizing problems were prevalent in females. There is a significant association between parent's (Deceased/Alive) status, their marital status, family history of psychiatric illness and the development of behavioral problems in children. CONCLUSION: Therefore identifying the children with behavioral problem in young age and treating them would go a long way in preventing psychiatric morbidity later life. The need for such study is very much warranted in developing countries like India where such information is limited and this study would go on to augment existing data.

AB This study evaluated the nomological network of the borderline personality disorder (BPD) trait profile in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM-5]) Section III. BPD symptoms include a variety of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, and it is important to determine if the Section III trait operationalization for BPD captures these behavioral symptoms, as well as shows similar associations as the traditional Section II version with external criteria. For this purpose, we used a sample of 285 undergraduate students and conducted correlation and regression analyses to delineate the associations between Section III BPD traits and conceptually relevant external criteria. A Section III Total score was meaningfully associated with all criteria. Moreover, externalizing psychopathology tended to be most highly associated with disinhibitory Section III BPD traits, whereas internalizing psychopathology tended to have its strongest unique associations with traits reflective of negative affectivity. These results provide support for the construct validity of the trait profile for BPD in DSM-5 Section III.

AB Poor academic performance is a strong predictor of school dropout. Researchers have tried to disentangle variables influencing academic performance. However, studies on preschool and early care variables are seldom examined when explaining the school dropout process. We reviewed the literature on the relationship between caregiver-child attachment and academic performance, including attachment studies from preschool years, seeking out potential contributions to academic performance and the dropout process. The review was organized according to a model of four main mediating hypotheses: the attachment-teaching hypothesis, the social network hypothesis, the attachment-cooperation hypothesis, and the attachment self-regulation hypothesis. The results of the review are summed up in a model. There is some support for all four hypotheses. The review indicates that attachment and early care contribute substantially to dropout and graduation processes. Mediation effects should be given far more attention in future research.

AB This study had two objectives: first, to determine the degree to which experiences of victimization by peers during adolescence led to a subsequent rise in depressive symptoms, and second, to identify genetic markers that predict depressive reactivity to victimization. We used a cohort sequential design to obtain a longitudinal sample of 1,475 adolescents (3,263 observations) in Grades 8 to 12 (56% female; 47% Black, 46% White). Multilevel growth curve models were used to assess whether victimization predicted depressive symptoms 6 months later, beyond baseline trajectories for depressive symptoms. We modeled the interactive effects of peer victimization with three genetic polymorphisms (on 5-HTTLPR, DRD2 TaqIA, and BDNF Val66Met) on depressive symptoms. Although victimization predicted subsequent depressive symptoms, there was substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of the effect of victimization. Val alleles, associated with higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) functioning, predicted more sensitivity to victimization. Neither DRD2 TaqIA, a marker associated with dopaminergic functioning, nor 5-HTTLPR, a marker associated with serotonin activity, was associated with sensitivity to victimization. The social stress of peer victimization triggers depressive symptoms most strongly in individuals who are homozygous for the Val allele on the BDNF Val/Met polymorphism. This polymorphism has been linked with sensitivity to social defeat in animal models. Future research should explore behavioral, cognitive, and emotional explanations of the effects of BDNF Val/Met on responsivity to victimization.

TI Marital Quality Spillover and Young Children's Adjustment: Evidence for

AB Research has evidenced support for the spillover model, which posits that parents' marital functioning influences child adjustment by eroding parenting and coparenting in dyadic (mother-child and father-child) and triadic (mother-father-child) contexts. However, prior work has not simultaneously investigated dyadic and triadic parenting as mechanisms of spillover. Furthermore, although evidence indicates that the marital system affects child adjustment by influencing parents' behavior, research has not explored whether child behaviors in parent-child interactions also serve as mechanisms. To address these gaps, we examined the spillover model using observational measures of parent and child behavior in parent-child dyadic interactions as well as coparenting in triadic interactions. We also explored parent and child gender differences in spillover effects. Participants were families with children 3 to 6 years of age (n=149; 62% Caucasian). Findings indicated that marital functioning influences child adjustment by disrupting parent-child interactions in dyadic and triadic contexts, although results differed by child/parent gender and outcome examined. First, children's responsiveness to their mothers emerged as a significant mechanism of spillover effects for boys' internalizing and girls' externalizing behavior. Second, for girls and boys, marital functioning was indirectly related to children's internalizing and externalizing behavior through reductions in coparenting warmth. Finally, there was little evidence that parent gender moderated the indirect effect of dyadic parenting, except that child responsiveness to mothers (vs. to fathers) was more strongly related to child adjustment. These findings underscore the need for interventions targeting dyadic and triadic parent-child interactions in the face of marital distress.

AB Few published studies have looked at the moderating role of coping styles on the association between stress reactivity and internalizing/externalizing problems despite theory suggesting that particular constellations of stress reactivity and coping may be uniquely problematic. The present study aimed to test the interactive effects of coping and psychophysiology on self- and parent-report broad-spectrum problems in a normative adolescent sample. Sixty-six late adolescents (ages 16-17; 60% female, 13% ethnic minority) completed questionnaires on coping, stressful life events, and behavioral/emotional problems, with parents also providing data on problems. In addition, skin conductance and heart rate data were obtained during a brief interview designed to elicit the feeling of reexperiencing a recent stressful experience. Path analytic results suggested evidence for several interaction effects between coping and skin conductance. Most commonly, the pattern of effects was consistent with a buffering effect for productive (or problem-focused) coping strategies against elevated internalizing and externalizing problems for individuals who demonstrated high physiological stress reactivity. Evidence for interaction effects related to respiratory sinus arrhythmia was less frequent and less consistent with a priori hypotheses. Although our cross-sectional results should be interpreted cautiously, the interactions reported here suggest that improving coping skills may be particularly beneficial for youth with high psychophysiological arousal.

AB The present study examined potential gender differences in the effects of family structure and family processes on externalizing and internalizing behavioral outcomes among youth over time. Using data from waves one through three of the Add Health study, results indicated that the relationship between family structure and family processes on behavioral outcomes varied depending on the specific externalizing or internalizing behavior. Family structure directly influenced three different externalizing behaviors, but indirectly influenced internalizing behaviors through its effect on maternal attachment and to some degree parental permissiveness. The long-term influence of family structure, family processes, and later externalizing and internalizing behaviors is complex. These relationships played out similarly across both male and female youth, suggesting that the effect of living in a single-parent home, subsequent family processes, and individual behavior and well-being may not be different across gender.

AB The main aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of a set of risk factors relating to childhood life events and other psychosocial factors that may be associated with criminal indicators and with the prevalence of internalizing psychopathology in a sample of adolescent offenders. Fifty male adolescents in the custody of the Portuguese juvenile Justice System participated in the study (M = 15.8 years of age). The Adolescent Psychopathology Scale - Short Form (APS-SF) was administered in a structured interview format, and the sociodemographic, family and criminal data questionnaire was filled in by the justice professional after consulting the adolescent's file. Forty-six percent of all subjects had previous delinquent behavior. About 32% of the boys had committed violent offenses and 88% acted with peers. Also, the persistence of the delinquent behavior (50% of the offenders), coupled with the increase in the severity of the crimes committed (38% of the sample), suggests that these adolescents were at risk for serious and chronic delinquency at the time of the intervention. About 32% of the participants reported posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 20% had suicide ideation, and a lower percentage reported other internalizing problems. Institutionalization, maltreatment and conduct problems in childhood, and family risk factors (parental conflict, absence of a father figure, lack of parental control and family substance addiction) were related with the report of internalizing problems. Moreover, the increase in the severity of criminal offenses and living in a correctional facility were associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress, interpersonal problems, anxiety and depression. This study draws attention to the importance of assessing indicators of psychopathology and of psychosocial risk in intervention programs with young offenders, but also to the need of family focused interventions in order to help prevent recidivism.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of mental disorders in juveniles who sexually offended (JSOs). A meta-analysis was performed based on studies reporting on the prevalence rates of mental disorders in JSOs. Furthermore, differences in mental disorders between JSOs and juveniles who offended non-sexually (non-JSOs) were assessed. In total, 21 studies reporting on mental disorders in 2951 JSOs and 18,688 non-JSOs were included. In the total group of JSOs, 69% met the criteria for at least one mental disorder; comorbidity was present in 44%. The most common externalizing and internalizing disorders were respectively conduct disorder (CD; 51%) and anxiety disorder (18%). Compared to non-JSOs, JSOs were less often diagnosed with a Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD, i.e., CD and/or Oppositional Deviant Disorder [ODD]), an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and a Substance Use Disorder (SUD). No significant differences were found for internalizing disorders. In conclusion, although the prevalence of externalizing disorders is higher in non-JSOs, mental disorders are highly prevalent in JSOs. Even though results of the current meta-analysis may overestimate prevalence rates (e.g., due to publication bias), screening of JSOs should focus on mental disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Inhibition of fear generalization with new learning is an important process in treatments for anxiety disorders. Generalization of maladaptive cognitions related to traumatic experiences (overgeneralized beliefs) have been demonstrated to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult populations, whereas more balanced, accommodated beliefs are associated with symptom improvement. It is not yet clear whether (a) overgeneralization and accommodation are associated with PTSD treatment outcome in youth, or (b whether accommodated beliefs can interact with or inhibit cognitive overgeneralization, as has been demonstrated in research on behavior-based fear generalization. The current study examined the relationships between overgeneralized and accommodated beliefs, child age, and symptom reduction in a sample of 81 youth (age 7-17 years), who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Overgeneralized and accommodated beliefs expressed during the exposure phase of treatment were coded in audio-recorded therapy sessions. Overgeneralization predicted (a) higher internalizing symptom scores at posttreatment, particularly for younger children, and less improvement over treatment, and (b) higher externalizing scores at 1-year follow-up and steeper symptom increases over this period. In contrast, accommodation was associated with (a) lower posttreatment internalizing symptoms and greater improvement over treatment, and (b) lower externalizing scores at 1-year follow-up, particularly for younger children. High levels of accommodation moderated the relationship between overgeneralization and worse symptom outcomes, except when predicting the slope of internalizing scores over treatment, and age did not moderate these effects. There were no significant predictors of child-reported PTSD-specific symptoms, although PTSD symptoms did decrease significantly over the course of treatment and maintain 1 year after treatment.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate whether childhood experiences with family pets are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety in early adulthood. Undergraduate students (n =318) responded to an online survey that included questions about bonding with childhood pets, exposure to family violence and human aggression directed toward family pets in childhood, and current symptoms of depression and anxiety. Two-way ANCOVAs were conducted with a measure of childhood emotional abuse included as a covariate, and significant interactions were observed between pet bonding and exposure to aggression toward pets (pet aggression). Among participants with medium-level bonds, those who were exposed to pet aggression had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores than those who were not exposed to pet aggression. Among participants who were not exposed to pet aggression, those with medium-level bonds had lower depression and anxiety scores than those with low-level bonds. Bearing in mind the limitations of the research design, the results are consistent with the assertion that bonding with pets may support mental health and that exposure to animal cruelty may lead to the development of internalizing symptoms. The results also support the contention that both bonding with pets and exposure to pet aggression should be considered when investigating the association between experiences with pets and mental health. Interventions for the protection of children may be indicated in cases of animal cruelty. Social workers who investigate child maltreatment may be advised to refer children who are exposed to animal cruelty for counseling. Clinicians should consider addressing issues that arise from exposure to pet aggression during the therapeutic process.

AB Objective To find out various life stressors of adolescents, coping strategies adopted by them and the impact of stress on adolescent mental health.
   Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study was conducted in the schools in south zone of Delhi, capital city of the country. Data was collected on 360 adolescents between the age group of 13-17 y on socio-demographic profile, Adolescent Life Event Stress Scale, Brief Cope and Youth Self Report for ages 11-18 y.
   Results Stress related to uncontrollable events such as family events, relocation events, accident events, ambiguous events and controllable events such as sexual events, deviance events and autonomy events was significantly higher as compared to distressful events (p<0.0) such as death of a pet, arguments with friends, appearing for exams, failure or low grades. Adolescent stress was significantly correlated with various demographic variables in the study. The most frequently used coping strategies by the adolescents were positive reframing, planning, active coping, and instrumental support. It has also been found that stress has a significant impact on adolescent mental health in the form of either internalizing problems such as anxiety, withdrawal and somatic problems or externalizing problems such as rule breaking and aggressive behaviors.
   Conclusions A significant correlation was found between most of the stressful life event domains and the syndrome subscale of the youth self report form which indicate that out of the total sample of 360 adolescents 150 were identified as having psycho-social morbidity, including 59 borderline cases and 91 high-risk cases. The study pointed out the need for mental health screening among the adolescents and also indicated the need for mental health inputs in educational institutions.

AB Objective To characterize the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) as well as generate novel hypotheses for future research in this pediatric population. Method A literature review was completed using PubMed and the keywords below. Results Research has shown that for children with EoE and their parents, symptom experiences and recommended treatments can have a negative impact on HRQoL. However, studies have yet to adequately address mechanisms that may help explain why this is. Areas of interest include sleep quality and disturbances, the experience of pain, and the presence of internalizing symptoms, all of which have the potential to uniquely and synergistically impact HRQoL. Conclusion With greater understanding of the associations among sleep, pain, internalizing symptoms, and HRQoL in children with EoE may come enhanced therapies that substantially improve the quality of their health care.

AB This study reviews the findings from the Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle (IDEAL) study, a multisite, longitudinal, prospective study designed to determine maternal outcome and child growth and developmental findings following prenatal methamphetamine exposure from birth up to age 7.5 years. These findings are presented in the context of the home environment and caregiver characteristics to determine how the drug and the environment interact to affect the outcome of these children. No neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring pharmacologic intervention was observed but heavy drug exposure was associated with increased stress responses in the neonatal period. Poorer inhibitory control was also observed in heavy methamphetamine exposed children placing them at high risk for impaired executive function. Independent of methamphetamine exposure, children with more responsive home environments to developmental and emotional needs demonstrated lower risks for internalizing and externalizing behavior.

AB Background Interventions to minimize the long-term consequences of neglect or emotional abuse rely on prompt identification of these children. This systematic review of world literature (1947-2012) identifies features that children aged 5-14 years experiencing neglect or emotional abuse, as opposed to physical or sexual abuse, may exhibit.
   Methods Searching 18 databases, utilizing over 100 keywords, supplemented by hand searching, 13,210 articles were identified and 111 underwent full critical appraisal by two independent trained reviewers.
   Results The 30 included studies highlighted behavioural features (15 studies), externalizing features being the most prominent (8/9 studies) and internalizing features noted in 4/6 studies. Four studies identified attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated features: impulsivity, inattention or hyperactivity. Child difficulties in initiating or developing friendships were noted in seven studies. Of 13 studies addressing emotional well-being, three highlighted low self-esteem, with a perception of external control (1), or depression (6) including suicidality (1). A negative internal working model of the mother increased the likelihood of depression (1). In assessing cognition or academic performance, lower general intelligence (3/4) and reduced literacy and numeracy (2) were reported, but no observable effect on memory (3).
   Conclusions School-aged children presenting with poor academic performance, ADHD symptomatology or abnormal behaviours warrant assessment of neglect or emotional abuse as a potential underlying cause.

AB Objective: The relationship between experiencing trauma and increased alcohol consumption has been well established. Exposure to childhood trauma has been linked to both early onset of drinking and problematic substance use. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. The results of early work suggested that drinking to relieve negative affect (i.e., drinking to cope) was driving this connection. However, the findings of more recent work suggest that drinking might be used to enhance positive affect as a way of addressing the aftereffects of early trauma. The current study looked at these two drinking expectancies as indirect pathways between the experience in early childhood of living in a home with parental violence and peak alcohol use in emerging adulthood. Method: Participants were 1,064 children and their parents involved in a longitudinal community study of children at high risk for the development of alcoholism and a community contrast group of those at lower risk. Baseline assessment was at age 3-5 years, self-reports of internalizing behavior and drinking expectancies were obtained at age 12-14, and drinking measures were assessed at age 18-20. Results: Results indicated that coping expectancy was a mediator of the relationship between early childhood trauma and later peak alcohol use, whereas enhancement expectancy was not. Conclusions: Children living in homes with parental violence were more likely to develop ineffective coping strategies, such as using alcohol to decrease negative affect. These results support the self-medication theory. They also demonstrate the long-term effects of early life experience on drinking behavior in early adulthood.

AB Objective: Adolescent problem behaviors are often the visible results of intrapsychic distress. Defensive reactions are the unconscious means of managing intrapsychic distress. This cross-sectional study examines the strength of defensive style as measured by self-report on the Response Evaluation Measure (REM-71) relative to age, sex, and SES, as a correlate of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, as assessed by the Youth Self Report (YSR). Methods: A sample of 1,487 students from two suburban high schools completed self-report measures of defense style, self-esteem, and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Demographic variables (age, sex, and SES) were included as covariates. Results: Mature and immature defense style correlated as expected with problem behaviors. Demographic variables contributed minimally to the variance in the outcome variable. Conclusions: Defense style, as assessed by the REM-71, is a significant correlate of clinically elevated internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in youth as in adults. This study adds to the convergent validity of the REM-71.

AB Our study examined parenting stress and its association with behavioral problems and disease severity in children with problematic severe asthma. Research participants were 93 children (mean age 13.4 +/- A 2.7 years) and their parents (86 mothers, 59 fathers). As compared to reference groups analyzed in previous research, scores on the Parenting Stress Index in mothers and fathers of the children with problematic severe asthma were low. Higher parenting stress was associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems in children (Child Behavior Checklist). Higher parenting stress in mothers was also associated with higher airway inflammation (FeNO). Thus, although parenting stress was suggested to be low in this group, higher parenting stress, especially in the mother, is associated with more airway inflammation and greater child behavioral problems. This indicates the importance of focusing care in this group on all possible sources of problems, i.e., disease exacerbations and behavioral problems in the child as well as parenting stress.

AB Risk-related liabilities associated with the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) during adolescence and early adulthood are thought to be established well before the emergence of the index episode. In this study, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology from earlier developmental periods were evaluated as risk factors for CUDs during adolescence and early adulthood. Participants (N = 816) completed 4 diagnostic assessments between the ages 16 and 30, during which current and past CUDs were assessed as well as a full range of psychiatric disorders associated with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology domains. In unadjusted and adjusted time-to-event analyses, externalizing but not internalizing psychopathology from proximal developmental periods predicted subsequent CUD onset. A large proportion of adolescent and early adult cases, however, did not manifest any externalizing or internalizing psychopathology during developmental periods before CUD onset. Findings are consistent with the emerging view that externalizing disorders from proximal developmental periods are robust risk factors for CUDs. Although the identification of externalizing liabilities may aid in the identification of individuals at risk for embarking on developmental pathways that culminate in CUDs, such liabilities are an incomplete indication of overall risk.

AB Poor mental health is associated with teen dating violence (TDV), but whether there are specific types of psychiatric disorders that could be targeted with intervention to reduce TDV remains unknown.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of psychiatric disorders that emerged prior to dating initiation with subsequent physical dating violence in a nationally representative sample from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, adjusting statistically for adverse childhood experiences.
   In adjusted models, internalizing disorders (AOR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.04,1.25; no sex differences noted) and externalizing disorders (males: AOR 1.28, 95 % CI 1.10, 1.49; females: AOR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.55, 2.21) were associated with subsequent involvement in any physical dating violence victimization or perpetration before the age of 21. Those at greatest risk included girls with ADHD and a substance use disorder, in particular.
   The range of psychiatric disorders associated with TDV is broader than has generally been recognized for both boys and girls. Clinical and public health prevention programs should incorporate strategies for addressing multiple pathways through which poor mental health may put adolescents at risk for TDV.

AB Childhood maltreatment has been linked to numerous negative health outcomes. However, few studies have examined mediating processes using longitudinal designs or objectively measured biological data. This study sought to determine whether child abuse and neglect predicts allostatic load (a composite indicator of accumulated stress-induced biological risk) and to examine potential mediators. Using a prospective cohort design, children (ages 0-11) with documented cases of abuse and neglect were matched with non-maltreated children and followed up into adulthood with in-person interviews and a medical status exam (mean age 41). Allostatic load was assessed with nine physical health indicators. Child abuse and neglect predicted allostatic load, controlling for age, sex, and race. The direct effect of child abuse and neglect persisted despite the introduction of potential mediators of internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence and social support and risky lifestyle in middle adulthood. These findings reveal the long-term impact of childhood abuse and neglect on physical health over 30 years later. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal stress during pregnancy (MSDP) has been linked to a decrease in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in the general population. The purpose of this study is to first examine the association between MSDP and IQ in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and second, to confirm, in a large sample, the link between MSDP and ADHD behavioral symptomatology. Methods: Four hundred ten children diagnosed with ADHD, ages six to 12, were consecutively recruited from the ADHD clinic and day hospital at the Douglas Institute from 1999 to 2013. IQ was assessed using the WISC III and IV. Symptom severity was evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Connor's Global Index for Parents (CGI-P) and Teachers (CGI-T). Results: No significant effect of MSDP on full scale IQ was observed, but MSDP had a significant effect on CBCL and CGI scores. Elevated MSDP was significantly associated with increased CBCL internalizing scores (beta = 4.2, p < .01), CBCL externalizing scores (beta = 1.9, p = .04), CGI-P restless-impulsive scores (beta = 2.6, p = .01), CGI-P emotional lability scores (beta = 3.1, p = .02), and CGI-T restless-impulsive (beta = 2.2, p = .05) and emotional lability (beta = 3.4, p = .04) scores. MSDP increased the variance explained of ADHD symptomatology even after controlling for various factors (i. e. familial income, parental education, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, gender and age). Conclusion: The study demonstrates that in children with ADHD, MSDP does not have an impact on IQ but rather on ADHD symptomatology, highlighting the importance of potentially offering psychological and social support to mothers who experience stress during pregnancy.

AB Behavioral/emotional difficulties in children are the first sign of mental health problems. These problems are however, heterogeneous. A domain that may identify homogenous subgroups is hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. This study tested whether epigenetic regulation of glucocorticoid receptor gene could explain the co-occurrence of anxiety problems in children with behavior problems. Four- to 16-year-old clinically referred children (N=241) were measured for psychiatric symptoms, methylation of target CpG sites in blood or saliva, and morning cortisol levels in those who gave blood. Increased methylation of promoter 1F CpG sites was associated with higher vulnerability to co-occurring internalizing symptoms and morning cortisol. The results support increasing optimism that epigenetic regulation of key neuroendocrine systems might help explain hitherto unfathomable individual differences in susceptibility to psychiatric symptom profiles.

AB The present study assessed a developmental task theory of romantic relationships by examining associations between romantic relationship qualities and adjustment across 9years using a community-based sample of 100 male and 100 female participants (M-age Wave 1=15.83) in a Western U.S. city. Using multilevel modeling, the study examined the moderating effect of age on links between romantic relationship qualities and adjustment. Consistent with developmental task theory, high romantic quality was more negatively associated with internalizing symptoms and dating satisfaction during young adulthood than adolescence. Romantic relationship qualities were also associated with externalizing symptoms and substance use, but the degree of association was consistent across ages. The findings underscore the significance of romantic relationship qualities across development.

AB Well-documented treatment methods must be tested following their implementation in community service agencies and across different cultures to ensure continuing effectiveness. This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Parent Management Trainingthe Oregon model (PMTO), conducted within a nationwide implementation in Iceland. Families of 102 clinically referred children with behavior problems were recruited from five municipalities throughout Iceland. Child age ranged from 5 to 12; 73% were boys. Families were randomly assigned to either PMTO or services usually offered in the communities (SAU). Child adjustment was measured with a latent construct based on parent, child, and teacher reports of externalizing and internalizing problems and social skills. Prepost intent-to-treat analyses showed that PMTO treatment led to greater reductions in child adjustment problems relative to the comparison group, obtaining a modest to medium effect size based on the construct score. Only one indicator (parent-rated Social Skills) showed significant change independently and information on amount and kind of treatment in the SAU was limited. Overall, findings indicate that PMTO is an effective method to treat children's behavior problems in a Northern European culture and supply evidence for the method's successful implementation in community settings in Iceland. This is one of few nationwide implementation studies of PMTO outside the United States and the first RCT in Iceland to test a treatment model for children's behavior problems.
   Los metodos de tratamiento bien documentados deben evaluarse despues de su implementacion en organizaciones de servicios comunitarios y en diferentes culturas para garantizar la continuidad de su eficacia. El presente estudio fue una prueba controlada aleatoria del Curso de formacion para el manejo de padres y madres - Modelo de Oregon (Parent Management Training- Oregon Model, PMTO), realizado dentro de una implementacion nacional en Islandia. Se convoco a las familias de 102 ninos derivados clinicamente con problemas de comportamiento de cinco distritos de Islandia. La edad de los ninos oscilo entre los 5 y los 12 anos; el 73% eran varones. Se asigno aleatoriamente a las familias al PMTO o a servicios ofrecidos normalmente en las comunidades. La adaptacion de los ninos se midio con un constructo latente basado en informes de los padres, los ninos y los maestros en relacion con la exteriorizacion y la interiorizacion de problemas y las habilidades sociales. Los analisis anteriores y posteriores por intencion de tratar indicaron que el tratamiento del PMTO condujo a una mayor disminucion de los problemas de adaptacion de los ninos en relacion con el grupo comparativo, y se obtuvo un tamano del efecto entre modesto y mediano basado en el puntaje del constructo. Solo un indicador (habilidades sociales calificadas por los padres) demostro un cambio significativo independientemente, y la informacion sobre la cantidad y el tipo de tratamiento en los servicios ofrecidos en las comunidades fue limitada. En general, los resultados indican que el PMTO es un metodo eficaz para tratar los problemas de comportamiento de los ninos en una cultura de Europa del Norte y ofrecen evidencia para la implementacion satisfactoria del metodo en entornos comunitarios de Islandia. Este es uno de los pocos estudios de implementacion nacional del PMTO fuera de Estados Unidos y la primera prueba controlada aleatoria realizada en Islandia para evaluar un modelo de tratamiento de los problemas de comportamiento de los ninos.

AB Aims: Peptides and a dysregulated immune system play a role in the pathophysiology of autism. Dysfunctions in prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) may underpin both the peptidergic and immune alterations in autism. The aims of this study are to: (i) delineate serum PEP and DPP-IV enzyme activities in autism, and (ii) examine the associations between both peptidases and behavioral characteristics or immune variables.
   Main methods: We included 18 autistic patients and 22 healthy controls and measured the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), serum PEP and DPP-IV and immune biomarkers, i.e. the serum protein fractions alpha 1, alpha 2 and gamma, and immunoglobulins, i. e. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. Results were adjusted for possible effects of age and body mass index (BMI).
   Key findings: There were no significant differences in PEP or DPP-IV between the autistic patients and controls. DPP-IV was significantly and positively associated with the CBCL attention problems, aggressive and externalizing behavior subscales. PEP was significantly and positively associated with the CBCL delinquent, aggressive, externalizing and internalizing behavior subscales. There was a negative correlation between both peptidases and age and Tanner stage. DPP-IV was associated with alpha 2-globulin (positively) and IgG3 (inversely) levels, while PEP activity was correlated with IgG2 levels (inversely). BMI was significantly associated with aggressive and externalizing behaviors.
   Significance: These findings demonstrate an association between peptidases and aggressive and externalizing behaviors, which may be explained by effects of these peptidases cleaving behavioral neuropeptides. Both peptidases are associated with immune biomarkers suggesting multiple bidirectional effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID CHILDREN; RECOVERY; SKILLS; ADOLESCENTS; VARIABILITY; DISORDERS;
   OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) on attention, a prerequisite for behavioral and neurocognitive functioning.
   METHODS: Children aged 6 to 13 years who were diagnosed with TBI (n = 113; mean 1.7 years postinjury) were compared with children with a trauma control injury (not involving the head) (n = 53). TBI severity was defined as mild TBI with or without risk factors for complicated TBI (mild(RF+) TBI, n = 52; mild(RF-) TBI, n = 24) or moderate/severe TBI (n = 37). Behavioral functioning was assessed by using parent and teacher questionnaires, and the Attention Network Test assessed alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Ex-Gaussian modeling determined the contribution of extremely slow responses (lapses of attention) to mean reaction time (MRT).
   RESULTS: The TBI group showed higher parent and teacher ratings of attention and internalizing problems, higher parent ratings of externalizing problems, and lower intelligence than the control group (P < .05, >= 0.34). No effect of TBI on alerting, orienting, and executive attention was observed (P >= .55). MRT was slower in the TBI group (P = .008, d = 0.45), traced back to increased lapses of attention (P = .002, d = 0.52). The mild(RF-) TBI group was unaffected, whereas the mild(RF+) TBI and moderate/severe TBI groups showed elevated parent ratings of behavior problems, lower intelligence, and increased lapses of attention (P <= .03, d >= 0.48). Lapses of attention fully explained the negative relation between intelligence and parent-rated attention problems in the TBI group (P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Lapses of attention represent a core attention deficit in children with mild(RF+) TBI (even in the absence of intracranial pathology) or moderate/severe TBI, and relate to daily life problems after pediatric TBI.

AB Objective: Genetic factors contribute to individual differences in behavior problems. In children, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded the first suggestive results when aiming to identify genetic variants that explain heritability, but the proportion of genetic variance that can be attributed to common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remains to be determined, as only a few studies have estimated SNP heritability, with diverging results.
   Method: Genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) as implemented in the software Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate SNP heritability (SNP h(2)) for multiple phenotypes within 4 broad domains of children's behavioral problems (attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms, internalizing, externalizing, and pervasive developmental problems) and cognitive function. We combined phenotype and genotype data from 2 independent, population-based Dutch cohorts, yielding a total number of 1,495 to 3,175 of 3-, 7-, and 9-year-old children.
   Results: Significant SNP heritability estimates were found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms (SNP h(2) = 0.37-0.71), externalizing problems (SNP h(2) = 0.44), and total problems (SNP h(2) = 0.18), rated by mother or teacher. Sensitivity analyses with exclusion of extreme cases and quantile normalization of the phenotype data decreased SNP h(2) as expected under genetic inheritance, but they remained statistically significant for most phenotypes.
   Conclusion: We provide evidence of the influence of common SNPs on child behavior problems in an ethnically homogenous sample. These results support the continuation of large GWAS collaborative efforts to unravel the genetic basis of complex child behaviors.

AB Prior empirical examinations of the factor structure of the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI; Millon, 1993, 2006) have produced mixed results and have not included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In this study, we examined the internal structure of the MACI in a sample of 1,015 detained adolescent boys (ages 13 to 19). The sample was randomly divided into independent samples. Replication of prior factor models was first attempted in one half (n = 505) of the sample (Sample 1) and disconfirmed these models on the current data. An exploratory factor analysis was then conducted and revealed a 2-factor model representing internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Next, CFA was conducted with Sample 2 (n = 510) and revealed acceptable fit when the model was revised to include correlated error terms among certain scales and factor cross-loadings. Implications for the use of the MACI with adolescents as well as directions for future research are discussed.

AB In the present study, we examined the extent to which the responses of teachers and mothers toward a particular child are similar in respect to their instructional support and affect, and whether child characteristics predict these responses. The data of 373 Finnish child-teacher-mother triads (178 girls, 195 boys) were analysed. Teachers and mothers reported their instructional support and affective responses toward a child in the school/homework context in Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. At the beginning of Grade 1, the children's performance in reading and math was tested, and teachers evaluated the children's externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour. The results demonstrated that mothers and teachers showed similar instructional support and affective responses toward a particular child at the end of Grade 1. Moreover, children's poor performance in reading and math at the beginning of Grade 1 was associated with high amounts of both teachers' and mothers' instructional support at the end of Grade 1, while children's externalizing problem behaviour was strongly related particularly to teachers' but also to mothers' negative affective responses at the end of Grade 1. The results provide evidence for the evocative impact of child characteristics on the child's interpersonal environment at the start of child's school career.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine associations between parenting and child behaviour problems in two neighbouring countries with subtle, yet apparent cultural differences. Participants were mothers and fathers of preschool-age children from Latvia and Lithuania. Parents completed a measure of child-rearing attitudes and reported on their child's internalizing and externalizing behaviours. In both countries, parental warmth was negatively associated with child behaviour problems, and punishment orientation was positively associated. There were differences by country in the association of paternal psychological control and behaviour problems, and in the interactions of parenting dimensions, specifically maternal warmth and punishment orientation. Possible differences in the meaning attributed to parenting practices imply considerations for parent training programs.

AB Coping research has consistently shown that accommodative coping is positively correlated with individuals' health. Until now, however, there have been little to no studies on the prognostic impact of accommodative coping on health, and only a few studies investigating its buffering effect on the relation between stress and health in childhood and adolescence. Thus, two main research questions were tracked in two longitudinal studies: Study 1 investigated if accommodative coping is indeed a functional resource that longitudinally predicts well-being in a sample of N = 403 adolescents (aged 12-15 years at Wave 1). Study 2 examined the function of accommodative coping under stressful conditions by investigating its buffering effect on the negative impact of school-related stress on well-being in a sample of N = 86 children (aged 9-12 years at Wave 1). Study 1 revealed accommodative coping longitudinally predicting well-being, and, conversely, there was no prediction of well-being through accommodative coping over time. Study 2 revealed a significant moderating effect and gives a first indication that accommodative coping buffers the negative impact of school-related stress on well-being in childhood. The results indicate that accommodation is a functional coping resource in adolescence that diminishes the negative impact of specific stressors. All main and further results are discussed, and implications for further research are given.

AB This is a 3-year, quasi-experimental trial of an intervention diffusion framework. There were 11 intervention and 10 control junior high schools located in either a large Swedish city or the Swedish countryside. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to evaluate a 2-level model (1,337 students nested in 85 classrooms) for each outcome domain: internalizing and externalizing problems, substance use, socioemotional competence, and perception of a positive school environment. Results showed that framework-related benefits were predominately shown for either 1 gender or 1 gender living in a particular setting. Changes were also primarily of a buffering character, in which a subgroup of comparison participants showed a poorer pattern of change relative to intervention participants. Study results provide (a) evidence for discourse about what is an optimal level of choice for intervention stakeholders to have when implementing interventions and (b) an empirical test of a diffusion framework in routine practice, outside of the United States.

AB On September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack occurred in the U.S. (9/11). Research on 9/11 and psychiatric outcomes has focused on individual disorders rather than the broader internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) domains of psychopathology, leaving unknown whether direct and indirect 9/11 exposure differentially impacted these domains rather than individual disorders. Further, whether such effects were exacerbated by earlier childhood maltreatment (i.e. stress sensitization) is unknown. 18,713 participants from a U.S. national sample with no history of psychiatric disorders prior to 9/11 were assessed using a structured in-person interview. Structural equation modeling conducted in a sample who endorsed no psychiatric history prior to 9/11, indicated that indirect exposure to 9/11 (i.e. media, friends/family) was related to both EXT (alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis dependence, and antisocial personality disorder) and INT (major depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) dimensions of psychopathology (EXT: beta = 0.10, p < 0.001; INT: beta = 0.11, p < 0.001) whereas direct exposure was associated with the INT dimension only (beta = 0.11, p < 0.001). For individuals who had experienced childhood maltreatment, the risk for EXT and INT dimensions associated with 9/11 was exacerbated (Interactions: beta = 0.06, p < 0.01; beta = 0.07, p < 0.001, respectively). These findings indicate that 9/11 impacted latent liability to broad domains of psychopathology in the US general population rather than specific disorders with the exception of PTSD, which had independent effects beyond INT (as indicated by a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in modification indices). Findings also indicated that childhood maltreatment increases the risk associated with adult trauma exposure, providing further evidence for the concept of stress sensitization.

AB Homelessness affects a large and increasing number of families in the United States, and exposure to violence and other potentially traumatic events is common among homeless families. It is important to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the relationship between youth mental health and caregiver mental health and trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the needs of this vulnerable population. The objective of this study is to explore the relationships between caregiver exposure to violence, caregiver depression, and youth depression and behavioral problems among homeless families. Preliminary findings indicate that among this sample of homeless families, caregiver violence exposure has statistically significant relationships with both youth behavioral problems and youth depression symptoms, as mediated by caregiver depression. These findings indicate that youth behavioral health is associated with caregiver mental health, which, in turn, is associated with caregiver trauma exposure. This highlights the importance of taking into account adult mental health while treating youth externalizing and internalizing behaviors and ensuring that caregivers, too, have access to adequate treatment and supports. Furthermore, this treatment should be trauma informed, given the link between trauma and mental health.

AB Decades of research have demonstrated links between behavioral adjustment and cognitive ability. However, little attention has been given to examining the relations between behavioral adjustment and IQ utilizing the most recent edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (i.e., WISC-IV). The WISC has undergone substantial revisions designed to produce more reliable and valid intellectual profiles. The release of a new edition provides a unique opportunity to revisit questions about IQ profiles and behavior. Consequently, we compared the relations between behavior problems and the WISC-III or WISC-IV. All 290 child participants were referred by their parent for a psychoeducational assessment due to academic concerns. This was a diverse sample. The majority was from a low-income family. Eighty-eight completed the WISC-III; 202 completed the WISC-IV. We found a number of differences between the WISC-III and WISC-IV in their relation to behavior problems, including significant negative relations between WISC-III IQ scores and adjustment scores that did not hold up with the WISC-IV. This may suggest that the WISC-IV is better than its predecessors at estimating IQ independently of behavior problems, which is important when testing clinically referred children. We also discuss alternate explanations and additional factors to consider.

AB Internalizing behavior problems such as anxiety and depression impair children's aptitude to establish contacts with peers and hinder their ability to fully participate in learning activities. Furthermore, early onset of internalizing problems may significantly decrease quality of adult life. The present study examined factors that contribute to internalizing behavior problems among young children. Factors intrinsic to the child and to the child's family were assessed and analyzed using multilevel modeling techniques to explain variation in internalizing problem behaviors across participating Head Start preschools. The final sample included 183 children ages 3-5.5 years old who were recruited from 15 preschools in rural and urban communities in south central Michigan. Majority (54 %) of children were Caucasian and others were identified as African-American (23 %), biracial (20 %), Hispanic and Native American (3 %). Children's parents, teachers and case managers reported on behavioral problems, child and family characteristics. Child male gender, externalizing behavior problems, lower maternal education, and lower levels of social support to the mother were significantly associated with higher Achenbach TRF Internalizing behavior scores in young children.

AB Shared latent dimensions may account for the co-occurrence of multiple forms of psychological dysfunction. However, this conceptualization has rarely been integrated into the smoking literature, despite high levels of psychological symptoms in smokers. In this study, we used confirmatory factor analysis to compare three models (1-factor, 2-factor [internalizing-externalizing], and 3-factor [low positive affect-negative affect-disinhibition]) of relations among nine measures of affective and behavioral symptoms implicated in smoking spanning depression, anxiety, happiness, anhedonia, ADHD, aggression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. We then examined associations of scores from each of the manifest scales and the latent factors from the best-fitting model to several smoking characteristics (i.e., experimentation, lifetime established smoking [a parts per thousand yen100 cigarettes lifetime], age of smoking onset, cigarettes/day, nicotine dependence, and past nicotine withdrawal). We used two samples: (1) College Students (N =288; mean age =20; 75 % female) and (2) Adult Daily Smokers (N=338; mean age=44; 32 % female). In both samples, the 3-factor model separating latent dimensions of deficient positive affect, negative affect, and disinhibition fit best. In the college students, the disinhibition factor and its respective indicators significantly associated with lifetime smoking. In the daily smokers, low positive and high negative affect factors and their respective indicators positively associated with cigarettes/day and nicotine withdrawal symptom severity. These findings suggest that shared features of psychological symptoms may be parsimonious explanations of how multiple manifestations of psychological dysfunction play a role in smoking. Implications for research and treatment of co-occurring psychological symptoms and smoking are discussed.

AB Background Parental depressive symptoms are associated with emotional and behavioural problems in offspring. However, genetically informative studies are needed to distinguish potential causal effects from genetic confounds, and longitudinal studies are required to distinguish parent-to-child effects from child-to-parent effects.
   Method We conducted cross-sectional analyses on a sample of Swedish twins and their adolescent offspring (n = 876 twin families), and longitudinal analyses on a US sample of children adopted at birth, their adoptive parents, and their birth mothers (n = 361 adoptive families). Depressive symptoms were measured in parents, and externalizing and internalizing problems measured in offspring. Structural equation models were fitted to the data.
   Results Results of model fitting suggest that associations between parental depressive symptoms and offspring internalizing and externalizing problems remain after accounting for genes shared between parent and child. Genetic transmission was not evident in the twin study but was evident in the adoption study. In the longitudinal adoption study child-to-parent effects were evident.
   Conclusions We interpret the results as demonstrating that associations between parental depressive symptoms and offspring emotional and behavioural problems are not solely attributable to shared genes, and that bidirectional effects may be present in intergenerational associations.

AB BackgroundSipping alcohol is common during early adolescence, but research has ignored the distinction between sipping and drinking whole alcohol beverages, conflating the 2, or else simply classifying sippers as abstainers. Research has not addressed whether sippers are different to drinkers, in relation to variables known to be associated with adolescent alcohol consumption, or considered whether sipping and drinking behaviors may have quite different associations.
   MethodsParent-child dyads (N=1,823) were recruited in 3 states from Australian grade 7 classes. Multinomial logistic analyses compared adolescents who had only had a sip/taste of alcohol (sippers) with adolescents who had consumed at least a whole drink (drinkers) in the past 6months. The multivariate model assessed a broad range of demographics, parenting practices, peer influences, and adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and controlled for school clustering.
   ResultsCompared to drinkers, sippers were less likely to come from 1-parent households (odds ratio [OR]=0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35 to 0.98); less likely to come from low-socioeconomic status (SES) households (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.94); more likely to come from families where parents provide stricter alcohol-specific rules (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.32), stricter monitoring of the child's activities (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.16), more consistent parenting practices (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.23), and more positive family relationships (OR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.43); and report having fewer substance-using peers (OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.91) and greater peer disapproval of any substance use (OR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.42). After adjustment for confounders, the associations with household composition and SES were no longer significant, but the familial and peer associations remained significant in the multivariate analysis, (2)(40)=1,493.06, p<0.001.
   ConclusionsSipping alcohol has different associations with known predictors of adolescent alcohol use than drinking whole beverages, and sipping may be a distinct or separable behavior. Future research should better define quantities of early consumption and assess the relationship between early sipping and drinking on long-term outcomes separately.

AB Background: Negative cognitive errors are important in the etiology and treatment of youth internalizing problems, but less is known about their unique relations with anxiety and depression. Aims: The major purpose of this study was to examine associations between distinct negative cognitive errors and anxiety and depression in youth. Method: In a community sample of children and adolescents (aged 9-17; N = 278) negative cognitive errors were assessed using the revised version of the Children's Negative Cognitive Error Questionnaire (CNCEQ-R). Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and Children's Depression Inventory, respectively. Results: The strongest predictors of anxiety were the negative cognitive errors "underestimation of the ability to cope" and "mind reading". The strongest predictors of depression were the errors "selective abstraction" and "overgeneralizing", with the first error explaining most variance. Analyses of age effects showed that, in comparison to adolescents, children reported higher scores on the total CNCEQ-R score, and on the errors "overgeneralizing", "personalizing", and "mind reading". Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of researching the role of distinct cognitive processing in youth with anxiety and depression and further development of the CNCEQ-R. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

AB Background Few studies have analysed the effects of the parenting style used by foster carers on children's behaviour problems. This study examines the role played by the quality of the emotional relationship with foster carers and the kind of discipline they use as regard internalizing and externalizing problems among foster children.
   Methods Participants were 104 foster children (56 boys and 48 girls) and their respective foster families. The Child Behaviour Checklist, the Affect and Communication Scale, and the Rules and Demands Scale were completed by foster parents. A series of linear regression analyses were performed using the stepwise method.
   Results The main findings were as follows: an authoritarian parenting style explained the internalizing problems presented by foster children (11% of the variance); criticism/rejection, authoritarian parenting and permissive parenting explained externalizing problems (37% of the variance); and criticism/rejection and authoritarian parenting explained total problems (29% of the variance). These results indicate that criticism/rejection on the part of foster parents, as well as the use of inappropriate parenting styles (authoritarian and permissive), has an important effect in relation to the behaviour problems of foster children.
   Conclusions This highlights the key role that foster carers play in terms of tackling the behaviour problems that foster children present. The findings also suggest that preparation for fostering should focus especially on ways of helping foster parents both to acquire positive parenting strategies and to avoid authoritarian and permissive parenting.

AB Data were analyzed from a population-based, longitudinal sample of 8,650 U.S. children to (a) identify factors associated with or predictive of oral vocabulary size at 24months of age and (b) evaluate whether oral vocabulary size is uniquely predictive of academic and behavioral functioning at kindergarten entry. Children from higher socioeconomic status households, females, and those experiencing higher quality parenting had larger oral vocabularies. Children born with very low birth weight or from households where the mother had health problems had smaller oral vocabularies. Even after extensive covariate adjustment, 24-month-old children with larger oral vocabularies displayed greater reading and mathematics achievement, increased behavioral self-regulation, and fewer externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors at kindergarten entry.

AB Substantial research has implicated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes independently in adolescent mental health problems, though this literature remains largely inconclusive. Given the cross-talk between the HPA and HPG axes and their increased activation in adolescence, a dual-axis approach that examines both axes simultaneously is proposed to predict the emergence and persistence of adolescent mental health problems. After briefly orienting readers to HPA and HPG axis functioning, we review the literature examining associations between hormone levels and changes with behavior during adolescence. Then, we provide a review of the literature supporting examination of both axes simultaneously and present the limited research that has taken a dual-axis approach. We propose future directions including consideration of between-person and within-person approaches to address questions of correlated changes in HPA and HPG hormones. Potential moderators are considered to increase understanding of the nuanced hormone-behavior associations during key developmental transitions. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We examined psychopathology-neuroendocrine associations in relation to the transition into adolescence within a developmental framework that acknowledged the interdependence of the HPA and HPG hormone systems in the regulation of responses to everyday affective contexts. Saliva samples were collected during anxiety and anger inductions from 51 young adolescents (M13.47, SD=.60 years) to evaluate cortisol, DHEA, and testosterone responses. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at pre-adolescence (M=9.27, SD=.58 years) while youths were in elementary school and concurrently with hormones in early adolescence. Externalizing problems from elementary school predicted adolescents' reduced DHEA reactivity during anxiety induction. Follow up analyses simultaneously examining the contributions of elementary school and adolescent problems showed a trend suggesting that youths with higher levels of internalizing problems during elementary school eventuated in a profile of heightened DHEA reactivity as adolescents undergoing anxiety induction. For both the anxiety and the anger inductions, it was normative for DHEA and testosterone to be positively coupled. Adolescents with high externalizing problems but low internalizing problems marshaled dual axes co-activation during anger induction in the form of positive cortisol-testosterone coupling. This is some of the first evidence suggesting affective context determines whether dual axes coupling is reflective of normative or problematic functioning in adolescence.

AB In clinical child psychology, co-morbidity is the norm rather than exception. Single disorder manuals are limited in their scope and applicability to patients with several presenting problems. Emotion dysregulation and perfectionism are two salient pathways to various internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders in youth. In order to treat these children efficiently and effectively, psychotherapists must be equipped with an approach that is able to target these common corridors to psychopathology. Transdiagnostic modular cognitive behavioral procedures are matched to the individual patients' contexts. The article begins with a brief discussion of emotional regulation, perfectionism, and transdiagnostic modular cognitive behavior therapy. Three confabulated clinical case examples are presented to illustrate the case conceptualization process and the application of modular CBT.

AB The Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2) is used to assess behavioral and emotional outcomes for youth. Research providing evidence for use of the BASC-2 parent-report form historically has included biological parents reporting on their children (Reynolds and Kamphaus 2004). For youth residing in out-of-home placements through enrollment in foster care, caregivers reporting on their functioning may include foster parents or residential staff. Given the significant adverse mental health outcomes for youth in foster care and the need to adequately assess adjustment in foster care, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the measurement properties of caregivers' report on the parent report form (PRS) of the BASC-2 in foster care youth. Using 479 respondents, a measurement model was fit to the data demonstrating adequate fit across Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, and Adaptive Skills. Further, a comparison of measurement properties across child and adolescent groups and groups of youth residing in residential facilities versus foster homes was conducted. Factorial invariance and latent means also were assessed. The BASC-2 PRS was found to be an adequate assessment of psychological outcomes for youth in foster care when completed by foster parents or residential facility staff.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is characterized by excessive daydreaming, mental confusion, slowness, and low motivation. Several teacher-and parent-report measures of SCT have recently been developed but a child self-report measure of SCT does not yet exist despite clear links between SCT and internalizing psychopathology (for which self-report is often desired). This study examined the initial reliability and validity of the Child Concentration Inventory (CCI), a child self-report measure of SCT symptoms, in a school-based sample of 124 children (ages 8-13; 55% female). Children completed the CCI and measures of academic/social functioning, emotion regulation, and self-esteem. Teachers completed measures of psychopathology symptoms (including SCT) and academic/social functioning. Although exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) supported a 3-factor model of the CCI (consisting of slow, sleepy, and daydreamer scales closely resembling the factor structure of the parent-report version of this measure), bifactor modeling and omega reliability indices indicated that the CCI is best conceptualized as unidimensional. CCI scores were significantly correlated with teacher-rated SCT and were statistically distinct from teacher-rated ADHD and child-rated anxiety/depression. After controlling for sex, grade, and other psychopathology symptoms, the CCI total score was significantly associated with poorer child-reported academic/social functioning and self-worth in addition to increased loneliness and emotion dysregulation. Child ratings on the CCI were moderately to strongly correlated with poorer teacher-rated academic/social functioning but these associations were reduced to nonsignificance after controlling for demographics and other psychopathology symptoms. Findings provide preliminary support for the CCI, and future directions include replication with adolescents and clinical samples in order to further examine the CCI's factor structure, reliability, validity, and clinical utility.

AB Although the role of immune marker secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in stress-related health outcomes is gaining recognition, SIgA responsiveness to acute stress has rarely been assessed in adults, and not at all in children. This study was designed to clarify developmental origins of differential immune function-related health risks by investigating youth SIgA responses to psychosocial stressors, including both normative responses and variability related to behavioral problems. Children and adolescents from a larger study (n = 82) gave 6 saliva samples during a laboratory session in which they were exposed to a series of performance or interpersonal stressors. Samples were assayed for SIgA, as well as cortisol (representing hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activity) and alpha-amylase (sAA; representing autonomic nervous system activity). Behavioral problems were assessed with parent-report measures of youth internalizing and externalizing. Youth SIgA trajectories followed a normative pattern of reactivity and recovery around the stressors; however, these responses were blunted in youth with higher externalizing scores. SIgA showed differential associations with cortisol and sAA, and with positive and negative affect; whereas overall levels of SIgA related to cortisol output and positive affect, changes in SIgA over time synchronized with changes in sAA and negative affect. In contrast to SIgA, neither cortisol nor sAA related significantly to behavioral problems. Implications for the role of SIgA during psychosocial stress in the development of immune function-related health risks are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction Sexual-minority youths (SMY) report high rates of psychological distress such as depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation (Burton, Marshal, Chisolm, Sucato et Friedman, 2013; Williams & Chapman, 2011). Several studies confirm that the poor mental health outcomes are partly related to their high likelihood of experiencing homophobic victimization (Blais, Gervais, Boucher, HEbert & Lavoie, 2013; Taylor & Peter, 2011; Hughes, McCabe, Wilsnack, West & Boyd, 2010; Chamberland, Richard & Bernier, 2013). Whereas the development of a positive sexual minority identity is crucial for the mental health of SMY (Chamberland, Richard & Chevrier, 2011; Rosario, Schrimshaw & Hunter, 2011; Luhtanen, 2002), the victimization they experience put them at risk of internalizing societal homophobia and heterosexism (Meyer, 2003; Hatzenbuehler, 2009). It is important to identify variables that may influence the impact of distal and proximal factors that impact SMY's mental health.
   Objectives The objectives of this paper are 1) to document different forms of homophobic victimization experienced by SMY, according to gender and age, and 2) to test the potential moderating effect of parental support in the relationship between homophobic victimization, internalized homophobia and psychological distress.
   Method Data come from 228 SMY aged 14 to 22 years old recruited through online means as part of the Quebec Youth's Romantic Relationships Survey. The impact of homophobic victimization, parental support, and internalized homophobia on psychological distress is explored by a linear regression model including moderated mediation effects.
   Results Results show the relationship between homophobic victimization and psychological distress as well as indirect significant relationship through internalized homophobia. The moderated mediation analysis also confirms the moderating role of parental support in the relationship between homophobic victimization and psychological distress. Thus, at equal level of victimization, participants with low parental support experienced more psychological distress. However, parental support did not lessen the impact of victimization on internalized homophobia. The linear regression model explains 22.5% of the variance in psychological distress and 6.6% of the variance of internalized homophobia.
   Conclusion The results emphasize the importance of continuing efforts to prevent homophobic behaviors and attitudes among school staff, parents as well as employers and colleagues in the workplace. Given their key role, parents must also be educated and trained to support their gay, lesbian, bisexual or questioning children.

AB Objectives: Using a social learning model, the aim of the Sleep Smart Program was to primarily improve sleep health behaviors and secondarily improve academic performance and behavioral well-being.
   Design: Randomized control trial for a social learning-based preventive intervention program.
   Participants: A diverse group of seventh graders from 2 urban, middle schools were randomly assigned, according to school, to an 8-session Sleep Smart Program (SS = 70) or a comparison group (comparison = 73).
   Measurements: Sleep patterns, sleep hygiene, and sleep health efficacy; academic performance; and behavioral well-being were assessed at 4 times of measure (baseline, postintervention, 2 follow-up times in eighth grade).
   Results: SS seventh graders experienced significantly greater sleep health efficacy, improved physiological and emotional sleep hygiene, more time in bed, and earlier bedtimes vs comparison group. SS (vs comparison) participants also reported a significant decrease in internalizing behavior problems and sustained academic performance. Finally, although not maintained at time 4, SS participants continued to report improved sleep health efficacy at time 3, whereas the comparison group participants sleep health efficacy declined.
   Conclusion: The Sleep Smart preventive intervention was effective in improving sleep health efficacy, sleep hygiene, time in bed, and bedtimes; in maintaining grades; and in reducing internalizing behavior problems, yet these changes were not sustained at follow-up.

AB Cohabitation is a family structure that is rapidly increasing in the United States. The current longitudinal study examined the interplay of involvement in a youth's daily activities and firm control parenting by male cohabiting partners (MCPs) on change in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. In a sample of 111 inner-city African American families, adolescents reported on involvement and parenting by MCPs at Wave 1 and biological mothers reported on adolescent problem behaviors at Waves 1 and 2. A significant interaction indicated that low involvement and low firm control by MCPs at Wave 1 were associated with the highest level of internalizing problems at Wave 2. An interaction did not emerge when externalizing problems served as the outcome. The findings indicate that male partners play an important role in parenting adolescents in cohabiting families and should be considered potential participants in prevention and intervention programs.

AB Mental health issues often become apparent as adolescents emerge into young adulthood. The use of mental health services is low among adolescents and young adults, and use is particularly low among minorities. In this study, we examine mental health utilization among diverse young parenting couples. The sample consisted of 296 couples. We used the social-personal framework to examine personal, family, partner relationship, and environmental predictors for using mental health services. We used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to assess actor and partner effects on mental health utilization. We also examined moderator effects for gender and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We found that being female, being White, higher income, more conduct problems, and less anxious romantic attachment predicted mental health utilization. Significant moderator effects included depression x gender, depression x medical insurance, and stress x Latino. Implications for community mental health practice include conducting mental health assessments during medical visits and systematic mental health follow-up for individuals and couples with identified mental health and support needs. Future research should include married couples and the spouse's influence on mental health use and examine relevant parenting factors that may also predict mental health utilization among couples.

AB The present 9-wave, 2-year study examined whether Cole's (1991) theory of self-perceived competence could help explain vulnerability to depressive and anxiety symptoms in a sample of adolescents from mainland China. Participants included 624 adolescents (319 females and 305 males) from an urban school in Changsha (n=308) and from a rural school in Liuyang (n=316). Findings showed that self-perceived academic competence was negatively associated with prospective depressive and anxiety symptoms. Meanwhile, adolescents with low levels of self-perceived social competence were at heightened risk for depressive symptoms during times of increased stressors (supporting a vulnerability-stress model). These findings advance past research by highlighting new developmental pathways for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents.

AB Background: Joiner's interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) proposes that suicide results from the combination of a perception of burdening others, social alienation, and the capability for self harm The theory gained some empirical support, however the overall model has yet to be tested. This study aimed to Lest the main predictions of IPTS in a large community sample of Israeli adolescents.
   Method: 1196 Israeli Jewish and Arab high-school pupils participating in the SEYLE project completed a self report questionnaire measuring perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, health risk behaviors, and non suicidal self injury (risk variables), and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (outcome measures). The data were tested in cross-sectional regression models.
   Results: Consistent with IPTS, perceived burdensomeness was found to interact with thwarted belongingness, predicting suicidal ideation. Depression mediated most of the effect of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness on suicidal ideation. Acquired capability for self-harm, as measured by health risk behaviors and direct non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, predicted suicide attempt. However, this mechanism operated independently from ideation rather than in interaction with it, at variance with IPTS-based predictions. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes conclusions about causality and directionality. Proxy measures were used to test the interpersonal theory constructs.
   Conclusion: The findings support some of the IPTS predictions but not all, and imply two separate pathways for suicidal behavior in adolescents: one related to internalizing psychopathology and the other to self-harm behaviors. This conceptualization has clinical implications for the differential identification of adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior and for the development of prevention strategies.

AB Background: Research in war-torn regions has mainly focused on the impact of traumatic experiences on individual mental health and has found high prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in affected adults and children. However, little is known about the possible protective factors occurring in children's environments in the aftermath of mass trauma. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study with families in Northern Sri Lanka, a region that had been shattered by a long-lasting civil war and devastated by the Asian tsunami in 2004.
   Methods: Schoolchildren aged 7 to 11 (N = 359) were interviewed on the basis of standardized measures to assess children's exposure to traumatic events, mental health symptoms, and parenting behavior as perceived by children. All interviews were carried out by local senior counselors.
   Results: Linear regression analyses identified exposure to mass trauma and family violence as significant risk factors of child mental health whereas parental care emerged as a significant factor associated with fewer behavior problems. In addition, parental care significantly moderated the relationship between mass trauma and internalizing behavior problems.
   Conclusions: Family characteristics seem to be strongly associated with children's mental health even in regions severely affected by mass trauma. This finding is particularly relevant for the development of targeted psychosocial interventions for children and families living in war torn areas.

AB Background: The aim is to examine associations between bullying involvement in adolescence and mental health problems in adulthood.
   Methods: Information on bullying-involvement (being bullied, bully-victim, aggressive toward others) and non-involved was collected from 2464 adolescents in Mid-Norway at mean age 13.7 and again at mean age 14.9. Information about mental health problems and psychosocial functioning was collected about 12 years later at mean age 27.2 (n = 1266).
   Results: All groups involved in bullying in young adolescence had adverse mental health outcomes in adulthood compared to non-involved. Those being bullied were affected especially regarding increased total sum of depressive symptoms and high levels of total, internalizing and critical symptoms, increased risk of having received help for mental health problems, and reduced functioning because of a psychiatric problem in adulthood. While those being aggressive toward others showed high levels of total and internalizing symptoms. Both those being bullied and bully-victims showed an increased risk of high levels of critical symptoms. Lastly, all groups involved in bullying on adolescence had increased risk of psychiatric hospitalization because of mental health problems.
   Conclusion: Involvement in bullying in adolescence is associated with later mental health problems, possibly hindering development into independent adulthood.

AB Background: Parents' perception and awareness about psychiatric illness in children and adolescents is an important determinant of early detection and treatment seeking for the condition. However, there has been limited information about the perception and awareness of parents about these issues as well as their preferred treatment options in Ethiopia. This study is, therefore, aimed at assessing the perception of parents about psychiatric illness in children and adolescents and their preferred treatment options in Jimma, Ethiopia.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 532 parents in Jimma City, Ethiopia from April to May 2013. Parents from the city were invited to participate in this study to assess their knowledge on causes, and manifestations of psychiatric illness in children and adolescents as well as their preferred treatment options if their children exhibited signs and symptoms of mental illness.
   Results: Nearly three quarters of the parents identified genetic factors while approximately 20 % of them mentioned neuro-chemical disturbance as possible causes of their children's mental health problems. On the other hand, magic, curse, and sin were mentioned as causes of mental health problems by 93.2, 81.8 and 73.9 % of the parents, respectively. Externalizing behavioral symptoms like "stealing from home, school or elsewhere" and internalizing symptoms like "being nervous in new situations and easily loses confidence" were perceived by 60.9 and 38.2 % of the parents, respectively. The majority (92.7 %) of parents agreed that they would seek treatment either from religious or spiritual healers if their children developed mental illness.
   Conclusions: The low level of awareness about internalizing symptoms, the widespread traditional explanatory models as well as preference for traditional treatment options might present significant challenges to utilization of child and adolescent mental health services in this population. Public health intervention programs targeting parental attitude regarding the causes and treatment for child and adolescent mental health problems need to be designed and evaluated for their effectiveness in low-income settings. Additionally, including religious and spiritual leaders in the process of educating members of their respective churches and mosques should also be explored.

AB Background: An increasing number of young people have made contact with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). However, only a small proportion of the population with emotional problems, actually seek specialized care. Research concerning the help-seeking process and pathways to care of a clinical sample could help to develop effective health policies to facilitate access to specialized care.
   Aim: To analyze the access pattern for CAMHS, reasons of contact and care pathways of a consecutive sample of first-time patients. Our aim was to analyze the association between source of referral, socio-demographic and clinical variables.
   Methods: Standardized assessment instruments and information concerning access patterns and care pathways were collected from 399 patients at first-time contact with CAMHS in a Northern Italian Region.
   Results: Most patients were referred to CAMHS by school teachers (36 %) or health professionals (32 %), while only 17 % of the parents sought help by themselves. School issues (50 %) and emotional problems (17 %) were the most frequent reasons for contact. The proportion of first-time contacts with no diagnosis of mental disorder at their first consultation did not differ by source of referral. Parents of children who did not receive a clinical diagnosis of mental disorders described them as "psychosocially impaired" and their condition as "clinically severe" likewise parents of patients who received a psychiatric diagnosis. Patients with externalizing problems were more frequently referred by the parents themselves, while youth with internalizing problems were more often referred through health professionals. Families with non-traditional structures (adoptive, foster care, mono-parental) were more likely to consult CAMHS directly, while immigrant youth were more often referred by teachers.
   Conclusion: Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics can affect pathways to care. To improve early access to care for children and adolescents with ongoing mental disorders, a plan for proper action addressed to teachers and health professionals may well be important. This would improve their ability to recognize emotional and behavioral problems and use proper referral pathways, while informative intervention addressed to non-Italian families should inform them about the functioning and the mission of CAMHS.

AB Mental health and social outcomes following acquired brain injury (ABI) in children are often considered to be due to brain insult, but other factors, such as environment, may also play a role. We assessed mental health and social function in children with chronic illness, with and without stroke (a form of ABI), and typically developing (TD) controls to examine environmental influences on these outcomes. We recruited 36 children diagnosed with stroke, 15 with chronic asthma, and 43 TD controls. Children and parents completed questionnaires rating child mental health and social function and distal and proximal environment. TD children had significantly less internalizing and social problems than stroke and asthma groups, and engaged in more social activities than children with stroke. Poorer parent mental health predicted more internalizing and social problems and lower social participation. Family dysfunction was associated with internalizing problems. Lower parent education contributed to children's social function. Children with chronic illness are at elevated risk of poorer mental health and social function. Addition of brain insult leads to poorer social participation. Quality of home environment contributes to children's outcomes, suggesting that supporting parent and family function provides an opportunity to optimize child mental health and social outcomes.

AB There are persistent socioeconomic disparities in many aspects of child development in America. Relative to their affluent peers, children of low socioeconomic status (SES) complete fewer years of education, have a higher prevalence of health problems, and are convicted of more criminal offenses. Based on research indicating that low self-control underlies some of these disparities, policymakers have begun incorporating character-skills training into school curricula and social services. However, emerging data suggest that for low-SES youth, self-control may act as a "double-edged sword,"facilitating academic success and psychosocial adjustment, while at the same time undermining physical health. Here, we examine this hypothesis in a five-wave study of 292 African American teenagers from rural Georgia. From ages 17 to 20 y, we assessed SES and self-control annually, along with depressive symptoms, substance use, aggressive behavior, and internalizing problems. At age 22 y, we obtained DNA methylation profiles of subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These data were used to measure epigenetic aging, a methylation-derived biomarker reflecting the disparity between biological and chronological aging. Among high-SES youth, better mid-adolescent self-control presaged favorable psychological and methylation outcomes. However, among low-SES youth, self-control had divergent associations with these outcomes. Self-control forecasted lower rates of depressive symptoms, substance use, aggressive behavior, and internalizing problems but faster epigenetic aging. These patterns suggest that for low-SES youth, resilience is a "skin-deep" phenomenon, wherein outward indicators of success can mask emerging problems with health. These findings have conceptual implications for models of resilience, and practical implications for interventions aimed at ameliorating social and racial disparities.

AB The study considered individual differences in children's ability to adjust to hospitalization and found the length of hospitalization to be related to adaptive psychological functioning for some children. Applying the theoretical framework of three competing models of gene-X-environment interactions (diathesis stress, differential susceptibility, and vantage sensitivity), the study examined the moderating effect of genetics (DRD4) on the relationship between the length of hospitalization and internalizing and externalizing problems. Mothers reported on children's hospitalization background and conduct problems (externalizing) and emotional symptoms (internalizing), using subscales of the 25 item Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (1). Data on both hospitalization and genetics were available for 65 children, 57% of whom were females, with an average age of 61.4 months (SD = 2.3). The study found length of hospitalization did not predict emotional and behavior problems per se, but the interaction with genetics was significant; the length of hospitalization was related to diminished levels of internalizing and externalizing problems only for children with the 7R allele (the sensitive variant). The vantage sensitivity model best accounted for how the length of hospitalization and genetics related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Background
   Eczema and asthma are common conditions in childhood that can influence children's mental health. Despite this, little is known about how these conditions affect the well-being of children in school. This study examines whether symptoms of eczema or asthma are associated with poorer social and mental well-being in school as reported by children and their teachers at age 8 years.
   Methods
   Participants were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Measures of child well-being in school were child-reported (n = 6626) and teacher reported (n = 4366): children reported on their enjoyment of school and relationships with peers via a self-complete questionnaire; teachers reported child mental well-being using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was > 90th percentile)]. Child rash and wheeze status were maternally reported and symptoms categorised as: 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only).
   Results
   Children with persistent (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.63) and late onset (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.14) rash were more likely to report being bullied, and children with persistent wheeze to feel left out (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.84). Late onset rash was associated with high teacher-reported internalising behaviours (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.54), and persistent rash with high externalising behaviours (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.84). Child sleep and maternal mental health explained some of the associations with teacher-reported mental well-being.
   Conclusion
   Symptoms of eczema or asthma can adversely affect a child's social and mental well-being at primary school. This suggests interventions, such as additional support or education of peers, should begin at early stages in schooling.

AB Introduction: While the presence of externalizing behavioral problems following traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been well established in the literature, less is known regarding internalizing disorders, and more specifically anxiety disorders, in such a population. This study explored the presence, rate, and incidence of internalizing behavior problems, including anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, avoidant personality symptomatology, and overall internalizing behavior problems in university students aged 18-25 years. Method: A convenience sample of 247 university students (197 non-TBI, 47 mild TBI, 2 moderate TBI, 1 severe TBI) aged 18-25 years was utilized. Participants completed a self-report measure on behavioral functioning, the Adult Self Report (ASR), to identify internalizing behaviors, and a questionnaire to identify TBI history. Results: Raw scores of behavior indicated that participants with a history of childhood TBI reported significantly higher levels of withdrawal, somatic complaints, and internalizing behavioral problems than the non-TBI participants. When analyzing standardized T-scores for borderline and clinically elevated ASR syndromes and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented scales, individuals in the TBI group were significantly more likely to have higher rates of borderline anxiety, somatic complaints, avoidant personality problems, and overall internalizing disorders, and clinically elevated somatic complaints. Adults with a history of childhood TBI were also significantly more likely to report at least 1 or more DSM disorders. Conclusion: These results clearly suggest that individuals with a childhood history of TBI are at a heightened risk for a range of internalizing disorders in early adulthood, which is particularly troubling in a university sample pursuing tertiary education.

AB Adolescent bulimia nervosa (BN) remains relatively understudied, and the complex interaction between core eating psychopathology and emotional regulation difficulties provides ongoing challenges for full symptom remission. In an open pilot trial, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of a program integrating family-based treatment (FBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating adolescent BN, without exclusion criteria. Participants were 35 adolescents who underwent partial hospital treatment for BN, and outcomes included measures of core BN pathology and emotional regulation difficulties, as well as parental measures of self-efficacy, completed at intake and discharge. Results indicate significant improvements in overall eating disorder pathology, t(68) = 4.52, p = .002, and in core BN symptoms, including objective binge episodes, t(68) = 2.01, p = .041, and self-induced vomiting, t(68) = 2.90, p = .005. Results also illustrated a significant increase in parental efficacy throughout the course of treatment, t(20) = .081, p = .001, although no global improvement in difficulties in emotion regulation was noted, t(68) = 1.12, p = .285. These preliminary findings support the utility of this integration of FBT and DBT, although raise interesting questions as to the mechanism of symptom remission.

AB Objective
   The purpose of this study was to examine the association between pre and post environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and behavioral problems in schoolchildren.
   Methods
   In the cross-sectional 6 cities Study conducted in France, 5221 primary school children were investigated. Pre- and postnatal exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke at home was assessed using a parent questionnaire. Child's behavioral outcomes (emotional symptoms and conduct problems) were evaluated by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by the parents.
   Results
   ETS exposure during the postnatal period and during both pre- and postnatal periods was associated with behavioral problems in children. Abnormal emotional symptoms (internalizing problems) were related to ETS exposure in children who were exposed during the preand postnatal periods with an OR of 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.36-2.17), whereas the OR was estimated to be 1.38 (95% CI=1.12-1.69) in the case of postnatal exposure only. Abnormal conduct problems (externalizing problems) were related to ETS exposure in children who were exposed during the pre-and postnatal periods with an OR of 1.94 (95% CI=1.51-2.50), whereas the OR was estimated to be 1.47 (95% CI=1.17-1.84) in the case of postnatal exposure only. Effect estimates were adjusted for gender, study center, ethnic origin, child age, low parental education, current physician diagnosed asthma, siblings, preterm birth and single parenthood.
   Conclusion
   Postnatal ETS exposure, alone or in association with prenatal exposure, increases the risk of behavioral problems in school-age children.

AB Introduction: In line with literature, the quality of adult infant interactions and mental representations of the caregivers play an essential role in influencing the children's well-being. Many studies focused the attention on the role of attachment for a better evaluation of child psychopathological outcomes. The flexibility of the child's attachment model gives the opportunity to parents to be helped in modifying their own caregiving quality, encouraging the reflection on the children's state of mind with respect to attachment. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (1) the attachment models in young patients diagnosed with Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs) and Somatic Symptoms Disorders (SSDs); (2) the levels of post-traumatic symptomatology; (3) the association between the attachment models and post-traumatic symptomatology.
   Methods: Forty Italian patients, aged from 8 to 15, recruited at Gaslini Paediatric Hospital of Genoa, previously diagnosed with SSD (N = 20) and DBD (N = 20) were assessed using the Child Attachment Interview (CAI), the Separation Anxiety Test (SAT), the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A). Socio-demographic data were collected.
   Results: In both the clinical samples, the findings on the distribution of attachment models showed a significant presence of insecure attachment with respect to both parents in more than a half of the patients and high levels of disorganized attachment. No significant differences between DBD and SSD samples were found on post-traumatic symptomatology (Post-Traumatic Stress and Dissociation). Significant differences were found on Depression, Anxiety, and Fantasy subscales.
   Discussion: This study can provide a detection of dysfunctional aspects in clinical populations. The findings suggest that the quality of the attachment to parents may be a fundamental element to better assess SSD and DBD in children and adolescents. Clinical implications of this study aimed at improving parental caregiving are highlighted.

AB The present study aims to: (1) estimate the levels of internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors among youth affected by HIV in central Haiti; and (2) examine the risk and protective factors associated with these outcomes to identify potential areas of intervention for HIV-affected youth. Baseline data for 492 youth affected by HIV (ages 10-17) and their 330 caregivers were collected for a pilot study of a psychosocial support intervention. Participants were recruited from a list of HIV-positive patients receiving care at Partners In Health/Zanmi Lasante clinic sites. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Demographic, economic, and social indicators were collected using a structured questionnaire administered by trained social workers. Youth affected by HIV in central Haiti displayed high levels of internalizing and, to a lesser degree, externalizing symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated risk factors most strongly associated with internalizing symptoms (socioeconomic status, parental depressive symptoms) and externalizing behaviors (household living arrangements, such as living with a stepparent). Social support had a protective effect on externalizing behaviors for both caregiver (beta = -0.03, p = 0.01) and self-report (beta = -0.05, p < 0.0001). High levels of psychological distress were observed in this population, especially with respect to internalizing outcomes. Interventions should address the economic security, mental health, and access to antiretroviral therapy for families affected by HIV, as well as emphasize the importance of building supportive caregiver-child relationships to decrease the psychological symptoms and impact of other life stressors experienced by youth affected by HIV in Haiti and similar resource-limited settings.

AB Psychosocial problems increase the risk for mental health problems and increase the need for health care services in children and adolescents. Primary care practice is a valuable avenue for identifying the need for more specialized mental health care. We hypothesized that Korean version of the pediatric symptom checklist (PSC) would be a useful tool for early detection of psychosocial problems in children and adolescents in Korea and we aimed to suggest cut-off scores for detecting meaningful psychosocial problems. A total of 397 children with their parents and 97 child patients with their parents were asked to complete the PSC Korean version and the child behavior checklist (CBCL). The internal reliability and test-retest reliability of the PSC as well as the cut-off score of the PSC was determined via receiver operating characteristic analysis of the CBCL score, clinical group scores and non-clinical group scores. The internal consistency of the PSC-Korean version was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95). The test-retest reliability was r = 0.73 (P < 0.001). Using clinical CBCL scores (total score, externalizing score, internalizing score, respectively >= 60) and presence of clinical diagnosis, the recommended cut-off score of the PSC was 14. Using 494 Korean children aged 7-12 yr, the current study assessed the reliability and validity of a Korean version of the PSC and suggested a cut-off for recommending further clinical assessment. The present results suggest that the Korean version of the PSC has good internal consistency and validity using the standard of CBCL scores.

AB Objective: Potential adverse effects of prenatal antidepressant exposure on child development are still debated. The possibility that associations are due to genetic or familial environmental risk factors rather than antidepressant use per se cannot easily be ruled out in conventional studies. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the association between prenatal antidepressant exposure and behavioural problems in a sibling controlled study.
   Method: This study used data on 20 180 siblings identified from the population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study recruited between 1999 and 2008. The mothers were asked to report antidepressant use at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and 6 months post-partum. Child Behavioral Checklist syndrome scales were used to assess externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems by questionnaires sent to mothers at 18 and 36 months postpartum. We performed unmatched and matched sibling analyses using both random-and fixed-effects linear models, respectively, to determine potential behavioural effects of antidepressant exposure.
   Results: Prenatal exposure to antidepressants was associated with increased levels of anxiety symptoms in 3 year old children after adjusting for maternal familial effects and confounding by indication (i.e. maternal depression). Effect of prenatal exposure to antidepressants was specific to anxiety, and not associated with emotional reactivity, somatic complaints, sleep problems, attention problems or aggression.
   Conclusion: Using a sibling design, we showed that prenatal antidepressant use was specifically associated with increased anxiety symptoms after adjusting for maternal familial factors and confounding by indication.

Participants were 1,680 kindergarten through sixth-grade elementary students from three schools in a northeastern state. Correlation coefficients indicated statistically significant, inverse relationships between SRSS-IE scores and Prosocial Behavior, Motivation to Learn, Reading Skills, and Math Skills subscale scores of the SSiS-PSG. Test-retest stability analyses suggested SRSS-IE and SSiS-PSG scores were stable between fall and spring administrations (p < .0001).

AB The current study investigated whether the relation between child care quality and children's socio-emotional behavior depended on children's affective self-regulation skills and gender. Participants were 545 children (M-age = 27 months) from 60 center-based child care centers in the Netherlands. Multi-level analyses showed that children with low affective self-regulation skills or who were male demonstrated less teacher-rated social competence when exposed to relatively low quality child care. In addition, children with low affective self-regulation skills also showed more social competence in the case of relatively high quality child care, suggesting mechanisms of differential susceptibility. No main effects of child care quality or interactions were found for teacher- and parent-rated externalizing behavior. These findings emphasize the importance of considering children's affective self-regulation skills and gender in understanding the effects of child care quality. High quality child care can be a means to strengthen children's social development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Anxiety symptoms are common in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and directly associated with symptom severity and functional impairment. Family accommodation occurs frequently among individuals with obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders; to date, no data exist on the nature and correlates of family accommodation in youth with ASD and anxiety, as well as its relationship to cognitive-behavioral therapy outcome. Forty children with ASD and a comorbid anxiety disorder participated. Clinicians administered measures of ASD and anxiety disorder caseness, anxiety symptom severity, and family accommodation; parents completed questionnaires assessing social responsiveness, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and functional impairment. A subsample of youth (n = 24) completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Family accommodation was common and positively correlated with anxiety symptom severity, but not functional impairment, general internalizing symptoms, externalizing behavior, or social responsiveness. Family accommodation decreased following cognitive-behavioral therapy with decreases in family accommodation being associated with decreases in anxiety levels. Treatment responders reported lower family accommodation frequency and lower parent impact relative to non-responders. Clinical implications of this study in assessing and psychotherapeutically treating youth with ASD and comorbid anxiety are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although child sexual abuse (CSA) is associated with psychopathology, limited research examined mechanisms through which CSA leads to psychopathology in children. It is generally assumed that CSA is associated with secrecy among children, to our knowledge this assumption has not yet been empirically tested. This gap in our understanding of the aftermath of CSA is surprising in light of abundant evidence linking secrecy to psychopathology among children. The current study examined whether, as compared to children who have not experienced CSA, CSA victims have a greater tendency for secrecy as reported by mothers and children, and whether psychopathology in CSA victims may be explained by their tendency to keep secrets. Sixty-three non-offending mothers and their sexually abused children (68.3% female; M age = 10.89) and 48 mothers and their non-abused children (62.5% female; M age = 11.17) completed questionnaires on secrecy and psychopathology (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behavior problems). Mothers of abused children perceived higher levels of secrecy and psychopathology in their children as compared to mothers of non-abused children. There were no differences in child-reported secrecy between abused and non-abused children. Mediation analyses revealed that mother-reported secrecy mediated the association between CSA and psychopathology. These findings suggest that secrecy is a potential mechanism underlying psychopathology associated with CSA, which has important implications for treatment of abused children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examined differences in offending behavior and psychosocial problems between juvenile offenders who have been sexually abused (n = 231), physically abused (n = 1,568), neglected (n = 1,555), exposed to multiple forms of maltreatment (n =1,767), and non-victims (n = 8,492). In addition, the moderating effect of gender in the association between type of maltreatment and offending behavior/psychosocial problems was examined. Results showed that violent offenses were more common in victims of physical abuse and victims of multiple forms of abuse than in non-victims, both in boys and girls. In boys, sexual offenses were far more common in victims of sexual abuse than in victims of other or multiple forms of maltreatment or in non-victims. In girls, no group differences were found in sexual offending behavior. For both boys and girls, externalizing problems were relatively common in victims of physical abuse and neglect whereas internalizing problems were relatively common in victims of sexual abuse. In victims of multiple forms of maltreatment, both internalizing and externalizing problems were relatively common. Implications for clinical practice are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study explored relationships among parental problem drinking, family functioning, and adolescent externalizing behaviors. The unique effects of maternal and paternal drinking were examined separately for girls and boys. The sample included 14-19 year old U.S. adolescents (M-age = 16.15; SD = .75; 52.5% female) and their parents. Participants completed surveys in the spring of 2007 and 2008. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct path analysis models. Results showed the distinctive and adverse effects of parental problem drinking on adolescent alcohol use, drug use, rule breaking, and aggressive behavior over time. Findings also highlighted the indirect and mediating roles of family functioning. For both girls and boys, family cohesion mediated the relationship between parental problem drinking and adolescent externalizing behaviors. For girls, adolescent father communication predicted increased externalizing behaviors over time. These findings draw attention to the importance of exploring adolescent and parent gender when examining parental problem drinking, family functioning, and externalizing behaviors.

AB Rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are high among female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), and children of parents experiencing PTSS are at increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems. However, little is known about the factors that may explain this relation. We examined child's emotion regulation as a moderator and mother's emotion regulation as a mediator of the relation between mother PTSS and child adjustment. Sixty-four female survivors of IPV and their 6-12-year-old children participated. Mothers reported their own PTSS and their children's adjustment. Child emotion regulation was measured using respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a physiological index of emotion regulation. Mother's emotion regulation was measured from observer coding of the Parent Meta-Emotion Interview (Katz & Gottman, 1986), which asked mothers about their awareness and regulation of emotion. Child emotion regulation moderated the relation between mother's PTSS and child depression and child PTSS. Mothers' total trauma symptom severity showed significant indirect effects on children's internalizing, externalizing, and total problems via mothers' emotion regulation. Results suggest that children's as well as mothers' emotion-regulation abilities represent factors that affect associations between maternal PTSS and child adjustment in families exposed to IPV.

AB Emotional overinvolvement (EOI) in parents' Five Minute Speech Samples (FMSSs; Magana-Amato, 1993) is thought to measure overconcern and enmeshment with one's child. Although related to maladaptive outcomes in studies of adult children, FMSS EOI evidences varied relations with behavior problems in studies with young children. These mixed findings may indicate that certain FMSS EOI criteria reflect inappropriate and excessive involvement with adult children, but do not indicate maladaptive processes when parenting younger children. Thus, this study evaluated relations of each FMSS EOI criterion with changes in child behavior problems from preschool to first grade in a community sample of 223 child-mother dyads (47.98% female; Wave 1 M-age = 49.08 months; 56.50% Hispanic/Latina). Maternal FMSS EOI ratings were obtained at Wave 1, and independent examiners rated child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at Wave 1 and again 2 years later. Path analyses indicated that both the self-sacrifice/overprotection (SSOP) and statements of attitude (SOAs) FMSS EOI criteria predicted increased externalizing problems. In contrast, excessive detail and exaggerated praise were not related to child externalizing behavior problems, and Emotional Display was not evident in this sample. None of the FMSS EOI criteria evidenced significant relations with internalizing behavior problems. Multigroup comparisons indicated that the effect of SOAs on externalizing behavior problems was significant for boys but not for girls, and there were no significant group differences by race/ethnicity. These findings point to the salience of SSOP and SOAs for understanding the developmental significance of EOI in early development.

AB Background: Quality of the parent-child relationship is a robust predictor of behavioral and emotional health for children and adolescents; the application to physical health is less clear. Methods: We investigated the links between observed parent-child relationship quality in an interaction task and antibody response to meningococcal conjugate vaccine in a longitudinal study of 164 ambulatory 10-11 year-old children; additional analyses examine associations with cortisol reactivity, BMI, and somatic illness. Results: Observed Negative/Conflict behavior in the interaction task predicted a less robust antibody response to meningococcal serotype C vaccine in the child over a 6 month-period, after controlling for socio-economic and other covariates. Observer rated interaction conflict also predicted increased cortisol reactivity following the interaction task and higher BMI, but these factors did not account for the link between relationship quality and antibody response. Conclusions: The results begin to document the degree to which a major source of child stress exposure, parent-child relationship conflict, is associated with altered immune system development in children, and may constitute an important public health consideration.

AB Recent work examining the content and organization of attachment representations suggests that 1 way in which we represent the attachment relationship is in the form of a cognitive script. This work has largely focused on early childhood or adolescence/adulthood, leaving a large gap in our understanding of script-like attachment representations in the middle childhood period. We present 2 studies and provide 3 critical pieces of evidence regarding the presence of a script-like representation of the attachment relationship in middle childhood. We present evidence that a middle childhood attachment script assessment tapped a stable underlying script using samples drawn from 2 western cultures, the United States (Study 1) and Belgium (Study 2). We also found evidence suggestive of the intergenerational transmission of secure base script knowledge (Study 1) and relations between secure base script knowledge and symptoms of psychopathology in middle childhood (Study 2). The results from this investigation represent an important downward extension of the secure base script construct.

AB Building on empirical documentation of children's involvement in interparental conflicts as a weak predictor of psychopathology, we tested the hypothesis that involvement in conflict more consistently serves as a moderator of associations between children's emotional reactivity to interparental conflict and their psychological problems. In Study 1, 263 early adolescents (M age = 12.62 years), mothers, and fathers completed surveys of family and child functioning at 2 measurement occasions spaced 2 years apart. In Study 2, 243 preschool children (M age = 4.60 years) participated in a multimethod (i.e., observations, structured interview, surveys) measurement battery to assess family functioning, children's reactivity to interparental conflict, and their psychological adjustment. Across both studies, latent difference score analyses revealed that involvement moderated associations between emotional reactivity and children's increases in psychological (i.e., internalizing and externalizing) problems. Children's emotional reactivity to interparental conflict was a significantly stronger predictor of their psychological maladjustment when they were highly involved in the conflicts. In addition, the developmental benefits and costs of involvement varied as a function of emotional reactivity. Involvement in interparental conflict predicted increases in psychological problems for children experiencing high emotional reactivity and decreases in psychological problems when they exhibited low emotional reactivity. We interpret the results in the context of the new formulation of emotional security theory (e.g., Davies & Martin, 2013) and family systems models of children's parentification (e.g., Byng-Hall, 2002).

DE aggression; targeted prevention; intervention format; group intervention
ID COPING POWER PROGRAM; YOUTH; SAMPLE
AB Objective: Some research suggests that group interventions with antisocial youth may, on occasion, have iatrogenic effects. This is the first study to test the effects of group versus individual delivery of evidencebased intervention for aggressive children. Method: Three hundred sixty fourth-grade children were randomly assigned by school to group coping power (GCP) or individual coping power (ICP). Longitudinal assessments of teacher and parent reports of behavior (Behavior Assessment System for Children [BASC]; Peer Affiliation and Social Acceptance [PASA]) were collected from baseline through a 1-year follow-up. Results: Growth curve analyses revealed that children in both conditions reduced teacher-and parent-reported externalizing behavior problems and internalizing behavior problems by the end of the 1-year follow-up. However, the degree of improvement in teacher-reported outcomes was significantly greater for children receiving an individual version of the program. In addition, children's baseline level of inhibitory control moderated intervention effects, showing children with low initial levels of inhibitory control to respond poorly in teacher-rated outcomes to group interventions compared to those delivered individually. Conclusions: This study suggests overall benefits to children for either group or individual delivery of the Coping Power program under high-fidelity conditions; however, for children with low levels of initial self-regulation, individualized interventions will likely yield the most significant reduction in externalizing behavior in the school setting in preadolescence.

AB The goals of this study were to identify whether barriers that parents perceived to using health care differed by service type (medical vs. mental health care) and whether there were racial/ethnic differences in barriers. Participants were a community sample of 275 parents (34.2% African American, 36.7% Caucasian, and 29.1% Hispanic) of children ages 9-13 years old who rated the extent to which potential barriers in 3 broad domains (stigma-related, logistical, and socioeconomic) would prevent or delay them from obtaining services. They also rated internalizing and externalizing problems exhibited by their child. Overall, parents reported greater socioeconomic and stigma-related barriers to obtaining mental health services than medical services. Hispanic parents reported socioeconomic and stigma-related barriers as more inhibiting than did African-American parents. Findings highlight the importance of strengthening relationships between mental health care providers and the community to reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment for children and better educating parents about the potential benefits of treatment. Policy focused on educating parents about their insurance options and improving insurance coverage may help to reduce socioeconomic barriers.

AB In individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 70-90 % have at least one comorbid non-PTSD disorder.
   This study tested several hypotheses to untangle comorbidity issues. Following McMillen et al. (Compr Psychiatry 43(6):478-485, 2002), we hypothesized that few non-PTSD disorders would arise following traumatic events in children with substantial PTSD symptoms. Second, Repeated Events victims would show more internalizing and externalizing problems compared to Single Event and Hurricane Katrina victims. Third, we aimed to replicate in young children the finding from older populations that exposure to multiple events, not the type of event, would predict severity of symptoms. These results would inform speculations that repeated and prolonged traumas produce greater symptom complexity.
   Children 3-6 years of age were recruited for three types of trauma: Single (n = 62), Hurricane Katrina (n = 85), and Repeated Events (n = 137), and assessed with caregiver reports from a diagnostic interview.
   Overall, 95 % of children who developed new non-PTSD disorders following traumas also had substantial PTSD symptoms. The Katrina and Repeated Events groups showed more diagnoses of oppositional defiant disorder compared to the Single Event group, but groups did not differ on PTSD, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Cumulative number of events was the only significant predictor of PTSD symptoms, while type of trauma and total occurrences of traumas did not predict additional variance.
   These data provide empirical support for targeting interventions on PTSD following traumas and disasters. The homogeneity of outcomes across types of traumas provides little empirical support for speculations that repeated and prolonged traumas produce greater symptom complexity.

AB A sample of 356 children recruited from Head Start (58% European American, 25% African American, and 17% Hispanic; 54% girls; M-age = 4.59 years) were followed longitudinally from prekindergarten through fifth grade. Latent profile analyses of teacher-rated inattention from kindergarten through third grade identified four developmental trajectories: stable low (53% of the sample), stable high (11.3%), rising over time (16.4%), and declining over time (19.3%). Children with stable low inattention had the best academic outcomes in fifth grade, and children exhibiting stable high inattention had the worst, with the others in between. Self-regulation difficulties in preschool (poor executive function skills and elevated opposition-aggression) differentiated children with rising versus stable low inattention. Elementary schools characterized by higher achievement differentiated children with declining versus stable high inattention. Boys and children from single-parent families were more likely to remain high or rise in inattention, whereas girls and children from dual-parent families were more likely to remain low or decline in inattention.

AB We used sex, observed parenting quality at 18 months, and three variants of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (Val(158)Met [rs4680], intron1 [rs737865], and 3-untranslated region [rs165599]) to predict mothers' reports of inhibitory and attentional control (assessed at 42, 54, 72, and 84 months) and internalizing symptoms (assessed at 24, 30, 42, 48, and 54 months) in a sample of 146 children (79 male). Although the pattern for all three variants was very similar, Val(158)Met explained more variance in both outcomes than did intron1, the 3-untranslated region, or a haplotype that combined all three catechol-O-methyltransferase variants. In separate models, there were significant three-way interactions among each of the variants, parenting, and sex, predicting the intercepts of inhibitory control and internalizing symptoms. Results suggested that Val(158)Met indexes plasticity, although this effect was moderated by sex. Parenting was positively associated with inhibitory control for methionine-methionine boys and for valine-valine/valine-methionine girls, and was negatively associated with internalizing symptoms for methionine-methionine boys. Using the regions of significance technique, genetic differences in inhibitory control were found for children exposed to high-quality parenting, whereas genetic differences in internalizing were found for children exposed to low-quality parenting. These findings provide evidence in support of testing for differential susceptibility across multiple outcomes.

AB Children born preterm are at risk for experiencing significant deleterious developmental outcomes throughout their childhood and adolescence. However, individual variation and resilience are hallmarks of the preterm population. The present study examined pathways to resilience across multiple domains (e.g., social activities, peer relations, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomology, externalizing and internalizing behavior, and sleep quality) as children born preterm reached school age. The study also examined early child and family predictors of resilience. Using a prospective longitudinal design, 173 infants born preterm and without significant neurological complications were assessed at five time points: neonatal intensive care unit discharge, 9 months, 16 months, 24 months, and 6 years. Three pathways of adaptation emerged at 6 years: children who were resilient, those who remained at-risk, and children who exhibited significant difficulties. Resilient children were less likely to have experienced negative parenting at 9 and 16 months, more likely to delay gratification at 24 months, and more likely to experience neonatal health complications than nonresilient children.

AB Little is known about how processes underlying maternal psychopathology, such as emotion dysregulation, are related to children's adjustment problems. Further, scant research has explored child protective factors that can buffer these associations. We used a multi-method approach to examine whether child positive affect functions as a protective and/or promotive factor in the context of maternal emotion dysregulation in a cross-sectional sample of 95 mothers (M age = 30.38 years, SD = 6.10) and their preschool-age children (M age = 3.52 years, SD = .52). We assessed maternal emotion dysregulation using respiratory sinus arrhythmia data and a self-report measure. Mothers reported on their children's positive affect as well as their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results yielded significant bivariate relations between maternal self-reported emotion dysregulation and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Moderation analyses indicated that high child positive affect facilitated adjustment across both internalizing and externalizing domains when maternal physiological emotion dysregulation was low. In addition, high child positive affect facilitated adjustment in the internalizing domain when self-reported maternal emotion dysregulation was low. The identification of factors contributing to adjustment problems during the preschool period is crucial given the potential for the prevention of long-term maladaptation, and our results suggest that child positive affect and maternal emotion dysregulation may be important targets for prevention and intervention work.

AB The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) is a parent rating scale widely used to assess disruptive behaviors in children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to assess psychometric properties and conduct standardization of the Korean ECBI. The Korean version of the ECBI was administered to parents of 707 children between the ages 2 and 12 (grade 6) from five areas of South Korea. For Korean children, the means of Intensity and Problem Scale raw scores were 70.7 and 3.5, respectively, much lower than the US norms. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 for the Intensity Scale and 0.93 for the Problem Scale of the Korean ECBI, indicating high internal consistency. The test-retest reliability was 0.92 and 0.97 for the Intensity and Problem Scales (n = 66), respectively. Convergent validity was assessed and confirmed by comparing the ECBI and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The ECBI Intensity Scale score correlated with the total problem score (0.81), externalizing problem score (0.85), and internalizing problem score (0.50) of the CBCL. Both Intensity and Problem Scale scores were significantly different between typical children and children receiving counseling services (n = 88): t = -13.365, t = -11.215, both p = .001, respectively. The factor structure of the ECBI indicated eight factors. Results indicated that the Korean ECBI is psychometrically sound. Further study is recommended to explore and confirm factor structures of the Korean version of the ECBI.

AB Historically, scholars have consistently linked dimensions of parenting (e.g., support, control) to adolescent outcomes (e.g., internalizing and externalizing problems). Many now are working to identify the possible mechanisms that underlie these parenting effects. The present study extended an existing model by hypothesizing and testing adolescent self-esteem as a mediator of the association between perceived parenting (parental support, behavioral control, and psychological control) and youth outcomes (social initiative, depression, and antisocial behavior). Results from structural equation analyses of two, consecutive years of data from adolescents in the southwestern US showed that two aspects of self-esteem (i.e., positive self-esteem and self-derogation) mediated the effects of mothers' and fathers' psychological control on adolescent depression and antisocial behavior. The effects of maternal and paternal support and behavioral control were not mediated by adolescent self-esteem. Implications are discussed.

AB Introduction: Creative bibliotherapy is the guided reading of fiction and poetry relevant to therapeutic needs. Experiencing stories is hypothesized to act on the same mechanisms as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This systematic review assesses the efficacy and effectiveness of creative bibliotherapy for the prevention and treatment of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and the strengthening of prosocial behaviors in children (aged 5-16).
   Method: An electronic search in seven major databases was conducted along with hand searches of key journals and bibliographies. Only randomized or cluster-randomized trials were included. Primary outcomes: internalizing behavior (e.g., anxiety and depression), externalizing behavior (e.g., aggression), and prosocial behavior (e.g., behavioral intentions and attitudes towards others). Secondary outcomes: parent-child relationship, peer relationship, educational attainment and reading ability.
   Results: 9180 records were located after removing duplicates. 9134 were excluded prior to screening. Of the 46 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, eight met the inclusion criteria and 38 were excluded. Meta-analysis was inappropriate due to study heterogeneity. Overall results suggest that creative bibliotherapy has small to moderate effect for internalizing behavior (delta range: 0.48-1.28), externalizing behavior (delta range: 0.53-1.09), and prosocial behavior (delta range: 0-12).
   Conclusion: Creative bibliotherapy can have a small to moderate positive effect on child behavior. Although no definitive model of creative bibliotherapy emerges from the included studies, to some extent all interventions reflected CBT mechanisms. Further research is required to: 1) model the change processes taking place when children experience stories; 2) develop and pilot an intervention; 3) assess subgroup effects by gender, age, modality and literacy.

AB This study examined differences between comorbid internalizing and disruptive behavior disorder (DBD), and those with either internalizing disorder or DBD. We focused on differences with regard to trauma exposure and offending characteristics in 8,431 juvenile justice youths. Self-reported, structured interview and official record data were used. Multinomial logistic regression analysis predicted disorder profile from traumatic exposure, suicide attempt, and offending characteristics, adjusting for background variables. Victimization by non-sexual violence was significantly higher in comorbid than in internalizing youth. Also, the number of DBDs, as well as rates of victimization via sexual and non-sexual assault, was significantly higher in the comorbid than in the DBD group. We conclude that a history of victimization, but not an early onset of criminal behavior, was associated with comorbid internalizing disorder and DBD. Findings emphasize the need for improving identification of this comorbid condition and referral for effective treatment.

AB Neuroticism and extraversion are multifaceted affective-laden personality traits that have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Research and theory have argued that extraversion, and particularly its facet positive emotionality, is specific to MDD, while neuroticism is common across internalizing disorders. Converging evidence has suggested that MDD is associated with reduced engagement with emotional stimuli, but it remains unclear whether either extraversion, neuroticism, or both modulate reactivity to emotional cues. The late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related brain potential that is uniquely suited to assess engagement with emotional stimuli because it reflects sustained attention toward emotional content. The current study examined the LPP in relation to personality traits that may confer risk for depression by examining the relationship between the LPP and both neuroticism and extraversion in never-depressed adolescent girls. Specifically, 550 girls aged 13.5-15.5 with no lifetime history of depression completed an emotional picture-viewing task, and the LPP was measured in response to neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant pictures. Personality traits were gathered via self- and informant report. Results indicated that high extraversion was associated with a potentiated LPP to emotional picturesand this effect was accounted for by positive emotionality in particular. In contrast, there was no association between the LPP and neuroticism or its facets. The present study is one of the first to demonstrate that extraversion is associated with variation in neural indices of emotional picture processing, similar to what has been observed among individuals with depression and at high risk for depression.

AB The present study aims to understand the mental health status of an understudied group of migrant children - children of migrant workers in China. A total of 1,466 children from Beijing participated in the study that compared migrant children (n=1,019) to their local peers (n=447) in public and private school settings. Results showed that overall, migrant children reported more internalizing and externalizing mental health problems and lower life satisfaction than local peers. However, public school attendance served as a protective factor for migrant children's mental health. The mental health status of migrant children attending public schools, including externalizing problems as well as friend and school satisfaction, was not different from local children. In addition, our data indicates that the protective effect of public school attendance for migrant children may be even more salient among girls than boys, and for younger children than older children.

AB This study investigated developmental trajectories for prosocial behavior for a sample followed from the age of 10-18 and examined possible adjustment outcomes associated with membership in different trajectory groups. Participants were 136 boys and 148 girls, their teachers, and their parents (19.4 percent African-American, 2.4 percent Asian, 51.9 percent Caucasian, 19.5 percent Hispanic, and 5.8 percent other). Teachers rated children's prosocial behavior yearly in grades 4-12. At the end of the 12th grade year, teachers, parents, and participants reported externalizing behaviors and participants reported internalizing symptoms, narcissism, and features of borderline personality disorder. Results suggested that prosocial behavior remained stable from middle childhood through late adolescence. Group-based mixture modeling revealed three prosocial trajectory groups: low (18.7 percent), medium (52.8 percent), and high (29.6 percent). Membership in the high prosocial trajectory group predicted lower levels of externalizing behavior as compared with the low prosocial trajectory group, and for girls, lower levels of internalizing symptoms. Membership in the medium prosocial trajectory group also predicted being lower on externalizing behaviors. Membership in the high prosocial trajectory group predicted lower levels of borderline personality features for girls only.

AB Despite the great number of children affected by anxiety and depression, developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders are not well understood. The current study applied a group-based modeling approach to examine the interplay between the temperamental trait of negative emotionality and parenting on internalizing symptoms from early childhood to adolescence. Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 881), analyses revealed that a four-group model best characterized trajectories of internalizing symptoms from the age of 4.5 to the age of 15. Interestingly, children with high negative emotionality were more likely to belong to groups with elevated levels of internalizing symptoms if their mothers exhibited high warmth/sensitivity. Our findings add to the understanding of developmental pathways of internalizing problems from early childhood to adolescence by suggesting that certain combinations of temperament and parenting may increase youth's propensity to develop internalizing problems.

   disorder; Residential and home-based therapeutic service
AB The influence of severe emotional and behavioral disorders in youth on their parents is a complex, yet understudied topic. There is a dearth of literature in which the experiences of parents of youth who access intensive mental health treatment have been reported. The purpose of this study was to explore parents' self-reported sense of competence in relation to their relationship status and in relation to the severity of their children's symptoms. Data for this report were collected in a larger study on the psychosocial outcomes of youth accessing residential or intensive home-based treatment. In the current study, parental sense of competence was negatively associated with severity of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in children. Separated parents rated their parenting competence statistically significantly higher than divorced parents, though the practical significance of this finding is uncertain. Implications for social work research and practice are discussed.

AB This study examined the role of child temperament as moderator of the effect of parenting style on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. A series of structural equation models were fit to a representative sample of 2,631 Canadian children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. In addition to testing for the presence of Temperament x Parenting interactions, these models also examined the direct and indirect effects of a number of additional contextual factors such as neighborhood problems, neighborhood cohesion, social support, and maternal depression. The results indicate that exposure to more positive parenting reduces behavior problems in children with difficult/unadaptable temperaments. No moderating effects of temperament on hostile parenting were found. Such results serve to highlight the pivotal role of positive features of the rearing environment as catalysts for the successful adaptation of children with difficult/unadaptable temperaments. The results of this modeling work also serve to emphasize the importance of considering the ways in which more distal factors can affect children's behavioral adaptation by contributing to changes in proximal family processes.

AB This longitudinal study compares developmental changes in psychosocial functioning during the transition into school of children with and without dyslexia. In addition, it examines the effects of gender and family risk for dyslexia in terms of the associations between dyslexia and psychosocial functioning. Children's psychosocial functioning (social skills, inattention and externalizing and internalizing problems) was evaluated by their parents at ages 4, 6 and 9, and diagnosis for dyslexia was made at age 8 (in grade 2). The findings indicated that children with dyslexia were already rated as having poorer social skills and being more inattentive than were typical readers before their entry into school. Significant interactions of gender and diagnosis of dyslexia emerged for social skills and inattention. The social skills of boys with dyslexia improved after school entry as compared to the level of girls without dyslexia, whereas the social skills of girls with dyslexia did not improve. Boys with dyslexia were rated as showing a high level of inattention both prior to and after school entry, whereas, for girls with dyslexia, inattention ratings increased after school entry, eventually matching the boys' levels.

AB Anxiety symptoms are one of the most common diseases in youth worldwide. However, there is still scant literature on the role that cross-cultural factors may play in the expression and development of anxiety. Our study is aimed to compare anxiety symptoms in community based Chinese and Italian adolescents using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). In addition to the SCAS, the 3416 adolescents (13-18 years old) involved in the study, filled in the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). A multi-group factor analysis confirmed the adequacy of a 6-factor inter-correlated model across the countries. Results supported the convergent validity between the SCAS and the internalizing behaviours and the divergent validity between the SCAS and the externalizing problems, as measured by the SDQ. Chinese adolescents reported higher anxiety symptoms than Italian ones and girls scored higher than boys. No age differences were found. In addition, a comparison between the current research and previous studies conducted in China and Italy was carried out, showing few significant differences among the studies concerning the Italian samples. However, our Chinese adolescents reported greater anxiety symptoms compared to previous studies. Results support the use of the SCAS as a potentially valuable tool for assessing anxiety symptoms in both countries. The discussion highlighted the importance to consider cultural, as well as sub-cultural issues as to promote the understanding and prevention of anxiety symptoms in adolescence.

AB BackgroundIt is generally believed that parental rejection of children leads to child maladaptation. However, the specific effects of perceived parental acceptance-rejection on diverse domains of child adjustment and development have been incompletely documented, and whether these effects hold across diverse populations and for mothers and fathers are still open questions.
   MethodsThis study assessed children's perceptions of mother and father acceptance-rejection in 1,247 families from China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States as antecedent predictors of later internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, school performance, prosocial behavior, and social competence.
   ResultsHigher perceived parental rejection predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and decreases in school performance and prosocial behavior across 3years controlling for within-wave relations, stability across waves, and parental age, education, and social desirability bias. Patterns of relations were similar across mothers and fathers and, with a few exceptions, all nine countries.
   ConclusionsChildren's perceptions of maternal and paternal acceptance-rejection have small but nearly universal effects on multiple aspects of their adjustment and development regardless of the family's country of origin.

AB Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children. Previous research has shown that most of the injuries occur in and around the home. Therefore, parents have a key role in the occurrence and prevention of injuries. In this study, we examined the relationship among home injuries to children and parental attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, parental attitudes, and children's behavioral problems.Forty children who were admitted to the emergency department because of home injuries constitute the study group. The control group also consisted of 40 children, who were admitted for mild throat infections. The parents filled out questionnaires assessing parental ADHD, child behavioral problems, and parenting attitudes.Scores were significantly higher for both internalizing disorders and externalizing disorders in study groups. We also found that ADHD symptoms were significantly higher among fathers of injured children compared with fathers of control groups. Democratic parenting was also found to correlate with higher numbers of injuries.Parenting style, as well as the psychopathology of both the parents and children, is important factors in children's injuries. A child psychiatrist visit following an emergency procedure may help to prevent further unintentional injuries to the child.

AB BACKGROUND: Animal research has suggested that prenatal serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant exposure causes increased anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood. We examined whether in utero SRI exposure influenced externalizing and internalizing behaviors in children at 3 y and again at 6y of age.
   Methods: We recruited women in their second trimester of pregnancy from primary maternity care providers in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada. We compared the internalizing, externalizing, and the anxious and attention subscales of the internalizing behaviors scores of children exposed to SRIs and children not exposed to SRIs at age 3 and age 6.
   Results: We included 110 mother-child pairs (44 exposed to SRI and 66 not exposed). Higher levels of internalizing and anxious behaviors were reported in SRI exposed children at both 3 and 6 y of age compared with children who were not exposed (F = 7.52, P = 0.0072 and F = 7.91, P = 0.0058, respectively). The fully adjusted hierarchical regression models indicated a positive and significant relationship between SRI exposure and increased internalizing and anxious behaviors even when controlling for maternal mood during pregnancy, postpartum and childhood.
   Conclusion: SRI exposure was associated with sustained higher levels of internalizing behaviors in early childhood even when controlling for Maternal depression.

TI Identifying Priorities for Mental Health Interventions in War-Affected

AB BACKGROUND: War-affected youth often suffer from multiple co-occurring mental health problems. These youth often live in low-resource settings where it may be infeasible to provide mental health services that simultaneously address all of these co-occurring mental health issues. It is therefore important to identify the areas where targeted interventions would do the most good.
   METHODS: This analysis uses observational data from 3 waves of a longitudinal study on mental health in asampleof529war-affectedyouth(24.2% female; ages 10-17 at T1,2002) in SierraLeone. We regressed 4 mental health outcomes at T3 (2008) on internalizing (depression/anxiety) and externalizing (hostility/aggression) problems and prosocial attitudes/behaviors and community variables at T2 (2004) controlling for demographics, war exposures, and previous mental health scores at T1, allowing us to assess the relative impact of potential mental health intervention targets in shaping mental health outcomes over time.
   RESULTS: Controlling for baseline covariates at T1 and all other exposures/potential intervention targets at T2, we observed a significant association between internalizing problems at T2 and 3 of the 4 outcomes at T3: internalizing (beta = 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11-0.42), prosocial attitudes (beta = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.07) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (beta = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.02-0.43). No other potential intervention target had similar substantial effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in internalizing may have multiple benefits for other mental health outcomes at a later point in time, even after controlling for confounding variables.

AB The prevention of intimate partner violence is a desirable individual and public health goal for society. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of adolescent risk factors for partner violence in order to inform the development of evidence-based prevention strategies. We utilize data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, a two decade long prospective study of a representative community sample of 1000 participants that has extensive measures of adolescent characteristics, contexts, and behaviors that are potential precursors of partner violence. Using a developmental psychopathology framework, we assess self-reported partner violence perpetration in emerging adulthood (ages 20-22) and in adulthood (ages 29-30) utilizing the Conflict Tactics Scale. Our results indicate that risk factors for intimate partner violence span several developmental domains and are substantially similar for both genders. Internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors as well as early intimate relationships are especially salient for both genders. Additionally, cumulative risk across a number of developmental domains places adolescents at particularly high risk of perpetrating partner violence. Implications for prevention include extending existing prevention programs that focus on high risk groups with multiple risks for developmental disruption, as well as focusing on preventing or mitigating identified risk factors across both genders.

AB The co-morbidity of motor coordination and mental health problems is an increasing concern. While links between poor motor coordination and mental health have been examined extensively in individuals born at normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 g), relatively little research has examined these associations in special populations, particularly those born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g). In this study, we examined whether birth weight status (ELBW vs. NBW) moderated associations between motor coordination problems and levels of mental health problems from childhood into the fourth decade of life. The present study utilized the oldest known prospectively followed, population-based cohort of ELBW survivors (n = 151). This group was born between 1977 and 1982 in Ontario, Canada and was compared to a matched group of NBW controls (n = 145). Mental health problems were measured at age 8 using parent and teacher reports, and at age 22-26 and 29-36 using self-reports. Childhood motor coordination was retrospectively reported at age 29-36. In both ELBW and NBW groups, childhood coordination problems were associated with elevated levels of inattention and symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, we observed stronger associations between childhood motor coordination problems and mental health problems in NBW controls at 22-26 and 29-36 years of age than in ELBW survivors. Our findings highlight the importance of recognizing and screening for motor coordination problems not only in vulnerable, at-risk children, but in all children, as motor difficulties appear to be associated with mental health problems well into adult life.

AB Temperament characteristics, such as higher negative emotionality (NE) and lower effortful control (EC), are individual difference risk factors for developmental psychopathology. Research has also noted relations between temperament and more specific manifestations of psychopathology, such as eating disorders (EDs). Although work is emerging that indicates that NE and EC may additively contribute to risk for ED symptoms, no studies have considered the interactive effects of NE and EC in relation to ED symptoms. In the current investigation, we hypothesized that (1) low EC would be associated with increased ED symptoms, (2) high NE would be associated with increased ED symptoms, and (3) these temperament traits would interact, such that the relationship between NE and ED symptoms would be strongest in the presence of low EC. After controlling for gender and child trauma history, emerging adults' (N=160) lower EC (i.e., more difficulties with self-regulation) was associated with more ED symptoms. NE did not emerge as a direct predictor of ED symptoms. However, the anticipated interaction of these temperament characteristics on ED symptoms was found. The association between NE and ED symptoms was only significant in the context of low EC. These findings provide evidence that elevated NE may only be a risk factor for the development of eating disorders when individuals also have self-regulation difficulties. The implications of these findings for research and interventions are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines concurrent and prospective relations between children's threat and self-blame appraisals of interparental conflict, their involvement in interparental conflict, and their internalizing and externalizing problems. 539 children aged 7-10 years old and their mothers participated in the study. They completed 3 assessments spaced 6 months apart. At each assessment, children reported on their threat and self-blame appraisals of interparental conflict, their conflict involvement, and their internalizing and externalizing problems. Mothers also reported on children's internalizing and externalizing problems. In concurrent analyses, threat and self-blame appraisals and conflict involvement were each positively and independently associated with children's adjustment problems. Threat related more strongly to internalizing problems than to externalizing problems; self-blame related more strongly to externalizing problems than to internalizing problems. Threat appraisals were associated with children's adjustment problems prospectively, but self-blame appraisals and conflict involvement were not. Although threat and self-blame appraisals and conflict involvement may each contribute to children's concurrent adjustment problems, threat appraisals appear most salient to their future adjustment problems.

AB Many victimized youngsters are at risk of developing internalizing problems, and this risk seems to be especially pronounced when they are genetically vulnerable for these problems. It is unclear, however, whether protective features of the school environment such as anti-bullying classroom policies and teacher's perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations can mitigate these negative outcomes. Using a genetically informed design based on twins, this study examined the potential moderating role of classroom anti-bullying policies and teachers' perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations in regard to the additive and interactive effects of peer victimization and genetic vulnerability on anxiety symptoms. To this end, 208 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins (120 girls) rated their level of anxiety and peer victimization in grade 6 (mean age = 12.1 years, SD = 2.8). Teachers rated their self-efficacy in handling bullying situations and the extent of anti-bullying classroom policies. Multilevel regressions revealed triple interactions showing that genetic disposition for anxiety predicted actual anxiety for twins who were highly victimized by their peers, but only when their teachers had low perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations or when anti-bullying classroom rules were absent or rarely enforced. In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms. Anti-bullying programs should continue to promote teachers' involvement, as well as the enforcement of anti-bullying classroom policies, in order to diminish peer victimization and its related consequences.

AB Large individual differences in adolescent mental health following chronic psychosocial stress suggest moderating factors. We examined two established moderators, basal cortisol and parental psychiatric history, simultaneously. We hypothesized that individuals with high basal cortisol, assumed to indicate high context sensitivity, would show relatively high problem levels following chronic stress, especially in the presence of parental psychiatric history. With Linear Mixed Models, we investigated the hypotheses in 1917 Dutch adolescents (53.2 % boys), assessed at ages 11, 13.5, and 16. Low basal cortisol combined with the absence of a parental psychiatric history increased the risk of externalizing but not internalizing problems following chronic stress. Conversely, low basal cortisol combined with a substantial parental psychiatric history increased the risk of internalizing but not externalizing problems following chronic stress. Thus, parental psychiatric history moderated stress- cortisol interactions in predicting psychopathology, but in a different direction than hypothesized. We conclude that the premise that basal cortisol indicates context sensitivity may be too crude. Context sensitivity may not be a general trait but may depend on the nature of the context (e.g., type or duration of stress exposure) and on the outcome of interest (e.g., internalizing vs. externalizing problems). Although consistent across informants, our findings need replication.

AB Decades of research supports the presence of significant genetic influences on children's internalizing (emotional), externalizing (acting out), and social difficulties, including victimization. Additionally, being victimized has been shown to relate to further behavioral problems. The current study assessed the nature of the gene-environment relationships between the DRD4 gene, peer victimization, and externalizing and internalizing difficulties in 6- to 10-year-old children. 174 children (56 % girls; 88.6 % Caucasian, 3.4 % African American, 8 % mixed race or Mayan) and their parents were administered victimization and problem behavior questionnaires, and DRD4 was genotyped for the children. An interaction between genes (DRD4) and environment (victimization) was significant and supported the differential susceptibility model for verbal victimization and child-reported externalizing behaviors. Children with the DRD4 7-repeat allele were differentially responsive to the verbal victimization environment, such that those experiencing little to no victimization reported significantly lower levels of externalizing behaviors, but if they experienced high amounts of victimization, they reported the highest levels of externalizing behaviors. Thus, consideration of how genes and environment affect children's experiences of victimization prior to adolescence is essential for understanding the trajectory of both externalizing and internalizing behaviors during adolescent development.

AB The benefits of an autonomy supportive environment have been established as a key component in children's development at various ages. Nonetheless, research examining the outcomes of early autonomy supportive environments has largely neglected socio-emotional development. The first objective of the present longitudinal study was to examine the socio-emotional outcomes associated with maternal autonomy support during the preschool period. Second, we explored the contextual specificity of the relationships between maternal autonomy support and children's later socio-emotional outcomes. Finally, we investigated the indirect effect of maternal autonomy support on children's later socio-emotional outcomes through earlier children's socio-emotional outcomes. Sixty-six mothers and their pre-school aged children (41 girls) were followed during preschool (Time 1), elementary school (Time 2) and preadolescence (Time 3). Maternal autonomy support (Time 1) was measured in two contexts (free-play and interference task) using observational coding. Furthermore, the children's internalizing and externalizing problems as well as their social competence were measured at Times 2 and 3. The results revealed the importance of maternal autonomy support during preschool for children's later socio-emotional development, especially during challenging contexts, and the mediating role of children's socio-emotional outcomes during elementary school in the link between maternal autonomy support during the preschool years and children's later socio-emotional outcomes during preadolescence. The results highlight the contextual specificity of the relationship between maternal autonomy support and children's later socio-emotional development and reveal one of the mechanisms through which the effect of early childhood parental autonomy support on children's later socio-emotional development is carried forward over time.

AB Sleep-related problems (SRPs) are common and problematic among anxious youth but have not been investigated in anxious youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were 102 youth (ages 7-16 years) with ASD and comorbid anxiety. Youth and their primary caregiver were administered the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale. Parents completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children-Parent (MASC-P) Report, Social Responsiveness Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A measure of SRPs was created from items from the CBCL and MASC-P. Results suggest SRPs were relatively common among youth with ASD and comorbid anxiety. The number of SRPs endorsed directly associated with parent ratings of social deficits, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, as well as with clinician-rated anxiety symptoms. Parent-rated internalizing symptoms predicted frequency of SRPs over and above social deficits, externalizing symptoms, and parent- and clinician-rated anxiety symptoms. A subset of 40 participants who completed family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) experienced reduced SRPs following treatment. Implications, study limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB Adolescence is a unique period of heightened emotional arousal and still-developing regulatory abilities. Adolescent emotion regulation patterns may be critically involved in adolescents' psychosocial development, but patterns of emotion regulation in youths are not well understood. The current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to elucidate patterns of emotion expression, experience, and emotion-related physiological arousal in adolescents. A sample of 198 adolescents and their primary caregivers participated in an emotionally arousing parent-adolescent conflict interaction. Adolescents' observed emotion expressions, emotion experiences, and heart rate (HR) and caregiver parenting behaviors were assessed during and/or after the interaction. Parents reported on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and youths reported on depressive symptoms. The LPA revealed four emotion regulation profiles: a moderate HR and high expression profile, a suppression profile (with low negative emotion expression and high emotion experience), a low reactive profile, and a high reactive profile. The moderate HR and high expression profile was associated with lower conduct disorder symptoms, the suppression profile was related to lower anxiety symptoms, and the high reactive profile was associated with higher adolescent depressive symptoms. The high reactive profile and moderate HR and high expression profile were associated with more negative/critical parenting behaviors. Findings suggest that profiles of adolescent emotion regulation can be empirically identified and may be significant risk factors for psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Substance use and abuse is a growing problem among adolescents with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (ID). Substance use patterns in general population are similar to patterns among non-disabled peers, but substance use has more negative consequences for adolescents with mild to borderline ID, and they are at an increased risk for developing a substance use disorder. Nevertheless, effective and evidence based prevention programs for this groups are lacking. The study described in this protocol tested the effectiveness of a selective intervention aimed at reducing substance use in adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems. In the intervention, participants acquire competences to deal with their high-risk personality traits.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 14-21-year old adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems admitted to treatment facilities in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria are previous substance use and personality risk for substance use. Participants will be individually randomized to the intervention (n = 70) or control (n = 70) groups. The intervention group will be exposed to six individual sessions and five group sessions carried out by two qualified trainers over six-week period. Primary outcomes will be the percentage reduction in substance use (for alcohol: percentage decrease of binge drinking, weekly use and problematic use, for cannabis: the percentage decrease of lifetime cannabis use and weekly use and for hard drug: the percentage decrease of lifetime use). Secondary outcomes will be motives for substance use, intention to use, and internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. All outcome measures will be assessed after two, six, and twelve months after the intervention.
   Discussion: This study protocol describes the design of an effectiveness study of a selective prevention program for substance use in adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems. We expect a significant reduction in alcohol, cannabis and hard drug use among adolescents in the intervention group compared with the control group.

AB Background: Although adolescents are often referred to residential treatment centres because of severe externalizing behaviours, a vast majority demonstrated comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety. Covert internalizing symptoms in these adolescents might be easily unrecognized and therefore untreated. Adolescents with mild intellectual disability (MID) are overrepresented among youth with both externalizing and internalizing problems. There are yet few treatment programs available for adolescents with both externalizing and internalizing problems.
   Methods/design: The CBT-based resiliency program, Op Volle Kracht (OVK), which is based on the US Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), was adapted to suit the needs of adolescents with both externalizing and internalizing problems, either with or without MID, in Dutch residential treatment centres. The effectiveness of this group intervention program of eight sessions will be tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with N = 182 adolescents aged 12-16, allocated to either the target intervention plus treatment as usual (OVK + TAU) or treatment as usual only (TAU). The main outcome variables include depressive symptoms (primary), anxiety, behavioural problems, and group therapeutic climate. Cognitive styles and coping styles will be included as possible mediators. Assessments take place at baseline (T1), one week before the start of the program (T2), immediately after the program (T3), and at three months follow-up (T4).
   Discussion: The program assets include its wide implementation possibilities due to low costs, the short duration of the program and the delivery by group care workers, and its suitability for adolescents with MID. Further strengths of the present study design include its robust method (RCT), the ecological validity, and the inclusion of possible mediators of treatment effect. The program emphasizes individual risk factors for depression rather than social and family factors. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

AB Exposure to parental depression and anxiety is known to heighten the risk of internalizing symptoms and disorders in children and adolescents. Ample research has focused on the influence of maternal depression and anxiety, but the contribution of psychopathology in fathers remains unclear. We studied the relationships of perceived maternal and paternal psychopathology with adolescents' depression and anxiety symptoms in a general population sample of 862 adolescent girls (age M = 12.39, SD = 0.79). Assessments included adolescents' self-reports of their own depression and anxiety as well as their reports of maternal and paternal psychopathology. We found that perceived maternal and paternal psychopathology were both related to depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescent girls. A combination of higher maternal and paternal psychopathology was related to even higher levels of depression and anxiety in adolescent girls. Our findings showed that adolescents' perceptions of their parents' psychopathology are significantly related to their own emotional problems.

AB During adolescence, considerable social and biological changes occur that interact with functional brain maturation, some of which are sex-specific. The amygdala is one brain area that has displayed sexual dimorphism, specifically in socio-affective (superficial amygdala [SFA]), stress (centromedial amygdala [CMA]), and learning and memory (basolateral amygdala [BLA]) processing. The amygdala has also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific features, most prominently observed during adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the interaction of age and sex on resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of amygdala sub-regions, BLA and SFA, in a sample of healthy adolescents between the ages 10 and 16 years (n = 122, 71 boys). Whole-brain, voxel-wise partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine RSFC of bilateral BLA and SFA seed regions, created using the Eickhoff-Zilles maximum probability maps based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST). Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to correct for multiple comparisons (threshold of 53 contiguous voxels with a z-value >= 2.25). Results indicated that with increasing age, there was a corresponding decrease in RSFC between both amygdala sub-regions and parieto-occipital cortices, with a concurrent increase in RSFC with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Specifically, boys and girls demonstrated increased coupling of mPFC and left and right SFA with age, respectively; however, neither sex showed increased connectivity between mPFC and BLA, which could indicate relative immaturity of fronto-limbic networks that is similar across sex. A dissociation in connectivity between BLA- and SFA-parieto-occipital RSFC emerged, in which girls had weaker negative RSFC between SFA and parieto-occipital regions and boys had weaker negative RSFC of BLA and parieto-occipital regions with increased age, both standing in contrast to adult patterns of amygdala sub-regional RSFC. The present findings suggest relative immaturity of amygdala sub-regional RSFC with parieto-occipital cortices during adolescence, with unique patterns in both sexes that may support memory and socio-affective processing in boys and girls, respectively. Understanding the underlying normative functional architecture of brain networks associated with the amygdala during adolescence may better inform future research of the neural features associated with increased risk for internalizing psychopathology.

   ASSOCIATION
AB Background: The relationship between early adverse life events and later internalizing problems could be mediated by DNA methylation. Adversity has been associated with higher methylation levels in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in adolescents. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation with adolescents' clinical diagnoses of internalizing disorders and internalizing symptom scores.
   Methods: In a population sample (mean age=162) we measured DNA methylation in three regions of NR3C1 (NR3C1_1, N=454; NR3C1_2, N=904; NR3C1_3, N=412) and one region of SLC6A4 (N=939) at baseline. Internalizing problems were operaLionalized as clinical DSM-IV diagnoses, assessed at 3 year follow-up with a diagnostic interview, and internalizing symptom scores, assessed with Self Report questionnaires at baseline and follow-up.
   Results: Only NR3C1_1 methylation was positively associated with risk of lifetime internalizing disorders, and with symptom scores at follow-up. However, after accounting for baseline symptom scores there was only a tendency for association with internalizing symptom scores at follow-up. There was no association between SLC6A4 methylation and risk of lifetime internalizing disorders. SLC6A4 methylation and internalizing symptom scores showed a tendency for association, also after accounting for baseline symptom scores.
   Limitations: There was no repeated measure of DNA methylation to study causality between methylation and internalizing problems. Gene expression data were not available.
   Conclusions: Although the role of gene methylation in the development of internalizing problems remains unclear, our findings suggest that gene methylation, particularly of NR3C1, may be involved in the development of internalizing problems in adolescence.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of neurocognitive functioning with internalizing and externalizing problems and school and social competence in children adopted internationally. Method: Participants included girls between the ages of 6-12years who were internationally adopted from China (n=32) or Eastern Europe (n=25) and a control group of never-adopted girls (n=25). Children completed the Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and the Score! and Sky Search subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and the Home and Community Social Behavior Scales. Results: Compared to the controls, the Eastern European group evidenced significantly more problems with externalizing behaviors and school and social competence and poorer performance on measures of verbal intelligence, perceptual reasoning, and auditory attention. More internalizing problems were reported in the Chinese group compared to the controls. Using generalized linear regression, interaction terms were examined to determine whether the associations of neurocognitive functioning with behavior varied across groups. Eastern European group status was associated with more externalizing problems and poorer school and social competence, irrespective of neurocognitive test performance. In the Chinese group, poorer auditory attention was associated with more problems with social competence. Conclusions: Neurocognitive functioning may be related to behavior in children adopted internationally. Knowledge about neurocognitive functioning may further our understanding of the impact of early institutionalization on post-adoption behavior.

AB This study assessed whether perceptions of others' reactions to disclosure are related to psychological and physical outcomes among individuals with a history of child sexual abuse. Eighty-six female undergraduates completed a series of questionnaires assessing child sexual abuse, nonsexual trauma, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, somatic symptoms, disclosure, and social reactions to disclosure. Those who reported child sexual abuse endorsed higher levels of psychological and physical symptoms than those who reported a nonsexual traumatic event. Child sexual abuse survivors who reported more hurtful responses to disclosure had higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and physical symptoms than nonsexual trauma survivors. These findings suggest that many survivors of CSA may need psychological services, and an important focus of treatment may be assessing and strengthening social support.

AB Parents play a central role in utilization of mental health services by their children. This study explored the relationship between parents' recognition of child mental health problems and their decisions to seek help. Participants included 251 parents (49% Black, 51% White; 49% fathers, 51% mothers) recruited from community settings. Parents ranged in age from 20 to 66 years old with at least one child between ages 2 and 21. Parents read three vignettes that described a child with an anxiety disorder, ADHD, and no clinically significant diagnosis. Parents completed measures of problem recognition, perception of need, willingness to seek help, and beliefs about causes of mental illness. Findings from Generalized Estimating Equations revealed that parents were more likely to report intentions to seek help when they recognized a problem (odds ratio [OR]=41.35, p<.001), 95% confidence interval (CI) [14.81, 115.49]; when it was an externalizing problem (OR=1.85, p<.05), 95% CI [1.14, 3.02]; and when parents were older (OR=1.04, p<.05), 95% CI [1.01, 1.08]. Predictors of parental problem recognition included perceived need, prior experience with mental illness, and belief in trauma as a cause of mental illness. Predictors of help-seeking intentions included problem recognition, perceived need, externalizing problem type, and being female. Given the relationship between parental problem recognition and willingness to seek help, findings suggest that efforts to address disparities in mental health utilization could focus on problem-specific, gender-sensitive, mutable factors such as helping parents value help-seeking for internalizing as well as externalizing problems.

AB This study tested an ecological model predicting children's behavior problems in kindergarten from risk and protective factors (parent psychological distress, parenting behavior, and social support) during early childhood. Study participants were 1,161 sociodemographically diverse mother-child pairs that participated in a longitudinal birth cohort study. The predictor variables were collected at two separate time points and based on parent reports; children were an average of 2 years old at Time 1 and 3 years old at Time 2. The outcome measures were collected when children reached kindergarten and were 6 years old on average. Our results show that early maternal psychological distress, mediated by suboptimal parenting behavior, predicts children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors in kindergarten. Moreover, early social support buffers the relations between psychological distress and later suboptimal parenting behavior and between suboptimal parenting behavior and later depressive/withdrawn behavior. Our findings have several implications for early intervention and prevention efforts. Of note, informal social support appears to play an important protective role in the development of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, weakening the link between psychological distress and less optimal parenting behavior and between suboptimal parenting behavior and children's withdrawal/depression symptoms. Increasing social support may be a productive goal for family and community-level intervention.

AB This study examined risk, vulnerability, and protective processes of parental expressed emotion for children's peer relationships in families living in emergency shelters with high rates of exposure to parental violence (EPV). Parental criticism and negativity were hypothesized to exacerbate the association between EPV and poorer peer relations, whereas parental warmth was expected to buffer this association. Participants included 138 homeless parents (M=30.77 years, SD=6.33, range=20.51-57.32 years; 64% African American, 12% Caucasian, 24% other) and their 4-to 6-year-old children (43.5% male; M=4.83, SD=.58, range=4.83-6.92 years; 67% African American, 2% Caucasian, 31% other). Families were assessed during the summer at three urban shelters, with parents completing the Five-Minute Speech Sample (FMSS), later scored for criticism, negativity, and warmth, and interview items about EPV. Teachers were subsequently contacted in the fall about children's classroom behavior, and they provided ratings of peer relations. Demographic factors, parental internalizing symptoms, and observed parental harshness were examined as covariates. Regression analyses indicated an interaction of EPV and warmth, consistent with a moderating effect of expressed emotion for EPV and peer relations, although no interactions were found for criticism or negativity. Observed harshness also directly predicted worse peer relations. Parental warmth may be protective for positive peer relations among impoverished families with high levels of EPV. The FMSS is discussed as an efficient tool with potential for both basic clinical research and preventative interventions designed to target or assess change in parental expressed emotion.

AB Although tics are the defining feature of chronic tic disorders (CTD), many children experience comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems that contribute to impairment across several domains, including family functioning. The current study examined clinical correlates and predictors of caregiver strain in parents of children with CTD. Participants were 123 children and adolescents diagnosed with a CTD who participated in a randomized-controlled trial of behavior therapy for reducing tics. Results showed that a combination of disruptive behavior, inattention/hyperactivity, and tic intensity best explained objective strain, and a combination of inattention/hyperactivity and tic intensity were the best predictors of subjective caregiver strain. Implications of these findings for care providers are discussed.

AB Educational researchers commonly use the rule of thumb of "design effect smaller than 2" as the justification of not accounting for the multilevel or clustered structure in their data. The rule, however, has not yet been systematically studied in previous research. In the present study, we generated data from three different models (which differ in the location of the clustering effect). With a 3 (design effect) x 5 (cluster size) x 4 (number of clusters) Monte Carlo simulation study we found that the rule should not be applied when researchers: (a) are interested in the effects of higher-level predictors, or (b) have a cluster size less than 10. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB Objective: We examined whether an empirically based, randomised controlled trial of a preventive intervention for divorced mothers and children had a long-term impact on offspring cortisol regulation.
   Design: Divorced mothers and children (age 9-12) were randomly assigned to a literature control condition or the 11-week New Beginnings Program, a family-focused group preventive intervention for mothers and children in newly divorced families.
   Main Outcome Measures: Fifteen years after the trial, offspring salivary cortisol (n=161) was measured before and after a social stress task.
   Results: Multilevel mixed models were used to predict cortisol from internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, group assignment and potential moderators of intervention effects. Across the sample, higher externalizing symptoms were associated with lower cortisol reactivity. There was a significant group-by-age interaction such that older offspring in the control group had higher reactivity relative to the intervention group, and younger offspring in the control group exhibited a decline across the task relative to younger offspring in the intervention group.
   Conclusions: Preventive interventions for youth from divorced families may have a long-term impact on cortisol reactivity to stress. Results highlight the importance of examining moderators of program effects.
