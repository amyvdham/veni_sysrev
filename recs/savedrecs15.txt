AB Research regarding the behavioral aspects of children with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) has suggested some possible behavioral patterns including autistic features. Caregivers of 39 children (mean age = 8.4 years) with RTS (49% showing abnormality in CREBBP gene) and 39 children (mean age = 8.6 years) matched on developmental level, age and gender were administered the Child Behavior Checklist and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire. Children with RTS did not exhibit higher internalizing (affective and anxiety symptoms) or externalizing (disruptive symptoms) behavioral problems than expected for their age/developmental range. However, they displayed some specific behaviors: short attention span, motor stereotypies, poor coordination, and overweight. The presence of an identified CREBBP gene abnormality was possibly related to the motor difficulties through impaired motor skills learning.

AB Children with asthma living in urban environments are at risk for experiencing internalizing problems and difficulties at school due to social context and health-related stressors. Parent confidence and participation in the school and children's attitudes about school were explored in association with children's depressed mood and school anxiety. Forty-five parent-child dyads were recruited from urban community health centers. Most participants were members of ethnic minority groups. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that higher levels of parent confidence in the school were associated with fewer symptoms of school anxiety in children. Children's attitudes toward school moderated the relation between parent participation in the school and children's depressed mood. Specifically, lower levels of parent participation were associated with higher levels of depressed mood only for children with the least positive school attitudes. Although preliminary, these results suggest the importance of attending to family-school connections to optimize the school-related psychological functioning of children living with asthma in urban environments.

TI Depression begets depression: Comparing the predictive utility of
   depression and anxiety symptoms to later depression
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Females; depression; anxiety; prediction
ID INTERNALIZING DISORDERS; COMORBIDITY; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS;
   CONSTRUCTS
AB Background:
   The high comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, especially among females, has called into question the independence of these two symptom groups. It is possible that childhood anxiety typically precedes depression in girls. Comparing of the predictive utility of symptoms of anxiety with the predictive utility of symptoms of depression from early childhood to early adolescence is needed to test this hypothesis.
   Methods:
   Data from a population-based sample of 2,451 girls were used to examine age-related changes and year-to-year stability within and across symptoms of major depression, separation anxiety, and generalized/social anxiety by maternal report from ages 6 to 12. In addition, the predictive utility of symptoms of major depression, separation anxiety, and generalized/social anxiety at ages 7-10 years of age to depressive disorders at ages 11-13 was tested.
   Results:
   Symptoms of separation anxiety demonstrated a linear decrease, depression symptoms a linear increase and symptoms of generalized/social anxiety an increase from 6-8, a plateau 8-10, followed by a decrease from 10-12 years. Year-to-year changes in symptoms of major depression were best predicted by depressive symptoms in the previous year, although a small amount of additional variance was accounted for by separation anxiety symptoms in early childhood and generalized/social anxiety symptoms in mid to later childhood. Age 8 was the earliest age from which depressive disorders in early adolescence could be predicted from symptoms of depression and generalized social anxiety.
   Conclusions:
   Homotypic continuity of depression and anxiety symptoms from early childhood to early adolescence is more common in girls than heterotypic continuity. Some additional information about year-to-year changes in depression symptoms and later depressive disorder is gained by assessing anxiety symptoms. Depressive symptoms themselves, however, appear to be the strongest and most reliable predictor of later depression.

AB Truancy is a considerable problem among adolescents. Considering the historical emphasis on studying truancy in urban regions, a concerted effort is needed to extend this research into rural areas to examine cultural generalizability of findings. The purpose of this study was to assess variables associated with truancy in a rural sample (N = 367) of students attending high school in a southern rural region of the Appalachian Mountains. The primary objective was to assess the relative predictive strength of the following variables: academic performance, religiosity, environmental factors (family structure, parental education, and adolescent perceptions of family functioning), internalizing problems (anxiety, depression, thought problems, attentional problems), externalizing problems (substance use and rule-breaking behaviors), and prosocial overt behaviors (participation in school and leadership activities). Regression analysis indicated that truancy was significantly associated with poor school performance, increased depression, social problems, having a less educated mother, a less structured home environment, higher grade, and decreased participation in school sports. Editors' Strategic Implications: These findings are critical for the understanding of truancy in rural areas, and they highlight contextual factors that must be identified and addressed through systematic prevention programs targeting adolescents at risk for truancy.

AB Computeen, a preventive technology and psychosocial skills development program for at-risk adolescents, was designed to improve computer skills, self-esteem, and school attitudes, and reduce behavior problems, by combining elements of community-based and empirically supported prevention programs. Fifty-five mostly Latino adolescents from 12 to 16 years old who were living in affordable housing communities participated in this randomized wait-list control study. Results showed considerable improvements in computer self-efficacy, decreases in internalizing behavior problems, and excellent attendance and consumer satisfaction. Self-esteem and school motivation results were mixed. Computer self-efficacy mediated the relationship between improved computer skills and self-esteem. Younger adolescents showed greater improvement than did older adolescents. Editors' Strategic Implications: Although there are limitations to this study's sample size and scope, Computeen appears promising as a developmentally appropriate, strengths-based prevention program.

AB This is a study of comorbid anxiety disorders and how they affect the clinical picture of comorbid cases. The sample consisted of 576 Spanish children aged 8 to 17 years receiving psychiatric outpatient consultation that were evaluated using a semi-structured diagnostic interview for both parents and children. A specific association of homotypic comorbidity among anxiety disorders that was independent of the presence of other disorders was found. There was heterotypic comorbidity between anxiety and depressive disorders, ADHD, anorexia and tic disorders. Relationships between non-anxiety disorders were, in general, independent of anxiety, but anxiety moderated the relationship between ADHD-Conduct disorder and Conduct disorder-enuresis. Comorbid anxiety increased difficulties in social interaction, was related with higher global impairment and had an impact on consultation and medication. Anxiety disorder comorbidity should be well recognized in order not to disregard the treatment of all present disorders.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test a conceptual model predicting children's anxiety/depression in middle childhood in a community sample of children with parents who had alcohol problems (n = 112) and those Without alcohol problems (n = 101). The conceptual model examined the role of parents' alcohol diagnoses, depression, and antisocial behavior among parents of children ages 12 months to kindergarten age in predicting marital aggression and parental aggravation. Higher levels of marital aggression and parental aggravation were hypothesized to predict children's depression/anxiety within time (18 months to kindergarten age and, prospectively, to age during fourth grade). Method: The sample was recruited front New York State birth records when the children were 12 months old. Assessments were conducted at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months; at kindergarten age; and during fourth grade, Results: Children with alcoholic fathers had higher depression/anxiety scores according to parental reports but not self-reports. Structural equations modeling was largely supportive of the conceptual model. Fathers' alcoholism was associated with higher child anxiety via greater levels of marital aggression among families with alcohol problems. Results also indicated that there was a significant indirect association between parents' depression symptoms and child anxiety via marital aggression. Conclusions: The results highlight the nested nature of risk characteristics in alcoholic families and the important role of marital aggression in predicting children's anxiety/depression. Interventions targeting both parents' alcohol problems and associated marital aggression are likely to provide the dual benefits of improving family interactions and lowering risk of children's internalizing behavior problems.

AB This study examines disparities in co-occurring mental health and substance use problems by race/ethnicity to inform the development of culturally appropriate treatment approaches. Using pooled clinical data collected with the Global Assessment of Individual Needs, we identified racial/ethnic and other factors associated with co-occurring internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and the combination thereof in adolescents in federally funded treatment facilities. Results show that after controlling for demographic and socioenvironmental factors, African Americans, Hispanics, and mixed-race adolescents were more likely than Whites to have co-occurring internalizing problems. African Americans and Native Americans were less likely than Whites to have externalizing problems and to have combined internalizing and externalizing problems. Presence of co-occurring problems was also associated with victimization, homelessness, and family substance abuse. These results indicate that co-occurring mental health problems vary by race/ethnicity, and therefore, refined approaches are needed for culturally appropriate care of patients.

AB Objective: Children born very preterm are reported to have an increased frequency of social, emotional, and behavioral problems at school age compared with their peers born at term. The primary aim of this study was to compare social-emotional difficulties and competencies of very preterm and full-term children at 2 years' corrected age. In addition, the relation between perinatal variables and early behavior problems was also examined to help identify those very preterm children most at risk. Method: At 2 years' corrected age, the parents of 188 very preterm (gestational age <30 weeks or birth weight <1,250 g) and 70 full-term (gestational age >= 37 weeks) children completed the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment to determine externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation problems and social-emotional competencies. For the very preterm sample, extensive perinatal data were collected including sex, birth weight, gestational age, chronic lung disease, and postnatal steroids, as well as neonatal cerebral white matter abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The very preterm children at 2 years demonstrated significantly higher internalizing and dysregulation scores and lower competence scores than peers born at term. There was no significant difference in externalizing scores between groups. Female sex, lower birth weight z score, white matter abnormalities, and postnatal corticosteroids were significantly associated with lower competence scores in the very preterm group. Conclusions: Very preterm children exhibit higher rates of behavior problems early in development, in particular internalizing and dysregulation problems and poorer competence. J. Am. Acad.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine whether there were significant differences between children of normative versus short stature in behavioral functioning and peer relationships, according to teacher and child reports.
   METHODS: The study included 712 boys and girls in the sixth grade, from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Main outcome measures included Achenbach Teacher's Report Form internalizing, externalizing, and total scores; Children's Depression Inventory scores (child report); Life Orientation Test-Revised scores (child report); Child Behavior with Peers questionnaire asocial with peers, excluded by peers, and peer victimization subscale scores (teacher report); peer social support and victimization scores (child report); and relationships with peers score (teacher report). In bivariate comparisons, these outcomes were compared for children of relatively short (height of <10th percentile) versus nonshort (height of >= 10th percentile) stature, and effect sizes were calculated. Multivariate linear regression models adjusted for maternal education, income/needs ratio, race, and gender.
   RESULTS: Effect sizes ranged from 0.00 to 0.35. Short children reported marginally higher levels of self-perceived peer victimization, compared with their nonshort peers. There were no significant differences in the rest of the outcomes for children of short versus nonshort stature, in either unadjusted or adjusted models.
   CONCLUSION: Although short children from a population-based sample reported marginally higher levels of self-perceived peer victimization, they did not differ from their nonshort peers in a range of social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 903-910

AB The Child Behavior Scale (CBS) is a teacher-report instrument that was developed over a decade ago as an alternative to more costly methods for assessing children's behavior and peer relations in school contexts. This investigation was undertaken to clarify how well the CBS achieves its aims with a broader age spectrum of youth (6- to 13-year-olds). Investigative aims were to examine the basic psychometric properties of the CBS and evaluate the construct and criterion-related validity of the CBS's 6 subscales at each of 8 grade levels (Grades 1-8). These aims were examined in a longitudinal investigation with samples of children and their teachers, classmates, and parents. One sample (n = 396) was followed from 1st through 8th grade, and a second sample (n = 100) was recruited in 5th grade, combined with the initial sample, and followed through 8th grade. Results suggest that the majority of the CBS subscales provide trustworthy data about the behavioral and peer relational constructs that this instrument was designed to measure and that the CBS's range of application, or developmental purview as an assessment tool, spans the period from early childhood (age 5) through early adolescence (age 13).

AB The present study investigated the co-occurrence of asthma and obesity in a sample of 193 children (mean age = 7.76 years). Specifically, this study was interested in delineating the associated comorbidities of internalizing symptoms and sleep disruptions among younger (younger than 7 years) and older elementary age children with asthma who were also overweight. Information about child internalizing symptoms (among other areas of functioning) was collected from teacher ratings of child behavior. Data regarding nighttime waking, morning symptoms, and school days missed were obtained from parent reports. Findings suggest that older elementary age children with asthma who are overweight are more likely to experience internalizing symptoms and more nighttime waking than their average weight peers. Implications include the important role of teachers in identifying these children who might be at increased risk for internalizing symptoms and the consequences of such symptoms.

AB In this study we explore the development of phonological and lexical reading in dyslexic children. We tested a group of 14 Italian children who have been diagnosed with dyslexia and whose reading age is end of grade 1. We compared this group with a group of 70 typically developing children who have been tested for reading at the end of grade 1. For each dyslexic child we also selected a participant who was attending the same grade, was close in age, and showed typical reading development when tested with a narrative passage reading task (Cornoldi, Colpo, & Gruppo MT, 1981) for correctness and reading speed. Children in this group are "same grade controls." We used a reading task consisting of 40 three syllables words. A qualitative and quantitative method of coding children's naming allowed us to distinguish several components of their reading performance: the grapheme and word recognition, the size of orthographic units involved in the aloud orthography-phonology conversion, the reading process used to recognize words. The comparison of the dyslexic group with the reading age and the same grade control groups reveals different trends of delayed reading processes. Considering dyslexic children's chronological age, lexical reading is greatly delayed. Considering dyslexic children's reading age, the type of reading process that is more deeply delayed is phonological reading. The rate of fragmented phonological reading (i.e., a type of syllabized phonological reading) is much higher in dyslexic children compared to the reading age group, suggesting that some factors undermine the possibility of internalizing the orthography-phonology conversion and the blending processes.

AB Objective: No previous study has assessed the occurrence of psychopathology in offspring of bipolar women from South America. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychopathology in offspring of bipolar mothers from Brazil compared with two control groups. Method: Children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years of bipolar disorders mothers (n = 43), mothers with other mild to moderate mental disorders (n = 53) and mothers without any psychiatric disorder (n = 53) were evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia present and lifetime version, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. Raters were blind to the mothers' diagnoses, who were interviewed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview. Results: Bipolar offspring had twice the chance of having one or more lifetime Axis I diagnoses [prevalence ratio = 2.11 (95% CI: 1.30-3.42) and p = 0.003] and 2.8 higher risk of having a lifetime anxiety disorder [prevalence ratio = 2.83 (95% CI: 1.39-5.78) e p = 0.004] than the offspring of mothers with no mental disorder. In addition, significantly higher scores on Child Behavior Checklist thought problems and Youth Self-Report social problems, as well as anxiety/depression and internalizing problems were observed. Conclusion: Our results confirm previous findings suggesting higher psychiatric problems in offspring of bipolar mothers and extend them to the Brazilian society

AB Background: Few studies have examined the effects of treatment factors, including the types of services [chemical dependency (CD), psychiatric, or both], on long-term outcomes among adolescents following CD treatment, and whether receiving continuing care may contribute to better outcomes. This study examines the effect of the index CD and ongoing CD and psychiatric treatment episodes, 12-step participation, and individual characteristics such as CD and mental health (MH) severity and gender, age, and ethnicity, on 3-year CD and MH outcomes.
   Methods: Participants were 296 adolescents aged 13 to 18 seeking treatment at 4 CD programs of a nonprofit, managed care, integrated health system. We surveyed participants at intake, 1 year, and 3 years, and examined survey and administrative data, and CD and psychiatric utilization.
   Results: At 3 years, 29.7% of the sample reported total abstinence from both alcohol and drugs (excluding tobacco). Compared with girls, boys had only half the odds of being abstinent (OR = 0.46, p = 0.0204). Gender also predicted Externalizing severity at 3 years (coefficients 18.42 vs. 14.77, p < 0.01). CD treatment readmission in the second and third follow-up years was related to abstinence at 3 years (OR = 0.24, p = 0.0066 and OR = 3.33, p = 0.0207, respectively). Abstinence at 1 year predicted abstinence at 3 years (OR = 4.11, p < 0.0001). Those who were abstinent at 1 year also had better MH outcomes (both lower Internalizing and Externalizing scores) than those who were not (11.75 vs. 15.55, p = 0.0012 and 15.13 vs. 18.06, p = 0.0179, respectively).
   Conclusions: A CD treatment episode resulting in good 1-year CD outcomes may contribute significantly to both CD and MH outcomes 3 years later. The findings also point to the value of providing a continuing care model of treatment for adolescents.

AB Context: Childhood depression is a serious and relapsing psychiatric disorder. However, to date studies have focused mostly on children aged 6 years and older. Validation for depression in preschool children has been provided by 2 independent study samples. While several studies have demonstrated stability and poor outcomes of internalizing symptoms in preschoolers, there has not yet been longitudinal data available to inform the course of preschool depression and whether it shows homotypic continuity into early childhood.
   Objective: To examine the 24-month course of preschool depression and whether it showed homotypic vs heterotypic continuity or was a developmentally transient phenomenon.
   Design: Blindly rated, prospective, 24-month, longitudinal follow-up study.
   Setting: Community sites.
   Patients: Three hundred six preschoolers aged 3 to 6 years recruited from community sites and oversampled for symptoms of depression.
   Main Outcome Measure: Recurrence/stability of depression and predictors of course.
   Results: Preschoolers with depression at baseline had the highest likelihood of subsequent depression 12 and/or 24 months later compared with preschoolers with no baseline disorder and with those who had other psychiatric disorders. Preschoolers with depression at baseline were more likely to have later depression rather than other psychiatric disorders. Findings from a logistic regression analysis indicated that when controlling for demographic variables, risk factors, and comorbid disorders, depression during the preschool period and family history of affective disorders were the most robust and significant predictors of later depression.
   Conclusions: Preschool depression, similar to childhood depression, is not a developmentally transient syndrome but rather shows chronicity and/or recurrence. Homotypic continuity of preschool MDD during a 24-month period was found. These results underscore the clinical and public health importance of identification of depression as early as preschool. Further follow-up of preschoolers with depression is warranted to inform the longitudinal course throughout childhood.

AB Children with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) still face a critical prognosis. We tested the hypothesis that targeted calichearnicin theta (theta) using an anti-CD19-immunoconjugate may provide ail effective treatment strategy for CD19(+) ALL. Calicheamicin theta is a rationally designed prodrug Of the natural enediyene calichearnicin gamma, obtained by total synthesis. It offers the advantage of increased in vivo stability and 1000-fold hi-her antitumor potency over calicheamicin gamma. First, we demonstrate efficacy of calicheamicin theta against primary pre-B leukemic cells and multidrug-resistant leukemia cell lines (IC50 = 10(-9) to 10(-12) M), Second, conjugation of calicheamicin theta to an internalizing murine anti-CD19 monoclonal anti body was demonstrated to affect neither calichearnicin theta mediated cytotoxicity nor binding of the antibody to the target molecule. Third, anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta immunoconjugate revealed a maximum tolerated dose of 10 mu g/kg and CD19-specific and long-lasting eradication of established leukemia was demonstrated in a xenograft model. Finally, we show that the antileukemic effect of anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta is mediated by induction of apoptosis proceeding through the caspase-mediated mitochondrial pathway, On the basis of these results, we conclude that anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta immunoconjugates may offer a novel and effective approach for the treatment of relapsed CD19(+)ALL.

AB Participants were 323 families with children (aged 4-12 years), among whom 87 (26.9%) were girls. Gender differences before treatment with Parent Management Training-the Oregon model (PMTO) and pre-post gender differences in behavioral change (regression analyses) were examined. At pre treatment, girls demonstrated less externalizing problem behavior according to parents and teachers, but more internalizing problems according to parents. Teachers reported girls to be more socially competent than boys and they reported more comorbidity among boys than girls. At post treatment, girls had more likely changed in a positive direction according to teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and social competence, but not according to any of the parent-reported variables. In sum, girls were not more at risk than boys at intake to treatment and PMTO appeared to be an equally effective intervention for girls and boys. The few gender differences in outcomes indicated that girls benefited more from PMTO than boys. The limitations and practical implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Consistent with principles of developmental psychopathology, this paper presents a broad psychodynamic structural developmental perspective that establishes conceptual continuities between processes of normal personality development, personality organization, concepts of psychopathology, and processes of therapeutic change. The major assumption of this approach is that personality development proceeds in a dialectic synergistic interaction between the development of capacities for interpersonal relatedness and the development of self-definition or identity. Extensive research demonstrates that these two dimensions define two broad types of personality organization, each with a particular experiential mode; preferred forms of cognition, defense, and adaptation; unique qualities of interpersonal relatedness and specific types of object and self-representation. Severe disruptions of this normal dialectic developmental process result in various forms of psychopathology organized in two basic configurations in which there is distorted defensive preoccupation, at different developmental levels, with one of these polarities (relatedness or self-definition) at the expense of the development of the other dimension. This paper reviews empirical findings supporting this approach to normal and disrupted personality development throughout the life cycle and considers its relationship to the internalizing-extemalizing distinction in childhood and adolescence, attachment theory, and research on the interaction between biological and psychosocial factors in development across the life span. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for intervention and prevention.

AB This study investigated the longitudinal impact of maltreatment parameters on personality processes and maladjustment and prospective relationships between personality trajectory classes and subsequent maladjustment outcomes. The sample involved maltreated (n = 249) and nonmaltreated (n = 200) children followed longitudinally between ages 6 and 10. Growth mixture modeling indicated multifinality in personality development depending on the risk status (i.e., maltreated vs. nonmaltreated). Two trajectory classes of ego resiliency were identified for maltreated children: those who showed a declining trajectory exhibited greater maladjustment. In contrast, three trajectory classes of ego control were identified for nonmaltreated children; the subgroups showing increases in ego undercontrol or dramatic changes from high ego undercontrol to high ego overcontrol exhibited poor adjustment. Experiencing multiple maltreatment subtypes and physical/sexual abuse were related to higher levels of ego undercontrol and extemalizing symptomatology, whereas early onset of maltreatment was associated with the low and decreasing trajectory of ego resiliency and higher levels of internalizing symptomatology. The findings suggest that ego resiliency and ego control, personality processes related to self-regulation, may be important factors in identifying distinct pathways to later personality disorders as well as pathways to resilient functioning.

AB Aim
   The aim of this study was to elucidate factors related to the high rate of mental health disorders seen in those with impaired hearing, including social factors and audiological measures.
   Method
   A representative sample of 95 pupils (47 females, 48 males; mean age 11y 1mo, range 6y 5mo to 16y, SD 2y 7mo) with hearing impairments of at least 40dB and normal non-verbal intelligence (IQ 97.5, SD 19.5), was assessed audiologically and with a structured clinical interview giving both current and lifetime diagnoses, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Detailed social information was gathered from parents and teachers.
   Results
   Point and lifetime prevalence rates for any psychiatric disorder (32.6%; 45.3%) and depression (7.4%; 26.3%) were higher than in general population samples and not related to the degree of hearing loss. There was a relation between having a lifetime diagnosis and the child's ability to be understood within the family (25.6% vs 7.7%, odds ratio 4.12 [1.2-14.1], p=0.02). Internalizing mental health disorders were between three and six times more likely in those who had been teased, maltreated by classmates, or isolated.
   Interpretation
   We conclude that the increased risk of depression in those who have been teased, isolated, or maltreated is not peculiar to deafness, but the ability to make oneself understood is, and is modestly related (r=0.22-0.34) to the probability of these adverse experiences.

AB Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCn-3PUFA) supplementation may improve symptoms of depression in children and bipolar disorder ( BD) in adults. No studies have examined the effectiveness of LCn-3PUFA supplementation in the treatment of mania and depression in juvenile BD (JBD) when given as an adjunct to standard pharmacological treatment. Eighteen children and adolescents with JBD received supplements containing 360 mg per day eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1560 mg per day docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 6 weeks in an open-label study. Intake and fasting red blood cell (RBC) LCn-3PUFA, mania, depression and global function were assessed before and after supplementation. RBC EPA and DHA were significantly higher following supplementation. Clinician ratings of mania and depression were significantly lower and global functioning significantly higher after supplementation. Parent ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviours were also significantly lower following supplementation. A larger randomized controlled trial appears warranted in this participant population.

AB Methods A sample of 1029 children was drawn from Birth to Twenty, a longitudinal cohort followed from pregnancy to young adulthood. This sample completed the Youth Self Report at age 12 years, a validated psychological measure of behavioural and emotional adjustment. Scores were compared between LBW (< 2500 g) and normal birthweight children using multivariate analysis with adjustment for potential birth and life events confounding factors.
   Results No associations were found between LBW and total [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.74], internalizing (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52-1.28) or externalizing profiles (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49-1.36). The only difference detected was for the internalizing sub-profile of Somatic Complaints (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.38), which on subgroup analysis was greatest among females.
   Conclusions We found no convincing evidence of an association between LBW and emotional and behavioural outcomes in 12-year olds in this sample in urban South Africa. To our knowledge, this is the first published assessment of this association in a developing world context.

AB The present study investigated underlying processes of the effect of maltreatment on psychopathology (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems) in a group of 111 maltreated and 110 nonmaltreated 7-10 year-old children (60% boys). We tested the moderating and/or mediating roles of emotion regulation and the mother-child relationship quality (pattern of relatedness) using Structural Equation Modeling. Emotion regulation, but not the pattern of relatedness, mediated the relation between maltreatment and psychopathology. This mediation was moderated by the pattern of relatedness: For the group of children with an insecure pattern of relatedness, maltreatment was related to lower levels of emotion regulation, which was predictive of higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. In contrast, for the secure relatedness group, there was no mediation by emotion regulation since the impact of maltreatment on emotion regulation was not significant. Implications of the mediating role of emotion regulation and the buffering role of the mother-child relationship quality were discussed.

AB Some evidence suggests that close friends may be knowledgeable of youth's psychological adjustment. However, friends are understudied as reporters of adjustment. The current study examines associations between self- and friend-reports of internalizing and externalizing adjustment in a community sample of fifth-, eighth-, and eleventh-grade youth. The study extends prior work by considering the degree to which friends' reports of youth adjustment are accurate (i.e., predicted by youths' actual adjustment) versus biased (i.e., predicted by the friend reporters' own adjustment). Findings indicated stronger bias effects than accuracy effects, but the accuracy effects were significant for both internalizing and externalizing adjustment. Additionally, friends who perceived their relationships as high in positive quality, friends in relationships high in disclosure, and girls perceived youths' internalizing symptoms most accurately. Knowledge of externalizing adjustment was not influenced by gender, grade, relationship quality, or self-disclosure. Findings suggest that friends could play an important role in prevention efforts.

AB The authors used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to model patterns of maternal depressive symptoms, from the period of infants' age 1 month to adolescence (age 12 years), and then examined adolescent adjustment at age 15 years as a function of the course and severity of maternal symptoms. The authors identified 5 latent classes of symptoms in 1,357 women, while also taking into account sociodemographic measures: never depressed, stable subclinical, early decreasing, moderately elevated, and chronic. Women with few symptoms were more likely to be married, better educated, and in better physical health than were women with more elevated symptoms. At age 15 years, adolescents whose mothers were in the chronic, elevated, and stable subdinical latent classes reported more internalizing and externalizing problems and acknowledged engaging in more risky behavior than did children of never depressed mothers. Latent class differences in self-reported loneliness and dysphoria were also found. Discussion focuses on adolescent adjustment, especially among offspring whose mothers reported stable symptoms of depression across their childhoods.

AB Anxiety sensitivity represents a robust risk factor for the development of anxiety symptoms among both adolescents and adults. However, the development of anxiety sensitivity among adolescents remains inadequately understood. In this study, the authors examined the role of stressful life events as a risk factor for the development of elevated anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity was then examined in a longitudinal design as a mechanism linking stressful life events to changes in anxiety symptoms. Stressful life events, anxiety sensitivity, and internalizing symptoms were assessed in a diverse community sample of adolescents (N = 1,065) at 3 time points spanning 7 months. The results indicated that stressful life events were longitudinally associated with increases in anxiety sensitivity and that certain types of stressful life events, specifically events related to health and events related to family discord, were differentially predictive of increases in anxiety sensitivity. Moreover, anxiety sensitivity mediated the longitudinal relation between stressful life events and anxiety symptoms. Evidence was also found for the predictive specificity of anxiety sensitivity to symptoms of anxiety but not depression.

AB A self-report measure of metacognition for both children and adolescents (ages 7-17) (Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children; MCQ-C) was adapted from a previous measure, the MCQ-A (Metacognitions Questionnaire for Adolescents) and was administered to a sample of 78 children and adolescents with clinical anxiety disorders and 20 non-clinical youth. The metacognitive processes included were (1) positive beliefs about worry (positive meta-worry); (2) negative beliefs about worry (negative meta-worry); (3) superstitious, punishment and responsibility beliefs (SPR beliefs) and (4) cognitive monitoring (awareness of one's own thoughts). The MCQ-C demonstrated good internal-consistency reliability, as well as concurrent and criterion validity, and four valid factors. In line with predictions, negative meta-worry was significantly associated with self-reports of internalizing symptoms (excessive worry and depression). Age-based differences on the MCQ-C were found for only one subscale, with adolescents reporting greater awareness of their thoughts than children. Adolescent girls scored higher on the total index of metacognitive processes than adolescent boys. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the use of the MCQ-C with a broader age range as well as an association between metacognitive processes and anxiety symptomatology in both children and adolescents, with implications for cognitive behavioral interventions with anxious youth.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between parental guilt induction and child internalizing problems in families where a caregiver had experienced depression. A total of 107 families, including 146 children (age 9-15), participated. Child-reported parental guilt induction, as well as three more traditionally studied parenting behaviors (warmth/involvement, monitoring, and discipline), were assessed, as was parent-report of child internalizing problem behavior. Linear Mixed Models Analysis indicated parental guilt induction was positively related to child internalizing problems in the context of the remaining three parenting behaviors. Implications of the findings for prevention and intervention parenting programs are considered.

AB We evaluated the efficacy of a social skills training intervention designed to improve adolescents' social, emotional and behavioral adjustment, Social Skills Group Intervention-Adolescent (S. S. GRIN-A). Seventy-four adolescents (ages 13-16 years) and their parents were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (N = 40) or a wait-list control group (N = 34). Adolescents in the treatment and control groups were compared on global self-concept, social self-efficacy, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems pre- and post-intervention. Youth in the treatment group demonstrated enhanced global self-concept, increased social self-efficacy, and decreased internalizing problems as compared to youth in the control group. No differences in externalizing behavior were found. We discuss the effectiveness of S. S. GRIN-A as a general program designed for addressing a range of adjustment issues and social skill deficits in adolescents.

AB Young maltreated children, birth to three years, represent the age group with the highest rates of maltreatment in the United States (ACYF 2007). There are few studies to date that have investigated early childhood maltreatment and its effects on emotion regulatory processes and psychopathology. In response, the current investigation uses a dyadic assessment procedure to examine the relationship between parenting, emotion regulation, and symptoms of psychopathology among maltreating and non-maltreating parent-child interactions. The participants in this study were 123 children (66 maltreated and 57 nonmaltreated) from ages 1-3. Child and parent affect and child effortful control were observed during a parent-child interaction task. Symptoms of psychopathology were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. The maltreated children exhibited more anger, more internalizing symptomatology, and less positive affect compared to non-maltreated children. Among maltreated children, emotion dysregulation was associated with internalizing symptomatology. Moreover, these data reveal parental positive affect was associated with lower child internalizing symptomatology and parental anger was associated with higher child internalizing symptomatology in the entire sample. This investigation offers evidence that emotion dysregulation subsequent to poor dyadic interactions is associated with early child maltreatment. These data suggest that maltreated children experience difficulties in emotion regulation which may be related to their higher levels of behavioral symptomatology.

AB The majority of studies investigating the effects of parental behaviour on the child's adjustment have a dimensional approach. We identified the existence of various patterns in parental rearing styles and analysed the relationship between different parenting patterns and behavioural problems in a group of school-aged children. A longitudinal, multi-informant study was conducted. The sample consisted of 519 school-aged children from the Portuguese general population. Parental rearing styles were measured using the EMBU-C, a questionnaire that evaluates children's perception of parental rearing dimensions. The assessment of child behavioural problems included the evaluation of internalizing and externalizing problems, and data from multiple reporters (parents and teacher). One year later, after a school transition, the adjustment of a sub-sample of 220 children was evaluated again. Cluster analysis identified four types of parental rearing styles: low support, supportive-controller, rejecting-controller, and supportive. In both assessment periods, low support and rejecting-controller parenting patterns showed higher levels of behavioural problems than the supportive and supportive-controller parenting patterns. These patterns show significant differences between them regarding behavioural problems and have a higher predictive value regarding externalizing problems (versus internalizing problems).

AB Although a developing body of literature suggests that depressive symptoms in fathers are related to child psychopathology, little evidence suggests that paternal depression plays a unique role in children's symptoms. We used a high-risk design involving children of mothers with and without histories of depression to test the unique mediating role of father-child conflict in the relations between fathers' depressive symptoms and child externalizing and internalizing symptoms. In all regression analyses, mothers' history of depression and current depressive symptoms were controlled. Depressive symptoms in fathers were associated with child externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and father-child conflict. Father-child conflict mediated relations between fathers' depressive symptoms and child externalizing symptoms above and beyond the effects of maternal depression history and depressive symptoms. The results suggest that negative interpersonal consequences of parental depression on child psychopathology may not be limited to mothers.

AB Objective: To identify subgroups of severely psychiatrically impaired children on the basis of the complexity of their histories of exposure to abuse and other potential traumatic stressors, and to examine the relationship of complex trauma histories to DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnoses.
   Method: In a sample of 397 consecutive inpatient child psychiatry admissions, cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups on the basis of measures of documented physical or sexual abuse, parental impairment (arrest, violence, and/or substance use), and disrupted attachment (ie, out-of-home placement). Data were collected for the years 1992 through 2002.
   Results: Four subgroups were identified. Two "low trauma" subgroups had infrequent histories of abuse and out-of-home placement but were distinguished by low/moderate versus high levels of parental impairment. Two "complex trauma" subgroups were characterized by histories of either physical abuse or sexual abuse with multiple perpetrators, as well as extensive out-of-home placement and severe parental impairment. All subgroups had similar profiles of psychiatric diagnoses. Complex trauma status was associated with behavior problem severity and lower body mass index over and above the effects of psychiatric diagnoses, gender, and ethnicity. Although abuse history was a factor in subgroup membership, the multiple out-of-home placements variable was the most consistent correlate of externalizing and internalizing problems and psychosocial impairment.
   Conclusions: Childhood adversity that may constitute complex trauma was associated with externalizing behavior problems and psychosocial impairment among psychiatrically hospitalized children, and this association cannot be accounted for fully by existing psychiatric diagnoses, gender, or ethnicity.

AB Objective: Our earlier studies on Ugandan children surviving cerebral malaria showed cognitive deficits mainly in attention and memory. We now present the first study in sub-Saharan Africa to investigate the feasibility and potential benefits of computerized cognitive rehabilitation training on neuropsychological and behavioral functioning of children surviving cerebral malaria. Methods: A randomized trial in which 65 children admitted 45 months earlier with cerebral malaria were recruited at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. For 8 weeks, 32 of the children received weekly training sessions using Captain's Log cognitive training software and the other 33 were assigned to a nontreatment condition. Pre- and postintervention assessments were completed using CogState, a computerized neuropsychological battery, measuring visuomotor processing speed, working memory, learning, attention and psychomotor speed and the Child Behavior Checklist measuring internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and total problems. Results: Preintervention scores were similar between both groups. Treatment effects were observed on visuospatial processing speed [group effect (standard error) 0.14 (0.03); p < .001], on a working memory and learning task [0.08 (0.02); p < .001], psychomotor speed [0.14 (0.07); p = .04], and on internalizing problems [-3.80 (1.56); p = .02] after controlling for age, sex, school grade, quality of the home environment, and weight for age z scores. Similar treatment effects were observed when no adjustments for the above covariates were made. Conclusions: Computerized cognitive training long after the cerebral malaria episode has immediate benefit on some neuropsychological and behavioral functions in African children. The long-term benefit of this intervention needs to be investigated.

AB The present study examines the mechanisms by which students' perceptions of family and school experiences moderate the association between their emotionality and their habitual involvement in bullying and victimization. The authors hypothesize that students with internalizing and/or externalizing difficulties are less likely to be categorized as bullies and/or victims if they report coming from more cohesive and adaptable families and attending schools characterized by higher adult monitoring, lower levels of aggression and disorder, and higher levels of school bonding. Home and school environments in which these characteristics are less evident to students were expected to exacerbate the likelihood of being bullies and/or victims. Middle school youth (N = 2,506) and their teachers completed surveys assessing emotionality, peer relationships, academic performance, and home and school contexts. Using multinomial logistic regression, the authors found that perceived climates low in student misconduct increase the likelihood that internalizing difficulties predicted classification as victims. Increased student-reported adult monitoring decreased the likelihood for students with externalizing problems to be characterized as bullies, particularly for girls. These findings have implications for the development of school-based intervention programming.

AB Young children's (n = 96) perceptions and appraisals of their parents' marital conflict were evaluated at age 5 and again at age 6. Concurrent reports of marital conflict by each parent and teachers' reports of children's classroom adjustment served as criteria against which to evaluate the validity Of Young children's perceptions. Children's perceptions of their parents' marital relationship were significantly correlated with spouses' reports at ages 5 and 6, as well as correlated with teacher reports of internalizing and externalizing problems. Consistent with the cognitive-contextual theory, children's tendency to blame themselves for their parents' conflict partially mediated the link between marital conflict and children's internalizing symptoms. In contrast, children's reports that they become involved in their parents' conflict partially mediated the effect of marital conflict on externalizing problems.

AB The claim that multiple partner fertility may pose a risk of adverse outcomes for children has not been tested. We test this argument using a sample of 4,027 resident fathers and children from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Survey by examining the pathways through which fathers' multipartnered fertility is associated with children's externalizing behaviors and physical health status at 36 months. Path analyses indicate that multiple partner fertility exerted both a significant direct and indirect effect through paternal depression to influence children's externalizing behaviors. Fathers' multiple partner fertility also exerted a significant indirect effect through one mediator-father involvement-to influence children's physical health. This evidence suggests that the disruptions brought about by multipartnered fertility are important for understanding child well-being.

AB This study examined sons' and daughters' involvement with nonresident fathers and associated outcomes (N = 4,663). Results indicated that sons and daughters reported equal involvement with nonresident fathers on most measures of father investment, although sons reported more overnight visits, sports, and movies and feeling closer to their fathers compared to daughters. Sons and daughters generally benefited from nonresident father involvement in the same way in internalizing and externalizing problems and grades. Feeling close to one's nonresident father, however, was associated with lower internalizing problems for daughters than sons. These findings suggest that nonresident fathers should be encouraged to be equally involved with their sons and daughters, as such involvement was associated with higher levels of well-being for both sons and daughters.

AB ObjectivesTo analyze the relation between the symptoms reported by adolescents with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and their perception of their emotional and behavioral functioning.MethodsTwo groups of adolescents (clinical group, n 48; control group, n 135) and their parents (clinical group, n 42; control group, n 128) were studied, respectively, with the Youth Self-Report Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist. Moreover, a secondary analysis was performed, identifying another subgroup of adolescents who reported having headaches.ResultsThe clinical group of adolescents obtained higher scores than the control group in Internalizing Syndrome; Aggressive Behavior for Externalizing Syndrome; Social, Thought, and Attention Problems; and in all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)-oriented scales (except conduct problems). Differences between the two groups of parents were found in all the scales. The controls reporting headaches obtained interesting intermediate scores.ConclusionsAdolescents with CTTH show greater emotional and behavioral problems than their healthy peers. Consequently, clinical approaches for proper diagnosis and treatment need to adopt a multidisciplinary prospective.

Patients completed measures of pain intensity, anxiety, depression, pain coping, and functional disability. Parents completed a measure of protective behavior.ResultsGirls and boys reported similar levels of pain intensity. Girls were more likely to endorse depressive symptoms, and internalizing symptoms were associated with disability in girls, not in boys. No gender differences were found in links between coping and protective parenting and disability.ConclusionsIn general, psychosocial factors influenced functional disability similarly in girls and boys, although some gender differences were found. Findings highlight the importance of considering child gender when evaluating factors that contribute to functional disability.

AB OBJECTIVE: Sequelae of academic underachievement, behavioral problems, and poor executive function (EF) have been extensively reported for very preterm (<= 33 weeks' gestation) and/or very low birth weight (VLBW) (<= 1500 g) children. Great variability in the published results, however, hinders the field in studying underlying dysfunctionsanddeveloping intervention strategies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of studies published between 1998 and 2008 on academic achievement, behavioral functioning, and EF with the aim of providing aggregated measures of effect size for these outcome domains.
   METHODS: Suitable for inclusion were 14 studies on academic achievement, 9 studies on behavioral problems, and 12 studies on EF, which compared a total of 4125 very preterm and/or VLBW children with 3197 term-born controls. Combined effect sizes for the 3 outcome domains were calculated in terms of Cohen's d. Q-test statistics were performed to test homogeneity among the obtained effect sizes. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the impact of mean birth weight and mean gestational age, as well as the influence of mean age at assessment on the effect sizes for academic achievement, behavioral problems, and EF.
   RESULTS: Combined effect sizes show that very preterm and/or VLBW children score 0.60 SD lower on mathematics tests, 0.48 SD on reading tests, and 0.76 SD on spelling tests than term-born peers. Of all behavioral problems stacked, attention problems were most pronounced in very preterm and/or VLBW children, with teacher and parent ratings being 0.43 to 0.59 SD higher than for controls, respectively. Combined effect sizes for parent and teacher ratings of internalizing behavior problems were small (< 0.28) and for externalizing behavior problems negligible (<0.09) and not significant. Combined effect sizes for EF revealed a decrement of 0.57 SD for verbal fluency, 0.36 SD for working memory, and 0.49 SD for cognitive flexibility in comparison to controls. Mean age at assessment was not correlated with the strength of the effect sizes. Mathematics and reading performance, parent ratings of internalizing problems, teacher ratings of externalizing behavior, and attention problems, showed strong and positive correlations with mean birth weight and mean gestational age (all r values > 0.51).
   CONCLUSIONS: Very preterm and/or VLBW children have moderate-to-severe deficits in academic achievement, attention problems, and internalizing behavioral problems and poor EF, which are adverse outcomes that were strongly correlated to their immaturity at birth. During transition to young adulthood these children continue to lag behind term-born peers. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 717-728

AB Background. Mood lability is a concept widely used. However, data on its prevalence and morbid associations are scarce. We sought to establish the occurrence and importance of mood lability in a large community sample of cildren and adolescents by testing a priori hypotheses.
   Method. Cross-sectional data were taken from a national mental health survey including 5326 subjects aged 8-79 years in the UK. The outcomes were prevalence and characteristics of mood lability and its associations with psychopathology and overall impairment.
   Results. Mood lability occurred in more than 5% of the population of children and adolescents, both by parent and self-report. Mood lability was strongly associated with a wide range of psychopathology and was linked to significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric disorders. Mood lability was particularly strongly associated with co-morbidity between internalizing and externalizing disorders, even when adjusting for the association with individual disorders. The pattern of results did not change after excluding youth with bipolar disorder or with episodes of elated mood.
   Conclusions. Clinically significant mood lability is relatively common in the community. Our findings indicate that mood lability is not a mere consequence of other psychopathology in that it is associated with significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, the pattern of association of mood lability with co-morbidity suggests that it could be a risk factor shared by both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Our data point to the need for greater awareness of mood lability and its implications for treatment.

AB The stress response system is comprised of an intricate interconnected network that Salivary cortisol; includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. The HPA axis maintains the Stressor paradigms; organism's capacity to respond to acute and prolonged stressors and is a focus of research on Human development the sequelae of stress. Human studies of the HPA system have been facilitated enormously by the development of salivary assays which measure cortisol, the steroid end-product of the HPA axis. The use of salivary cortisol is prevalent in child development stress research. However, in order to measure children's acute cortisol reactivity to circumscribed stressors, researchers must put children in stressful situations which produce elevated Levels of cortisol. Unfortunately, many studies on the cortisol stress response in children use paradigms that fail to produce mean elevations in cortisol. This paper reviews stressor paradigms used with infants, children, and adolescents to guide researchers in selecting effective stressor tasks. A number of different types of stressor paradigms were examined, including: public speaking, negative emotion, relationship disruption/threatening, novelty, handling, and mild pain paradigms. With development, marked changes are evident in the effectiveness of the same stressor paradigm to provoke elevations in cortisol. Several factors appear to be critical in determining whether a stressor paradigm is successful, including the availability of coping resources and the extent to which, in older children, the task threatens the social self. A consideration of these issues is needed to promote the implementation of more effective stressor paradigms in human developmental psychoendocrine research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Very few prospective studies examine the relationship between childhood sleep problems and subsequent substance use. In this study, we examined how sleep problems at ages 3-8 predicted onset of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in adolescence. We also investigated the relationships between childhood sleep problems and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Methods: Study participants were 292 boys and 94 girls from a community sample of high risk families and controls in an ongoing longitudinal study.
   Results: Controlling for parental alcoholism, sleep problems at ages 3-8 predicted onset of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among boys and onset of alcohol use among girls. Childhood sleep problems were related to maternal ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence for both boys and girls. Adjusting for these problems did not weaken the effects of sleep problems on onset of substance use.
   Conclusions: This is to our knowledge the first study that prospectively examines gender differences in the relationship between sleep problems and early onset of substance use. Childhood sleep problems predicted early onset of substance use for boys but not girls. If childhood sleep problems indeed increase the probability Of Substance use onset, greater attention by parents to sleep problems in children and adolescents would potentially have ameliorative long-term effects. Parents are encouraged to explore different ways to help their children sleep better, including obtaining information and suggestions from their primary care physicians. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Alcohol problem use during adolescence has been linked to a variety of adverse consequences, including cigarette and illicit drug use, delinquency, adverse effects on pubertal brain development and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In addition, heavy alcohol-drinking adolescents are at increased risk of comorbid psychopathology, including internalizing symptomatology (especially depression and anxiety). A range of genetic and non-genetic factors have been implicated in both alcohol problem use as well as internalizing symptomatology. However, to what extent shared risk factors contribute to their comorbidity in adolescence is poorly understood.
   We conducted a systematic review on Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science to identify epidemiological and molecular genetic studies published between November 1997 and November 2007 that examined risk factors that may be shared in common between alcohol problem use and internalizing symptomatology in adolescence.
   Externalizing disorders, family alcohol problems and stress, as well as the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) S-allele, the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) low-activity alleles and the dopamine D2 receptor (DDR2) Taq A1 allele have been associated most frequently with both traits. An increasing number of papers are focusing upon the role of gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions in the development of comorbid alcohol problem use and internalizing symptomatology.
   Further research in adolescents is warranted; the increasing availability of large longitudinal genetically informative studies will provide the evidence base from which effective prevention and intervention strategies for comorbid alcohol problems and internalizing symptomatology can be developed.

AB The goal of the study was to assess two types of school-based interventions-a class intervention (integrated) and a small group counseling (segregated) intervention for highly aggressive children-and to determine which is more efficacious in reducing individual and classroom aggression, lessening internalizing and externalizing behavior, and increasing positive classroom relationships. The study, conducted in Israel, included 904 children from 13 schools. In each school, one age level was selected and divided randomly into three experimental conditions: psychoeducational class intervention, small group counseling, and control. In all classrooms, the highly aggressive children were identified a priori (n = 166). Analyses were conducted separately for the aggressive children and their nonaggressive classmates, in a nested procedure (mixed models). Results showed similar positive outcomes on all variables in both treatment groups, and higher compared with the control group. The discussion focuses on the strengths of each type of intervention.

AB Previous research has demonstrated impact of psychosocial adversity on the mental health of children. This cross-sectional study examined specific influences of psychosocial adversity on internalizing versus externalizing symptoms, as explained by relative neighborhood disadvantage, sociocultural disadvantage, and exposure to interpersonal and non-interpersonal traumatic life events. Participants included 258 children aged 6 to 12 years from two Swedish elementary schools located in two socioeconomically distinct neighborhood settings. Information was obtained from their parents by means of questionnaires (a demographic form including information about parental occupation and country of origin, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Life Incidence of Traumatic Events checklist). Neighborhood differences in mental health were explained by variability in psychosocial adversity. While controlling for gender, age, and the other symptom dimension, sociocultural disadvantage was associated with internalizing but not with externalizing symptoms. In contrast, traumatic life events and especially interpersonal traumas were related to externalizing but not to internalizing symptoms. These findings provide some support for specificity of psychosocial adversities in the impact on child mental health.

AB The current study examines violent and nonviolent traumatic events involving friends and family members as predictors of PTSD, depression, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors in a sample of 403 African American early adolescents from chronically violent environments. Although there are many studies of urban children's exposure to community violence, few address the unique contribution of events involving significant others, and almost no research addresses African American youths' exposure to traumatic events other than violence. This study found that violent and nonviolent traumatic events were pervasive in the lives of these urban youth, and that they were as likely to report loss and injury of a close other through an accident as an act of violence. There were strong gender differences in the data. Unexpectedly, injury or loss of a close friend or family member from nonviolent events, but not from violent events, predicted PTSD, internalizing, and depression for boys. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for school-based universal interventions in communities where large numbers of children live with loss and trauma.

AB Objective: There is increasing interest in the relations between adverse early experiences and subsequent psychiatric disorders. Institutional rearing is considered an adverse caregiving environment, but few studies have systematically examined its effects. This study aimed to determine whether removing young children from institutional care and placing them with foster families would reduce psychiatric morbidity at 54 months of age.
   Method: Young children living in institutions in Bucharest were enrolled when they were between 6 and 30 months of age. Following baseline assessment, 136 children were randomly assigned to care as usual (continued institutional care) or to removal and placement in foster care that was created as part of the study. Psychiatric disorders, symptoms, and comorbidity were examined by structured psychiatric interviews of caregivers of 52 children receiving care as usual and 59 children in foster care when the children were 54 months of age. Both groups were compared to 59 typically developing, never-institutionalized Romanian children recruited from pediatric clinics in Bucharest. Foster care was created and supported by social workers in Bucharest who received regular consultation from U.S. clinicians.
   Results: Children with any history of institutional rearing had more psychiatric disorders than children without such a history (53.2% versus 22.0%). Children removed from institutions and placed in foster families were less likely to have internalizing disorders than children who continued with care as usual ( 22.0% versus 44.2%). Boys were more symptomatic than girls regardless of their caregiving environment and, unlike girls, had no reduction in total psychiatric symptoms following foster placement.
   Conclusions: Institutional rearing was associated with substantial psychiatric morbidity. Removing young children from institutions and placing them in families significantly reduced internalizing disorders, although girls were significantly more responsive to this intervention than boys.

AB This article reviews the use of the broad category of internalizing disorders and data on young children using this definition. It also reviews the emerging support for more specific internalizing diagnoses in very young children. The current empiric database on nosology and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in young children is examined, and a clinical case example is included. Identification of recent advances in the understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders in young children and areas in which future studies are needed also are explored.

AB This study evaluated the effectiveness of a group mentoring program that included components of empirically supported mentoring and cognitive behavioral techniques for children served at a community mental health center. Eighty-six 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to either group mentoring or a wait-list control group. Group mentoring significantly increased children's reported social problem-solving skills and decreased parent-reported child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems after controlling for other concurrent mental health services. Attrition from the group mentoring program was notably low (7%) for children. The integration of a cognitive behavioral group mentoring program into children's existing community mental health services may result in additional reductions in externalizing and internalizing behavior problems.

AB Purpose of review
   Two decades of research has implicated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the development of antisocial behavior in children. However, findings regarding the association between cortisol and antisocial behavior have been largely inconsistent, and the role of the HPA axis in relation to broader etiological processes remains unclear. We examine evidence that the role of the HPA axis in the development of antisocial behavior may differ across subgroups of children.
   Recent findings
   A meta-analysis has supported the prediction that low levels of cortisol are associated with risk for childhood antisocial behavior, but the relationship is weaker than previously assumed. Recent studies suggest the association between cortisol levels and antisocial behavior may vary depending on type of antisocial behavior, patterns of internalizing comorbidity, and early environmental adversity. The findings are consistent with evidence that two early-onset pathways to antisocial behavior can be distinguished based on the presence or absence of callous-unemotional traits.
   Summary
   We speculate that early adversity is important to the development of chronic antisocial behavior in children with low levels of callous-unemotional traits and HPA-axis hyperactivity, but that high levels of callous-unemotional traits and HPA-axis hypoactivity characterize a particularly severe subgroup, for whom antisocial behavior develops somewhat independently of adversity.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the relations of effortful control (EC), impulsivity, and negative emotionality to at least borderline clinical levels of symptoms and change in maladjustment over four years. Children's (N = 214: 77% European American; M age = 73 months) externalizing and internalizing symptoms were rated by parents and teachers at 3 times, 2 years apart (T1, T2, and T3) and were related to children's adult-rated EC, impulsivity, and emotion. In addition, the authors found patterns of change in maladjustment were related to these variables at T3 while controlling for the T1 predictor. Externalizing problems (pure or co-occurring with internalizing problems) were associated with low EC, high impulsivity, and negative emotionality, especially anger, and patterns of change also related to these variables. Internalizing problems were associated with low impulsivity and sadness and somewhat with high anger. Low attentional EC was related to internalizing problems only in regard to change in maladjustment. Change in impulsivity was associated with change in internalizing primarily when controlling for change in externalizing problems.

AB Data from a prospective 11-year longitudinal survey were used to identify early predictors and pathways to symptoms of anxiety and depression at 12-13 years of age, and to examine whether there were unique predictors of anxious versus depressive symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to explore longitudinal relations between contextual (maternal distress, family adversities, and social support) and temperamental (shyness and emotionality) risk factors in their prediction of informant-consistent symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results show that early risk factors can explain 38% of the variance in boys' covarying symptoms of anxiety and depression in early adolescence, and 25% of variance in girls' covarying symptoms. Two main pathways were identified. One pathway was through temperament, as nearly all risk factors were partly mediated through child emotionality in midchildhood. Another pathway was through early contextual risk factors, with all direct and indirect contextual impact from before 5 years of age. Family adversity uniquely predicted depressive symptoms. These findings underscore the persisting impact of contextual predictors in families with children less than 5 years of age. The importance of early interventions to prevent adolescent internalizing problems is stressed.

AB In the past, research has demonstrated that parental depression and parenting practices are related. More recently, there has been an increase in research examining child outcomes as they are related to maternal and paternal psychopathology. To continue with this line of research, this study examined the relationships among mothers' and fathers' symptoms of depression, characteristics of their parenting practices, and their ratings of their young children's internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. The results of this study demonstrated that these variables are related significantly. Further, the results of this study suggested that mothers' parenting, particularly their limit setting with their young children, is an important predictor of their ratings of their young children's externalizing behaviour problems in the context of their own symptoms of depression. A different pattern of relationships may be present for fathers, as both their symptoms of depression and their parenting characteristics predicted their ratings of their young children's externalizing behaviour problems. Such findings were not supported for young children's internalizing behaviour problems. These findings suggested that interventions should have different targets for mothers and fathers.

AB The Behaviour Style Observation System for Young Children (BSOS) was used to predict preschool-aged children's externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems in middle childhood, 3-5 years after the initial assessment. This observational measurement tool was designed to sample and assess young children's disruptive, non-compliant, and unresponsive behaviour, during a brief (11 min) observation in the child's home. In the current study, the BSOS was used to predict parent and teacher ratings of child behaviour problems after school entry in a longitudinal sample (N = 81) of at-risk children at time 2. The BSOS predicted teacher-reported externalizing problems at time 2. In contrast, parent reports of behaviour problems, although correlated with repeated parent reports at time 2, were not significantly predictive of teacher-reported behaviour problems at school age. The BSOS was not associated with either parent or teacher reports of internalizing problems. These findings emphasize the importance and utility of using observational measures when examining the continuity of behaviour problems in young children over time.

AB In this study the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the brief infant-toddler social emotional assessment (BITSEA) were investigated in a community sample. The sample consisted of 462 children (mean age: 24.60 +/- 7.93 [12-42] months) who had applied to Turkish health centers for immunization. Both parents completed the BITSEA; mothers completed the child behavior checklist 2/3 (CBCL). Internal consistencies of the BITSEA-problem (P) and competence (C) scales were good to excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82 and 0.72, respectively). Interrater reliability between parents and test-retest reliability were good. BITSEA/P scores were significantly correlated with CBCL internalizing, externalizing and total problem scores (p < 0.001). Maternal BITSEA/P cutpoint scores revealed that 30.6% of male toddlers and 28.6% of females were in the subclinical range and 13.1% of males and 17.6% of females were in clinical range. Results reveal that the Turkish version of BITSEA is a reliable, valid and simply applicable instrument for screening social, emotional and behavioral problems among toddlers. Clinical validation of the BITSEA/C and BITSEA/P is warranted. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioral problems are frequent among post-institutionalized Eastern European adoptees. However, risk factors related to outcomes have not been fully delineated. We evaluated 50 Eastern European adoptees, age 8-10 years, with their adoptive families for more than five years. Cognitive and behavioral outcomes and parenting stress were evaluated in relation to pre-adoptive risk factors, including arrival age, growth, and facial phenotype related to prenatal alcohol exposure. At follow-up, IQ and achievement scores were >= average in most children (>= 74%). Behavioral and school problems were common (externalizing 44%, internalizing 18%, behavioral symptoms 50%, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 46%, learning disabilities 40%, mental health disorders 28%); 38% had multiple problems. Behavioral problems correlated inversely with IQ. Parent stress was high and correlated with child externalizing behaviors and inversely to child full scale IQ. Children with "severe behavioral disturbances" (24%) were more likely to have had smaller head circumferences at arrival. Child's age at adoption related inversely to parent stress, possibly due to the longer duration of time that children resided with their families. "High/intermediate risk" phenotypic facial scores for prenatal alcohol exposure (58%) correlated with head circumference z scores at arrival and follow-up. Otherwise, arrival age, growth, and facial phenotype did not correlate with these specific outcome measures.

AB This study examined self-reports of social victimization and parent reports of adjustment for a sample followed from fourth through seventh grades. Different patterns of social victimization experiences were identified; of the 153 students (79 girls) with complete data, 24% reported chronic social victimization, 23% reported transient experiences of social victimization, and 53% reported being socially victimized at no more than one time point. We examined whether students who experienced persistent and periodic social victimization were at greater risk for internalizing problems than nonvictims. Persistently victimized children demonstrated continuously elevated levels of internalizing problems. Children who were not originally victimized by social aggression but became victimized with time did not demonstrate higher levels of internalizing problems than did nonvictims. Findings were mixed for those who escaped social victimization during this period.

AB Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) towards tactile and auditory input can impact children's participation in academic and social activities; however the prevalence of SOR behaviors and their relation to social-emotional problems and competence has not been rigorously studied. This study investigated SOR in a representative sample of elementary school-aged children (n = 925, 50% boys, ages 7-11 years) who were followed from infancy. Sixteen percent of parents reported that at least four tactile or auditory sensations bothered their children. Being bothered by certain sensations was common while others were relatively rare. Parents of children with versus without elevated SOR in school-age reported higher frequencies of early and co-occurring internalizing, externalizing, and dysregulation problems, and lower levels of concurrent adaptive social behaviors. Early identification of elevated SOR and assessment of concurrent social-emotional status are important to minimize their impact on social adaptive behaviors at school age.

AB Parent cultural adaptation and preschool behavioral and socioemotional functioning were examined in a community sample of urban families from diverse cultural backgrounds. Participants were 130 families of children (mean age = 4.1 years) attending eight public Pre-Kindergarten programs in urban communities. Parents completed a measure of cultural adaptation that taps into acculturation and enculturation, and teachers reported on children's externalizing problems, internalizing problems and adaptive behavior in the classroom. Parents' ethnic identity was a significant predictor of children's functioning. The retention of parents' culture of origin and specific aspects of acculturation are related to positive outcomes in a sample of culturally diverse families of preschoolers living in urban communities. Bicultural parents (those with high ethnic and US American identity) had children with lower levels of internalizing problems and higher levels of adaptive behavior relative to parents who were not bicultural. Implications for enhancing positive child outcomes through the promotion of parental ethnic identity are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The friendships of socially withdrawn/anxious children and early adolescents have been found to lack critical rewarding qualities. Observational research may help elucidate the obstacles they face in forming and maintaining high-quality friendships with sociable peers. Method: We observed the interactions of 38 socially withdrawn early adolescents with their friends and compared them to a community control group. Results: In negotiating the sharing of an object, the socially withdrawn, anxious group was more passive than controls. The socially withdrawn, anxious participants engaged less actively in a fast-paced game involving miniature cars. While completing a quiet drawing task, the socially anxious, withdrawn participants tended to refrain from comparing their work to that of their friends. In all three of our closed-field situations, the socially withdrawn, anxious participants displayed relatively neutral affect in comparison with the control group. Conclusions: These results suggest that the social withdrawal and social anxiety of children with social phobia are very evident even within the confines of their close friendships. Therefore, therapeutic interventions at the level of the dyad may be indicated.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among risk factors, cultural assets, and Latino adolescent mental health outcomes. We extend past research by using a longitudinal design and evaluating direct and moderated acculturation effects across a range of internalizing, externalizing, and academic engagement outcomes. The sample consisted of 281 Latino/a youths and one of their parents in metropolitan, small town, and rural areas within North Carolina and Arizona. The length of time the adolescent was in the U. S. was positively related to humiliation, aggression, and school bonding. Adolescent U. S. cultural involvement and parent culture of origin involvement were not significantly related to adolescent mental health or school bonding. Parent U. S. involvement had an inverse association with adolescent social problems, aggression, and anxiety. Adolescent culture of origin involvement was positively related to adolescent self-esteem 1 year later. Inverse relationships were found for the link between adolescent culture of origin involvement and hopelessness, social problems, and aggression 1 year later. Implications for prevention programming and policy development are discussed.

AB We investigated whether role models (individuals adolescents look up to) contributed to the resilience of adolescents who were exposed to negative nonparental adult influences. Our sample included 659 African American, ninth-grade adolescents. We found that adolescents' exposure to negative adult behavior was associated with increased externalizing, internalizing, and substance using behaviors, as well as more negative school attitudes and behavior. We found that role models had protective effects on externalizing and internalizing behaviors and compensatory effects on school outcomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that role models can contribute to the resilience of African American adolescents who are exposed to negative nonparental adult behavior.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral parent therapy (BPT) program in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using multidimensional evaluations, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Between 2001 and 2005, the parents of 21 preschool children with ADHD were divided into six groups and participated in a series of 11 BPT sessions. Before and after BPT, the parents completed the CBCL,. and the teachers completed the TRF. The behavioral and emotional problems of the children showed improvement after the BPT sessions, specifically for the following categories: internalizing problems, anxious/depressed syndromes, somatic complaints, externalizing problems, rule-breaking behaviors, aggressive behaviors, social problems, thought problems, and attention problems. In the DSM-oriented scale of the CBCL, affective problems, anxiety problems, somatic problems, ADHD problems, oppositional defiant disorder problems, and conduct disorder problems showed significant improvements. On the DSM scale of the TRF, Inattention syndrome improved significantly after the BPT sessions, while other syndromes showed non-significant changes. We conclude that the BPT program significantly improved the children's behavioral problems at home and inattention problems at school.

AB Background. Although radiation therapy is a primary treatment for craniopharyngioma, it can exacerbate existing problems related to the tumor and pre-irradiation management. Survival is often marked by neurologic deficits, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, cognitive deficiencies, and behavioral and social problems. Procedure. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to evaluate behavioral and social problems during the first 5 years of follow-up in 27 patients with craniopharyngioma treated with conformal radiation therapy. Results. All group averages for the CBCL scales were within the age-typical range at pre-irradiation baseline. Extent of surgical resection was implicated in baseline differences for the internalizing, externalizing, behavior problem and social scores. Significant longitudinal changes were found in internalizing, externalizing, behavior problem and school scores that correlated with tumor and treatment-related factors. Conclusions. The most common variables implicated in postirradiation behavioral and social problems were CSF shunting, presence of an Ommaya reservoir, diabetes insipidus, and low pre-irradiation growth hormone levels.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and behavioral problems among inner-city children with asthma.
   METHODS: We examined data for 194 children (aged 4-10 years) who were enrolled in a school-based asthma intervention program ( response rate: 72%). SDB was assessed by using the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder Questionnaire that contains 3 subscales: snoring, sleepiness, and attention/hyperactivity. For the current study, we modified the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder Questionnaire by removing the 6 attention/hyperactivity items. A sleep score of >0.33 was considered indicative of SDB. To assess behavior, caregivers completed the Behavior Problem Index (BPI), which includes 8 behavioral subdomains. We conducted bivariate analyses and multiple linear regression to determine the association of SDB with BPI scores.
   RESULTS: The majority of children (mean age: 8.2 years) were male (56%), black (66%), and insured by Medicaid (73%). Overall, 33% of the children experienced SDB. In bivariate analyses, children with SDB had significantly higher ( worse) behavior scores compared with children without SDB on total BPI (13.7 vs 8.8) and the subdomains externalizing (9.4 vs 6.3), internalizing (4.4 vs 2.5), anxious/depressed (2.4 vs 1.3), headstrong (3.2 vs 2.1), antisocial (2.3 vs 1.7), hyperactive (3.0 vs 1.8), peer conflict (0.74 vs 0.43), and immature (2.0 vs 1.5). In multiple regression models adjusting for several important covariates, SDB remained significantly associated with total BPI scores and externalizing, internalizing, anxious/depressed, headstrong, and hyperactive behaviors. Results were consistent across SDB subscales (snoring, sleepiness).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that poor sleep was independently associated with behavior problems in a large proportion of urban children with asthma. Systematic screening for SDB in this high-risk population might help to identify children who would benefit from additional intervention. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 218-225

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate polymorphisms of the APOE gene as modifiers of neurobehavioral outcomes for preschool-aged children with congenital heart defects, after cardiac surgery.
   METHODS: A prospective observational study with neurodevelopmental evaluation between the fourth and fifth birthdays was performed. Attention and behavioral skills were assessed through parental report.
   RESULTS: Parents of 380 children completed the neurobehavioral measures. Child Behavior Checklist scores for the pervasive developmental problem scale were in the at-risk or clinically significant range for 15% of the cohort, compared with 9% for the normative data (P < .00001). Attention problem scores were in the at-risk or clinically significant range for 12% of the cohort, compared with 7% for the normative data (P = .0002). The Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV, Preschool Version, was completed for 378 children; 30% scored in the clinically significant range for inattention and 22% for impulsivity. After adjustment for covariates, the APOE is an element of 2 allele was significantly associated with higher scores ( worse problems) for multiple Child Behavior Checklist indices, including somatic complaints (P = .009), pervasive developmental problems (P = .032), and internalizing problems (P = .009). In each case, the is an element of 4 allele was associated with a better outcome. APOE is an element of 2 carriers had impaired social skills, compared with is an element of 4 carriers (P = .009).
   CONCLUSIONS: For preschool-aged children with congenital heart defects requiring surgery, parental rating scales showed an increased prevalence of restricted behavior patterns, inattention, and impaired social interactions. The APOE is an element of 2 allele was associated with increased behavior problems, impaired social interactions, and restricted behavior patterns. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 241-250

AB OBJECTIVE: To study outcome of low-risk moderately preterm birth between 32 and 36/7 weeks' gestation.
   METHODS: 377 Moderately preterm children (M: 34.7, SD: 1.2 complete weeks), without need for neonatal intensive care and without dysmaturity or congenital malformations, were compared with 182 term children and assessed at eight years (M: 8.9, SD: 0.54). School situation, IQ, sustained attention, behavior problems, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity characteristics were studied.
   RESULTS: Special education was attended by 7.7% of the moderately preterm children, more than twice the rate of 2.8% in the general Dutch population of this age. Additional exploration for two preterm subgroups of 32 to 33 versus 34 to 36 weeks' gestation showed a need for special education in 9.7% versus 7.3% and a significant difference in grade retention for 30% versus 17%, respectively. Of the children attending mainstream primary schools, grade retention was found in 19% of the preterm versus 8% of the comparison children. Adjusting for maternal education, a group difference of 3 points was found in IQ. The preterm children needed more time for the sustained attention task. The preterm children had more behavior problems (specifically internalizing problems with 27% scoring above the borderline cut-off), as well as more attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder characteristics (specifically attention deficits).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and emotional regulation difficulties affect functioning of moderately preterm children, as school problems, a slightly lower IQ, attention and behavioral problems are found when they are compared with term-born children. Identification and monitoring of precursors of these problems at younger age is needed in view of prevention purposes. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 251-257

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the risk posed to infant development by triplet birth persists into childhood and whether growth-discordant triplets are at a particularly high developmental risk.
   METHODS: Twenty-one sets of triplets were matched with 21 sets of twins and 21 singletons (N = 126) for medical and demographic conditions and were followed from birth to 5 years. At 6, 12, and 24 months, cognitive development was assessed and mother-infant interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity and child social engagement. At 5 years, the children's cognitive development and neuropsychological skills were tested, social engagement was coded from mother-child interactions, and behavior problems were examined. Maternal adjustment was assessed during interviews at 1 and 5 years.
   RESULTS: Although triplets showed lower cognitive performance at 6, 12, and 24 months as compared with singletons and twins, differences were attenuated by 5 years in both global IQ and executive functions. Similarly, the lower social engagement observed across infancy and the higher internalizing symptoms reported at 2 years for those in the triplet group were no longer found at 5 years. Difficulties in maternal adjustment among mothers of triplets decreased from 1 to 5 years. However, in 65.2% of the initial sample there was a weight discordance of >15% at birth, and the discordant triplets showed poorer cognitive and social development as compared with their siblings across infancy. At 5 years, the discordant children demonstrated lower cognitive and executive functions performance, decreased social engagement, and higher internalizing symptoms as compared with both siblings and peers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Whereas most triplets catch up after an early developmental delay, the risk for discordant triplets seems to persist into childhood. Such infants, who are at both biological and environmental risk, should receive special and consistent professional care. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 316-323

AB Objective. To investigate the associations between dietary patterns and mental health in early adolescence.
   Method. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study is a prospective study of 2900 pregnancies recruited from 1989-1992. At 14 years of age (2003-2006; n = 1324), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess behaviour (characterising mental health status), with higher scores representing poorer behaviour. Two dietary patterns (Western and Healthy) were identified using factor analysis and food group intakes estimated by a 212-item food frequency questionnaire. Relationships between dietary patterns, food group intakes and behaviour were examined using general linear modelling following adjustment for potential confounding factors at age 14: total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, screen use, family structure, income and functioning, gender and maternal education at pregnancy.
   Results. Higher total (b = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.06, 3.35), internalizing (withdrawn/depressed) (b = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.15, 2.35) and externalizing (delinquent/aggressive) (b = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.51, 3.68) CBCL scores were significantly associated with the Western dietary pattern, with increased intakes of takeaway foods, confectionary and red meat. Improved behavioural scores were significantly associated with higher intakes of leafy green vegetables and fresh fruit (components of the Healthy pattern).
   Conclusion. These findings implicate a Western dietary pattern in poorer behavioural outcomes for adolescents. Better behavioural outcomes were associated with a higher intake of fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioral genetic research has concluded that the more important environmental influences result in differences between siblings (referred to as nonshared; e(2)), whereas environmental influences that create similarities between siblings (referred to as shared; c(2)) are indistinguishable from zero. However, there is mounting evidence that during childhood and adolescence, c(2) may make important contributions to most forms of psychopathology. The aim of the meta-analysis was to empirically confirm this hypothesis. The author examined twin and adoption studies (n = 490) of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology prior to adulthood. Analyses revealed that c(2) accounted for 10%-19% of the variance within conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, depression, and broad internalizing and externalizing disorders, regardless of their operationalization. When age, informant, and sex effects were considered, c(2) generally ranged from 10%-30% of the variance. Importantly, c(2) estimates did not vary across twin and adoption studies, suggesting that these estimates reflect actual environmental influences common to siblings. The only exception was attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which appeared to be largely genetic (and particularly nonadditive genetic) in origin. Conceptual, methodological, and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB In this study we examined the prospective relationships between perseverative thoughts, internalizing negative emotions, and somatic complaints in children aged 9-13, and evaluated whether a perseverative thoughts intervention had a beneficial effect on these experiences. Children (N=227) from 7 primary schools in Leiden, the Netherlands, recorded their perseverative thoughts during one week, 138 of whom were instructed to postpone these thoughts to a special 30 min period in the early evening. Children who had received the postponement instructions showed a reduction in the frequency of perseverative thoughts, and girls also in the duration of them. Girl's perseverative thoughts were positively associated with the number of somatic complaints and with negative emotions. The postponement intervention also seemed to reduce somatic complaints in the seventh grade children. These findings confirm the previously found prospective relationship between perseverative thoughts and children's well-being and provide initial validation for the use of the postponement intervention to reduce perseverative thoughts in this age group, particularly for girls.

AB The correlates between public and private self-consciousness and internalizing difficulties were examined during early adolescence. Friendship quality was assessed as a possible moderator of the relation between self-consciousness and maladjustment. One hundred and thirty-seven young adolescents (N = 87 girls; Mage = 13: 98 years) reported on their self-consciousness, internalizing problems, and the quality of their best friendship. Results indicated stronger associations between private self-consciousness and internalizing correlates than between public self-consciousness and internalizing problems, suggesting that private self-consciousness may be a stronger risk factor during adolescence. Contrary to expectations, evidence revealed that positive friendship quality may exacerbate some difficulties associated with self-consciousness. Results pertaining to friendship quality add to the growing literature on the ways in which friendships can contribute to adjustment difficulties.

AB The present study investigates five types of continuity of personality and internalizing and externalizing problems (i.e., structural, differential, mean-level, individual-level and ipsative continuity) in a sample of referred children and adolescents (N = 114) with a broad variety of psychological problems. Mothers were administered a child personality and psychopathology measure, i.e., the Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children [Handleiding hiA << rarchische persoonlijkheidsvragenlijst voor kinderen (manual hierarchical personality inventory for children). Ghent University, Department of Developmental, Personality, and Social Psychology, Ghent, 2005] and the Child Behavior Checklist [Handleiding voor de cbcl/4-18: (Manual of the CBCL/4-18), Afdeling Kinder- en Jeugdpsychiatrie. Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 1996] at two measurement occasions, with a 26-months interval. Personality was substantially stable, paralleling findings for non-referred peers. Internalizing and Externalizing Problem Behavior were almost as stable as personality traits, suggesting that childhood psychopathology is more persistent than generally assumed. Strengths and limitations of the present study and implications for further research are discussed.

AB Sickle cell disease (SCD) complications place patients at risk for poor psychosocial adaptation, including depression and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to test a mediator model based on the Risk and Resistance model to explore the role of intrapersonal characteristics and stress processing variables in psychosocial functioning. Participants were 44 adolescents with SCD, 15 healthy siblings, and 43 primary caregivers, recruited from an East Coast comprehensive sickle cell center. The participants completed paper and pencil measures of resilience factors (attributional style, hope, coping) and internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety). Internalizing symptoms among adolescents with SCD and healthy siblings did not differ and were within non-clinical ranges. Self-esteem of adolescents with SCD was correlated with less depression and anxiety and sense of inadequacy was associated with poorer functioning. There were no findings to support the role of coping in psychosocial adjustment. Although the mediation hypothesis was not supported, findings highlighted the resilience of this sample of adolescents with SCD. Determining how these resilience factors protect adolescents with SCD may aid in the development of psychosocial interventions. In particular, interventions should focus on improving intrapersonal skills and coping with stress and investigate ways to tailor these interventions to African-American populations.

AB The goal of this study was to examine relationships between several family characteristics and the adjustment (at individual, relational and school levels) of 63 school-aged children and adolescents growing up in families that received psychosocial interventions by Social Services of the Seville Council. The second aim was to explore possible differences in family characteristics between at-risk children non-adapted to their classroom and adapted children. We compared at-risk children to their classmates (N = 747) and established the rate of at-risk children non-adapted to their classroom. First, the models tested showed low to moderate prediction ability, with ecological levels of family variables playing a specific role depending on the outcome considered. Perceived satisfaction was relevant for internalizing problems, quality of home environment predicted the externalizing problems and both relational and group-level variables explained social skills and academic performance. Second, at-risk children non-adapted to their classroom performed more poorly than adapted ones when several development measures were considered. Taking family variables into account, only the mother's perceived competence and socio-economic status were statistically different for adolescents non-adapted to the classroom, compared to the adapted children.

AB Theoretically informed models are required to further the comprehensive understanding of children's ETV. We draw on the stress process paradigm to forward an overall conceptual model of ETV (ETV) in childhood and adolescence. Around this conceptual model, we synthesize research in four dominant areas of the literature which are detailed but often disconnected including: (1) exposure to three forms of physical violence (e.g., child physical maltreatment, interparental violence, and community ETV); (2) the multilevel correlates and causes of ETV (e.g., neighborhood characteristics including concentrated disadvantage; family characteristics including socio-economic status and family stressors); (3) a range of consequences of ETV (e.g., internalizing and externalizing mental health problems, role transitions, and academic outcomes); and (4) multilevel and cross domain mediators and moderators of ETV influences (e.g., school and community factors, family social support, and individual coping resources). We highlight the range of interconnected processes through which violence exposures may influence children and suggest opportunities for prevention and intervention. We further identify needed future research on children's ETV including coping resources as well as research on cumulative contributions of violence exposure, violence exposure modifications, curvilinearity, and timing of exposure.

AB Community violence is recognized as a major public health problem (WHO, World Report on Violence and Health, 2002) that Americans increasingly understand has adverse implications beyond inner-cities. However, the majority of research on chronic community violence exposure focuses on ethnic minority, impoverished, and/or crime-ridden communities while treatment and prevention focuses on the perpetrators of the violence, not on the youth who are its direct or indirect victims. School-based treatment and preventive interventions are needed for children at elevated risk for exposure to community violence. In preparation, a longitudinal, community epidemiological study, The Multiple Opportunities to Reach Excellence (MORE) Project, is being fielded to address some of the methodological weaknesses presented in previous studies. This study was designed to better understand the impact of children's chronic exposure to community violence on their emotional, behavioral, substance use, and academic functioning with an overarching goal to identify malleable risk and protective factors which can be targeted in preventive and intervention programs. This paper describes the MORE Project, its conceptual underpinnings, goals, and methodology, as well as implications for treatment and preventive interventions and future research.

AB To identify symptoms reported by parents that predict abnormal laboratory investigations in preschoolers with global developmental delay (GDD). Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive study of 8 1 boys and 38 girls, with a mean age of 43.5 months (SD = 13.4), with global developmental delay. All parents/guardians completed the following: (1) a semistructured interview about their child and family; (2) the Child Development Inventory (CDI); (3) the Possible Problems Checklist (PPC); and (4) the Child Behavior Checklist 1 1/2-5 (CBCL). Results. There were 61 abnormal results: MRI 37 (31%); high-resolution chromosomes 8 (7%); fragile X molecular testing 4 (3%); and microarray comparative genomic hybridization 12 (10%). A total of 47 children had abnormal tests (40%): none, 72 (60%); one, 36 (30%); two, 8 (7%); three, (3%). Younger children with more developmental delays are more likely to have abnormal tests. They are Clumsy, more passive, and less disobedience. They had lower total, externalizing, and internalizing problems scores. The odds of finding an abnormal investigation are increasingly greater as parent's report of language comprehension and social development ratios increase, and decrease in likelihood for every increase in the expressive language and fine motor ratios. Interpretation. Parent's reports predict abnormal tests and indicate quantifiable differences requiring investigation.

AB Background: Existing research indicates sleep problems to be prevalent in youth with internalizing disorders. However, childhood sleep problems are common in the general population and few data are available examining unique relationships between sleep, specific types of anxiety and depressive symptoms among non-clinical samples of children and adolescents. Methods: The presence of sleep problems was examined among a community sample of children and adolescents (N=175) in association with anxiety and depressive symptoms, age, and. gender Based on emerging findings from the adult literature we also examined associations between cognitive biases and sleep problems. Results: Overall findings revealed significant associations between sleep problems and both anxiety and depressive symptoms, though results varied by age. Depressive symptoms showed a greater association with sleep problems among adolescents, while anxiety symptoms were generally associated with sleep problems in all youth. Cognitive factors (cognitive errors and control beliefs) linked with anxiety and depression also were associated with sleep problems among adolescents, though these correlations were no longer significant after controlling for internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of their implications for research and treatment of sleep and internalizing disorders in youth. Depression and Anxiety 26.503-512, 2009.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate suicidal ideations and associated psychopathology in two groups of adolescents, a sample of detained youth and a general population sample. In both groups the comparisons of mental health characteristics between suicidal ideators and non-suicidal youth were conducted separately for girls and boys.
   The study sample consisted of 290 delinquent adolescents [228 boys and 62 girls] from three Flemish juvenile detention centers and 1,548 adolescents [811 boys and 737 girls] from an age-matched school-based sample. Both groups were administered the Social and Health Assessment [SAHA], a self-report survey investigating levels of psychopathology [internalizing and externalizing] and risk-taking behavior.
   Suicidal ideations during the past year were reported by 21.5% of detained males, compared to 6.7% in the general population. In females, 58.1% of detained individuals reported suicidal thoughts during the past year, compared to 14.4% of the general population. In girls and boys from the general population, both internalizing and externalizing problems were higher in suicidal ideators than in non-suicidal youth, while in the detention group mainly internalizing problems were higher in suicidal ideators. When comparing detention suicidal ideators with those from the general population, male suicidal ideators scored higher on delinquency, while detained female suicidal ideators also scored higher on posttraumatic stress, but lower on prosocial beliefs.
   Information used in this study was solely based on self-report measures only and limited to Flemish adolescents.
   Since suicidal ideation is a frequent problem in detained youth, adequate recognition and treatment seems clinically relevant. While both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology may be an indicator of suicidal ideation in the general population, internalizing problems may be the main clinical predictor in detained youth.

AB Objective. - The purpose of this study wits to investigate the degree of agreement among parents, teachers and adolescents with respect to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and the Youth Self Report (YSR). In addition we evaluated the suitability of these three forms (CBCL, TRF and YSR) in terms of their contribution to understanding internalizing and externalizing disorders in youths being referred to a child and adolescent unit of a psychiatric care facility.
   Methods. - A total of 611 patients aged 11-18 years (mean age 13.0, SD 1.6) were assessed using the CBCL, the TRF and the YSR.
   Results. - Intraclass coefficients (ICC) showed low to moderate agreement among informants. Furthermore, the level of agreement was generally less among patients suffering from internalizing disorders than for young patients who displayed externalizing disorders. Logistic regression revealed that the TRF internalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL internalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of internalizing disorders in youth. The YSR internalizing syndrome scale, on the other hand, was not a relevant factor among adolescents of a clinical target population. Likewise, only the TRF extemalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL externalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of externalizing disorders in youth.
   Conclusions. - Particularly the CBCL and TRF are useful instruments in assessing internalizing and externalizing disorders in adolescents referred to a mental health setting. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the relations of 84 preschoolers' (43 boys; mean age = 54 months) situational stress reactivity to their observed emotions and mothers' reports of temperament and adjustment. Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) were collected prior to, and following, a frustrating task. Children's anger, sadness, and positive affect were measured, and mothers reported on preschoolers' dispositional emotionality, regulation, impulsivity, and problem behaviors. Forty-seven percent of children had an increase in sAA and 52% had an increase in cortisol following the challenging task. On average, sAA levels showed the predicted pattern of rise following the frustrating task, followed by return to baseline. For cortisol, there was a mean increase from pre-task to 40 min post-test. sAA reactivity was associated with relatively low levels of dispositional anger and impulsivity and relatively high regulation, particularly for girls. sAA reactivity also was related to low externalizing problems for girls, but not boys. Although cortisol reactivity was unrelated to children's emotions and maladjustment, it was positively related to mothers' reports of regulation. The findings suggest that sAA reactivity in response to a frustrating social task may reflect girls' constrained behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Diagnostic information on children is typically elicited from both children and their parents. The aims of the present paper were to: (1) compare prevalence estimates according to maternal reports, paternal reports and direct interviews of children [major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety and attention-deficit and disruptive behavioural disorders]; (2) assess mother-child, father-child and inter-parental agreement for these disorders; (3) determine the association between several child, parent and familial characteristics and the degree of diagnostic agreement or the likelihood of parental reporting; (4) determine the predictive validity of diagnostic information provided by parents and children. Analyses were based on 235 mother-offspring, 189 father-offspring and 128 mother-father pairs. Diagnostic assessment included the Kiddie-schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) (offspring) and the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) (parents and offspring at follow-up) interviews. Parental reports were collected using the Family History - Research Diagnostic Criteria (FH-RDC). Analyses revealed: (1) prevalence estimates for internalizing disorders were generally lower according to parental information than according to the K-SADS; (2) mother-child and father-child agreement was poor and within similar ranges; (3) parents with a history of MDD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) reported these disorders in their children more frequently; (4) in a sub-sample followed-up into adulthood, diagnoses of MDD, separation anxiety and conduct disorder at baseline concurred with the corresponding lifetime diagnosis at age 19 according to the child rather than according to the parents. In conclusion, our findings support large discrepancies of diagnostic information provided by parents and children with generally lower reporting of internalizing disorders by parents, and differential reporting of depression and ADHD by parental disease status. Follow-up data also supports the validity of information provided by adolescent offspring. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: To compare CBCL (Child Behaviour Check Llist) Urdu, with the validated Urdu version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) used as "gold standard" among school children in Karachi, Pakistan, and to develop local cutoffs for CBCL using SDQ as a gold standard.
   Study Design: A cross-sectional study.
   Place and Duration of Study: Schools of Karachi metropolitan area from January to December 2006.
   Methodology: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) was completed by parents of 5-11 years old primary school children in Karachi. Appropriate cutoff points for total problem, internalizing and externalizing scales were obtained for CBCL.
   Results: A total of 556 parents filled out both the SDQ Urdu version as well as CBCL. Scores from the parent rated total SDQ scores were highly correlated with the total CBCL scores (r=0.589). The local cutoffs derived for CBCL were considerably lower than USA norms. Slightly higher cutoff for males was found as compared to females for the total CBCL scores.
   Conclusion: Like the original English version, the Urdu version of CBCL and SDQ are both equally valid assessment tools to be used for both clinical and research purpose in Pakistani settings, where Urdu is widely spoken and understood.

AB Using an 'at-risk' sample of African American girls, the present study examined the link between girls' retrospective reports of pubertal timing, girls' perceived relative pubertal timing, and their behavioral and emotional problems as rated by the girls themselves (N = 102; 11 - 17 years), as well as teachers and parents. Structural equation modeling results indicated that the girls' retrospective reports of menarche were significantly related to their perceived relative menarche, whereas the girls' retrospective reports of development of their breasts were not related to their perceived relative development of breasts. Girls who perceived their breasts developing early relative to their peers were more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors according to teacher report. Significant effects of teacher reported adolescent internalizing problems also were found for girls who retrospectively reported either early or late development of breasts. The study's findings Underscore the importance of teasing apart the effects of different indicators of girls' pubertal development on psychosocial adjustment and including teachers' reports of girls' emotional and behavioral problems, particularly among girls with the additional risks associated with residing in an economically disadvantaged Urban setting.

AB Little is understood about generalized and non-generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) and their associations With co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence. In the present study, we investigated adolescent boys with SAD symptoms and considered depressive symptoms as well as antisocial behaviors when looking for patterns during two developmental time periods: junior high and high school. Participants in the analyses were part of a longitudinal study. No patterns were found linking antisocial problems and non-generalized SAD in either junior high or high school. Furthermore, it was uncommon for youths in the non-generalized SAD Subgroup to develop comorbidity over time. The generalized SAD subgroup of boys, however, was likely to develop comorbidity either with depressive symptoms only or with depressive symptoms and antisocial tendencies. Our findings Suggest that developmental pathways for SAD subgroups may differ. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined parental experience of having a child with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in 62 parent-child dyads. Youth with a primary diagnosis of OCD and their parent(s) were administered the CY-BOCS jointly by a trained clinician. Parents completed several measures about their child's OCD-related impairment and accommodation, emotional and behavioral functioning, parental distress, caregiver stress, and parental experiences of having a child with OCD. Results indicated that parents of children with OCD are considerably distressed about their child's condition. As expected, negative parental experiences (e.g., anxiety about child's condition, uncertainty about their future) were directly related to OCD symptom severity and impairment, as well as child internalizing and externalizing problems, family accommodation of symptoms, and caregiver strain. The presence of emotional resources was negatively related to most outcomes, although some of these relationships did not achieve statistical significance. The presence of internalizing symptoms mediated the relationship between parental experiences and parental distress. Given these findings, addressing parental experiences as part of a family based cognitive-behavioral treatment program for pediatric OCD may help reduce parental distress and improve patient prognosis.

AB We describe a sample of school-age children of incarcerated parents enrolled in a federally funded mentoring program. A mixed methods approach was applied to discern key themes related to caregiver incarceration. Results demonstrated a high prevalence of posttraumatic stress as well as high rates of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Descriptions of children's stress and coping behaviors in response to the ambiguous loss associated with parental incarceration are presented. Further, implications for similar mentoring programs are discussed.

AB This study evaluated the extent to which a range of risk factors (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, low socioeconomic status) predicted kindergarten children's likelihood of later displaying recurring psychopathology. It used multilevel logistic regression to analyze teacher ratings of frequent and recurring externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors in a longitudinal sample of 4,674 children participating in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, 1998-1999. Results indicated that those most at risk of displaying externalizing problem behaviors in both the third and fifth grade are those entering school already displaying high levels of these behaviors, as well as those displaying low reading readiness. Hispanics are at reduced risk of such problem behaviors. Those most at risk of displaying internalizing behavior problems in the third and fifth grades are those entering kindergarten with such problems and those displaying inattention and other learning-related behavior problems. Asian children are at reduced risk of recurring internalizing behavior problems. Females and children from higher SES families are at reduced risk for both types of psychopathology.

AB Early identification of students who might develop emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) is essential in preventing negative outcomes. Systematic screening tools are available for identifying elementary-age students with EBD, including the Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD) and the Student Risk Screening Scale (SRSS). The SSBD is considered the gold standard for systematic EBD screening. The brevity of the SRSS is often favored with respect to resource allocation. The authors evaluated the concurrent validity of the SRSS to predict SSBD results when used to detect school children with externalizing or internalizing behavior concerns. Between low- and high-risk categories, the SRSS had excellent accuracy for predicting both externalizing (95%) and internalizing (93%) problems oil the SSBD. Sensitivity (94%) and specificity (95%) were both excellent for externalizing behavior, but for internalizing behavior, sensitivity was lower (44%), while specificity was excellent (95%). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis also suggested that the SRSS was more accurate for detecting externalizing than internalizing behaviors. Limitations and future directions are offered.

AB From an initial sample of 1,278 Italian students, the authors selected 537 on the basis of their responses to a self-report bully and victim questionnaire. Participants' ages ranged from 13 to 20 years (M = 15.12 years, SD = 1.08 years). The authors compared the concurrent psychological symptoms of 4 participant groups (bullies, victims, bully/victims [i.e., bullies who were also victims of bullying], and uninvolved students). Of participants, 157 were in the bullies group, 140 were in the victims group, 81 were in the bully/victims group, and 159 were in the uninvolved students group. The results show that bullies reported a higher level of externalizing problems, victims reported more internalizing symptoms, and bully/victims reported both a higher level of externalizing problems and more internalizing symptoms. The authors divided the sample into 8 groups on the basis of the students' recollection of their earlier school experiences and of their present role. The authors classified the participants as stable versus late bullies, victims, bully/victims, or uninvolved students. The authors compared each stable group with its corresponding late group and found that stable victims and stable bully/victims reported higher degrees of anxiety, depression, and withdrawal than did the other groups. The authors focus their discussion on the role of chronic peer difficulties in relation to adolescents' symptoms and well-being.

AB Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a paraprofessional-delivered, home-visiting intervention among young, reservation-based American Indian (AI) mothers on parenting knowledge, involvement, and maternal and infant outcomes. Method: From 2002 to 2004, expectant AI women aged 12 to 22 years (n = 167) were randomized (1:1) to one of two paraprofessional-delivered, home-visiting interventions: the 25-visit "Family Spirit" intervention addressing prenatal and newborn care and maternal life skills (treatment) or a 23-visit breast-feeding/nutrition education intervention (active control). The interventions began during pregnancy and continued to 6 months postpartum. Mothers and children were evaluated at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcomes included changes in mothers' parenting knowledge and involvement. Secondary outcomes included infants' social and emotional behavior; the home environment; and mothers' stress, social support, depression, and substance use. Results: Participants were mostly teenaged, first-time, unmarried mothers living in reservation communities. At 6 and 12 months postpartum, treatment mothers compared with control mothers had greater parenting knowledge gains, 13.5 (p<.0001) and 13.9 (p<.0001) points higher, respectively (100-point scale). At 12 months postpartum, treatment mothers reported their infants to have significantly lower scores on the externalizing domain (beta = -.17, p<.05) and less separation distress in the internalizing domain (beta = -.17, p<.05). No between-group differences were found for maternal involvement, home environment, or mothers' stress, social support, depression, or substance use. Conclusions: This study supports the efficacy of the paraprofessional-delivered Family Spirit home-visiting intervention for young AI mothers on maternal knowledge and infant behavior outcomes. A longer, larger study is needed to replicate results and evaluate the durability of child behavior outcomes. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(6):591-601.

AB Objective: The current study evaluated the efficacy of early intervention for preschool-aged children selected on the basis of risk who also met diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. Method: Seventy-one 3- to 4-year-old children were selected based on demonstrating high levels of inhibition and having a parent with a current anxiety disorder. They were randomly allocated to an eight-session parent intervention or waitlist. Results: At baseline, all of the children met criteria for one or more anxiety disorders. At 6-month follow-up, the intervention group showed a significantly greater reduction in anxiety disorders and less interference from their anxiety than the waitlist. In addition, children in the intervention condition showed greater reductions in parent and laboratory observed measures of behavioral inhibition. Conclusions: The results suggest that a brief early intervention delivered through parents can reduce current anxiety and associated risk and may have the potential to alter the developmental trajectory of anxiety in a high-risk group of young children.

AB Objectives: Recent research has suggested that children with autistic spectrum disorders often experience comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, despite this overlap, no quantitative genetic studies have addressed the phenotypic overlap and the etiologic association between internalizing and autistic-like traits within the general population. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic and etiologic relation between internalizing and autistic-like traits using a community-based twin sample. Method: We investigated the co-occurrence of these traits in a population-based sample of 3,233 twin pairs aged 8 to 9 years, using both parent- and teacher-report questionnaires. Bivariate structural equation modeling techniques were used to determine the extent to which internalizing and autistic-like traits shared common genetic and environmental influences. Results: Our results showed that there was a modest phenotypic correlation (r = 0.26-0.29) between autistic-like and internalizing traits. The traits were both substantially heritable but were largely independent with regard to their genetic influences (r(G) = 0.12-0.19). Shared environmental influences were modest but were largely common to both traits. Similar results were found using both parent- and teacher reported data. Conclusions: Internalizing and autistic-like traits showed moderate phenotypic overlap within the general population. This association was explained in small part by shared genetic factors, but the results suggested that most genetic influences were specific to either internalizing traits or autistic traits. Given these findings, we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie the relation between these traits. J Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(6):618-627.

AB Although early Prevention is a strongly expanding field of developmental criminology, there is a lack of sound evaluations in Europe. This study reports short- and long-term effects of two programs for the promotion of child social skills and parenting behavior which were evaluated in the Erlangen-Nuremberg Development and Prevention Study. From a sample of 675 children (age 4-5 years), 239 were assigned to the program groups and 239 to the control groups (group-wise randomization, matching, intent-to-treat analysis). Preschool teachers' reports on the children in the Social Behavior Questionnaire revealed positive effects 2-3 months after the training. Program groups showed significantly less externalizing and internalizing problems. Most effect sizes were small but relatively large for the combined parent- and child program and for children at risk. Up to three years after the training the school report cards showed lower rates of program children with stable multiple problems, in particular for the combined training. However, mothers' ratings in the SBQ revealed no positive effects in both short-term and long-term evaluation. Possible reasons for these inconsistencies are discussed. A cautious optimism, more sound evaluation studies and a long-term Prevention policy are recommended.

AB BACKGROUND. Previous research has indicated that childhood behavioral disturbances predict lower scores on academic tests and curtail educational attainment. It is unknown which types of childhood behavioral problems are most likely to predict these outcomes.
   METHODS. An ethnically diverse cohort was assessed at 6 years of age for behavioral problems and IQ and at 17 years of age for academic achievement in math and reading. Of the original cohort of 823 children, 693 (84%) had complete data. Multiple regressions were used to estimate associations of attention and internalizing and externalizing problems at age 6 and with math and reading achievement at age 17, adjusting for IQ and indicators of family socioeconomic status.
   RESULTS. Adjusting for IQ, inner-city community, and maternal education and marital status, teacher ratings of attention, internalizing behavior, and externalizing problems at age 6 significantly predict math and reading achievement at age 17. When types of problems are examined simultaneously, attention problems predict math and reading achievement with little attenuation, whereas the influence of externalizing and internalizing problems is materially reduced and not significant.
   CONCLUSIONS. Interventions that target attention problems at school entry should be tested as a potential avenue for improving educational achievement. Pediatrics 2009; 123: 1472-1476

AB There are both quantitative and methodological techniques that foster the development and maintenance of a cumulative knowledge base within the psychological sciences. Most noteworthy of these techniques is meta-analysis, which allows for the synthesis of summary statistics drawn from multiple studies when the original data are not available. However, when the original data can be obtained from multiple studies, many advantages stem from the statistical analysis of the pooled data. The authors define integrative data analysis (IDA) as the analysis of multiple data sets that have been pooled into one. Although variants of IDA have been incorporated into other scientific disciplines, the use of these techniques is much less evident in psychology. In this article the authors present an overview of IDA as it may be applied within the psychological sciences, discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of IDA, describe analytic strategies for analyzing pooled individual data, and offer recommendations for the use of IDA in practice.

AB This study examined whether there was a cortisol response to inoculation or if pre-inoculation levels were already elevated due to an anticipatory response to going to the doctors' office. For 4-year-old children, a base saliva sample was obtained in the home on a non-stress day, and a pre-inoculation saliva sample was obtained in the doctors' office prior to the stress. Doctors' office pre-inoculation cortisol was higher than home-based cortisol, suggesting the occurrence of an anticipatory cortisol response to the impending stress. Post-inoculation cortisol levels (+20 min) were comparable to home-based cortisol, indicating that there was no cortisol response to the inoculation itself. While there was no mean increase in cortisol, individual differences in cortisol response existed. Cortisol increases were related to important aspects of child behavioral functioning, including internalizing and externalizing behavior ratings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective-Children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk of violence exposure and behavior problems, which have been linked to mothers' disciplinary practices. This study examines how the effect of young African American mothers' discipline on their preschool-age children's extemalizing and internalizing behavior varies by mother and child violence exposure.
   Methods.-A sample of 230 African American mothers who gave birth as adolescents and their 3- to 6-year-old children were recruited from community-based day care and primary health care sites in the Washington, DC, metropolitan region. In-person interviews were conducted by trained research assistants who administered standard survey instruments.
   Results.-Hierarchical regression models revealed an interaction effect such that adolescent mothers' harsh disciplinary practices, specifically physical discipline strategies, were positively associated with young children's internalizing and extemalizing behavior in the context of high or moderate, but not low, maternal violence exposure.
   Conclusions.-Corn pared with less violence-ex posed mothers, the harsh disciplinary practices of young African American mothers who have been exposed to high levels of violence are more strongly associated with their children's problem behavior. Practitioners should screen mothers for violence exposure in order to address potential issues of discipline and behavior problems.

AB Objective To examine the relationship between specific types of child mental health problems and severe physical punishment, in combination with other important known risk factors.
   Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in Embu, Sao Paulo, Brazil, as the Brazilian component of a multicountry survey on abuse in the family environment. From a probabilistic sample of clusters that included all eligible households (women aged 15-49 years with a son or daughter < 18 years of age), we randomly selected one mother-child pair per household (n = 813; attrition rate: 17.6%). This study focused on children aged 6-17 years (n = 480). Child Behaviour Checklist CBCL/6-18 was used to identify children with internalizing problems only, externalizing problems only, and both internalizing and externalizing problems (comorbidity). Severe physical punishment was defined as being hit with an object, being kicked, choked, smothered, burnt, scalded, branded, beaten or threatened with a weapon. We examined other potential correlates from four domains: child (gender, age, ever witnessing marital violence); mother (education, unemployment, anxiety or depression, marital violence); father (absence, drunkenness); and family (socioeconomic status). The WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to identify maternal anxiety or depression (score > 7). Backward logistic regression analysis identified independent correlates and significant interactions.
   Findings Multivariate modelling showed that severe punishment wash an independent correlate of comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems but was not associated with internalizing problems only. It increased the risk of externalizing problems alone only for children and adolescents not exposed to maternal anxiety or depression. Maternal anxiety or depression increased the risk only for children or adolescents not exposed to severe punishment.
   Conclusion Severe punishment may be related to child mental health problems, with the mechanism depending on the type of problem. Its influence persists in the presence of family stressors such as the father's absence and maternal anxiety or depression.

AB Many youth experience impairing, unexplained somatic complaints. Psychosocial models of child somatization have primarily focused on parent somatic functioning. Although helpful in understanding child somatization, this narrow focus on parental factors leaves a large proportion of the variance unaccounted for when explaining children's general somatic functioning. The goal of this investigation is to extend current models of child somatization by collectively examining the influence of parent somatization and child emotional functioning.
   Forty-two children (50% male; M age = 9.11) reported on their somatic symptoms, emotion awareness skills, and negative affect. Parents reported on their own somatic symptoms and their child's somatic symptoms and emotion regulation skills.
   Regression analyses indicated that poor awareness of emotional experiences and frequency of negative effect predicted child-reported somatic symptoms. Parental somatic symptoms and parent reports of children's emotion regulation difficulties predicted mother-reported child somatic symptoms. Only parental somatic symptoms significantly predicted father-reported child somatic symptoms.
   These results suggest that models of child somatization should consider both family - (e.g. parent somatization) and child-level (e.g. emotional functioning) variables. The discrepancies between parent and child report of youth somatic symptoms underscore the importance of including multiple reporters on symptomatology in research and clinical settings. Suggestions for future research are provided.

AB Three models of the prospective relations between child maladjustment and peer victimization are examined: (a) internalizing results directly from victimization, (b) internalizing leads to victimization, and (c) physical aggression fuels retaliatory victimization that leads to increases in internalizing over time. Data came from assessments of children at the beginning of Grade 1 (n = 432; average age = 6.3 years), with follow-ups at the end of Grades 1, 2, and 3. Most children showed low stable internalizing trajectories (73%); however, high stable and increasing curvilinear trajectories were evident for 7% and 20% of children, respectively. Findings suggest that children's adjustment problems at entry to Grade 1 affect the course of their internalizing, in part, by setting the stage for peer victimization.

AB This Study investigated the relationship between alexithymia, depressive symptoms, and Youth Self-Report (YSR) self-image profiles among 13 to 18-year-old adolescents (n = 7087) attending school in Kuopio, Finland. The final sample consisted of 3936 adolescents (1801 boys, 2 135 girls) who completed structured self-rating questionnaires (Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS] 20, Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], and YSR) during class periods at school. The overall prevalence of alexithymia was 7.3%. However, girls in all age groups were more frequently alexithymic than boys, Regardless of sex, alexithymic Youths reported more depressive symptoms as well as internalizing and externalizing problems than the others. A YSR total score of more than 70 was recorded among 33.4% of alexithymic compared with 3.7% of nonalexithymic adolescents. The TAS-20 correlated significantly with the BDI score, YSR total score, and with internalizing problems. This Study revealed alexithymia among adolescents to be associated with various complications such as depressive symptoms. high scores in YSR problem scales, and difficulties in social relationships. Our findings indicate that these adolescents are at high risk of mental disorders and require treatment interventions. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to changes associated with a family-based intervention. The current study addressed this issue with a sample of 731 families receiving services from a national food supplement and nutrition program. Families with toddlers between ages 2 and 3 were screened and then randomized to a brief family intervention, the Family Check-Up, which included linked interventions that were tailored and adapted to the families needs. Follow-up intervention services were provided at age 3 and follow-up of child outcomes occurred at ages 3 and 4. Latent growth models revealed intervention effects for early externalizing and internalizing problems from 2 to 4, and reductions in maternal depression from ages 2 to 3. In addition, reductions in maternal depression mediated improvements in both child externalizing and internalizing problem behavior after accounting for the potential mediating effects of improvements in positive parenting. The results are discussed with respect to targeting maternal depression in future intervention studies aimed at improving early child problem behavior.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the relations Of authoritative parenting and corporal punishment to Chinese first and second graders' effortful control (EC), impulsivity, ego resilience, and maladjustment, as well as mediating relations. A parent and teacher reported on children's EC, impulsivity, and ego resilience; parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms and their own parenting, and teachers and peers reported on children's externalizing symptoms. Authoritative parenting and low corporal punishment predicted high EC, and EC mediated the relation between parenting and externalizing problems. In addition, impulsivity mediated the relation of corporal punishment to externalizing problems. The relation of parenting to children's ego resilience was mediated by EC and/or impulsivity, and ego resilience mediated the relations of EC and impulsivity to internalizing problems.

AB Few studies have utilized both categorical and dimensional measures of psychopathology in children with epilepsy. We evaluated 173 children (88 males, 85 females; mean age 11.7y [SD 1.8]; range 9-14y) who had epilepsy (generalized 36%, partial 61%) for at least 6 months. The primary caregiver completed a dimensional measure, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a categorical measure, either the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) or the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI). Correlation coefficients were computed between the CBCL scores and CSI/ASI symptom scores. For all children, diagnostic risk was higher than norms on CSI/ASI for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type, ADHD combined type, oppositional defiant disorder, and dysthymic disorder. For children between 9 and 12 years, elevated scores were found on CBCL, total, internalizing, and attention problems, and on CSI, diagnostic risk for conduct disorder and Asperger syndrome. For children of 13 and 14 years, ASI diagnostic risk was higher for specific phobia, obsessions, posttraumatic stress disorder, motor tics, antisocial personality, panic attack, somatization disorder, and enuresis. CBCL and symptom scores on the CSI/ASI were significantly correlated. The conclusion was that children with epilepsy have high rates of behavioral difficulties on both dimensional and categorical measures. Concurrent validity for the CSI/ASI was supported.

AB The relations of parents' and teachers' reports of temperament anger-irritability, positive emotionality, and effortful control (attention focusing and inhibitory control) to children's externalizing and internalizing, problems were examined in Chinese (N = 382) and U.S. (N = 322) samples of school-age children. Results suggested that in both cultures, low effortful control and high anger-irritability were associated with high externalizing problems. although the relations were stronger in the Chinese sample than ill the U.S. sample. Low positive emotionality wits associated with high internalizing problems in both cultures. However. high positive emotionality was associated with noncomorbid externalizing problems (teachers' reports) in the Chinese sample but not in the U.S. sample. These findings suggest that there are considerable cross-cultural similarities ill the temperament-adjustment associations. although some cross-cultural differences might exist. Implications of the findings for the detection and intervention of adjustment problems in Chinese children are discussed.

AB Identifying childhood precursors for depression has been challenging and yet important for understanding the rapid increase in the rate of depression among adolescent girls. This study examined the prospective relations of preadolescent girls' emotion regulation and parenting style with depressive symptoms. Participants were 225 children and their biological mothers recruited from a larger longitudinal community Study. Girls' observed positive and negative emotion during a conflict resolution task with mothers, their ability to regulate sadness and anger, and their perception of parental acceptance and psychological control were assessed at age 9. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report at ages 9 and 10. The results indicated interactions between child emotion characteristics and parenting in predicting later depression. Specifically, low levels of positive emotion expression predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in the context of moderate to high parental psychological control. Low levels of sadness regulation were predictive of high levels of depressive symptoms in the context of low to moderate parental acceptance. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that the prospective association between vulnerabilities in emotion regulation and depression are moderated by the caregiving environment.

AB Aggression is associated with a host of behavioral, social, and emotional adjustment difficulties. However. some aggressive youth are perceived as "popular" by peers. Although these perceived popular aggressive youth appear relatively well adjusted, especially in the social domain, the emotional wellbeing of these youth is understudied. The current findings indicate that perceived popularity buffers adolescents who hurt others through relational aggression from internalizing symptoms. In contrast. perceived Popularity (lid not buffer adolescents who engaged in overt verbal and physical aggression from internalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Sex differences are found in animal studies concerning the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and outcome of the offspring. Most human studies in this field have not addressed sex differences, although differences between boys and girls may elucidate the biochemical as well as psychological processes involved. Associations between prenatal maternal emotional complaints and behavioural problems of toddlers and preschoolers as assessed by both mothers and fathers are studied separately for boys and girls.
   Methods: Healthy Dutch Caucasian singleton. pregnant women (N = 444) answered questionnaires about anxiety and depression in every trimester of pregnancy. When their children (227 boys, 217 girls) were between 14 and 54 months old, both parents reported on their current feelings of depression and anxiety and on the behavioural problems of their children.
   Results: Prenatal maternal emotional complaints were found to be associated with child behavioural problems both in boys and in girls, but in different ways. Prenatal maternal emotional complaints during the first trimester were associated with total and internalizing behavioural problems for boys. Emotional complaints during the third trimester were associated with total, internalizing, as well as externalizing behavioural problems for girls.
   Conclusions: Differentiation according to sex and information on timing of emotional complaints during pregnancy is needed in studies concerning the relation between prenatal maternal emotional complaints and child outcome. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Toddlers may be at particularly high risk for a number of psychiatric, developmental and neurobiological consequences in the aftermath of trauma. The social and emotional impact of potentially traumatic life events experienced between 6 and 36-months of age was assessed in an epidemiological birth cohort of 18- to 36-month-olds from the Greater New Haven Area. Event-exposed toddlers evidenced greater symptom severity on the ITSEA Internalizing, Externalizing, Dysregulation, Atypical and Maladaptive scales, as well on the CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing scales than those not exposed. Approximately one-fifth of event-exposed toddlers were reported by their parents to have experienced a dramatic change in functioning following the event, and were described as experiencing higher levels of symptoms consistent with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), namely re-experiencing and arousal, than exposed toddlers whose parents did not report a change in their functioning. Implications for clinicians and child care providers working with toddlers and their parents are discussed.

AB Purpose: Self-cutting as a form of self-harm is common in general population adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors among self-cutting community-dwelling adolescents.
   Methods: A sample of adolescents who reported current self-cutting (n = 80) was drawn from a large sample of community adolescents (n = 4205). Of these 80 individuals, 44 consented to further detailed assessment. An age- and gender-matched control subject was selected for each study subject. Data collection included Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV-TR, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Youth Self-Report for adolescents aged 11-18 years (YSR).
   Results: Major depressive disorder (63% vs. 5%), anxiety disorders (37% vs. 12%), and eating disorders (15% vs. 0%) were more common among self-cutting girls (n = 41) than among controls. None of the self-cutting boys (n = 3) had a DSM-IV-TR Axis I mental disorder. In multivariate model, the presence of major depressive disorder, the AUDIT score and the YSR internalizing subscale score were the factors that were independently associated with the presence of self-cutting in girls.
   Conclusions: Major depressive disorder, signs of alcohol misuse, and internalizing behavior strongly associate with self-cutting in community-dwelling adolescents, especially in girls. (C) 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Social-emotional competence is a key developmental task during early childhood. This study examined concurrent relationships between maternal education and employment status. children's sex. ethnicity, age, receptive vocabulary, emotional knowledge, attention skills, inhibitory control and social-emotional competence in a sample of 146 preschool, low-income, ethnically diverse children from Head Start classrooms. Multilevel models demonstrated that inhibitory control played a significant role in the concurrent prediction of teacher ratings of social-emotional competence above and beyond other variables associated with social-emotional competence. Children who demonstrated better inhibitory control were more likely to be rated higher on social skills and lower in internalizing behaviors. Findings suggest that early identification of inhibitory control difficulties may be beneficial for targeting children at risk for maladaptive outcomes. The contribution of environmental experience to the development of inhibitory control skills suggests there are many opportunities to intervene during early childhood. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Many childhood psychiatric problems are transient. Consequently, screening procedures to accurately identify children with problems unlikely to remit and thus, in need of intervention, are of major public health concern. This study aimed to develop a universal school-based screening procedure based on the answers to three questions: (1) What are the broad patterns of mental health problems from kindergarten to grade 5? (2) What are the grade 5 outcomes of these patterns? (3) How early in school can children likely to develop the most impairing patterns be identified accurately?
   Mothers and teachers reported on a community sample (N = 328) of children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms in kindergarten and grades 1, 3, and 5. In grade 5, teachers reported on children's school-based functional impairments, physical health problems, and service use; mothers reported on children's specialty mental health care.
   Four patterns distinguished children who (1) never evidenced symptoms; (2) evidenced only isolated symptoms; or evidenced recurrent symptoms, either (3) without or (4) with comorbid internalizing and externalizing. By grade 5, children with recurrent comorbid symptoms had the greatest impairments, physical health problems, and service use. These children can be identified quite accurately by grade 1.
   Universal screening at school entry can effectively identify children likely to develop recurrent comorbid symptoms, and would provide a basis for developing optimal targeted intervention programs.

AB Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study (N = 1,162) and the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (N = 1,308), we estimate associations between material and instrumental support available to low-income mothers and young children's socioemotional well-being. In multivariate OLS models, we find mothers' available support is negatively associated with children's behavior problems and positively associated with prosocial behavior in both data sets; associations between available support and children's internalizing and prosocial behaviors attenuate but remain robust in residualized change models. Overall, results support the hypothesis that the availability of a private safety net is positively associated with children's socioemotional adjustment.

AB Several investigations have found support for the role of behavioral inhibition in the etiology of childhood anxiety and depression disorders. However, nothing is known about how this relation extends to children with a chronic, life-threatening illness. The purpose of the current study was to examine behavioral inhibition and its relation to anxiety and depression symptoms among 30 adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). Adolescents with SCD and their primary caregivers completed instruments assessing demographic information, behavioral inhibition, and anxiety and depression symptoms. A majority of adolescents with SCD classified themselves as middle or low on behavioral inhibition. Adolescents with SCD who classified themselves as high on behavioral inhibition displayed higher levels of anxiety and depression than adolescents with SCD who classified themselves as low on behavioral inhibition; adolescents with SCD endorsing the middle behavioral inhibition category generally scored in between. These data extend previous work with healthy children and adolescents and suggest that early and continued assessment of behavioral inhibition may be important in preventing adverse psychological outcomes among a group that is already at risk for internalizing disorders.

The study relied on maternal reports of child temperament at age 1, family conflict at age 6 years and 8 years, and child behavior at age 8 years.ResultsChildren exposed to high levels of family conflict had more internalizing problems. Child temperament assessed in infancy moderated the impact of family conflict on externalizing but not internalizing problem behavior.DiscussionLBW/PT children with a difficult temperament are more at risk for poor developmental outcomes, such as externalizing behavior problems, when exposed to family conflict than children with a less difficult temperament.

AB Objective: To test whether school, neighborhood, and family factors are independently associated with children's involvement in bullying, over and above their own behaviors that may increase their risk for becoming involved in bullying. Method: We examined bullying in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 birth cohort of 2,232 children. We used mother and teacher reports to identify children who experienced bullying between the ages of 5 and 7 years either as victims, bullies, or bully-victims. We collected information about school characteristics from the Department for Children, Schools and Families. We collected reports from mothers about children's neighborhood and home environments and reports from mothers and teachers about children's internalizing and externalizing problems when they were 5 years old. Results: Multinomial logistic regressions showed that over and above other socioenvironmental factors and children's behavior problems, school size was associated with an increased risk for being a victim of bullying, problems with neighbors was associated with an increased risk for being a bully-victim, and family factors (e.g., child maltreatment, domestic violence) were associated with all groups of children involved in bullying. Conclusions: Socioenvironmental factors are associated with children's risk for becoming involved in bullying over and above their own behaviors. Intervention programs aimed at reducing bullying should extend their focus beyond schools to include local communities and families. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(5):545-553.

AB Longitudinal data on 177 school-age adopted Chinese girls (Time 1: mean age = 8.92 years, SD = 1.76; Time 2: mean age = 11.18 years, SD = 1.79) were analyzed to determine their long-term outcomes in behavioral adjustment, academic performance (measured with the Child Behavior Checklist/6-18), and social skills (measured with the Social Skills Rating System) and how these outcomes were related to preadoption adversity. More than 90% of the girls were adopted at 24 months or younger (M = 19.25, SD = 21.67). Results revealed that over a 2-year period, there was a moderate to strong stability in the children's behavioral adjustment and academic performance. However, there was a significant increase in the number of children with deviant internalizing problems. At both times, higher degrees of preadoption adversity were related to more internalizing problems and poorer academic performance. Children who were adopted at older ages had poorer academic performance. Children who were older had a lower level of assertion and a higher level of responsibility. Children's attention problems at Time 1 mediated the effect of preadoption adversity on academic performance at Time 2.

AB Context: To our knowledge, no prospective, population-based study in existence examines predictive associations between early or middle childhood psychopathologic disorders and later completed suicides.
   Objective: To study predictive associations between childhood psychopathologic disorders at the age of 8 years and later completed suicides and severe suicide attempts.
   Design: Birth cohort study of individuals 8 to 24 years old.
   Setting: Finland.
   Participants: The sample includes 5302 Finnish people born in 1981 who were examined at the age of 8 years to gather information about psychopathologic conditions, school performance, and family demographics from parents, teachers, and children.
   Main Outcome Measures: National register-based lifetime information about completed suicides and suicide attempts that prompted hospital admission.
   Results: Of all 24 deaths among males between 8 and 24 years of age, 13 were suicides, whereas of 16 deaths among females, only 2 were suicides. Fifty-four males and females (1%) had either completed suicide or made a serious suicide attempt, defined as a suicide attempt that prompted hospital admission. Of 27 males with completed or serious suicide attempts, 78% screened positive on parent or teacher Rutter scales at the age of 8 years, whereas of 27 females only 11% screened positive. Among males, completed or serious suicide attempt outcome was predicted at the age of 8 years by living in a nonintact family; psychological problems as reported by the primary teacher; or conduct, hyperkinetic, and emotional problems. However, self-reports of depressive symptoms at the age of 8 years did not predict suicide outcome. No predictive associations between the study variables measured at the age of 8 years and suicide outcome were found among females. Male suicide outcome was predicted most strongly by comorbid conduct and internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Most males who completed suicide and/or made serious suicide attempts in adolescence or early adulthood had psychiatric problems by the age of 8 years, indicating a trajectory that persists throughout their lives. However, female severe suicidality is not predicted by psychopathologic disorders at the age of 8 years. The results give additional support to the importance of early detection and treatment of psychiatric problems in males.

AB Although mild worry is normative, children with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience worry that is intense, difficult to control, and impairing. Common worries of children with GAD may relate to perfectionism, performance, social situations, family, community/world events, or health. GAD co-occurs not only with other internalizing disorders (e.g., depression) but also with externalizing problems. A careful, multi-informant assessment is likely to help differentiate GAD from other disorders and also facilitate treatment planning. Research has found support for a number of variables in the etiology and maintenance of GAD including genetic, biological, familial, and environmental influences, cognitive processes, and personality traits and temperamental factors. The course of GAD is characterized by a chronic and episodic wax and wane of symptoms over a fairly long period of time though at least a few treatment approaches are promising. Numerous studies provide support for the use of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in treating GAD in youth, and preliminary data suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can also be helpful. The most apparent limitation of the extant literature that is reviewed is the lack of focus on youth with GAD in particular. Future research needs to compare youth with GAD to youth with other types of anxiety disorders.

AB This longitudinal study examines the development of racial-ethnic identity among African American children. Racial preferences were assessed in early elementary school with the Racial Attitudes, Belief's, and Stereotypes Measure-II, a projective technique using paired comparisons of pictures of African American, Asian, Latino, and Caucasian children. Racial-ethnic identity in 3rd grade was assessed using the Multi-Ethnic Identity Measure Ethnic Belonging subscale. Multilevel models indicated that own-group racial preferences increased with age. Second-grade own-group preferences were positively related to 3rd-grade racial-ethnic identity scores. Third-grade racial-ethnic identity was associated positively with self-esteem variables (scholastic, social, physical appearance. and behavioral) and with academic performance. Identity correlated negatively with parent-rated aggression and externalizing and internalizing behaviors. The findings suggest that children's racial-ethnic identity develops differentially by gender, with girls showing faster growth but lower initial ethnic identity. Racial-ethnic identity was shown to be modestly but statistically significantly associated with various important child outcomes.

AB Background: To examine the role of parental psychopathology and family environment for the risk of social phobia (SP) in off spring from childhood to early adulthood, encompassing the high risk period for SP Methods: A community sample of 1,395 adolescents was prospectively followed-up over 10 years. Offspring and parental pychopathology were assessed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV using the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI), and direct diagnostic interviews in parents were supplemented by family history reports. Parental rearing was assessed by the Questionnaire of Recalled Rearing Behavior administered to offspring. Family functioning was assessed by the McMaster Family Assessment Device administered to parents. Results: Parental SP was associated with offspring's risk to develop SP (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-8.0). Other parental anxiety disorders (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-6.1), depression (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.2-5.4), and alcohol use disorders (OR = 2.8, 95% CI. 1.3-6.1) were also associated with offspring SP Parental rearing styles of overprotection, rejection, and lack of emotional warmth, were associated with offspring SP Family functioning measures were not associated with off spring SP Analyses of interaction of parental psychopathology and parental rearing indicated combined effects oil the risk for offspring SP Conclusions: Parental psychopathology and rearing were associated with offspring SP, independently as well as in their interaction. Further delineation of these associations is warranted as malleable components of these risk factors may provide potential targets for prevention programs. In addition, parent-to-offspring transmission of other internalizing disorders should be considered to examine the degree of diagnostic specificity. Depression and Anxiety 26:363-370, 2009.

AB Purpose To investigate the role of emotion regulation in the relation between fathers' parenting (specifically warmth, behavioral control and psychological control) and adolescents' emotional and eating disorder symptoms, after adjustment for controls. Methods A total of 203 11-18 year-old students from a school in a socio-economically disadvantaged area in North-East London completed questionnaires assessing emotional symptoms (measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire's (SDQ) Emotional Symptoms Scale), eating disorder symptoms (measured with the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)), difficulties in emotion regulation (measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)), and fathers' overprotection and warmth, measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), as well as behavioral and psychological control. The confounding variables considered were number of proximal (i.e., during the last year) adverse life events experienced, gender, age, and socio-economic status (eligibility for free school meals). Results Adolescents' difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the link between fathers' psychological control and adolescents' emotional symptoms, but not the link between fathers' parenting and adolescents' eating disorder symptoms, which appeared to be more directly linked to fathers' psychological control and number of proximal adverse life events experienced. Proximal adverse life events experienced were also strongly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation. Conclusions The study findings have implications for intervention programs which may prove more fruitful in addressing adolescent emotional problems by targeting underlying emotion regulation abilities, and in addressing adolescent eating disorder symptoms by protecting adolescents with a recent experience of multiple adverse life events. Parenting programs also stand to benefit from the evidence presented in this study that paternal psychological control may have uniquely harmful consequences for adolescent development through the hampering or atrophying of emotion regulation abilities and the encouragement of eating disorders.

AB This study compares African American and Asian American adolescents in their rates of extreme community violence exposure and consequent internalizing behaviors. Using information from a national longitudinal survey, this study found substantial violence exposure rates for both groups. Also, gender differences in exposure rates and adolescent reports of internalizing behaviors after violence exposure were detected. Male African American adolescents had the highest exposure rate, while female Asian American adolescents reported the highest level of internalizing behaviors. These findings suggest further research is needed to better understand the effect of violence exposure on various ethnic minority adolescents. Moreover, social workers and other professionals involved in adolescent services could use these results to improve out-reach methods to vulnerable adolescents.

AB Hormonal influences on the organization of behavior are apparent to neuroendocrinologists but under-examined in relation to childhood and adolescent mental disorders. A central mystery in the field of developmental psychopathology is the preferential male vulnerability to behavior disorders in childhood and female vulnerability to emotional disorders in adolescence. Relative neglect of a hormonal explanation may be due to lack of simple or unifying conceptual paradigms to guide studies. This paper seeks to stimulate research in this area by drawing upon clinical psychology and neuroscience literatures to offer a heuristic paradigm for clinical research. Two syndromes are selected here for illustration: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), because they have opposite gender risk profiles. Two guiding theories are evaluated. First, prenatal organizational effects of testosterone may modulate striatally-based dopaminergic circuits in such a way as to place boys at greater risk for early developing inattention and disruptive behavioral disorders. Second, activational effects of estradiol at puberty may modulate amygdalar and other circuitry, with particular effects on serotonergic pathways, in such a way as to place girls at greater risk for internalizing and mood disorders. Hypotheses from these theories are evaluated based on the current available literature, and limitations of, and future directions for, this literature are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper examines the associations between maternal nonstandard work schedules during infancy and children's early behavior problems, and the extent to which infant temperament may moderate these associations. Hypothesized associations were tested using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care (Phase I). Analyses focused on mothers who returned to work by the time the child was 6 months of age, and who worked an average of at least 35 h per week from 6 through 36 months. At 24 and 36 months, children whose mothers worked a nonstandard schedule had higher internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Modest, albeit inconsistent, evidence suggests that temperamentally reactive children may be more vulnerable to maternal work schedules. Maternal depressive symptoms partially mediated associations between nonstandard maternal work schedules and child behavior outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A prior evaluation of the predictors of child coping outcomes following an unanticipated critical hospitalization revealed gender differences, which were explored in this study to examine patterns of behavioral change over time.
   Data from 163 mother-child (2-7 years) dyads were extracted for this study. Measures of child coping obtained 3 and 6 months following hospitalization included the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and the Post-Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire.
   Maladaptive behaviors in girls increased throughout the 6-month posthospitalization period. Boys demonstrated a peak and then decline of those same behaviors.
   Given this information, gender-specific child coping information can be developed for parents, which may lead to improved child outcomes.

AB Objective or the study was to examine how cognitive emotion regulation strategies were related to psychological maladjustment in adolescents with a chronic disease. The sample consisted of adolescents with a diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). A self-report questionnaire was used to assess Internalizing problems and Quality of Life. The specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies that were used in response to the disease were measured by the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Correlations and Multiple regression analyses showed that Rumination and Catastrophizing were the most important 'predictors' of psychological maladjustment in adolescents with JIA, suggesting that they should he considered as maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies in response to a chronic disease such as JIA. Challenging these maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies may therefore play an important role in intervention strategies.

AB Background: Poor interpersonal functioning may represent a putative prodromal feature of major affective disorder. However, no studies have examined the naturalistic patterns of social behaviours; among the offspring of parents with a major affective disorder. The present study assessed daily social interactions among 25 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder and 23 control participants in late adolescence and young adulthood.
   Methods: Using event-contingent recording procedures, interpersonal behaviours and perceptions were assessed along four scales (quarrelsomeness, agreeableness, dominance, and submissiveness) and were measured during specific social interactions over 14 days.
   Results: Multilevel modeling analyses revealed no group differences on any of the four scales, but gender by group interactions were was observed. High-risk males reported higher mean levels of quarrelsome behaviour and lower mean levels of agreeable behaviour than high-risk females, whereas low-risk males and females reported comparable levels of affiliative behaviours. High-risk participants reported more externalizing, but not internalizing, problems on the Acherbach Youth Self-Report Form than low-risk participants.
   Limitations: Although event-contingent recording reduces the self-report bias associated with self-report questionnaires, participants may have been biased in the selection of interactions they chose to record.
   Conclusions: Overall, the offspring of parents with BID, relative to controls, report no deficits in social functioning in the natural environment. However, high-risk youth displayed elevated externalizing problems and gender-specific patterns of social functioning that may precede the development of major affective disorder.

AB The pattern of perceived dysfunction associated with symptoms composing the externalizing childhood disorder syndrome was compared to the pattern characterizing the internalizing syndrome. In Study 1, undergraduate students (N = 205) judged the social impairment, academic/occupational impairment and personal distress associated with symptoms from the child and adolescent psychopathology scale (Lahey et al. 2004) related to externalizing and internalizing syndromes. As predicted, symptoms composing the externalizing syndrome were judged as involving less personal distress and more impairment than those composing the internalizing syndrome. Converging findings emerged in Study 2 when undergraduates (N = 183) judged DSM-IV symptoms composing externalizing and internalizing disorders. This research reveals systematic differences in perceptions of impairment and distress related to the symptoms that compose the externalizing and internalizing syndromes.

AB Family conflict is exacerbated by poverty-related stress and is detrimental to adolescent mental health. Adolescent coping with family conflict has the potential to buffer or exacerbate the negative effects of family conflict on internalizing symptoms. We examined coping with family conflict among 82 low-income adolescents (53.7% female, mean age = 13.5 years at Time 1, SD = 1.98; range 11-18), and their primary caregivers (95% female, mean age = 34.9 years, SD = 7.45). Adolescents were 25.9% Caucasian, 28.4% African American, 38.3% Hispanic, and 7.4% Other (Multi-racial, Native American, or Asian). Results show that family conflict is more strongly associated with internalizing symptoms for adolescents under high levels of poverty-related stress. Regression analyses indicate that secondary control coping moderates the effects of family conflict on internalizing symptoms. In addition, analyses reveal that disengagement coping exacerbates symptoms across time for both adolescent girls and boys. Regression analyses also suggest that primary control coping is helpful for coping with family conflict, but only for girls. Results highlight the importance of examining coping concurrently and across time as well as including moderating effects of gender. Intervention efforts targeting low-income adolescents should incorporate the instruction of secondary control strategies for coping with family conflict.

ID PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; COGNITION
AB Using the Child Behavior Checklist, behavior of 51 children with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy was Studied. According to parent report, children with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy scored in the clinical range on the subscales "internalizing behavior," "total behavior," and attentional problems." No relation between the epilepsy factors seizure frequency, age at onset, duration of epilepsy or the number of antiepileptic drugs, and the subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist was found. Only for seizure type a relationship was found. Although in the normal range, the more severe the seizure type, the more delinquent, aggressive, and externalizing behavioral problems. Other studies have demonstrated that in children with epilepsy, internalizing problems are more common than externalizing problems, and that attentional, social, and thought problems are relatively specific. Therefore, we can conclude chat the behavioral problems we found in our cohort are not very different from behavioral problems described in other epilepsy types.

AB The present study evaluated the efficacy of a multicomponent, classroom-based intervention in reducing preschoolers' behavior problems. The Chicago School Readiness Project model was implemented in 35 Head Start classrooms using a clustered-randomized controlled trial design. Results indicate significant treatment effects (ds = 0.53-0.89) for teacher-reported and independent observations of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Moreover, there was some evidence for the moderating role of child gender, race/ethnic group membership, and exposure to poverty-related risk, with stronger effects of intervention for some groups of children than for others. Findings contribute to a growing area of research on poverty and preventive intervention in early childhood.

AB Objective: To study emotional and behavioral problems and sleep and cognitive performance in snoring and nonsnoring 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: As part of an epidemiological study of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in preschool-aged children, 43 snorers and 46 nonsnorers participated in a clinical study. Their parents completed the Child Behavior Checkl ist (CBCL). The children were assessed with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of intelligence, Revised and subtests of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-A) representing aspects of attention, language skills, sensorimotor functions, memory, and learning. Results: On the CBCL snoring children had significantly more parent reported internalizing symptoms (p < .05) than the nonsnoring children, especially symptoms of anxious/depressed mood (p < .01) and emotional reactivity (p < .05). More children from the snoring group than from the nonsnoring group (22 vs 11%) scored in the subdinical or clinical range on the internalizing scale. Interestingly, no significant difference between the groups was found in the amount of externalizing symptoms. The amount of sleep problems other than snoring was higher in the snoring than in the nonsnoring group (p < .01). On tests measuring auditory attention (p < .01) and language skills (verbal IQ, p < .05), the snoring group performed worse than the nonsnoring group. Conclusions: Our results support the view that SDB should be considered a possible risk factor for mood disorder symptoms and impaired cognitive performance in children.

AB This study examined adolescents' emotional reactivity to parents' marital conflict as a mediator of the association between triangulation and adolescents' internalizing problems in a sample of 2-parent families (N = 426). Four waves of annual, multiple-informant data were analyzed (youth ages 11-15 years). The authors used structural equation modeling and found that triangulation was associated with increases in adolescents' internalizing problems, controlling for marital hostility and adolescent externalizing problems. There also was an indirect pathway from triangulation to internalizing problems across time through youths' emotional reactivity. Moderating analyses indicated that the 2nd half of the pathway, the association between emotional reactivity and increased internalizing problems, characterized youth with lower levels of hopefulness and attachment to parents. The findings help detail why triangulation is a risk factor for adolescents' development and which youth will profit most from interventions focused on emotional regulation.

AB This study examines longitudinal associations between adolescent adjustment and perceived parental support across the middle-school years (ages 11 to 13) in a diverse sample of 197 girls and 116 boys. Growth curve models revealed associations between the slope of change in perceptions of support in relationships with mothers and fathers and the slope of change in adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms such that declining support accompanied increasing problems. After controlling for this correlated change, there was still evidence of child-problem effects on changes in relationship support (i.e., initial levels of adolescent externalizing symptoms predicted subsequent changes in perceived parental support), but there was no evidence of parent-support effects on changes in adjustment (i.e., initial levels of relationship support did. not predict changes in adolescent externalizing symptoms). Declines in perceived parental support were steeper at high-initial levels of adolescent externalizing than at average or low levels.

ID SMOKING; THEMES
AB The present 3-wave, 3-year longitudinal study examined direct and indirect associations between marital quality, parenting, and adolescent internalizing problems, taking into account bidirectional associations between these concepts. Data were used from 428 Dutch families, consisting of 2 biological parents and 2 adolescents with mean ages of 13.4 and 15.2 years (at Time 1). Results from structural equation modeling analyses showed that low marital quality at Time 1 was directly related to adolescent internalizing problems at Time 2 in oldest siblings. However, support was not found for any indirect associations through parenting or for longitudinal associations from adolescent internalizing problems to parents' marital quality. Results are discussed in terms of implications for understanding the mechanism by which marital quality is related to adolescent internalizing problems.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of adolescence suicidality in a longitudinal study. Additionally, the prevalence of deliberate self-harm behavior and suicide ideation at age 7 and during middle school were examined. Initial assessment data was obtained from 1998 to 2000, and a follow-up assessment was performed in 2006 when the original subjects became middle school students. The addresses and names of 1,857 subjects were located from the original data; they were 910 boys and 947 girls. The subjects were evaluated with the Korean version of the Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL), which was administered by the parents of the children, and by various demographic and psychosocial factors. They were reassessed using self reports on the Korea Youth Self Report (K-YSR); in particular, replies to items related to self-harm behavior and suicide ideation were recorded. A logistic regression analysis showed that the factors of gender, economic status, the overall amount of behavior problems, the tendency to internalizing and externalizing problems, somatic problems, thought problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior were independent predictors of adolescent suicide ideation and self-harm behavior. The importance of total behavior problems suggested that adolescent difficulty is a consequence of an accumulation of various risk factors. Accordingly, clinicians must consider a range of internalizing and externalizing issues, especially overall adaptation, for suicide intervention.

AB In the current longitudinal investigation, we explored the continuity of and changes in the mental representations of the mother and an additional caregiver among forty-five 9- to 11-year-old children who had been severely maltreated and subsequently placed in long-term residential care as well as the relationships between the content and structure of these representations and teacher's assessments of the child's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. At Time 1, a nonmaltreated comparison group was assessed concomitantly. Compared to nonmaltreated children, maltreated children scored higher for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and their maternal representations were found to be significantly less benevolent and integrated and more punitive. In addition, among the maltreated children, the additional caregiver representations were found to be more benevolent and integrated, and less punitive, than the maternal representations. After 30 months, the maltreated children's levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms diminished, their maternal representations become more benevolent and less punitive, and the additional caregiver representations became less benevolent. Moreover, the Benevolence of the additional caregiver representation was found to predict these children's changes in externalizing symptoms beyond the effects of their symptomatology and its associations with the Benevolence of these representations at Time 1.

AB The current study examined the impact of racial discrimination stress on internalizing symptoms and coping strategies in a sample of 268 African American early adolescents (mean age = 12.90; 56% female) from low-income communities. Information about discrimination stress, coping, and internalizing symptoms was obtained via adolescents' self-report. It was predicted that discrimination stress would be positively associated with depression and anxiety, as well as culturally-specific coping. Finally, culturally-relevant coping and mainstream coping were examined as moderators of the association between discrimination stress and internalizing symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that discrimination stress was positively associated with depression and anxiety and predicted culturally-relevant coping while controlling for mainstream coping. Communalistic coping moderated the association between discrimination and anxiety, but demonstrated a vulnerability function by increasing anxiety at high levels of discrimination. The results highlight the salience of racial discrimination for African American adolescents and the importance of considering culturally-specific coping behaviors.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to compare psychosocial adaptation in adolescent (first generation) migrants, double-citizens (mainly second generation with one migrant parent), and native Swiss, and to compare migrants from various European regions. Method Data from a community survey were based on 1,239 participants (mean age 13.8, SD = 1.6 years) with 996 natives, 55 double-citizens, and 188 migrants. The adolescents completed the youth self-report measuring emotional and behavioural problems, and various questionnaires addressing life events, personality variables, perceived parental behaviour (PPB), family functioning, school environment, and social network. Results Adolescent migrants had significantly higher scores for internalizing and externalizing problems. There was a pattern of various unfavourable psychosocial features including life events, coping, self-related cognitions, and PPB that was more common among adolescent migrants than natives. Double-citizens were similar to natives in all domains. Young adolescents from South and South-East Europe differed from natives in terms of more unfavourable psychosocial features. Migrant status was best predicted by adverse psychosocial features rather than emotional and behavioural problems. Conclusion There is some indication that certain migrant adolescents are at risk of psychosocial mal-adaptation. Obviously, ethnic origin is an important moderator.

AB The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to explore the mediating influence of internalizing behavior on the link between child maltreatment and externalizing behavior (for example, rule-breaking behavior and aggressive behavior) among children. Using a longitudinal comparison group design and a simple of 300 youths (56 percent maltreated), the relationship among maltreatment and internalizing and externalizing behavior was explored. Structural equation modeling revealed a mediating effect in which initial internalizing symptoms had a longitudinal residual effect on externalizing behavior among maltreated youths. Practice and policy strategies should include early identification, comprehensive assessment, and treatment for child maltreatment that include emotional, psychological, and behavioral issues. A comprehensive social work response may serve to reduce the risk of adverse behavioral Outcomes among youths that place them at risk of juvenile delinquency and juvenile justice. involvement.

AB There are scant data documenting the relationship between caregiver strain and suicidal behavior among youth. This study includes data from the caregivers of 1,854 youth who received services through the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program. Caregiver strain, family functioning, and youth functional impairment were assessed with the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire, Family Life Questionnaire, and Columbia Impairment Scale. Caregivers of suicidal and nonsuicidal youth differed in subjective internalizing strain (e.g., worry and guilt) and objective strain (e.g., constraints on activities). Differences in objective strain persisted even after controlling for family life and youth functional impairment.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to report the psychiatric evaluation of children and adolescents living in a children's village and to present their psychiatric treatment process. Material and Methods: After allegations of abuse on January 2005, a multi disciplinary health team was established. The children and adolescents (n=78) were subjected to a series of assessments including group discussions, psychiatric interviews and administration of Child Depression Inventory or Beck Depression Inventory (depending on their age) and Achenbach's Youth Self Report. Healthy children who were consulted at the university hospital pediatric outpatient clinic with acute medical complaints, without any trauma history and without any psychiatric diagnosis were included in the study as the control group. Results: The results of the investigations carried on by a multi-disciplinary team revealed that 22% of children and adolescents required psychiatric treatment. Village adolescents reported considerably higher levels of both "internalizing" and "externalizing" problems than the controls. The comparison of pre- and post-treatment results revealed that the treatment process was successful in alleviating the symptoms of the adolescents. By the end of eight months the adolescents' psychiatric symptoms had disappeared. Conclusion: The children and adolescents living in the village were negatively affected by these processes after sexual abuse allegations. Studies after the crisis period can give more detailed information about the mental health of the village children and adolescents, and this study may be a preliminary study for future research on this area.

AB High rates of psychiatric impairment in adults with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS, also referred to as DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndrome) suggest that behavioral trajectories of children with 22q11DS may provide critical etiologic insights. Past findings that report Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) diagnoses are extremely variable; moreover, sex differences in behavior have not yet been examined. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings from 82 children, including 51 with the 22q11DS and 31 control siblings, were analyzed. Strikingly consistent with rates of psychiatric impairment among affected adults, 25% of children with 22q11DS had high CBCL scores for Total Impairment, and 20% had high CBCL Internalizing Scale scores. Males accounted for 90% of high Internalizing scores and 67% of high Total Impairment scores. Attention and Social Problems were ubiquitous; more affected males than females (23% vs. 4%) scored high on Thought Problems. With regard to CBCL/DSM overlap, 20% of affected males as compared with 0 affected females had one or more high CBCL ratings in the absence of a DSM diagnosis. Behaviors of children with 22q11DS are characterized by marked sex differences when rated dimensionally, with significantly more males experiencing Internalizing and Thought Problems. Categorical diagnoses do not reflect behavioral differences between male and female children with 22q11DS, and may miss significant behavior problems in 20% of affected males.

AB The multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) was revised for Arab American adolescents (MSPSS-AA). Items measuring social support from significant others were omitted and items measuring support from school personnel were added based on advice from cultural experts. The sample consisted of 635 Arab American young adolescents in metropolitan Detroit. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the proposed three-factor solution (family, friends, and school personnel). Internal consistency coefficients for the three subscales of family (alpha = 0.63), friends (alpha = 0.75), school personnel (alpha = 0.72) were good. As predicted, perceived support from family, friends, and school personnel were inversely related to self reports of daily hassles and internalizing behavior and positively related to assistance seeking coping, which provides evidence for construct validity. Support for discriminant validity was also demonstrated with significantly larger correlations between the MSPSS-AA Family subscale and daily hassles specific to parents and the MSPSS-AA Friend subscale and daily hassles specific to peers. These finding suggest that the MSPSS-AA is reliable and valid for use with Arab-American adolescents.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between psychosocial antecedents in earlier adolescence and problems related to substance use and related adverse health consequence (e.g., respiratory diseases, neurocognitive symptoms, and general malaise) in adulthood. We specifically focused on parent-child bonding in earlier adolescence and internalizing behaviors in later adolescence and their effects on problems related to substance use in the mid-20s; and health problems in the mid-30s.
   Methods. Our team interviewed a community-based sample of 502 participants over a 30-year period (1975, 1983, 1985-1986, 1997, 2002, and 2005).
   Results. We found a strong relationship between internalizing behaviors in later adolescence and adverse health consequences in the mid-30s. Internalizing behaviors in later adolescence served as a mediator between low parent-child bonding in earlier adolescence and later adverse health consequences. Problems related to substance use in the late 20s and early 30s; were related directly to later adverse health consequences and indirectly as mediators between earlier psychosocial difficulties (i.e., internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, poor ego integration, and maladaptive coping) and later adverse health consequences.
   Conclusions. Policies and programs that address parent-child bonding and internalizing behaviors should be created to reduce problems related to substance use and, ultimately, later health problems. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99: 563-568. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2007.127225)

AB A large body of research has examined the development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in childhood and early adolescence. Notably, there is significant concomitant impairment associated with early adolescent symptomatology, as well as association of these symptoms with future development of psychopathology, poor physical health, self-destructive thoughts and behaviors, criminal behavior, and HIV risk behaviors. Drawing on negative reinforcement theory, the Current study sought to examine the potential role of distress tolerance, defined as the ability to persist in goal-directed activity while experiencing emotional distress, as a potential mechanism that may underlie both internalizing and externalizing symptoms among 231 Caucasian and African American youth (M age = 10.9 years; 45.5% female; 54.5% Caucasian ethnicity). A series of regressions resulted in significant moderated relationships, such that low distress tolerance conferred increased risk for alcohol use among Caucasians, delinquent behavior among African Americans, and internalizing symptoms among females. Clinical implications, including the potential role of negative reinforcement models in early intervention with young adolescents, are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study investigated the joint long-term impact of witnessing interparental violence and experiencing child physical maltreatment on young adults' trauma symptoms and behavior problems. It also explored Chinese traditional beliefs as a possible contributor to young adults' trauma and behavior.
   Methods: This study used self-reporting measures to collect data from a national proportionate stratified sample of 1,924 college students in Taiwan. The sample was divided into four groups: no violence; interparental violence only; child physical maltreatment only and dual violence, to compare the combined effect of dual violence on long-term outcome with the no violence group and the one type of violence group.
   Results: The results indicated a significant association of interparental violence and child physical maltreatment, and 11.3% of participants reported witnessing partner violence between parents and experiencing physical maltreatment during childhood. Participants experiencing dual violence reported more trauma symptoms and behavior problems than did those experiencing only one form of violence or none at all. Exposure to both interparental violence and child physical maltreatment during childhood is a significant predictor of young adults' trauma symptoms and behavior problems, after controlling for other potentially confounding risk factors. Cultural factors also play a significant role in predicting young adults' trauma symptoms and internalizing behavior problems, after accounting for control variables and violence-related variables. Moreover, cultural factors interact significantly with dual violence experiences in predicting young adults' externalizing behavior problems.
   Conclusions: This study extended Western co-occurrence study findings with large Taiwanese community samples. The results demonstrated that dual violence experiences during childhood have long-term detrimental impact on young adults' trauma symptoms and behavior problems. Cultural beliefs and their interaction with dual violence experiences play a significant role in young adults' trauma symptoms and behavior problems as well.
   Practice implications: The present findings underscore the need for interventions for young adults exposed to childhood dual violence. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions to address the cultural factor impact on young adults' trauma symptoms and behavior problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individual and family characteristics that predict resilience among children exposed to domestic violence (DV) were examined. Mother-child dyads (n = 190) were assessed when the children were 2, 3, and 4 years of age. DV-exposed children were 3.7 times more likely than nonexposed children to develop internalizing or externalizing problems. However, 54% of DV-exposed children maintained positive adaptation and were characterized by easy temperament (odds ratio [OR] = .39, d = .52) and nondepressed mothers (OR = 1.14, d = .07), as compared to their nonresilient counterparts. Chronic DV was associated with maternal depression, difficult child temperament, and internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Results underscore heterogeneous outcomes among DV-exposed children and the influence of individual and family characteristics on children's adaptation.

AB The present article aims to analyze the relation between teachers suffering from psychological distress and school children with behavioral problems. A total of 372 children were evaluated by teachers through utilizing the Teachers Report Form (TRF). The teachers also answered a questionnaire in order to evaluate some personal characteristics and the presence of psychological distress (Self Reported Questionnaire, SRQ-20). The prevalence of psychological distress found was of 21.8%. The results show that the teachers presenting psychological distress identified higher percentages of internalizing problems in the children.

AB This study examined the possible risk-buffering and risk-enhancing role of family characteristics on the association between temperament and early adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems, adjusted for familial vulnerability for psychopathology and early childhood problem behavior. Furthermore, it explored whether these effects were specific or conditional for either internalizing or externalizing problems or more generic for psychopathology. Data on temperament (frustration and fearfulness) and family characteristies (overprotection, rejection, emotional warmth, and socioeconomic status) came from a large longitudinal Dutch population sample of early adolescents (n = 2,149; M age = 13.55 years; 51.2% girls). Hypotheses on the direction and the specificity of the effects were derived from a goal-framing approach. The findings indicate that family characteristics can either buffer or enhance the temperamental risk in the development of psychopathology. Analyses on the direction of these effects resulted in a descriptive classification of domain-specific, conditional, and generic factors that promote or protect the development of psychopathology. Implications of the result,; are discussed, and directions for future research are given.

AB This study reports the findings of a pilot demonstration project called Together for Kids, which used a mental health consultation model to address the needs of young children with challenging behaviors who are identified in preschool classrooms. The study was conducted in four preschool programs and one Head Start program serving children ages 3-5, including both private-pay families and those using public subsidies. Rates of significant behavior problems as assessed by preschool teachers using a standardized scale were high, with 34% of all children enrolled in preschool classrooms in these sites over a 3-year period identified at-risk of externalizing or internalizing problems. Classroom teachers, as well as individual children and families identified as at-risk, were provided services, including, classroom observation and teacher training, individual child assessment and therapy, family assessment and support, and referrals for other family needs. Analysis of outcomes for 47 children and families with externalizing behavior problems who received individualized consultation, compared to 89 control children, and analysis of outcomes of a matched group of 19 intervention and 19 control children, revealed that the intervention was associated with significant improvements in classroom aggressive and maladaptive behavior, and growth in adaptive behavior. Improvements in child behavior were associated with total hours of individual child services provided, and with improvements in child developmental skills. Significant reductions in the rate of children suspended or terminated from child care programs were also found. Implications for further development of models of early childhood mental health consultation are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective The study examined parent-youth agreement regarding reports on psychopathology among adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. Method A total of 1,718 patients between the age of 11 and 18, as well as their parents, were assessed using the child behavior checklist (CBCL), and the youth self-report (YSR). Results Poor to low agreement between parent- and adolescent-reported problem behavior on the internalizing scale, the total problem scale and moderate agreement concerning the externalizing scale of the CBCL and the YSR were found. Independent from the amount of psychiatric diagnoses, adolescents reported significantly less behavioral problems than their parents. Concerning externalizing problems, parent-youth disagreement was stronger for patients suffering from comorbid psychiatric disorders, than for adolescents displaying only one psychiatric disorder. Conclusion In clinically referred children, parents are likely to emphasize the severity of the difficulties, whereas adolescents' under-report symptoms.

AB Background This study aimed firstly to investigate whether youngsters referred for overweight treatment differ from non-referred overweight youngsters on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological symptoms. Secondly, the potentially moderating role of age, gender, socio-economic status and degree of overweight in the association of referral status and mental disorder in overweight youth was explored. Methods Participants were 155 overweight youngsters enrolled in an obesity treatment programme (mean age = 13.76; mean BMI = 33.99) and 73 non-referred overweight youngsters (mean age = 13.74; mean BMI = 27.35). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Childhood version and the Child version of the Eating Disorder Examination were administered and participants filled out the Children's Depression Inventory, the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the Youth Self Report. Parents were asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklist. Results In the referred group 37.50% and in the non-referred group 23.29% of the participants met criteria for at least one mental disorder. In both groups, anxiety disorders were most prominent. Overall, a higher prevalence of mental disorders was found in the referred group. Referred youth displayed significantly more 'full blown' eating disorders and binge eating than non-referred youngsters and exhibited a significantly greater severity of self- and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. Referral was also associated with a significantly higher degree of overweight and significantly lower SES. After controlling for these pre-existing differences in degree of overweight and SES, only the greater severity of parent-reported internalizing symptoms in referred youth remained significant. Older age was generally predictive for the presence of mental disorders and in the non-referred group SES was positively associated with psychiatric disorder. Conclusions A substantial proportion of overweight youngsters suffer from mental disorders. Referral status and age are associated with the presence of psychopathology. However, differences between referred and non-referred youngsters are not as pronounced as expected on the basis of earlier research in the field.

AB Background. - Little evidence exists about suicidal acts in eating disorders and its relation with personality. We explored the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (SA) in women with bulimia nervosa (BN), and compared eating disorder symptoms, general psychopathology, impulsivity and personality between individuals who had and had not attempted suicide. We also determined the variables that better correlate with of SA.
   Method. - Five hundred sixty-six BN outpatients (417 BN purging, 47 BN non-purging and 102 subthreshold BN) participated in the study.
   Results. - Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 26.9%. BN subtype was not associated with lifetime SA (p = 0.36). Suicide attempters exhibited higher rates on eating symptomatology, general psychopathology, impulsive behaviors, more frequent history of childhood obesity and parental alcohol abuse (p < 0.004). Suicide attempters exhibited higher scores on harm avoidance and lower on self-directedness, reward dependence and cooperativeness (p < 0.002). The most strongly correlated variables with SA were: lower education, minimum BMI, previous eating disorder treatment, low self-directedness, and familial history of alcohol abuse (p < 0.006).
   Conclusion. - Our results support the notion that internalizing personality traits combined with impulsivity may increase the probability of suicidal behaviors in these patients. Future research may increase our understanding of the role of suicidality to work towards rational prevention of suicidal attempts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined potential non-shaxed environmental processes in middle childhood by estimating statistical associations between monozygotic (MZ) twin differences in externalizing and internalizing problems and positive social engagement, and differential maternal positivity and negativity, over 1 year. Seventy-seven pairs of identical twins participated (M = 6.08-years old, 65% male) in two annual home visits. Observers' ratings and maternal reports were gathered. At both assessments, the twin who showed more conduct problems (maternal report and observers' ratings) and less positive social engagement (positive affect, responsiveness) received more maternal negativity and less maternal warmth (self-reports and observers' ratings), relative to his or her genetically identical co-twin. The same patterns held over time, for the associations between change in differential MZ twin conduct problems and social engagement and. change in differential maternal behaviour. Effects for child internalizing problems were not consistent within or across raters. Overall, these results indicated that differential maternal warmth and negativity-self-perceived and observed by others-are important aspects of sibling differentiation for both problematic and adaptive behaviours during middle childhood.

AB Purpose: This study describes the adversities experienced by a sample of children of opiate-dependent parents, examines criteria for young adulthood functional resilience, and tests parent, child, and School predictors of resilience.
   Methods: The Focus on Families (FOF) project was a randomized trial of a farmly-focused intervention with opiate-dependent individuals in methadone treatment and their children. Analyses were conducted on data from the children in treatment and control families during the original Study (1991-1995) and a long-term follow-Lip interview (2005-2006).
   Results: Although all participants had an opiate-dependent parent, 70% experienced two or more additional types of childhood adversity and 20% experienced four or more types. A total of 24% met the following three criteria for functional resilience at the time of their young-adult interview: (1) working or being enrolled in school, (2) no history of substance abuse or dependence, and (3) no adult Criminal charges in the prior 5 years. The FOF intervention did not significantly predict functional resilience. Girls were approximately four times more likely to exhibit resilience than boys. Fxperiencing a wider range of adversities in addition to having an opiate-dependent parent did not reduce the likelihood of functional resilience. Of the five child, family, and school predictors tested, only externalizing or internalizing problems in childhood were significantly associated with the likelihood of functional resilience (odds ratio.30, p = .04) as a young adult.
   Conclusions: These findings Suggest that early intervention with families with opiate-dependent parents to prevent and reduce internalizing and externalizing problems in their children holds the most promise of' supporting resilient adaptation in early adulthood.

AB Background: The deleterious effects of childhood abuse have been a focus of much research; however, the causes of parental physical abuse are less well documented. Research with clinical samples suggests that individuals who display abusive behaviors are more likely to have a history of childhood abuse and higher rates of internalizing and externalizing disorders. Whether childhood abuse and psychopathology contribute independently to parental abusive behaviors or if the association between childhood abuse and the parental physical abuse is mediated by the individual's psychopathology has not been studied empirically.
   Methods: The current study is based on data from a representative sample (N=4141). Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse, and physically abusive behaviors exhibited towards children were assessed.
   Results: Internalizing and externalizing disorders partially mediated the association between childhood abuse and parental abuse. Nonetheless, the participant's internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, and previous experiences of childhood abuse each independently predicted parental abuse. Further, the influence of childhood abuse was greater for women than men.
   Limitations: The data is cross-sectional, thus clear conclusions regarding causality cannot be made.
   Conclusions: There are multiple pathways in the etiology of parental abusive behaviors. Previous experiences of childhood abuse, internalizing disorders, and extemalizing disorders each contribute to parental abuse. Individuals with psychiatric disorders or a history of childhood abuse are at an increased risk for abusive behaviors towards children in their care. Identifying such high-risk parents and providing parent training programs may be effective in lowering rates of child abuse. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obsessive-compulsive behavior was studied in a cohort of N = 570 subjects who had been assessed at three times between adolescence and young adulthood. Based on the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR), the adolescent obsessive-compulsive scale (AOCS) was defined. At each of the three assessments, subjects scoring above the cut-off score of the 90th percentile of the AOCS were identified and compared to the rest of the sample serving as control group. The risk group was clearly more abnormal in both domains of internalizing and externalizing across time. Various psychiatric disorders in young adulthood were predicted by the AOCS. However, concomitant general psychopathology also contributed strongly to the prediction. Parent and youth agreement on group membership was rather low. Stability of group assignment across time was significantly increased. The AOCS is a promising instrument both for epidemiological and clinical studies. Its content and predictive validity deserves further studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Caregiver depression has been described as leading to overreport of child behavior problems. This study examines this "depression-distortion" hypothesis in terms of high-risk families of young adolescents. Questionnaire data were collected from mothers, teachers. and fathers. and self-report information was obtained from youth between ages 10 and 14 years. First, convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated for internalizing and externalizing multiagent constructs. Second, the depression-distortion hypothesis was examined, revealing a modest effect of maternal depression, leading to the inflation of reported son externalizing and daughter internalizing problems. The data suggest the need to consider multiple influences on parental perceptions of child behavior and psychopathology in research and clinical settings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The current study examined the moderating role of conflict resolution on the association between parent-adolescent conflicts and adolescent problematic adjustment. Participants were 1313 Dutch early and middle adolescents who completed measures on conflict frequency, conflict resolution with parents, and internalizing and externalizing adjustment problems. Using a person-centered approach, five types of adolescents could be distinguished that were characterized by different patterns of conflict resolution. These types meaningfully differed in conflict frequency with parents and adjustment problems. Furthermore, these types moderated the relation between conflict frequency and externalizing problems and internalizing problems. When withdrawal was the only strategy used to resolve conflicts with parents, conflict frequency was more strongly related to externalizing problems, but when withdrawal was used in combination with other styles, conflict frequency was more strongly related to internalizing problems.

TI Grandchildhood: Adult Grandchildren's Perception of Their Role towards
   Their Grandparents from an Intergenerational Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE FAMILY STUDIES

   CONTACT; PARENTS; TIES
AB The study focuses on adult grandchildren's perception of their role towards their grandparents according to the perspectives of both generations: the grandchildren and the grandparents. This study proposes a definition of the role of the adult grandchild, including the expectations and obligations deriving from the role. The main theories that provide the conceptual framework for this study are Symbolic Interaction Theory, Exchange Theory and the Intergenerational Solidarity Model.
   The sample included 216 pairs of adult grandchildren (average age: 24.9) and their grandparents (average age: 78.3), Jewish residents in Israel, who responded to closed questionnaires. The main findings of the research demonstrate that role perception of the adult grandchild is shaped by means of intergenerational transfer and by internalizing norms and behavior patterns of parents. As expected, it was found that perception of the grandchild's role is more positive among grandchildren who experienced their grandparents as caregivers in their childhood than among grandchildren that did not have the experience of being cared for by grandparents. Grandchildren definitely possess a perception of filial obligation and responsibility to ward grandparents and in fact they express more positive opinions than the grandparent regarding this responsibility. Regarding the practical implications of these results for the clinical field of therapy with aging family, the conclusion that adult grandchildren are an integral part of the grandparents' total support network can contribute to the development of comprehensive psycho-social evaluations, as well as to the development of family treatment programs that involve the third generation.

AB Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a variable, complex malformation involving asymmetric hypoplasia of the face and ear. Little is known about the risk factors for or consequences of HFM. In this study, we describe 3 studies that have been or are currently being conducted to further our understanding of this malformation. The first completed study examined whether HFM risk is related to maternal exposures that may affect blood flow. In that case-control study, interview data from 230 mothers of children in the case group and 678 mothers of children in the control group suggested that maternal use of vasoactive medications in the first trimester, particularly in combination with cigarette smoking, was associated with increased risks of HFM. The second study is currently underway, in which we are evaluating whether HFM risk is related to genetic variation in pathways associated with vasculogenesis and hemostasis, using DNA collected in the first study. The third ongoing study observes children with HFM to identify psychosocial, cognitive, dental, and medical sequelae. When the children from the original case-control study are 6 or 7 years of age, mothers and teachers complete self-administered questionnaires that cover a wide range of psychosocial development domains. Preliminary analyses of 115 case and 314 control children suggest that children with HFM may have worse teacher-reported academic performance and possibly higher levels of internalizing behavior problems than control children. When data on the full study sample are available, further analyses will determine whether the preliminary findings remain and if they vary by HFM phenotype, parenting style, or indicators of social risk.

AB The authors examined racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use based on problem type (internalizing/externalizing). A diverse sample of youth in contact with public sectors of care and their families provided reports of youth's symptoms and functional impairment during an initial interview. Specialty and school-based mental health service use during the subsequent 2 years was assessed prospectively. Greater disparities in mental health service receipt were evident for internalizing problems, with non-Hispanic White youth more likely to receive services in response to internalizing symptoms than minority youth. Fewer disparities in rates of unmet need emerged for externalizing problems, but minority youth were more likely to have need for externalizing problems met and African American youth were particularly likely to receive services in response to such problems. Findings highlight the importance of considering problem type when examining racial disparities in mental health services and underscore concerns about the responsiveness of mental health services for minority youth with internalizing disorders.

AB Child welfare agencies are required to provide services that ensure that children receive adequate mental health care. This study provides a comprehensive view of the emotional and behavioral problems of children who are referred to child welfare services, using nationally representative data. Bivariate analyses compare rates by child demographics, and conditional probability tables present changes in clinical status. Results show that 62% of children have at least one clinical-level score over 3 years. Rates are highest at baseline. Posttraumatic stress most frequently improves, whereas thought, attention, and aggressive/delinquent behavior problems are most persistent. Sexualized behavior is more common among White and Hispanic children, and boys are reported with more internalizing problems than do girls. Targeted services are needed for young children who experience posttraumatic stress, as is treatment for attention problems that accounts for both biological and environmental components. Distinguishing the effects of age, environment, and assessment methods on boys' internalizing problems is also critical.

AB Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with decreased quality of life (QOL) and neurocognitive dysfunction in adults, but little is known about its impact on children and their caregivers.
   Patients and Methods: We Studied the QOL, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive functioning of 114 treatment-naive children with HCV enrolled in a placebo-con trolled, randomized, multisite clinical trial evaluating peginterferon alpha-2a alone or with ribavirin. Baseline assessment included measures of children's QOL, cognitive functioning, behavioral adaptation, and depression. Caregivers' QOL also was assessed.
   Results: Relative to published normative data, caregivers were more likely to believe that their children's health was poor and would likely worsen (t = 3.93; P < 0.0001), and reported higher concern about their children's health status (t = 6.63; P < 0.0001) and that this concern limited family activities (t = 2.45; P < 0.01); they also viewed their children as having more internalizing behavioral problems (t = 1.98; P < 0.05). Only 2 (2%) children had a score in the clinically depressed range. Children with HCV had worse cognitive functioning than the normative sample but significantly better functioning than children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Caregivers' QOL scores did not differ significantly from the normative sample, but infected mothers had lower QOL than noninfected caregivers. Caregivers were highly distressed about their children's medical circumstances.
   Conclusions: Although HCV infection, in its early stages, does not lead to global impairment in QOL, cognitive, behavioral, or emotional functioning in children, it is associated with higher caregiver stress and strain on the family system, and it may be associated with some cognitive changes in children.

Children with RAP were higher than well children but not significantly different from children with anxiety on total internalizing and anxiety symptoms.ConclusionsRAP and anxiety are closely related. Further understanding between these disorders is essential to understanding the development and progression of RAP, and to inform the prevention and treatment of the disorder.

AB The contribution of sleep problems to emotional and behavioral problems among young children within the context of known risk factors for psychopathology was examined. Data on 2- and 3-year-olds, representative of Canadian children without a chronic illness, from three cross-sectional cohorts of the Canadian National Longitudinal Study of Child and Youth were analysed (n = 2996, 2822, and 3050). The person most knowledgeable (PMK), usually the mother, provided information about her child, herself, and her family. Predictors included: child health status and temperament; parenting and PMK depressive symptomatology; family demographics (e.g., marital status, income) and functioning. Child sleep problems included night waking and bedtime resistance. Both internalizing/emotional (i.e., anxiety) and externalizing/behavioral problems (i.e., hyperactivity, aggression) were examined. Adjusting for other known risk factors, child sleep problems accounted for a small, but significant, independent proportion of the variance in internalizing and externalizing problems. Structural equation models examining the pathways linking risk factors to sleep problems and emotional and behavioral problems were a good fit of the data. Results were replicated on two additional cross-sectional samples. The relation between sleep problems and emotional and behavioral problems is independent of other commonly identified risk factors. Among young children, sleep problems are as strong a correlate of child emotional and behavioral problems as PMK depressive symptomatology, a well-established risk factor for child psychopathology. Adverse parenting and PMK symptomatology, along with difficult temperament all contribute to both sleep problems and emotional and behavioral problems. Children's sleep problems appear to exacerbate emotional and behavioral problems.

AB Objective: Depression is often found to be comorbid with alcohol-related problems. Parental overprotection, which may be of particular importance during emerging adulthood, has been linked to internalizing symptoms in offspring. This article evaluates the impact of parenting styles and parental confidence in their offspring on an internalizing pathway to alcohol-related problems through self-esteem and depression. Method: Mediational links were tested among parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), parental confidence (overprotection, autonomy), self-esteem, depression, and alcohol-related problems. A two-group, multiple indicator multiple-cause structural equation model with 441 (216 female, 225 male) college students was examined. Results: Overall, having a father who was confident in his child's ability to make autonomous decisions was protective against depression for both genders. Perceptions of paternal autonomy mediated the impact of the fathers' parenting styles (authoritative, permissive) on depression for both genders. For men, parental overprotection mediated the impact of an authoritarian father on self-esteem, and self-esteem mediated the impact of parental overprotection on depression. Moreover, among men, perceptions of maternal autonomy mediated the impact of the mothers' parenting styles (authoritative, permissive) on self-esteem, and self-esteem mediated the impact of maternal autonomy on depression. Conclusions: The current pattern of findings is distinct from pathways through behavioral undercontrol with influences from the same-sex parent for both genders. These findings indicate that parenting may have differential influences on internalizing pathways to alcohol-related problems. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 215-226, 2009)

AB This article reviews the research literature on links between parental divorce and children's short-term and long-term adjustment. First, I consider evidence regarding how divorce relates to children's externalizing behaviors, internalizing problems, academic achievement, and social relationships. Second, I examine timing of the divorce, demographic characteristics, children's adjustment prior to the divorce, and stigmatization as moderators of the links between divorce and children's adjustment. Third, I examine income, interparental conflict, parenting, and parents' well-being as mediators of relations between divorce and children's adjustment. Fourth, I note the caveats and limitations of the research literature. Finally, I consider notable policies related to grounds for divorce, child support, and child custody in light of how they might affect children's adjustment to their parents' divorce.

TI Gender-Specific Mental and Behavioral Outcomes Among Physically Abused

AB Objective. Research has shown that physical abuse during childhood (early PA) is associated with various mental and behavioral problems in adolescence. However, there is little research on the differences in these associations by gender among youths residing in high-risk communities. This study investigated gender differences in the relationship between early PA and various internalizing (e.g., thoughts of suicide or victimization) and externalizing (e.g., perpetration of violence) behaviors.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted using survey data (collected in 2004) provided by 1,484 seventh-grade youths residing in a high-risk community (83% participated). Students were considered victims of early PA if they reported experiencing abuse prior to age 10 years. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated to estimate the association between early PA and various outcomes (e.g., suicidality, victimization, violence, and illegal drug use), adjusting for race/ethnicity and other forms of abuse. Poisson regression with robust variance estimates was used to estimate the PRs and test for early PA-gender interaction.
   Results. Early PA was positively associated with suicidality, illegal drug use, and victimization with no significant differences by gender. The association between early PA and criminal behavior was significantly higher for females; the association between early PA and peer violence perpetration was significantly higher for males (interaction term PA*gender was significant at the p <= 0.005 level).
   Conclusions. Young high-risk adolescents who experienced early PA may need counseling or other services (e.g., home visitation) to help prevent suicidality, victimization, violence perpetration, criminal behavior, and illegal drug use. Furthermore, male victims may need more attention in the area of violence prevention; female victims may need particular attention with regard to preventing criminal behavior.

TI Sex differences in the prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders

SO SALUD MENTAL

AB Introduction
   The first and only nationally representative prevalence estimates of psychiatric disorders in Mexico (the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey) indicate sex differences in the expression of psychopathology and early ages of onset for most disorders, often in the adolescent years. Studies from other countries have shown that sex differences in the pattern of psychopathology vary by life stage, which in part, may be explained by different ages of onset for varying disorders.
   These studies also suggest that many of the sex differences in the prevalence of disorders emerge during the adolescent years. However, scarce data is available on the epidemiology of adolescent psychopathology in Mexico, and much less regarding possible sex differences in the patterns of prevalence, severity and ages of onset.
   The purpose of this report, therefore, is to estimate sex differences in the 12-month prevalence and severity of 17 psychiatric disorders (using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) as well as ages of onset in adolescents from Mexico City metropolitan area.
   Materials and methods
   This article provides data from the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey. This survey has a multistage probability design and is representative of adolescents between 12 and 17 years old who reside in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The final sample included 3 005 adolescents selected from a stratified multistage area probability sample. In all strata, the primary sampling units were census count areas cartographically defined and updated in 2000 by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI). Two hundred census count areas were selected with probability proportional to size. Secondary sampling units were city blocks, four of which were selected with probability proportional to size from each census count area. All households within these selected city blocks with adolescents aged 12 to 17 were selected. One eligible member from each of these households was randomly selected using the Kish method of random number charts. The response rate of eligible respondents was 71%.
   The adolescents were interviewed in their homes by trained lay interviewers using the computerized adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHM-CIDI-A 3.0). The average length of the interview was two and a half hours. A verbal and written explanation of the study was given to both parents and adolescents. Interviews were administered only to those for whom signed informed consent from a parent and/or legal guardian were obtained as well as the adolescent agreement.
   Because of the stratified multistage sampling design, data was subsequently weighted to adjust for differential probabilities of selection and non-response. Post-stratification to the total Mexico City Metropolitan Area adolescent population according to the year 2000 Census in target age and sex ranges were also performed. For prevalence estimates, due to this complex sample design and weighting, estimates of standard errors for proportions were obtained by the Taylor series linearization method using the SUDAAN software. Sex differences were evaluated using Wald chi(2) tests. Statistical significance was based on two-tailed design tests evaluated at the .05 level of significance. Ages of onset for psychiatric disorders were estimated using discrete time survival analyses with person-years as the unit of analysis which in this article are presented as Kaplan-Meier curves.
   Results
   The most prevalent individual disorders in both sexes were specific phobia (15.6% for males, 26.1% for females) and social phobia (10.0% for males, 12.4% for females). For females, the most frequent disorders that follow in magnitude after these two types of phobias are, in decreasing order, major depression (7.6%), oppositional defiant disorder (6.9%), agoraphobia without panic (4.7%) and separation anxiety disorder (3.6%). On the other hand, for males, the most frequent disorders after specific and social phobia are oppositional defiant disorder (3.7%), alcohol abuse (3.4%) and conduct disorder (3.3%). Overall, females reported a forger number of disorders and a greater prevalence of any disorder.
   With regards to disorder severity, mood disorders have the greatest proportion of severe cases and anxiety disorders the smallest proportion of severe cases. While this pattern is found for both males and females, there are sex differences in severity such that females hove a greater proportion of severe cases overall (25.5% were severe cases compared to 18.9% for males).
   The earliest ages of onset were found in anxiety disorders, followed by impulse control disorders, and mood disorders with substance use disorders having the latest ages of onset. The ages of onset for anxiety, mood and substance use disorders are similar between males and females. However, males developed at earlier ages the onset of impulse control disorders than females, and this is due primarily to oppositional defiant disorder rather than to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or to conduct disorder.
   Discussion
   The greater overall prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders in adolescent females in comparison to adolescent males suggests that adolescence may be a period of greater vulnerability for females. Our findings with regards to a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescent females in comparison to males are consistent with those reported in the international literature. However, our findings of more impulse control disorders in females than males are inconsistent with most international reports excepting a study of Finnish adolescents in which adolescent girls reported more internalizing and externalizing disorders than their male counterparts. The greater prevalence of impulse control disorders in our study is due to oppositional defiant disorder, not attention deficit hyperactivity or conduct disorder. The lack of sex differences in substance use disorders is consistent with recent findings in Mexican adolescents which show a narrowing of the sex gap difference in substance use.
   There are both biological and psychosocial theories which may explain the greater vulnerability in adolescent girls such as gender role intensification and socialization during adolescence; a higher exposure to adversity, stress and negative life events; as well as a greater reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis when confronted with stress.
   Study limitations include the willingness of participants to disclosure sensitive or potentially embarrassing information as well as potential sex differences in willingness. While females reported more disorders and greater severity of disorders overall, sex differences in response style are not likely, since females reported more of many, but not all disorders. A further limitation is the use of trained lay interviewers instead of clinicians. The development and use of fully structured diagnostic instruments such as the CIDI have greatly helped to tackle this limitation in general population surveys and data suggest that diagnoses provided by these fully structured instruments approximate adequately clinical diagnoses.
   Keeping in mind these limitations, the results of this study are relevant for clinical practice as well as for the epidemiological surveillance of our population to guide service planning and public health policy.

AB Family socioeconomic position (SEP) is known to be associated with adolescent mental health. Whether the relationship is different for different mental health dimensions is unknown.
   Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated the differential effects of family SEP on multiple mental health dimensions in preadolescents (N = 2230, baseline age 10-12, 49% boys) using reports from multiple informants (parent, self, and teachers). A score equal to or higher than the 85th percentile (averaged across informants) defined mental health problems.
   SEP was inversely associated with all dimensions. Compared to high SEP, the odds ratios (OR) for externalizing problems were 3.88 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.56, 5.90) and 2.05 (CI: 1.34, 3.14) for low and intermediate SEP, respectively. For internalizing problems, they were 1.86 (CI: 1.28, 2.70) and 1.37 (CI: 0.94, 2.00), respectively. When adjusted for externalizing problems, SEP effects on internalizing problems materially attenuated (OR: 1.47, CI: 0.78, 1.68 and OR: 1.34, CI: 0.91, 1.96) while the converse was less pronounced (OR: 3.39, CI: 2.24, 5.15) and (OR: 1.91, CI: 1.25, 2.94).
   In early adolescence, the risk of mental health problems increases with decreasing SEP, particularly for externalizing problems. Further, the SEP-internalizing problems relationship is partly explained by shared aspects with externalizing problems.

AB Mental health problems in young adults are frequent and impairing, but are often left untreated. This study among young adults with self-perceived mental health problems examines beliefs about mental health problems (i.e. their cause, consequences, timeline, and controllability) and help-seeking behaviour.
   A cross-sectional population survey (n = 2,258) in the south-west Netherlands. Participants were included who reported having mental health problems during the past year (n = 830). Beliefs about cause, consequences, timeline, and controllability of self-perceived mental health problems were assessed with the Illness Perception Questionnaire. Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology was assessed with the Adult Self-Report.
   A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicates that independent of sex, age, and severity of psychopathology, higher levels on the intra-psychic causes scale (OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.48-2.58), the consequences scale (OR = 1.81, 95%CI = 1.40-2.33), and the treatment control scale (OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.60-2.41) are associated with an increased likelihood of mental health service use, while higher levels of personal control (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.62-0.93) are associated with a decreased likelihood.
   Beliefs that may encourage young adults with mental health problems to seek professional help include the beliefs that mental health problems have adverse consequences and that treatment can help. Since these beliefs are related to young adults' knowledge of mental health problems, help-seeking behavior may be encouraged by educating young adults about mental health problems and the effective mental health treatments which are available.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to investigate longitudinally children's behavioral and social competence outcomes up to 2 years after pediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT) and related factors. METHODS: Ninety-nine mothers and 24 youths completed standardized questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL] and Youth Self-Report [YSR]) pre-SCT, and 12 and 24 months after SCT; 26 teachers completed Teacher Report Form (TRF) at 24 months. Information regarding clinical (eg, diagnosis, cranial radiation, graft vs host disease [GVHD]), child (eg, age, sex, physical health), and familial (eg, maternal age, education, distress) factors was also obtained. RESULTS: Linear mixed regression models with compound covariance structure followed by adjusted pairwise analyses yielded significant improvements from pre-SCT to 1 and 2 years after SCT in total scores; in externalizing and internalizing scores from pre-SCT to 2 years after SCT; and in total competence from pre-SCT to 1 year after SCT. Child's physical health, maternal age, and depression were found to be significantly associated with the total, internalizing, and externalizing CBCL scores, whereas GVHD, mother's age, and time since diagnosis were associated with CBCL competence scores. Diagnosis, cranial radiation, GVHD, child's physical health, and maternal age and education were associated with YSR total behavioral and competence scores. Finally, total TRF scores were associated with time since diagnosis; TRF educational and adaptability scores were associated with maternal education, age, and distress. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, personal, and familial factors must be considered to understand the psychosocial outcomes of these survivors up to 2 years after SCT. This study has important implications for psychosocial interventions for this population. Cancer 2009;115:880-9. (C) 2009 American Cancer Society.

AB Eight first-grade students with either internalizing or externalizing behavioral risk factors participated in a supplemental reading intervention for 30 min per day. The intervention package consisted of three main components: instruction in word recognition, fluency, and appropriate behavior. A multiple-baseline design was employed to assess intervention effectiveness using weekly Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills Oral Reading Fluency probes and monthly Nonsense Word Fluency probes. Results indicated improvements in early literacy skills for all participants, and response to treatment did not vary by behavioral risk type. Both students with externalizing and internalizing behavioral challenges benefited. Social validity ratings were favorable. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB Office discipline referrals (ODRs) are commonly used by school teams implementing schoolwide positive behavior support to indicate individual student need for additional behavior support. However, little is known about the technical adequacy of ODRs when used in this manner. In this study, the authors assessed (a) the concurrent validity of number of ODRs received with a contemporary standardized behavior rating scale (the BASC-2 Teacher Report Form) and (b) the validity of common cut points to determine level of support needed (i.e., 0 to 1, 2 to 5, and 6 or more ODRs). Results indicated strong correlations between ODRs and rating of externalizing behavior and statistically and clinically significant differences in behavior ratings based on existing ODR cut points, but there was no significant relation between ODRs and ratings of internalizing problems. Results are discussed in terms of recommended use of ODRs as a screening measure to indicate level of behavior support required.

AB Objective: This research examined whether additional forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's intimate partner violence [IPV]) contribute to children's adjustment problems in families characterized by men's severe violence toward women.
   Methods: Participants were 258 children and their mothers recruited from domestic violence shelters. Mothers and children completed measures of men's IPV, women's IPV, partner-child aggression, and mother-child aggression. Mothers provided reports of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems: children provided reports of their appraisals of threat in relation to interparent conflict.
   Results: After controlling for sociodemographics and men's IPV: (1) each of the additional forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's IPV) was associated with children's externalizing problems; (2) partner-child aggression was associated with internalizing problems; and (3) partner-child aggression was associated with children's threat appraisals. The relation of mother-child aggression to externalizing problems was stronger for boys than for girls; gender differences were not observed for internalizing problems or threat appraisals.
   Conclusions: Men's severe IPV seldom occurs in the absence of other forms of family violence, and these other forms appear to contribute to children's adjustment problems. Parent-child aggression, and partner-child aggression in particular, are especially important. Systematic efforts to identify shelter children who are victims of parental violence seem warranted.
   Practice implications: Men's severe IPV seldom occurs in the absence of other forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's IPV), and these different forms of family violence all contribute to children's adjustment problems. Treatment programs for children who come to domestic violence shelters should address these different forms of family violence, especially parent-child aggression. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim This study was performed to investigate relations between psychopathology and psychopathy in adolescent female and male detainees. Method We examined 91 male and 123 female adolescent detainees (aged 14-19) for psychopathology-using the Youth Self Report, the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified and a Conduct Disorder Self Report Scale-and for psychopathic dimensions using the psychopathy checklist youth version (PCL:YV). Based on a linear regression analysis we compared the specific associations between psychopathology and psychopathy in both male and female delinquent juveniles. Results Our results revealed higher scores for externalizing behavior and psychopathic dimensions in delinquent males, and higher internalizing problem scores in delinquent females. Furthermore, we found a positive relationship between suicidal behavior and the psychopathy total score as well as the affective, the lifestyle and the antisocial dimension only in girls. No association was found for suicidal behavior in boys. Regarding anxious-depressive behavior, we found a negative relation to the psychopathy total score and to the affective psychopathy factor for the boys. Conclusion Expectedly, the population of incarcerated adolescents exhibited a high prevalence of psychopathology. At the same time our results referred to meaningful gender-related differences with respect to associations with psychopathy. The gender-related differences in psychopathological symptoms could indicate varied subtypes of psychopathy in boys and girls.

AB Juvenile delinquency is rarely associated with success in psychotherapeutic treatment. Up until now, few data have been recorded regarding possible overlaps or common features of conduct disorders with anxiety disorders. This case report of a delinquent adolescent's presenting an obsessive-compulsive disorder discusses possible underlying common features of externalizing and internalizing disorders, mainly in terms of fear and anxiety regulation. The successful psychotherapy is discussed with regard to efficient psychological assessment and treatment of delinquent adolescents, and it underlies the importance of detailed analysis of psychopathology in cases of juvenile delinquency.

AB Using growth curve modeling, trajectories of undercontrolled (oppositional, irritable, inattentive and overactive behaviors) and internalizing (worried, sad and fearful) problems from 18 months to 4.5 years were studied in a population based sample of 921 Norwegian children. At the population level, undercontrolled problems decreased and internalizing problems increased with increasing age. Child temperament and family factors present at 18 months predicted 43% of the stability and 20% of the linear changes in undercontrolled problems and 30% of the stability and 7% of the linear changes in internalizing problems. Persisting effects of child and family factors from 18 month were found on the two problem dimensions over and above the impact of changes in the same risk factors. Lower initial level of partner support and higher initial level of child emotionality predicted higher slope of undercontrolled problems and higher initial level of family stress predicted higher slope for internalizing problems. As expected, time to time change (t1 to t2 and t2 to t3) in risk factors predicted time to time change in problem scores as well. The study shows the significance of early emerging internalizing and undercontrolled problems, the need to consider their pathways separately from very young ages, lasting effects of early experiences, and the importance of a dynamic approach to the analysis of risk.

AB The aim of the present study is to investigate whether early childhood adversities determine the longitudinal course of psychiatric problems from childhood to adulthood; in particular if the impact of early maltreatment on psychopathology decreases as time passes. A sample of 1,984 international adoptees was followed (955 males and 1029 females; adopted at the mean age of 29 months). Parents provided information about abuse, neglect and number of placements prior to adoption at baseline and completed the Child Behavior Checklist or the Young Adult Behavior Checklist three times when their children were between 10 and 30 years of age. Multilevel analyses were performed to determine trajectories of psychiatric problems. Experience of early childhood adversity prior to adoption substantially increased the level of psychiatric problems, especially when maltreatment was severe. Moreover, the impact of early adversities on psychiatric problems remained markedly stable. This suggests that vulnerability of early-maltreated children persists even if they are taken out of their problematic environments and are raised in enriched circumstances.

AB Co-rumination, or excessive discussion of problems within friendships, has been associated with internalizing symptoms and is especially prevalent among adolescent girls. Eighty-three early adolescent girls participated in a prospective study further examining this construct. Co-rumination was positively correlated with depressive symptoms and positive aspects of friendship, but did not predict longitudinal changes in depressive symptoms. Co-rumination was negatively related to social anxiety when controlling for depressive symptoms. Co-rumination correlated positively with romantic experiences, and the two interacted to predict longitudinal changes in depressive symptoms, implying that co-rumination may only be depressogenic under certain circumstances. Theoretical ramifications for the construct of co-rumination and interpersonal aspects of adolescent internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB Purpose: To (1) examine growth in family conflict during adolescence as a predictor of depressive symptoms in early adulthood, (2) examine adult stressful life events as a possible mechanism linking prior family conflict with depressive symptoms, and (3) examine adolescent school bonding as a possible moderator of family conflict and stressful life events in relation to later depression.
   Methods: Analyses used a latent variable growth curve modeling approach to examine longitudinal patterns in data from the Seattle Social Development Project. Assessments of a gender-balanced and ethnically diverse sample of 754 participants were conducted from age 10 to age 27.
   Results: Results show an increase in conflict each year between ages 14 and 18 for participating youth. High initial levels and growth in family conflict predicted adult stressful life events, which, in turn, predicted adult depressive symptoms, controlling for earlier risks of poverty and internalizing problems. Bonding to school in mid-adolescence did not significantly change the associations among the variables in the model.
   Conclusions: inhibiting the growth in family conflict over the course of adolescence may reduce the risk for some life stresses linked to depression in early adulthood. Although a test of the protective influence of school bonding during mid-adolescence was not significant, the study offers an example of how longitudinal patterns and protective factors can be analyzed.

AB Purpose: Stressful life events represent potent risk factors for the development of internalizing symptoms among adolescents. However the mechanisms linking stress to adolescent psychopathology remain inadequately understood. This study examined the role of emotion dysregulation as a mechanism linking stress to changes in internalizing symptoms among adolescents.
   Methods: This study used a short-term longitudinal design. Stressful life events were assessed in a large diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065), and emotion dysregulation and symptomatology outcomes were assessed at two subsequent tune points. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the role of emotion dysregulation as a mediator of the association between stress and subsequent changes in internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between stressful life events and changes in internalizing symptoms over time. Sobel's test indicated a significant indirect effect of stressful life events on subsequent symptoms of depression (z = 5.05, p <.001) and anxiety (z = 4.95, p <.001) through emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: Stressful life events appear to disrupt the adaptive processing of emotion among adolescents. Emotion dysregulation represents an intrapersonal mechanism linking stress to poor mental health outcomes. The implications for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Research indicates that African Americans living in an oppressive society may be at art increased risk of experiencing psychological symptoms. Oppressive society has been defined as the continual denial of resources to marginalized groups. This study examined the possible moderating effects of racial socialization (using Scale of Racial Socialization-Adolescent) in the relationship between poverty and psychological symptoms (externalizing and internalizing symptoms). The sample consisted of 105 African American adolescents, aged 11 to 15, front a large midwestern city: Racial socialization was expected to reduce psychological symptomatology. There was an unexpected finding of a positive relationship between racial socialization and externalizing symptoms. Although significant moderating effects were found for racial socialization, no protective effect was demonstrated in this study. Future research directions are discussed.

AB In this study we explored the relation between maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and toddler adjustment in a community sample, testing direct, additive, and interactive models of parental depressive symptoms and child adjustment. Participants were 49 families with 30-month-old children. Data were collected on maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and marital quality, as well as on toddler internalizing and externalizing behavior. The data supported an additive, but not interactive, model of prediction to externalizing behavior, such that maternal and paternal symptoms each accounted for unique variance in the prediction of toddler externalizing. Models predicting toddler internalizing were not significant. Maternal reports of marital quality, but not paternal reports of marital quality, reduced the magnitude of the relation between symptoms and child externalizing when entered as a covariate. Implications for depression screening of parents are discussed.

AB We examined the relationship of gender and different forms of abuse experience on internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and IQ in a sample of 397 youngsters who were admitted to a residential treatment program. Three types of abuse experience were examined in this study: sexual abuse only, physical abuse only, and both sexual and physical abuse. Results indicate that girls exhibited higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms even though abuse experience was accounted for in the analyses. Moreover, youngsters who had experienced sexual abuse (but not physical abuse) exhibited higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms than youngsters who had not been abused. Implications for developing individualized interventions based on gender and abuse experience in residential treatment programs is discussed.

AB Potential pathways from childhood sexual abuse (CSA) to subsequent romantic intimacy problems were examined in a prospective longitudinal study of 160 ethnically diverse youth with confirmed CSA histories. Participants were interviewed at the time of abuse discovery, when they were 8-15 years of age, and again 1-6 years later. Stigmatization (abuse-specific shame and self-blame) and internalizing Symptoms (posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms), more than abuse severity, explained which youth with CSA histories experienced more sexual difficulties and dating aggression. Stigmatization was found to operate as I predictive mechanism for subsequent sexual difficulties. Internalizing symptoms were not predictive of romantic intimacy problems, although they did show correlational relations with sexual difficulties and dating aggression. Early interventions such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy that target Stigmatization may be important for preventing the development of sexual difficulties in CSA youth.

AB Objective To determine the relations between hypertension and parental ratings of behavior and executive functions in children with primary hypertension and to examine the potential moderating influence of obesity.
   Study design Hypertensive and normotensive control groups were matched for age, sex, race, intelligence quotient, maternal education, household income, and obesity. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist to assess Internalizing and Externalizing problems and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function to assess behavioral correlates of executive function.
   Results Thirty-two hypertensive subjects and 32 normotensive con trol sujects (aged 10 to 18 years) were enrolled. On the Child Behavior Checklist, hypertensives had higher Internalizing T-scores (53 vs 44.5, P = .02) with 37% failing within the clinically significant range vs 6% of control sujects (P = .005). Internalizing score increased with increasing body mass index percentile in hypertensive but not normotensive subjects. Hypertensives had worse Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Global Executive Composite T-scores compared with control subjects, (50 vs 43, P = .009).
   Conclusions Children with both hypertension and obesity demonstrate higher rates of clinically significant internalizing problems, and hypertensives (irrespective of obesity) demonstrate lower parental ratings of executive function compared with normotensive control subjects.

AB Objective To examine whether maternal gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are associated with behavioral problems in offspring throughout childhood and early adolescence.
   Study design We conducted a prospective cohort study of 2804 women in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study and their children observed at age 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to measure problem child behavior with continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points. Control variables included known biomedical, sociodemographic, and psychological factors.
   Results After adjustment, with general linear model analyses children of women with gestational hypertension were shown to be more likely to have higher CBCL z-scores. indicative of poorer behavior, from 8 years; on, with the largest difference seen at 14 years. Children of mothers with preeclampsia were more likely to have lower CBCL z-scores, indicative of pro-social behaviors. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that gestational hypertension was predictive of clinically significant CBCL T-scores from age 8 to 1.4 years. This association was significant for externalizing behavior, such as delinquent and aggressive behavior, and for internalizing behavior at age 14 years. Unexpectedly, preeclampsia reduced internalizing morbidity at ages 5 and 8 years.
   Conclusions The opposing effect on child and adolescent behavior of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia warrants further attention. (J Pediatr 2009,154:2.18-24)

AB Objective: From a developmental perspective, it is important to know to what extent childhood problem behaviors are transmitted across generations. In a longitudinal community study, we compared child behavior of parents with the behavior of their offspring. Intergenerational transmission was investigated for a broad range of problem behaviors, including internalizing problems and externalizing behavior. Sex differences were investigated as well. Method: We compared Child Behavior Checklist scores of 4- to 16-year-old children (N = 271) from a community sample assessed in 1983 with Child Behavior Checklist scores of their 6- to 18-year-old offspring (N = 424) who were assessed in 2007. Multilevel modeling was used to test intergenerational associations. Results: Most forms of problem behavior in children were predicted by the behavior of their parents as children. Parents' Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problem scores in childhood all predicted similar problems in their children. Sex differences were found for Delinquent Behavior: continuity was stronger in mothers than it was in fathers, and it was also stronger in sons than in daughters. Conclusions: The finding that child behavior continues across generations poses challenges in finding ways to prevent problems from being transmitted across generations. J. Am. Acad. Child. Adolsc.

For CBCL scales, the mean score on the internalizing scale was significantly higher in the children on dialysis than in predialysis and control children. No significant differences in the mean scores of the total problem or externalizing scales were found between the groups studied. The mean score of SCICA observed problems and total self-reports were significantly higher in the control group than in the CKD groups. The mean score on total self-report was significantly higher in the control children than in the predialysis group. There were significant positive correlations between SCICA self-report and all CBCL scales. No significant correlations were found between these CBCL and SCICA scales and age, gender, severity of anemia, duration of CKD or the efficiency or the duration of hemodialysis in the CKD patients. In conclusion, multi-method assessment of children's adjustment through different informants yields a comprehensive view of child psychopathology in CKD that calls for psychosocial support and early identification of maladjustment.

AB OBJECTIVE. There is an increasing focus on social and environmental factors that promote and support the early development of highly vulnerable children such as those born very preterm. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between parenting behavior, parent-child synchrony, and neurobehavioral development in very preterm children at 24 months of age.
   METHODS. Participants were 152 very preterm children (< 30 weeks' gestation or < 1250 g birth weight) and their parents/guardians. At 2 years' corrected age, parents/guardians and children completed a semistructured parent-child interaction task assessing dyad synchrony and parenting behavior (positive affect, negative affect, sensitivity, facilitation, and intrusiveness). Cognitive and motor development was assessed by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, and the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment was used to assess socioemotional development (social-emotional competence and internalizing and externalizing behavior).
   RESULTS. After controlling for social risk, most parenting domains were associated with cognitive development, with parent-child synchrony emerging as the most predictive. Greater parent-child synchrony was also associated with greater social-emotional competence, as was parenting that was positive, warm, and sensitive. Parents who displayed higher levels of negative affect were more likely to rate their children as withdrawn, anxious, and inhibited, but, unexpectedly, higher negative affect was also associated with more optimal psychomotor development. Parenting was not associated with externalizing behaviors at this age.
   CONCLUSIONS. Specific parenting behaviors, particularly parent-child synchrony, were associated with neurobehavioral development. These findings have implications for the development of targeted parent-based interventions to promote positive outcomes across different developmental domains during the first 2 years of life for very preterm children.

AB This longitudinal (22 yr.) study examined several psychosocial predictors of higher than normal recommended Body Mass Index and aspects of neurocognitive dysfunction in a community-based sample of 470 participants interviewed in private during childhood, adolescence. emerging adulthood and adulthood. Included were 5 psychosocial measures: Internalizing Behaviors (i.e., symptoms of internal distress), Educational Expectations and Aspirations (i.e.. components of cognitive functioning), Impulsivity (i.e., emotional control), Body Mass Index (a measure of weight by height), and Aspects of Neurocognitive Dysfunction (e.g., memory). Results, based on Structural Equation Modeling, indicated that earlier Internalizing Behaviors Low Educational Expectations and Aspirations, and Impulsivity predict greater Body Mass Index. Greater than normal Body Mass Index in the early 30s is associated with later Aspects of Neurocognitive Dysfunction in the middle 30s. Adolescent Internalizing Behaviors are also associated with Aspects of Neurocognitive Dysfunction in the middle 30s. Public health implications suggest increasing education about diet, health, and exercise to lessen or avoid aspects of neurocognitive dysfunction. Clinical implications suggest the importance of providing appropriate prevention and intervention for people with internalizing behaviors, impulsivity, and greater than recommended Body Mass Index.

   DIMENSIONS
AB Perfectionism is a multidimensional construct that has only recently received greater attention in parents and their children. Perfectionism is often shared among family members, and one developmental model indicates that anxious parents may help predispose perfectionism in youths. This study examined relationships between parent and youth perfectionism and between parent perfectionism and youth internalizing psychopathology among adolescents aged 11-17 years. Both relationships were examined for mediation by parent internalizing psychopathology. Maternal perfectionism was found related to sons' self-oriented perfectionism and internalizing psychopathology. Maternal self-oriented perfectionism was most closely related to sons' self-oriented perfectionism, but maternal socially prescribed perfectionism was most closely (and inversely) related to sons' internalizing psychopathology. Maternal obsessive compulsive symptoms also mediated the relationship between mothers' and sons' self-oriented perfectionism. Several possible pathways between parent and child perfectionism are discussed, including information transfer, modeling, and excessive control. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Based on the frequently noted heterogeneity in symptom representation and treatment resistance amongst clients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), this study sought to investigate whether a sample of 77 people with severe personality disorder, primarily BPD (n = 74), could be grouped into clinically meaningful subtypes. A follow-up question was whether the subtypes would respond differently to a specialist intervention.
   Method Participants were public mental health clients referred to a specialist residential treatment programme in Victoria, Australia. Using an existing data set, cluster analysis was applied in order to identify subtypes based on various demographic, clinical and psychological variables. Post-treatment analyses were carried out to investigate change in self-harm, suicide attempts, depression and dissociation.
   Results Three subtypes were identified, namely: withdrawn-internalizing, severely disturbed-internalizing and anxious-externalizing. Furthermore, the subtypes responded differently to the treatment, with the withdrawn-internalizing subtype showing reduced levels of dissociation and the anxious-externalizing subtype responding by large reductions in levels of depression. The severely disturbed-internalizing subtype did not improve significantly on any of the outcome measures in this study.
   Discussion These findings suggest that subtypes can be identified amongst clients with BPD, and that the subtypes may be related to treatment outcomes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Bullying poses a threat to children's social-emotional functioning and their perceptions of school climate, yet few studies have examined different types of social-emotional and behavior problems presented by children involved in bullying, as a bully, victim, or bully/victim across multiple school levels. The current study used data from 24,345 elementary-, middle-, and high-school students to examine the association between frequent involvement in bullying and aggressive impulsivity. attitudes toward aggressive retaliation, internalizing symptoms, peer relations, and perceptions of school climate. Logistic regression analyses indicated that bully/victims were most likely to display internalizing symptoms, problems in peer relationships, and have poorer perceptions of the school environment. Both frequent bullies and bully/victims displayed aggressive-impulsive behavior and endorsed retaliatory attitudes. High-school students frequently involved in bullying tended to display the greatest risk for internalizing problems. but less risk for aggressive impulsivity. Developmental trends and implications for prevention and early intervention are discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A total of 1,116 school children and 128 clinical children, aged 7-14, completed BYI. Internal consistency coefficients were high. Most test-retest correlations were > 0.70. A test-retest difference was found for BAI. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the five factor structure of the instrument was justified. The BSCI, BAI and BDI discriminated moderately between the norming sample and the clinical group, and the latter group included more children who exceeded the 90th percentile of the norming sample. Diagnostic groups scored higher on relevant scales than norms. Only BSCI and BDI differentiated between diagnostic groups. The BYI showed acceptable internal consistency and test-retest stability, except for BAI. The BYI did not adequately differentiate between internalizing disorders.

AB This study sought to examine predictors of psychological symptoms and psychiatric service receipt among youth with HIV. Data were from the baseline assessment of Adolescent Impact, a study of 13-21-year-old youth with HIV in three US cities. Between August 2003 and February 2005, participants completed the age-appropriate youth or adult self-report symptom checklists (Achenbach system of empirically based assessment) and reported their psychiatric treatment history. Psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted from medical records. The 164 participating youth living with HIV were Black (81%), female (52%), Heterosexually identified (62%), and perinatally HIV-infected (60%). Thirty-one percentage reported levels of internalizing (i.e., self-focused/ emotional), externalizing (i.e., outwardly focused/behavioral), or overall symptoms consistent with clinical psychopathology. In multivariate analyses, questioning one's sexual identity was associated with greater internalizing problems, whereas identifying as Bisexual was associated with greater externalizing problems (p < 0.05). Symptoms were not associated with HIV transmission group. Participants with >= 1 composite score within the clinical range were more likely to have received >= 1 psychiatric service (Odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 5.13) and a psychiatric diagnosis in the past year (OR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.27). However, 27% with clinically elevated scores had never received psychiatric care. Results suggest that among youth with HIV, those who identify as Bisexual or Questioning are at greatest risk for emotional and behavioral problems. Despite available mental health services, some youth with HIV are not receiving needed mental health care. Enhanced evaluation, referral and mental health service linkage is needed for these high-risk youth.

AB Little information is available on alcohol use in children up to age 10, although rates appear to be low. This age-group is not without risk, however. In fact, numerous nonspecific and specific risk factors for subsequent alcohol use are prevalent in childhood. Alcohol-nonspecific risk factors include externalizing and internalizing behaviors, as well as environmental and social factors (e.g., stress, physical abuse, or other aspects of social interaction). Nonspecific childhood factors (i.e., predictors) are being identified to target specific population subgroups for preventive interventions. These efforts have identified a variety of predictors of drinking onset during childhood or early adolescence that predict adolescent and young-adult problem drinking, as well as adult alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. Alcohol-specific risk factors also are being identified, including children's beliefs and expectancies about alcohol, as well as childhood social contexts (e.g., modeling of alcohol use by parents, portrayal of alcohol use in the mass media, and growing up in a family with an alcoholic family member). Together, these specific and nonspecific influences play a heavy role in determining a child risk of or resilience to later alcohol use and related problems.

AB Psychiatric and substance use disorders, separately or combined, are frequent in adolescence. Brief, psychometrically sound screening tools are needed to identify those at-risk. The Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GAIN-SS) is a brief, inexpensive screener that was derived from the well researched full GAIN interview. However, its validity has not been independently investigated based on independent validated screening instruments in an adolescent clinical population. In this project, the internal consistency, validity, and optimal screening cutoff scores were examined in 95 adolescents, most of whom were receiving treatment, and suffered from internalizing (52%; n = 49), externalizing (66%, n = 63), and co-occurring substance use disorders (55%, n = 56). Results indicated adequate internal consistency and overall and subscale construct validity. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses revealed that the GSS substance use disorder subscale had adequate sensitivity (88%) and specificity (89%). Psychiatric disorder subscales performed less well. The discussion focuses on the strengths and potential weaknesses of use of the GSS and its potential utility in other populations.

AB Service utilization patterns among children with severe emotional and/or behavioral disturbances are described for 89 children and families, interviewed at two time points across a 6-month period. Children received a greater number of individual therapy sessions than family therapy sessions, and children significantly decreased their levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Family therapy was associated with decreases in internalizing behaviors when children reported outcomes. Individual therapy was not associated with changes in either internalizing or externalizing behaviors regardless of reporter. Symptom severity did not dictate whether children were provided individual or family therapy. Recommendations for individualized treatment plans are offered.

AB This review examines the development and etiology of disruptive behavior [symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and psychopathic features] and delinquency (particularly violence). We address selected key developmental issues, including (a) to what extent negative emotional ODD symptoms are associated with later internalizing disorders, (b) whether psychopathic features provide added predictive utility beyond traditional disruptive behaviors, and (c) the role of oppositional behavior and conduct problems in the development of violence. This review also focuses on the causes of ODD, CD, psychopathic features, and delinquency and explores the extent to which the causes of disruptive and delinquent behavior are the same. We examine the degree to which risk and promotive factors change with age and whether promotive factors buffer the impact of risk factors. Finally, we explore the question of whether there are developmental shifts in children's exposure to risk and promotive factors.

AB Socially withdrawn children frequently refrain from social activities in the presence of peers. The lack of social interaction in childhood may result from a variety of causes, including social fear and anxiety or a preference for solitude. From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at risk for a wide range of negative adjustment outcomes, including socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., anxiety, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., rejection, victimization, poor friendship quality), and school difficulties (e.g., poor-quality teacher-child relationships, academic difficulties, school avoidance). The goals of the current review are to (a) provide some definitional, theoretical, and methodological clarity to the complex array of terms and constructs previously employed in the study of social withdrawal; (b) examine the predictors, correlates, and consequences of child and early-adolescent social withdrawal; and (c) present a developmental framework describing pathways to and from social withdrawal in childhood.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the association between the occurrence of stressful life events and internalizing and externalizing problems, and to analyze longitudinally buffering effects of supportive family relationships. To this end, 100 Spanish adolescents were studied twice, when they were in mid-adolescence (15-16 years) and two years later. They completed questionnaires regarding stressful life events, family relationships, and adolescent adjustment. Results showed that high quality parent-adolescent relationships protected boys and girls against the negative consequences of stressful life events on externalizing, but not internalizing, symptoms. The adolescents who enjoyed good relationships with their parents in mid-adolescence did not increase their externalizing problems in late adolescence as consequence of the occurrence of stressful events. However, these stressors did lead to an increase in the number of externalizing problems when the family relationships were of a middle or low quality. These results highlight the important role that supportive family relationships play in the behavioral adjustment of adolescents, protecting them against some negative consequences of stressful life events, and suggest the relevance of supporting parents through resources such as parent education in order to help them to improve their relationships with their adolescents.

AB Most attachment theorists assume that parenting style is the central mechanism linking the quality of parents' attachment with their parents and adaptation in their children. Outside the attachment tradition, family risk models assume that many family factors affect children's adaptation, chief among them being couple relationship quality. The present study tests an integrated model that considers both theoretical and empirical links between attachment theory and family risk research. Seventy-three fathers and mothers whose first child was about to make the transition to elementary school were administered the Adult Attachment Interview and a new Couple Attachment Interview. The parents were also observed in separate visits during kindergarten year in interaction with each other and with their child. At the end of first grade, we obtained children's academic achievement test results and teachers' checklist observations of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Structural equations revealed that a family risk model that includes information from working models of attachment and observations of couple interaction predicts substantial variation in children's adaptation to elementary school.

AB The present study examined three sets of questions about secure base provision in the context of the family, including (1) relations between inter-parental perceptions of secure base provision and parents' adult romantic attachment and marital satisfaction, (2) interrelations among family members' perception of secure base provision, and (3) links between both adolescents' and parents' perceptions of secure base provision and adolescent symptoms. Participants were 189 adolescents from two-parent families (mean age=17 years; 118 girls) and their parents. We found partial support for theorized links between perceptions of spousal secure base provision and spousal romantic attachment, as well as full support for expected associations between secure base provision and marital satisfaction. Family members' perceptions of secure base provision were linked in theoretically expected ways: mothers' perceptions of her spouse as a secure base were positively related to their adolescents' perceptions of the mother as a secure base and the father as a secure base. Further, adolescents tended to agree with mothers about perceptions of the husband/father and with fathers about the wife/mother as a secure base. Finally, adolescents' perceptions of parents as a secure base were associated with lower adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Inter-parental perceptions of secure base provision were not linked to adolescent symptoms.

ID ADULT ATTACHMENT; CHILDHOOD
AB An intergenerational study examined mothers' insecure attachment style using the Attachment Style Interview (ASI; Bifulco et al., 2002a) in relation to her history of partner relationships, her parenting competence, and depression or anxiety disorder in her offspring. The sample comprised 146 high-risk, mother-adolescent offspring pairs in London, who were recruited on the basis of the mothers' psychosocial vulnerability for depression. Retrospective, biographical, and clinical interviews were undertaken independently with mother and offspring. A path model was developed, which showed that mothers' insecure attachment style had no direct link to either recalled child neglect/abuse or currently assessed disorder in their adolescent and young adult offspring. The connections appeared to be indirect, through the quality of relationships in the family system: mothers' insecure attachment and their partners' problem behavior accounted for variance in mothers' incompetent parenting as rated by interviewers. These variables predicted her neglect/abuse of the child, which was the only variable directly associated with internalizing disorder in her offspring. Mother's lifetime depression did not add to the model. It is argued that an ecological approach (emphasizing social adversity and different role domains) and a lifespan approach (emphasizing a history of adverse relationships a different life stages) is important in understanding the mechanisms by which parental insecure attachment style influences transmission of risk to the next generation.

AB More than 200 adult attachment representation studies, presenting more than 10,500 Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, Main, 1985) classifications, have been conducted in the past 25 years. In a series of analyses on the distributions of the AAI classifications in various cultural and age groups, fathers, and high-risk and clinical samples, we used the distribution of the combined samples of North American non-clinical mothers (23% dismissing, 58% secure, 19% preoccupied attachment representations, and 18% additionally coded for unresolved loss or other trauma) to examine deviations from this normative pattern, through multinomial tests and analyses of correspondence. The analyses were restricted to AAI classifications coded according to the Main, Goldwyn, and Hesse (2003) system. We did not find gender differences in the use of dismissing versus preoccupied attachment strategies, and the AAI distributions were largely independent of language and country of origin. Clinical subjects showed more insecure and unresolved attachment representations than the norm groups. Disorders with an internalizing dimension (e.g., borderline personality disorders) were associated with more preoccupied and unresolved attachments, whereas disorders with an externalizing dimension (e.g., antisocial personality disorders) displayed more dismissing as well as preoccupied attachments. Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved. In order to find more reliable associations with clinical symptoms and disorders, future AAI studies may make more fruitful use of continuous AAI scales in addition to the conventionally used categorical classifications.

AB Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy's (1985) conceptualizations of disorganization in infancy and controlling behavior in preschool forged new directions in attachment research. However, there currently is no valid coding system for behavioral manifestations of attachment after 7 years of age. The present study presents the validity of an instrument for coding both disorganized and role-reversed behavior from ages 7 to 9; the Middle Childhood Disorganization and Control (MCDC) scales. In the present study, 43 mother-child dyads at socio-economic risk, followed from infancy, were assessed on the MCDC at age 8. Analyses revealed that children with higher combined punitive/disorganized scores were significantly more likely to: (1) come from families referred for clinical home visiting because of concerns about the quality of the parent-infant relationships; (2) have higher scores for disorganization in infancy if from the clinically-referred subgroup; (3) are more likely to show disorganized representations; and (4) show higher externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Higher caregiving MCDC scores were associated with more maternal withdrawal behavior in infancy. In conclusion, the present study provided the first validity data for an observational measure of disorganization and control in middle childhood.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of specialized team-based early intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) with treatment as usual. Method: In a quasi-experimental design, 32 outpatients who received historical treatment as usual (H-TAU) were compared with 78 participants from a recently published randomized controlled trial of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT; n = 41) versus manualized good clinical care (GCC; n = 37), conducted in a specialized early intervention service for BPD (the Helping Young People Early (HYPE) programme). All participants were 15-18-year-old outpatients who fulfilled 2-9 DSM-IV BPD criteria. It was predicted that, compared with H-TAU, HYPE + GCC and HYPE + CAT would show greater reductions in psychopathology and parasuicidal behaviour and greater improvement in global functioning over 24months. Results: At 24month follow up: (i) HYPE + CAT had lower standardized levels of, and a significantly faster standardized rate of improvement in, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, compared with H-TAU; and (ii) HYPE + GCC had lower standardized levels of internalizing psychopathology and a faster rate of improvement in global functioning than H-TAU. HYPE + CAT yielded the greatest median improvement on the four continuous outcome measures over 24months. No adverse effects were shown with any of the treatments. Conclusions: Specialized early intervention for subsyndromal or full-syndrome BPD is more effective than TAU, with HYPE + CAT being the most effective intervention. Reform of existing services using the HYPE model might yield substantial improvements in patient outcomes.

AB Latent class factor analysis allows for the estimation of a dimensional construct such as psychopathy through factor analysis while also examining the heterogeneity of the sample. We report the results of a latent class factor analysis examining the psychometric structure of a widely used measure of psychopathy, as well as internalizing (i.e. anxiety) and externalizing indices, among diversion program youths involved in an intervention study. The results indicated that four subgroups of adolescents existed in the data: one with high psychopathic features and externalizing problems, but low anxiety; one with moderately high affective and behavioral psychopathic features and externalizing problems, but low anxiety; one with moderately high interpersonal and behavioral psychopathic features, externalizing problems, and anxiety; and one with very low psychopathy scores, anxiety, and externalizing problems. The validity of these subgroups was assessed comparing prior family problems, substance use, and offending measures, and one-year follow-up measures of recidivism, detention days, substance use, and program completion. This study offers partial support for the existence of psychopathy subgroups and has implications for future studies of psychopathy typologics. In addition, this study employed a methodology for classification that permits consideration of the dimensional nature of a construct, and as such has implications for a variety of research areas.

AB Data from 249 children referred to a pediatric sleep clinic were analyzed. The first question of interest examined whether an International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Second Edition (ICSD-2)-based diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) would more strongly associate with parental perceptions of daytime attention and behavior problems in their child. The second question was whether the outcome would differ based on PLMD diagnostic criteria-that is, previously used criteria to define PLMD (Periodic Limb Movement Index [PLMI] < 5 per hour vs. PLMI >= 5 per hour only) versus the ICSD-2 criteria. Parents of children with ICSD-2-defined PLMD perceived more problems with daytime behavior and attention, more symptoms of internalizing and externalizing, longer sleep latency, and more difficulty falling back to sleep than did parents of children with SDB. Most effects were lost when groups were defined by PLMI alone. The PLMI had acceptable sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosing PLMD.

AB Objective: Recent research suggests that binge eating is a common experience in youth. However, it remains largely unknown how children's binge eating presents in everyday life and which psychological factors serve to maintain this binge eating.
   Methods: Children aged 8-13 years with binge eating (n = 59), defined as at least one episode of loss of control (LOC) over eating within the past three months, and 59 matched children without LOC history were recruited from the community. Following a combined random- and event-sampling protocol, children were interviewed about their day-to-day eating behavior, mood, and eating disorder-specific cognitions using child-specific cell phones during a 4-day assessment period in their natural environment.
   Results: LOC episodes led to a significantly greater intake of energy, particularly from carbohydrates, than regular meals of children with and without LOC eating. While LOC episodes were preceded and followed by cognitions about food/eating and body image, there was minimal evidence that negative mood states were antecedents of LOC eating.
   Conclusions: The results provide support for the construct validity of LOC eating in children. Maintenance theories of binge eating for adults apply to children regarding eating disorder-specific cognitions, but the association with affect regulation difficulties requires further investigation.

The Virtual Classroom included simulated real-world auditory and visual distracters. Parent ratings of attention, hyperactivity, internalizing problems, and adaptive skills on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Monitor for ADHD confirmed that the ADHD children had more problems in these areas than controls. The difference between the ADHD group (who performed worse) and the control group approached significance (p = .05; adjusted p = .02) in the Virtual Classroom presentation, and the classification rate of the Virtual Classroom was better than when the standard CPT was used (87.5% versus 68.8%). Children with ADHD were more affected by distractions in the VR classroom than those without ADHD. Results are discussed in relation to distractibility in ADHD.

AB The aim of this study was to explore psychopathological and behavior impairments in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) by focusing on individual differences rather than group tendencies. Parent/Guardian ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were analyzed in order to examine the influence of gender, chronological age, and cognitive abilities on psychopathological impairment within WBS. In line with predictions, and consistent with cognitive heterogeneity in WBS, psychopathological and behavioral abnormalities were variable, with gender and specific cognitive abilities making significant and independent contributions to this variance. For gender, females were significantly more likely than males with WBS to display difficulties with externalizing problems. For specific cognitive abilities, those cognitive functions characteristic of the classic WBS cognitive profile (a strength in verbal skills and a weakness in spatial skills) related to significantly greater internalizing difficulties. Future studies should explore underlying genetic and neurological differences in individuals with WBS in order to help explain the variability in psychopathological and cognitive functions.

AB This pilot study assessed the quality of life and psychosocial functioning of pediatric patients with Barth Syndrome. Thirty-four boys with Barth Syndrome and 22 healthy male controls were administered a measure of verbal ability and completed measures of quality of life, loneliness, perceived peer support, and sibling relationship quality. Parents completed measures of parental distress, parenting stress, child academic functioning, child adaptive behavior, and child emotional and behavioral functioning. Quality of life ratings were consistently lower in youth with Barth Syndrome relative to both healthy controls and a previously reported sample of youth with cardiac disease. Compared to healthy controls, children with Barth Syndrome were rated as having more internalizing and externalizing symptoms, social problems, loneliness, and lower independent functioning. Parents of boys with Barth Syndrome reported greater distress and parenting stress relative to healthy controls. In addition, parents reported a significant need for academic accommodations, given their son's illness and associated impairments. Boys with Barth Syndrome and their parents appear to be affected by the presence of the illness in numerous ways. Results suggest the need for interventions aimed at helping children and families cope with illness-related stressors to enhance quality of life and overall functioning.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the associations between parent- and child-reported illness uncertainty and psychosocial functioning among solid organ transplant recipients. Youths who received liver or kidney transplantations and their caregivers completed measures of illness uncertainty, youth depressive symptoms, youth anxiety, and youth psychosocial functioning. Regression analyses indicated that youth-reported uncertainty was associated with both youth-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety and with parent-reported adaptive functioning and behavioral functioning. Parent-reported uncertainty was associated with parent-reported overall behavioral functioning, adaptive functioning, and internalizing problems. Results extend previous findings regarding illness uncertainty, and suggest that educational interventions to reduce uncertainty might be of benefit to families.

AB Although much has been written about the utility of applying Sameroff and Chandler's transactional perspective to the study of child psychopathology, relatively few researchers have used such in approach to trace the emergence of child problem behavior from infancy to adolescence. Using a sample of 289 male toddlers from predominantly low-income families. the Current study examined associations between various forms of early child disruptive behavior, subsequent trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms over the Course of 8 years, and adolescent problem behavior. Results indicated that early child noncompliance was the most robust predictor of more chronic and elevated trajectories of maternal depression, which in turn discriminated teacher and Youth reports of adolescent antisocial behavior but not internalizing symptoms. The findings were consistent with transactional perspectives of developmental psychopathology that have emphasized the dynamic interplay between child and parent characteristics.

AB Meta-analytic techniques Were used to estimate the effects of exposure to community violence on mental health Outcomes across 114 studies. Community violence had its strongest effects on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and externalizing problems and smallest impact on other internalizing symptoms, Victimization by community violence most predicted symptomatology compared to witnessing or hearing about community violence. Witnessing community violence had a greater effect than hearing about violence on externalizing problems, but both types of exposure had an equal impact on other internalizing problems. PTSD symptoms were equally predicted by victimization, witnessing, or hearing about community violence. Compared to children, adolescents reported a stronger relationship between externalizing behaviors and exposure, whereas children exhibited greater internalizing problems than did adolescents.

AB The prospective relation of maternal emotion philosophy to children's emotion understanding and regulation and positive and negative adjustment was investigated. Sixty-nine African American youth (50% male; M age = 11.29 years) and their maternal caregivers living in high violence areas of a midsized city participated in this interview study. Caregivers' meta-emotion philosophy predicted child emotion understanding and emotion regulation, which also were associated with Time 1. grades, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and social skills after controlling for Time 1 adjustment. Emotional understanding mediated the relationship between caregivers' emotional socialization and boys' internalizing behaviors and between caregivers' emotional socialization and girls' social skills. In addition, emotion regulation mediated the relationships between emotional socialization and all four outcomes for boys. Implications for future work on emotion socialization and clinical intervention, particularly related to emotion regulation, ate discussed.

AB The main objectives of this study were to prospectively examine the relationship between externalizing (substance use and delinquency) and internalizing (depression and anxiety) dimensions and academic achievement (grades and classroom adjustment), as well as continuity over time in these domains, within a sample of wealthy adolescents followed from 10th to 12th grades (n = 256). In both parts of the study, cluster analyses were used to group participants at 10th grade and then group differences were evaluated on adjustment Outcomes over time. In Part 1, problem behavior Clusters revealed differences on academic indices with the two marijuana Using groups-marijuana users and multiproblem youth-exhibiting the worst academic outcomes at all three waves. For Part 2. the two lowest achieving groups reported the highest distress across all externalizing dimensions over time. Stability across the three waves was found for both personal and academic competence as well as the associations between these two domains. Results are discussed in relation to intervention efforts targeting wealthy students at risk.

AB Research Findings: The present longitudinal study investigated whether a range of social-emotional difficulties in early childhood predict the development of depressive symptoms in middle childhood. Participants were 56 children and their teachers. Teachers' reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors were obtained during preschool, and children's displays of negative affect were observed through classroom videotapes in preschool. Children's self-reports of depressive symptoms were collected approximately three and a half years later. Teachers' ratings of social problems and atypical behaviors were positively associated with later depressive symptoms. Teachers' ratings of rule breaking and observed negative affect in preschool were stronger predictors of later depressive symptoms in girls than in boys. Findings point to social non-conformity as an important feature in the developmental course of depressive symptoms. Results lend support to a developmental psychopathology framework, showing change over time across types of social-emotional difficulties in gender-specific directions. Practice or Policy: Findings underscore the role that preschool teachers and classroom observation could play in identifying early risk for depressive symptoms. Results suggest the possible utility of early screening programs for at-risk preschool-aged children. Moreover, results could inform school-based intervention or prevention programs targeting internalizing symptoms, an under-recognized area of children's mental health.

AB Research Findings: This study examined the stability of preschoolers' peer play behavior across the school year and the relations between emotion regulation, receptive vocabulary, and the trajectory of social competence deficits. Participants were 331 preschool children attending Head Start; they were primarily African American and from a low-SES background. Peer play behavior was moderately stable from fall to spring. Analyses revealed that emotional lability in the fall was associated with consistently maladaptive and declining social competence. Furthermore, children who exhibited stable maladaptive behavior had lower receptive language skills and emotion regulation in the fall than children who exhibited consistently adaptive behavior. Preschool children with comorbid externalizing and internalizing behaviors during peer play were at the greatest risk for consistent peer play difficulties or declining social competence over the course of the year compared to their peers. Practice: The present study informs practices for identifying at-risk preschoolers shortly after entry into an early education experience. Moreover, the findings suggest that without effective interventions, those at-risk children are likely to exhibit consistently poor social competence over time. Implications for the use of early intervention and prevention targeting specific behavioral and peer problems are discussed.

AB This study examined interpersonal competence configurations in a sample of 315 fifth-grade students ( 170 girls and 145 boys) from 8 elementary schools in the Appalachian region. Teachers completed the Interpersonal Competence Scale Teacher (ICS-T) for each student. The ICS-T consists of 18 7-point Likert scales to assess academic achievement, aggression, internalizing behavior, popularity, social skills, and athletic ability/attractiveness. Teachers also completed scales pertaining to social adaptation. Students completed peer behavioral assessments, sociometric surveys, and social network surveys. Nearly 40% of students were in high-competence configurations characterized by high teacher ratings on academic, behavioral, and social adjustment. These configurations were associated with high end-of-year grades and standardized achievement test scores and with positive peer relationships. In contrast, 16% of girls and 27% of boys were in high-risk configurations characterized by high teacher ratings of academic, behavioral, and social difficulties. These configurations were associated with low end-of-year grades and standardized test scores and with social and behavioral difficulties that are predictive of later adjustment problems. We also identified moderate-risk configurations that tended to fall between high-competence and high-risk configurations in terms of their relation to academic achievement and peer relations. Implications for interventions are discussed.

AB Questionnaire ratings were used to obtain child, mother, and father ratings on three major parenting dimensions (behavioral control, psychological control, and support) in a sample of 600 children aged 8-to-10 years old. Results indicated that mothers, fathers, and children were able to reliably differentiate between the three parenting dimensions by means of questionnaire ratings. Convergent and discriminant validity were tested by analyzing amultitrait-multimethod matrix via confirmatory factor analysis. Convergence between mothers and fathers was satisfactory, while convergence between child and parents was significant, but fairly low. Discriminant validity was sufficiently supported, whereas informant-specific error was related to both child and father ratings. Criterion validity of the parenting dimension with regard to child behavior was established. Overall, behavioral control and support were positively associated with child prosocial behavior, while psychological control was positively correlated with child conduct problems, and to a lesser extent with child internalizing problems. The nature and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The study examined the reliability and validity of the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) and the Childhood Psychopathy Scale (CPS) in a community sample of 182 Flemish adolescents in the age range of 9 to 19 years. Data were gathered by means of parent, teacher, and self-report, and the factor structure was examined by means of confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistencies of the resulting scales and associations with measures of disruptive behavior disorders and internalizing problem behaviors were explored. Results confirmed the underlying a priori structure of both APSD and CPS.

AB The present study included observational and self-report measures to examine associations among parental stress, parental behaviour, child behaviour, and children's theory of mind and emotion understanding. Eighty-three parents and their 3- to 5-year-old children participated. Parents completed measures of parental stress, parenting (laxness, overreactivity), and child behaviour (internalizing, externalizing); children completed language, theory of mind, and emotion understanding measures. Parent-child interactions also were observed (N=47). Laxness and parenting stress predicted children's theory of mind performance and parental usage of imitative gestures and vocalizations accounted for unique variance in emotion understanding. Associations also were found between child behaviour and emotion understanding. Results provide support for direct and indirect associations between parent-child interactions and early social-cognitive development. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Despite growing research results indicating that shyness is a risk factor for psychosocial maladjustment in childhood, less is known about the conceptual mechanisms that may underlie these associations. The purpose of the current study was to explore links between self-reported shyness, coping strategies and social functioning in middle childhood. As well, we sought to examine the reliance on internalizing coping strategies as a potential mediator of the link between shyness and social functioning. Participants were 355 children aged 9 to 11 years who completed measures of shyness, loneliness, positive and negative affect, social anxiety, self-concept, well-being, and coping strategies. Results indicated that shyness was associated with greater internalizing difficulties and lower wellbeing. Moreover, internalizing coping was found to partially mediate the relation between shyness and certain indices of internalizing problems. These results suggest a conceptual pathway, where an over-reliance on internalizing coping may partially explain why shy children experience internalizing difficulties in middle childhood.

AB Objective. This study aimed to investigate whether psychological disorders and symptom severity hamper weight loss in obese adolescents and explored the effect of evidence-based adolescent obesity treatment on psychological disorders and symptom severity. Method. Participants were 66 adolescents admitted for a 10-month obesity treatment programme. At the start of treatment both clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires were administered. Weight loss was registered at several time points. Half of the sample was invited to complete questionnaires and be interviewed once again at the end of the programme. Results. Baseline degree of overweight was the strongest predictor of weight loss. The presence of at least one psychological disorder appeared a negative predictor of weight loss after four months. At post-test, a decrease in eating, shape and weight concern and binge eating episodes was demonstrated. A similar trend was found for internalizing symptoms. All eating disorders resolved, but a substantial number of adolescents still suffered from psychological disorders at the end of treatment. Conclusion. During inpatient obesity treatment, youngsters who are more severely obese lose most weight. In girls and in adolescents suffering from psychological disorders, long-term care should be the aim to prevent an experience of failure. From a psychological health perspective, the inclusion of psychotherapy during inpatient obesity treatment for adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders is worth considering. All together, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of adopting both a medical and a psychological perspective on obesity (treatment) in youth.

AB Previous studies have repeatedly found that aggression causes various internalizing and externalizing problems. Despite the robust relationship, exactly how aggression causes these problems remains unclear, although it is plausible to postulate that this occurs both directly and indirectly (via other behavioural factors). One possible indirect factor might be the aggravation of peer relations. The poor peer relations of aggressive children could make them isolated psychologically or physically from peers, which in turn might result in depressive or disruptive problems. This study examined the relationships between three types of aggression and peer relations in Japanese elementary school children. The three aggression types comprised reactive-expressive (i.e., verbal and physical aggression), reactive-inexpressive (e.g., hostility), and proactive-relational aggression (i.e., aggression that can break human relationships, for instance, by circulating malicious rumours). Participants were 1581 children in grades 4 to 6 (752 boys and 829 girls), all of whom completed the Proactive-Reactive Aggression Questionnaire for Children to measure three types of aggression and the Peer Relation Questionnaire to measure peer relations (mutual understanding, self-disclosure, and similarity of taste) and number of friends. Hierarchical regression analyses of the data showed that higher scores of relational aggression were significantly associated with higher scores of all of the peer relations and the number of friends, and that higher scores of inexpressive aggression were significantly associated with lower scores of all except for self-disclosure in the peer relations. These findings suggest that among the three types of aggression, relational aggression leads to the best friendship in both dyadic relations and the number of friends, whereas inexpressive aggression to the poorest friendship. The implications of these findings with respect to internalizing and externalizing problem behaviours for aggressive children are discussed.

AB Research has demonstrated a lack of agreement between parent and child reports across a range of parent and child variables. These discrepancies hinder the interpretation of research findings as well as diagnostic and treatment decisions in clinical practice. The current study examined the hypothesis that discrepancies between parent and child reports of parenting can be useful as predictors of future child outcomes. The participants included 559 early adolescents and their primary caregivers (79% African American, 21% Caucasian). Both respondents provided information on parental nurturance, harsh discipline and inconsistent discipline. A year later, information of adolescents' internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social competence was collected. Structural equation modeling revealed that parent-child discrepancies in parenting reports could be explained by a latent factor which was a significant predictor of child internalizing problems and social competence, but not of externalizing problems, after adjusting for initial internalizing and externalizing problems. The three models applied across gender and ethnicity.

AB This article examined the effects of maternal depression during the postpartum period (Time 1) on the later behavior problems of toddlers (Time 3) and tested if this relationship was moderated by paternal psychopathology during toddlers' lives and/or mediated by maternal parenting behavior observed during mother-child interaction (Time 2). Of the 101 mothers who participated in this longitudinal study with their toddlers, 51 had never experienced an episode of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 50 had experienced an episode of MDD during the first 18 months of their toddlers' lives. Maternal depression at Time 1 was significantly associated with toddlers' externalizing and internalizing behavior problems only when paternal psychopathology was present. As predicted, maternal negativity at Time 2 was found to mediate the relationship between maternal depression at Time 1 and toddlers' externalizing behavior problems at Time 3.

AB Employing data from 140 prospectively followed girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 88 age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls, we adopted a person-centered analytic approach to assess rates of adolescent positive adjustment (PA) across six domains: ADHD symptoms, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, social skills, peer acceptance, and school achievement. During adolescence, between 19.8% and 61.1% of the girls with childhood ADHD met criteria for PA when the six domains were considered independently. A total of 16.4% of the ADHD sample showed PA in at least five of six domains, versus 86.4% of the comparison girls. Results were similar when PA was examined excluding the ADHD symptom domain. Most girls did not grow out of the symptoms and impairments related to their ADHD.

AB This study extends the existing adult literature on insecure attachment as a predictor of depression and anxiety by examining these pathways in a sample of adolescents. In addition, dysfunctional attitudes and low self-esteem were tested as mediators of the association between insecure attachment and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Youth (N = 350; 6th-10th graders) completed self-report measures of attachment, dysfunctional attitudes, self-esteem, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a 4-wave prospective study. Results indicate that anxious and avoidant attachment each predicted changes in both depression and anxiety (after controlling for initial symptom levels). The association between anxious attachment, but not avoidant attachment, and later internalizing symptoms was mediated by dysfunctional attitudes and low self-esteem. Effects remained even after controlling for initial co-occurring symptoms.

AB Information on history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is critical in risk assessment, and multi-informant assessment has been recommended. Despite this, relatively little is known about parent-adolescent agreement regarding adolescent suicidality. To examine the extent and predictors of such agreement, 448 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents and their parents were administered structured interviews assessing suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts and completed measures of youth internalizing and externalizing behaviors, perceived family social support, and parental distress and psychopathology. Adolescents reported significantly more suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts than parents. Parental history of depression and adolescent perceived family support were associated with significantly greater agreement about suicidality. History of multiple suicide attempts was associated with greater disagreement about suicidality.

AB Latino youth appear to be at higher risk for depression relative to youth from other ethnic groups. This study assessed the relationship between nativity and several forms of internalizing distress among Mexican American middle school students as well as sociocultural factors that may help explain this relationship. Immigrant Mexican American youth (n = 78) reported significantly higher social anxiety and loneliness than U.S.-born Mexican American youth (n = 83). Acculturation stress and English proficiency were identified as significant mediators of these nativity differences. Although internalizing problems and depression symptoms did not vary across nativity groups, both were related to lower affiliative obedience. The findings point to cultural socialization values and contextual influences as important variables in the mental health of youth in immigrant families.

AB African American youthw from single mother homes are at greater risk for internalizing and externalizing problems relative to their peers from two-parent homes. Although the predominance of psychosocial research on these youth has focused on maternal parenting and mother-child relationship quality, far less attention has been devoted to the quality of the relationships that youth have with nonmarital coparents, or other adults and family members who assist African American single mothers with childrearing. This study examined the contribution of the youth-coparent relationship to psychosocial adjustment among African American youth from single mother families (n=141). Findings revealed that maternal parenting and youth-coparent relationship quality interacted to predict both youth internalizing and externalizing problems. Specifically, greater youth-coparent relationship quality enhanced the protective role of maternal positive parenting. Findings suggest the potential role of broader familial and social contexts for enhancing the protective effects of positive parenting.

AB This study investigated psychosocial mechanisms that may account for sex differences in internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety during adolescence using data from a prospective, multiwave study with a sample of early and middle adolescents (N = 350, 6th to 10th graders; 57% female). Girls showed higher initial levels of only depressive symptoms, not anxious arousal, and increasing trajectories of depressive and anxious arousal symptoms over time compared with boys after controlling for age. Initial levels of depressive symptoms were mediated by a Rumination x Stressors interaction as well as a Negative Cognitive Style x Stressors interaction. The Negative Cognitive Style x Stressors interaction and Rumination x Stressors interaction partially accounted for girls' increasing trajectories of depressive and anxious arousal symptoms over time.

AB Four putative mediators underlying gender differences in youths' recovery from bereavement-related internalizing problems were examined in a sample (N = 109; age range = 8-16 years at the initial assessment) of parentally bereaved youth: intrusive thoughts about grief, postdeath stressors, negative appraisals of postdeath stressors, and fear of abandonment. A three-wave parallel process longitudinal growth model design was employed. Changes in internalizing problems and mediators were measured as a function of months since the death. Girls showed stability in depression symptoms and a slight rise in anxiety symptoms; boys' trajectories of symptoms of anxiety and depression declined. Girls' higher initial levels of postdeath stressors, threat appraisals and fear of abandonment mediated their higher level of internalizing problems 14 months later. Girls' higher initial fear of abandonment also mediated additional growth in anxiety relative to boys.

AB An accumulating body of literature has shown a link between early pubertal maturation and internalizing problems, particularly among girls. Our knowledge is, however, limited with regard to what accounts for this association. Based on a hypothesis that early maturing girls have heightened stress sensitivity that increases the risk of internalizing problems, the present investigation examined the roles of pubertal timing and salivary cortisol reactivity to interpersonal stressors in adolescents' internalizing problems. Results from 110 boys and 106 girls (ages 11-16) indicated that early maturing adolescents had increased internalizing symptoms. Early maturing girls' higher levels of internalizing problems were at least partially attributed to their heightened sensitivity to interpersonal stress. Finally, girls' cortisol reactivity to interpersonal challenge was more strongly associated with internalizing problems than boys' reactivity.

AB We investigated whether differences in positive and negative emotional reactivity could be found in depressed preschoolers and preschoolers at risk for later internalizing symptoms relative to nondepressed/low risk comparison groups. Observational measures of emotional reactivity, used to derive a score of the balance between anger and sadness, were obtained and analyzed in independent samples. One study utilized cross-sectional data from preschoolers (M age = 4.6 years) with a current depressive syndrome and two nondepressed comparison groups. The other study utilized longitudinal data that assessed emotional reactivity at preschool age (M age = 4.5 years) and later mental health symptoms during the transition to primary school, allowing a retrospective determination of risk. Depressed and at-risk boys displayed more anger than sadness in contrast to girls in the same groups and in contrast to no disorder/low-risk controls. This finding was detected in depressed and "at risk for internalizing" boys who were not comorbid for externalizing problems.

AB The prevalence of children's violence exposure, particularly among ethnic minorities living in urban areas, is troubling. Gender differences in the rates and effects of violence exposure on behavior have been found for older children, and the current study extends this research to preschool-age children. We draw on data collected from a sample of 3- to 5-year-olds born to 230 adolescent African American mothers living in Washington, DC. Girls and boys were exposed to comparable levels of witnessed and directly experienced violence. In contrast to findings from studies of older children, preschool-age boys' and girls' externalizing and internalizing behavior were comparably associated with directly experienced and witnessed violence. These findings highlight the importance of further developmental research to differentiate the effects of violence exposure as children grow older.

AB Two studies describe the development of a comprehensive, vignette-based measure of social information processing (SIP) particularly relevant for children with internalizing problems. Study 1 (N = 219 3rd-6th graders) describes the creation of the Children's Evaluation of Everyday Social Encounters Questionnaire (ChEESE-Q) and evidence for its reliability and validity, including internal structure and relation of SIP variables to depressive and anxious symptoms. Study 2 (N = 127 5th-6th graders) replicated the factor structure and validity evidence found in Study 1 and provided support for the reliability of alternate forms of the ChEESE-Q. Overall, results supported ChEESE-Q scores' moderate temporal stability and internal consistency in assessing SIP. Results also supported the presence of positive- and negative-valenced SIP patterns. Child internalizing symptoms were strongly related to a negative SIP style across both depression and anxiety, whereas only depressive symptoms were negatively associated with positive aspects of SIP.

Reliable individual differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms at mean age 5.3 and in their change to mean age 9.3 were observed, with significant correlations between depressive and anxiety symptoms at mean age 5.3 years and between their changes with age. Positive cross-lagged correlations from anxiety to depressive symptoms and negative cross-lagged correlations from depressive to anxiety symptoms were apparent in teachers' ratings at 6- to 12-month intervals. Developmental changes in teacher-rated child anxiety symptoms were robust predictors of child self-reported depressive symptoms at mean age 9.3 years. These results suggest assessment and interventions for emotional problems may be usefully implemented during childhood in school and peer social environments.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate loss and the experience of emotional distress through a series of three studies. In Study 1, results indicated that when controlling for the total number of traumas experienced, children with loss traumas did not differ significantly from children with other types of traumas in terms of the level of PTSD symptoms reported and diurnal cortisol levels. In Study 2, results indicated that youth with loss traumas had significantly higher parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms than control participants. In Study 3, we replicated and extended findings from Study 1 using an independent sample of non-clinic-referred youth. Findings are discussed in terms of how loss events may constitute a traumatic stressor in youth.

AB Objective To examine the association of psychiatric diagnoses and use of health care services in children with obesity-related health conditions. Method A retrospective, longitudinal design was used to examine Medicaid claims data. The data set consisted of 13,688 youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, or obesity. Results The presence of any type of psychiatric diagnosis was associated with higher health service use. In particular, the presence of an internalizing diagnosis was more consistently associated with higher service use than the presence of an externalizing diagnosis. Children with both an externalizing and internalizing disorder diagnosis had greater service use than children with a diagnosis in only one of these categories. Conclusions These data highlight a subgroup of children with obesity-related health conditions who are at greater risk for higher health service use, and the need for further research on the association between psychiatric diagnosis and health service use.

AB We explored the validity of the Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) facet scales of the adolescent version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-A; Butcher et al., 1992) in an adolescent inpatient psychiatric sample (N = 662) through a series of correlational analyses with self-report measures, therapist ratings, and chart review variables. Consistent with previous research with PSY-5 parent scales, externalizing symptoms were most clearly related to Hostility and Delinquent attitudes facet scales; internalizing symptoms were most clearly related to the presence of high Neuroticism facet scales and Low Drive/Expectations facet scales; and bizarre features and psychotic symptoms were most strongly related to both the Psychotic Experiences and Odd Mentations facet scales as well as the Low Drive/Expectations facet scales. These findings lend some support for the use of these facet scales as useful adjuncts to the PSY-5 parent scales.

AB This report provides evidence for the reliability, validity, and developmental course of the psychopathic personality traits (factors) of Fearless Dominance (FD) and Impulsive Antisociality (IA) as assessed by items from the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ; Patrick, Curtin, Tellegen, 2002). In Study 1, MPQ-based measures of FD and IA were strongly correlated with their corresponding composite scores from the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (Lilienfeld Widows, 2005). In Study 2, FD and IA had relatively distinct associations with measures of normal and maladaptive personality traits. In Study 3, FD and IA had substantial retest coefficients during the transition to adulthood, and both traits showed average declines with an especially substantial drop in IA. In Study 4, FD and IA were correlated with measures of internalizing and externalizing problems in ways consistent with previous research and theory. Collectively, these results provide important information about the assessment of FD and IA.

AB The purpose of this study was to expand the empirical basis for interpretation of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A; Butcher et al., 1992). Participants were 157 boys from a forensic setting and 197 girls from an acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Criterion variables were identified from sources such as psychiatrist report, parent report, and psychosocial history. Results generally support the construct validity of MMPI-A scales. Scales measuring internalizing problems were more highly correlated with criterion measures of internalizing behaviors than measures of externalizing behaviors, whereas scales measuring externalizing problems were more highly correlated with externalizing variables than with internalizing criteria. Implications of this study include an expanded empirical foundation for interpretation of the MMPI-A, greater understanding of the constructs it measures, and evidence supporting the generalizability of these constructs across settings.

AB This study examined the association between youths' triangulation in marital conflict and three aspects of their peer relations in 416 families during early adolescence. A 4-wave, longitudinal research design was used. As hypothesized, triangulation was associated negatively with perceived support from friends and positively with perceived peer rejection. Triangulation was a risk factor for both sons and daughters. Adolescent problem behavior did not mediate the significant association between triangulation and perceived friendship support. Adolescent problem behavior, particularly internalizing problems, completely me diated the association between triangulation and adolescents' perceptions of peer rejection, suggesting the important developmental role of adolescents' anxiety, depressive affect, and withdrawal. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of Bowen's multigenerational family systems theory and social learning principles.

AB We investigated longitudinal associations between alcohol-dependent fathers' 12-step treatment involvement and their children's internalizing and externalizing problems (N = 125, M-age = 9.8 +/- 3.1), testing the hypotheses that fathers' greater treatment involvement would benefit later child behavior and that this effect would be mediated by fathers' posttreatment behaviors. The initial association was established between fathers' treatment involvement and children's externalizing problems only, whereas Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results supported mediating hypotheses. Fathers' greater treatment involvement predicted children's lower externalizing problems 12 months later, and fathers' posttreatment behaviors mediated this association: Greater treatment involvement predicted greater posttreatment Alcoholics Anonymous attendance, which in turn predicted greater abstinence. Finally, fathers' abstinence was associated with lower externalizing problems in children. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To examine childhood problem behaviors manifested as externalizing behaviors (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) and internalizing behaviors (e.g., anxiousness, avoidant behavior) as predictors of mortality by the age of 46 years and to assess whether these associations are dependent on childhood family background. Method: The participants were 5,426 girls and 5,716 boys born in 1958 and participants in the British National Child Development Study (total N = 11,142). Childhood problem behaviors were assessed by teachers at ages 7 and 11 years, and the participants were followed for mortality to the age of 46 years. Results: Both externalizing and internalizing behaviors were associated with mortality in adulthood. By the age of 46 years, the cumulative probabilities of death by increasing externalizing score quartiles were 1.4%, 2.2%, 2.3%, and 3.2%, respectively (odds ratio [OR] for mortality per 1 SD increase in standardized externalizing score 1.27: 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.44). The corresponding percentages for internalizing score quartiles were 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.3%, and 3.0% (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.06-1.35). Adjusting for father's social class, family difficulties, family size, and cognitive ability attenuated these associations for externalizing behaviors (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.06-1.37) and for internalizing behaviors (OR 1.11 95% CI 0.98-1.26). Childhood environment did not modify the association between problem behaviors and mortality. Conclusions: Childhood problem behaviors are associated with increased long-term mortality risk beyond childhood and adolescence. J. Am. Acad Child Adolesc. Psychiatry. 2009;48(1):19-24.

The effects of hospitalization in childhood on social anxiety were analyzed in a study with pediatric patients between 6 and 13 years (N = 42). Children and their parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on social anxiety, social relationships, and self-esteem before and after the hospitalization. The effects of the hospital setting were controlled with the help of two groups of nonhospitalized children (healthy and chronically ill patients). In addition, the share of clinical and subclinical internalizing problems by children and the difference between the parent and self-reports were analyzed, too. The results show that hospitalization has no negative effects on the social anxiety, social relationships, and self-esteem of pediatric patients. The prevalence rates found here are congruent with the results of epidemiological studies. Modern hospitalization is no risk factor for internalizing problems in children.

AB The aim of this article is to examine the Machiavellian beliefs in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related behavioral problems. A sample of 70 Chinese boys aged 8 similar to 12 years with ADHD (17 cases have co morbid oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD+ODD) and normal controls were evaluated with Kiddie-Mach scales and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were significant differences between patients and controls. Boys with ADHD showed significantly higher Machiavellian beliefs than controls. However, boys with ADHD+ODD did not differ from boys with ADHD alone in Machiavellian beliefs. Withdrawal subscales, social subscales, attention subscales, internalizing behavior subscales and total problems of CBCL were positively correlated with Mach (p<0.05 similar to 0.01); social relations, school performance and total competence were negatively correlated with Mach (P<0.05 similar to 0.01). Conclusively, boys with ADHD have more Machiavellian beliefs. No difference emerges between boys with ADHD+ODD and with ADHD alone in Machiavellian beliefs. There are moderate correlations between Machiavellianism and behavioral problems and social impairment, especially internalizing behavioral problems and interpersonal communication embarrassment.

ID CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; GROWTH; STABILITY
AB Multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) confirmatory factor models were combined with longitudinal structural equation models to examine trait and method stability over time. A longitudinal correlated-trait correlated-method (CT-CM) model allowed for the study of trait and method variance in observed scores over time. Longitudinal measurement invariance was examined in the longitudinal CT-CM model to determine the invariance of the trait and method factors. The longitudinal MTMM model was then combined with second-order latent curve models to evaluate within-person change and between-person differences change in the trait factors while accounting for method-related variance. These models were developed and applied to longitudinal behavior-rating data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development with externalizing, internalizing, and social skills serving as the traits and mother, father, and teacher serving as methods or informants. Methodological extensions of longitudinal MTMM models and benefits of an MTMM approach to developmental research are discussed.

AB Finnish middle adolescents (n=3242) were assessed for family characters, family life events, depression and frequent drunkenness. Odds ratios for maladjustment outcomes associated with each event were computed and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of confounders. In the presence of serious illness or injury of a family member, increasing conflicts between parents and financial difficulties in the family, the probability of depression was twice as high than without the presence of these events. Parental unemployment, parent getting involved with the law and financial difficulties in the family were associated with frequent drunkenness. The associations between life events and depression were fairly similar among boys and girls. Among girls there were several events associated with frequent drunkenness even when family structure and socio-economic status were accounted for, while among boys there were only few. The significance of associations between family life events and depression may vary between the specific events while the associations between family life events and frequent drunkenness may be better explained with cumulative stress. Both males and females react to family stress, but the symptoms presented may differ. In case of family adversities, both internalizing and externalizing outcomes must be screened for.

AB Objective: To gain insight into the management of children and adolescents with mental health problems by their GPs as the GPs describe it. Design: A qualitative analysis of data from focus group interviews with GPs. Setting: Western Coast of Norway. Subjects: A strategic sample of 19 GPs. Results: According to the informants psychosomatic and other internalizing disorders are the most frequent mental health problems in their practice. Their assessments were based on history taking, physical examination and acquired knowledge of development and prevalence of common health problems. Their interventions mostly consisted of parental counselling. Their assessments and interventions to a lesser extent relied on specific knowledge in child and adolescent psychiatry. Conclusion: The interested GP is in a good position to provide services to these patients. They have the parents' trust, insight into family and local community, and essential general medical knowledge about management of mental health problems in this age group. There is need for mutual research and educational programmes between GPs and child and adolescent psychiatry to explore the interface between the fields.

AB Background. Despite high rates of school absenteeism in adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) the issue remains understudied. Potential associates of school absenteeism in adolescents with SCD include demographic (age, income), psychosocial (IQ, self-efficacy, competence, internalizing symptoms, negative thinking), and health-related (hemoglobin, health-care utilization, pain, disease knowledge). Procedure. Forty participants ages 12-18 completed measures of psychosocial functioning, IQ, and pain. Medical chart reviews identified other health-related variables. A subsample also completed all assessment of goals. Using-school records, absenteeism was the percent of school clays missed in the previous year. Correlations tested associates of absenteeism and linear regression tested a model of absenteeism. Results. Participants missed in average of 12%, of the school year and more than 35% missed at least a month of school. Health-related and psychosocial variables, but not demographic variables, correlated with absenteeism. Attendance at clinic appointments and parent-reported teen pain frequency were significant associates of absenteeism in the regression model. For those who completed goal assessment, over 40% of goals identified were academically focused. Absenteeism was positively related to current academic goals and health-related hindrance of academic goals, and negatively related to future-oriented academic goals. Conclusions. School absenteeism is a significant problem for adolescents with SCD despite file presence of academic goals. Collaboration between schools, parents, patients, and providers to understand and manage the impact of SCD on school attendance is recommended. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2009;52: 92-96.

In total, N = 207 sixth to ninth graders (aged 10 to 16 years) were asked to complete self-report measures, which assessed experiences with bullying and victimization, coping strategies, externalizing and internalizing problems, and strain. Overall, bully/victims showed the worst psychosocial functioning. Victims were characterized by a mixed pattern of maladaptive coping as well as anger control and internalizing problems. In contrast, bullies scored low on maladaptive coping and high on externalizing problems. Results suggest preventive interventions, which must be tailored to special needs of the groups regularly involved in bullying and victimization.

DE obesity; body image
ID DISTURBANCES
AB The authors present a literature review of the mutual relationship between obesity and body image. Obesity is becoming a worldwide problem that causes not only medical consequences but also disturbances in psychosocial functioning. Contemporary culture stigmatizes obese persons, which increases the probability of them internalizing negative information about themselves, and can cause obese persons feel psychologically discomforted about their physical appearance. Obesity then, is a source of distress related to a negative body image that plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of eating disorders. Body image is an element of self-image and psychological well-being is substantially dependent on it. Research has clearly shown that obese persons are dissatisfied with their body and remain dissatisfied even after having lost weight. Obese persons more often tend to overestimate than underestimate their body size. It turns out though that not all obese people have a disturbed body image to the same degree. Most significant disturbances are characteristic of people with childhood-onset or adolescence-onset obesity, women and people suffering from a binge-eating disorder.

AB Sensory-perceptual abnormalities, which include hyper- and hyposensitivity, have been identified by numerous researchers as prevalent in individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Hypersensitivity has a greater impact on PDD patients' daily lives than hyposensitivity. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship of hypersensitivity to anxiety, depression and other psychopathology in children with PDD.
   Sixty-four children were divided into a hypersensitivity group (HG; n = 43) and a non-hypersensitivity group (non-HG; n = 21), and compared for anxiety, depression and other psychopathology on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).
   The HG group had significantly higher scores than the non-HG group in Total, Internalizing, and Somatic complaints on the CBCL. On STAIC, the mean sore of Total Score, State Score and Trait Score in the HG group tended to be higher than in the non-HG group, but the difference was not significant. The score on the CDI in the HG group was significantly higher than that in the non-HG group.
   PDD children with hypersensitivity have more serious psychopathologies, especially internalizing symptoms including depression.

AB Aim: To investigate the effects of age, gender, prenatal/perinatal factors, and maternal psychological distress on childhood emotional/behavioral problems, and the gender difference in the patterns of comorbid emotional/behavioral problems.
   Methods: The sample included 1391 children aged 4-9 in Taipei using a multi-stage sampling method. Their mothers completed questionnaires including demographics, prenatal/perinatal variables, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Chinese Health Questionnaire. The linear and non-linear mixed model was used for data analysis.
   Results: Boys scored higher on externalizing problems, and girls scored higher on internalizing problems. Gender also modified the comorbid patterns of emotional/behavioral problems. Aggressive behaviors decreased, but attention and thought problems increased with age. Prenatal/perinatal exposure to alcohol and coffee, vaginal bleeding, and gestational diabetes, low birthweight, and postnatal incubation and resuscitation, and maternal psychological distress predicted the risk for several childhood emotional/behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Prenatal/perinatal and maternal care, and gender-specific measures are important for prevention of childhood emotional/behavioral problems.

TI Does the 'gateway' matter? Associations between the order of drug use

AB Background. The 'gateway' pattern of drug initiation describes a normative sequence, beginning with alcohol and tobacco use, followed by cannabis, then other illicit drugs. Previous work has suggested that 'violations' of this sequence may be predictors of later problems but other determinants were not considered. We have examined the role of pre-existing mental disorders and sociodemographics in explaining the predictive effects of violations using data from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R).
   Method. The NCS-R is a nationally representative face-to-face household survey of 9282 English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older that used the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess DSM-IV mental and substance disorders. Drug initiation was estimated using retrospective age-of-onset reports and 'violations' defined as inconsistent with the normative initiation order. Predictors of violations were examined using multivariable logistic regressions. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to see whether violations predicted progression to dependence.
   Results. Gateway violations were largely unrelated to later dependence risk, with the exception of small increases in risk of alcohol and other illicit drug dependence for those who initiated use of other illicit drugs before cannabis. Early-onset internalizing disorders were predictors of gateway violations, and both internalizing and externalizing disorders increased the risks of dependence among users of all drugs.
   Conclusions. Drug use initiation follows a strong normative pattern, deviations from which are not strongly predictive of later problems. By contrast, adolescents who have already developed mental health problems are at risk for deviations from the normative sequence of drug initiation and for the development of dependence.

AB Inconsistency in parenting between parents was investigated in a longitudinal prospective study with regard to children's problem behavior. As part of the Erlangen-Nuremberg Development and Prevention Study (Losel et al., 2006) 504 parents together with their children were studied; the average age of the child was 6.6 years. The self-reported parenting behavior of mothers and fathers was based on the two basic dimensions emotional warmth and rejection/punishment operationalized through a questionnaire developed by Jaursch (2003). The children's externalizing and internalizing behavior was assessed two years later with the Social Behavior Questionnaire by Tremblay er al. (1992). The data was analyzed within a variable-centered moderator approach as well as within a typological group comparison approach. There were significant correlations between parental inconsistency and the child's problem behavior in both approaches. These correlations were especially high for harsh-punitive parenting and the child's antisocial behavior as well as for the overall problem behavior. In the case of inconsistency in parenting, the positive parenting of one parent was not able to compensate for the negative parenting of the other parent. It was also shown that consistency in parenting does not only reveal positive effects, also negative effects were possible. This was true for those mothers and fathers who displayed a punishing together with a rejecting parenting.

AB The introduction of growth curve modeling into the field of neuroendocrinology has enabled researchers to examine mean patterns of change in unbalanced and/or incomplete repeated measures data. However, growth curve modeling assumes population homogeneity, or that all individuals follow roughly the same pattern of change, with differences expressed as deviation around the mean curve. Group-based trajectory modeling, in contrast, is designed for heterogeneous populations and as a result is able to identify atypical patterns of change over time that may exist within a population. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each technique, we apply both to a sample of diurnal cortisol data measured at home in young children (N = 106, 46 mate, M age = 3.81 years, S.D. = 0.24). We find three distinct trajectories of cortisol and demonstrate that the members of these trajectories are measurably different in terms of cortisol levels across context and time and in terms of the relationship between behavioral problems and parenting. At the same time, our growth curve analysis finds differential response patterns for high vs. low internalizing children with high vs. tow parenting quality. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for the proper application of each method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Relations among parental depressive symptoms, overt and covert marital conflict, and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined in a community sample of 235 couples and their children. Families were assessed once yearly for three years, starting when children were in kindergarten. Parents completed measures of depressive symptoms and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Behavioral observations of marital conflict behaviors (insult, threat, pursuit, and defensiveness) and self report of covert negativity (feeling worry, sorry, worthless, and helpless) were assessed based on problem-solving interactions. Results indicated that fathers' greater covert negativity and mothers' overt destructive conflict behaviors served as intervening variables in the link between fathers' depressive symptoms and child internalizing symptoms, with modest support for the pathway through fathers' covert negativity found even after controlling for earlier levels of constructs. These findings support the role of marital conflict in the impact of fathers' depressive symptoms on child internalizing symptoms.

AB Psychosocial precursors and correlates of parent-reported internalizing behavior trajectories across the age span of 3-15 years were explored using a community-based cohort of Australian children. Six internalizing trajectories had previously been identified for both girls (N = 810) and boys (N = 874) in this sample, comprising stable low, high, decreasing, and increasing pathways. Infancy and toddler temperamental traits (inhibition/shyness, irritability), behavior problems, and parent-child relationship difficulties constituted significant risks for subsequent problematic internalizing profiles. Several gender-specific trends were evident, with temperamental reactivity and shyness, less optimal parenting, and peer difficulties more salient for girls on increasing trajectories whereas externalizing problems were more prominent among boys on increasing trajectories. Factors associated with recovery from elevated symptoms included higher levels of social competence, better parent and peer relations, and more positive school adjustment. Findings suggest that individual characteristics and relationship experiences may be involved in the development and course of internalizing problems.

AB Systematic research about the continuity of mental health problems from childhood to adolescence is limited, but necessary to design effective prevention and intervention strategies. We used a population-based representative sample of Greek adolescents, followed-up from birth to the age of 18 years, to assess early influences on and the persistence of mental health problems in youth. We examined the role of peripartum, early development and parental characteristics in predicting mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Results suggest a strong relationship between behavioural problems in childhood and adolescence for both genders, while emotional problems were more likely to persist in boys. Age and sex-specific models revealed significant positive associations between higher scores on the behavioural and emotional problems scales and higher frequency of accidents in preschool years, physical punishment in early childhood, lack of parental interest in child's school and activities, and perceived maternal stress in all children. Perceived paternal stress was associated with higher scores on the Total and Internalizing problems scales in the total population. Our results suggest that early interventions are necessary as mental health problems strongly persist from childhood to late adolescence. The adverse effects of parental stress and poor care-giving practices on child's psychopathology need to be recognised and improved.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the link between acculturation stress and substance use among Latino adolescents. In-home interviews were completed with the participants at four time-points between 2005 and 2007. Path analysis was completed using longitudinal data from 286 Latino adolescents living in North Carolina and Arizona (65% foreign-born). Results indicate that acculturation stress influences family and friend relationships, which in turn affect adolescent mental health problems, and finally, substance use. Key mediators in the pathway from acculturation stress to substance use were parent-adolescent conflict, internalizing, and externalizing problems. Implications for practice and research have been discussed here.

AB This study examined typologies of alcohol use among 2,948 White and African American adolescent girls using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Self-report data were collected on frequency and quantity of alcohol use, negative consequences, and high-risk drinking behaviors, as well as co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. Latent class analysis revealed a four-group typology for While girls and a three-group typology for African American girls. Problematic drinkers reported having more internalizing and externalizing problems in both racial groups. The study's limitations and implications are discussed.

AB We investigated the genetic and environmental origins of children's empathy toward a distress victim and its correlates with emotional symptoms and affective knowledge. The cognitive (hypothesis testing) and affective (empathic concern) empathy of 122 twin pairs in response to simulated pain by an adult examiner was observed at 3.5 years of age. Moderate (0.19 to 0.44) heritabilities were estimated for individual differences in empathy, and the nonshared environment and error accounted for the rest of the variance. Hypothesis testing and empathic concern were moderately correlated, mainly through overlapping genetic effects. Although children's affective knowledge did not correlate with their empathy, affective knowledge interacted with mother-rated emotional symptoms in predicting empathy; knowledge about emotions was associated with greater empathy in children low in emotional symptoms. In contrast, among children with high degrees of emotional symptoms, those with better affective knowledge tended to show lower empathy.

AB Objective: A course in child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy is optional for medical students within the Medical Curriculum Munich (MeCuMLMU). Aims of the course are to give insight into the specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry and to help students acquire basic skills. The focus is on psychopathology and on communication skills.
   Method: A course comprising 23 teaching units and limited to twelve students is taught over four days within one week twice per semester. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is introduced by means of case presentations of children in different age groups, each with externalizing, and internalizing disorders and with developmental delay, and by a clinical round in the teaching hospital affiliated to the University. Case examples of children are presented by video. In group discussions guided by a teacher students learn to formulate a psychopathological status. Role-plays derived from the clinical examples and video-based feed-back provides students with the opportunity to improve their communication skills.
   Results: The course is evaluated by means of a written examination, in which a psychopathological status must be written down independently. Students and teachers evaluate the seminar in a structured way. Videotapes of the role-plays are analyzed by the teachers after the course. In a sub-sample, a follow-up evaluation was carried out six months later.
   Conclusions: The seminar offers an excellent opportunity to introduce medical students to child and adolescent psychiatry and to recruit and inspire a future generation of child and adolescent psychiatrists.

AB Effective emotion regulation is essential for children's positive development. Polyvagal theory provides a framework for understanding how parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity contributes to children's adaptive versus maladaptive functioning. Maintenance of cardiac respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) under social challenge should support emotion regulation and behavioral adjustment. Children's effective parasympathetic regulation and behavioral adjustment should be supported by appropriate parental socialization. These proposals were evaluated in a short-term longitudinal study of 94 preschool-aged children. Parenting and basal RSA were measured at home, then 6-10 months later behavioral adjustment and RSA in lab baseline and socially challenging contexts were measured. Children with relatively higher RSA in social challenge than at baseline (ARSA) had fewer internalizing problems (IP) and externalizing problems (EP), and better behavioral self-regulation (SR). Mothers who used more negative control had children with lower ARSA, more IP and EP, and less SR. Structural equation modeling showed that vagal regulation mediated associations between maternal negative control and children's adjustment; maternal negative control did not predict EP or SR after accounting for ARSA. Associations were consistent across boys and girls, with one exception: Higher ARSA was significantly associated with fewer EP in boys only. These findings suggest that the practical significance of physiological regulation might be best revealed in ecologically valid procedures, and that children's physiological mechanisms of emotion regulation are shaped by their experiences of parental socialization.

AB Adopting a developmental epidemiology perspective, the current study examines sources of risk heterogeneity for internalizing symptomatology among children of alcoholic parents (COAs). Parent-based factors, including comorbid diagnoses and the number of alcoholic parents in the family, as well as child-based factors, namely child gender, formed the indicators of heterogeneity. Following a novel approach to cross-study methods, we present a three-stage analysis involving measurement development using item response theory, examination of study effects on latent trajectories over time using latent curve modeling, and prediction of these latent trajectories testing our theoretically derived hypotheses in two longitudinal investigations across both mother- and self-reported symptomatology. Specifically, we replicated previous findings that parent alcoholism has a unique effect on child internalizing symptoms, above and beyond those of both parent depression and antisocial personality disorder. However, we also found important subgroup differences, explaining heterogeneity within COAs' risk profile in terms of the number of alcoholic parents in the family, comorbid diagnoses for the alcoholic parent and, for self-reported symptoms, child gender. Such factors serve to refine the definition of risk among COAs, suggesting a more severely impaired target group for preventive interventions, identifying the significance of familial alcoholism in individual differences underlying internalizing symptoms over time, and further specifying the distal risk matrix for an internalizing pathway to alcohol involvement.

AB Relations between maternal and paternal problem drinking symptoms and destructive marital conflict, parenting problems, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems were investigated. Participants were community families with a child in kindergarten who completed questionnaire measures at baseline (N = 235), 1 year later (N = 227), and 2 years later (N = 215). Structural equation modeling revealed that paternal problem drinking at Time I was associated with greater destructive marital conflict 1 year later. In turn, destructive marital conflict was related to decreased parental warmth and increased parental psychological control; these parenting problems were associated with greater child internalizing and externalizing problems at the third time point. Further analyses revealed that the indirect effects of paternal drinking on children's adjustment were significant, and that relations remained even after including autoregressive effects. Findings are discussed in terms of family process models for relations between parental drinking and child adjustment problems.

AB Qualitative studies suggest that children react to parental imprisonment by developing internalizing as well as externalizing behaviors. However, no previous study has examined the effects of parental imprisonment on children's internalizing problems using standardized instruments, appropriate comparison groups, and long-term follow-up. Using prospective longitudinal data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, we compared boys separated because of parental imprisonment during their first 10 years of life with four control groups: boys who did not experience separation, boys separated because of hospitalization or death, boys separated for other reasons (usually parental disharmony), and boys whose parents were only imprisoned before the boys' births. Individual, parenting, and family risk factors for internalizing problems were measured when boys were ages 8-11 years. Separation because of parental imprisonment predicted boys' internalizing problems from age 14 to 48, even after controlling for childhood risk factors including parental criminality. Separation because of parental imprisonment also predicted the co-occurrence of internalizing and antisocial problems. These results suggest that parental imprisonment might cause long-lasting internalizing and antisocial problems for children.

AB The school is an obvious arena for interventions designed to promote mental health among children. A set of educational techniques named social and emotional learning, which focuses on students' self-control, social competence, empathy, motivation and self-awareness, has shown promising results in the United States. This is a study of the application of a similar method in Sweden (referred to as social and emotional training) for school years 2000/2001 through to 2004/2005. It is an effectiveness rather than an efficacy study, largely administered by school personnel, which relates duration of the training (1-5 years) to a set of outcomes previously found to be associated with mental health. Positive and significant effects were found on five of seven variables: internalizing problems, externalizing problems, mastery (reflecting self-efficacy or hopelessness), self-image and self-esteem and contentment in school. Effect sizes were medium. Somewhat surprisingly, no relationship was found between the intervention and the promotion of social skills. Nor was there any detectable long-term impact on bullying. Controlling for student gender did not moderate any of the effects.

AB Objective: To examine the developmental eating trajectories of adolescents and identify psychological correlates and risk factors associated with those trajectories.
   Method: Seven hundred thirty-nine adolescents completed self-reported measures of eating problems, internalizing and externalizing behaviors. alcohol and drug use, peer victimization, and depression.
   Results: Five eating trajectories were obtained. The proportions of males and females were the same in the increasing eating problems trajectory. For both genders, internalizing and externalizing problems were identified as associated risk factors of an eating pathology and reporting at least some eating problems was associated with an increased likelihood of psychological problems. Other risk factors found only in boys were frequency of drug use, victimization, and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: Externalizing problems in girls and internalizing behaviors in boys with disordered eating should not be overlooked. Atypical eating behaviors in boys are of particular concern since it increases their risk of cooccurring psychopathology. (C) 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Purpose: We prospectively tested the extent to which witnessing school violence predicts psychosocial and school adjustment in Students while accounting for their prior psychosocial characteristics and peer victimization. We also explored the role of feelings of insecurity in explaining this relationship.
   Methods: Questionnaires were administered to 1104 students (52% boys) from five high schools from the Montreal area (Quebec, Canada) at the beginning. middle, and end of seventh grade. Self report measures included sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, witnessing violence, feelings of insecurity. internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and measures of engagement. achievement, and truancy as indicators of school adjustment.
   Results: Witnessing School violence was a comparatively better predictor of subsequent externalizing problems and school adjustment than actual victimization. Conversely, relative to having experienced violence as a witness. actual victimization more reliably estimated later internalizing problems. Feelings of insecurity partially explained the development of school engagement and truancy.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the implications of school violence as a public health and safety issue, the consideration of witnessing as important in estimating its impact, and a comprehensive approach when developing and implementing strategies that aim to prevent this form of community violence.

AB Studies in Hong Kong indicated that there is a tendency for young children to use internalizing as a means to cope with their daily difficulties. Mother child relationship has been seen as a factor affecting a child's adaptive coping skills. In this study, we explored the prevalence of internalizing problems among primary school children in Hong Kong, as well as the mother-child relationship that contribute to children's internalizing problems. Data used to assess the internalizing behavior among 1598 primary school children were collected from their mothers. The estimated prevalence of internalizing problem was 11.4%. This prevalence was based on the cutoff point for internalizing disorders according to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL internalizing score was significantly correlated with mother-child relationship as measured using the Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire (PCRQ). Results from the PCRQ indicated that children's internalizing problems were positively correlated with mother's use of verbal punishment and rejection as well as their possessiveness and protection on their children. On the other hand, a nurturing and intimate relationship between mother and child was an important factor contributing to the development of mentally healthy children. Implications of this study and suggestions for further research were discussed.

AB Child adjustment and parenting were examined in twenty-three 9-16-year-old youth from families affected by maternal HIV infection and 20 same-age peers whose mothers were not infected. Children whose mothers were seropositive reported significantly more externalizing problems. Infected mothers reported less age-appropriate supervision/monitoring relative to non-infected mothers. Better mother-child relationship quality and less impairment in parental supervision/monitoring of age-appropriate youth behaviors were associated with fewer externalizing difficulties among the HIV-positive group only. Similarly, only among HIV-infected mothers was refraining from engaging in inconsistent disciplinary tactics associated with lower reports of internalizing and externalizing problems. These data highlight the promise of programs targeting parenting skills to prevent or ameliorate child difficulties.

AB In this study, we examined the longitudinal relations among maternal emotional distress, marital conflict, and early adolescent externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms during the transition to adolescence. 3 years of self-report data were collected from 136 married mothers and their children, beginning when the children were in 5th grade. Structural equations modeling with latent variables were conducted to examine the nature and directionality of paths between constructs. For mothers, results indicated that marital conflict mediated the relation between prior maternal emotional distress and subsequent early adolescent externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms. For early adolescents, a mediating pattern was seen only for externalizing behaviors. In testing the reverse pattern of effects for mothers, marital conflict mediated the relation between prior early adolescent externalizing behaviors and subsequent maternal emotional distress whereas only an indirect pattern of effects existed for internalizing symptoms. Thus, we identified dynamic patterns of familial relations that accounted for the diminished well-being of both early adolescents and their mothers, suggesting that prevention and intervention work during the transition to adolescence should focus on multiple components of family functioning.

AB Sexual minority adolescents appear to be at increased risk for internalizing disorders relative to their heterosexual peers, but there is a paucity of research explaining this elevated risk. Emotion regulation deficits are increasingly understood as important predictors of internalizing psychopathology among general samples of adolescents. The present study sought to examine whether deficits in emotion regulation could account for disparities in internalizing symptoms between sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents.
   The present study utilized longitudinal data from a racially/ethnically diverse (68% non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino) community sample of 1,071 middle school students (ages 11-14).
   Adolescents who endorsed same-sex attraction evidenced higher rates of internalizing symptoms at both time points. Structural equation modeling indicated that sexual minority adolescents exhibited greater deficits in emotion regulation (rumination and poor emotional awareness) than their heterosexual peers. Emotion regulation deficits in turn mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   The results demonstrate the importance of considering normative psychological processes in the development of internalizing symptomatology among sexual minority adolescents, and suggest emotion regulation deficits as specific targets of prevention and intervention efforts with this population. Future studies are needed to determine whether stigma-related stressors are responsible for emotion regulation deficits among sexual minority youth.

AB Rationale: Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may be linked with behavior problems in childhood, but previous research has relied primarily on parent report of exposure, and results are inconclusive. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between exposure to ETS and child behavior problems among children with asthma. Methods: The sample included 220 children who were enrolled in an asthma intervention trial and regularly exposed to ETS at home. Serum cotinine was used to measure exposure to tobacco smoke, and behavior problems were assessed by parent report on the Behavior Assessment System for Children. Covariates in adjusted analyses included: sex, age, race, asthma severity, asthma medication, maternal education, prenatal tobacco exposure, maternal depression, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment score. Results: Child behavior problems increased with increasing exposure to ETS. A stratified analysis of boys and girls separately indicated higher exposure among girls, but behavior problems were statistically significantly associated with exposure only in boys. increasing behavior problems included externalizing behavior problems (beta = 2.23, p =.02) such as hyperactivity and aggression, internalizing behavior problems (p = 2.19, p =.01) such as depression, and behavior symptoms (beta=2.55, p =.01). Conclusions: Among children with asthma, exposure to ETS is related to increased child behavior problems among boys.

AB The authors investigate whether parental use of punitive discipline and yielding to coercion varies in levels and associated child outcomes for mothers with different parenting styles. Participants were fourth-grade children (N = 370) and their mothers. Maternal parenting style was determined based on levels of responsiveness and demandingness. Authoritative mothers used less punitive discipline than indifferent mothers. Authoritative and authoritarian mothers engaged in less yielding to coercion than indifferent or indulgent mothers. More punitive discipline and yielding to coercion were associated with lower academic grades and more punitive discipline was associated with more social problems, with these effects not moderated by parenting style. Negative effects of yielding to coercion in terms of internalizing, externalizing, and social problems were observed only within authoritarian families. Greater use of punitive discipline was associated with more externalizing problems within the indulgent and authoritarian parenting style groups and more internalizing problems within the authoritarian group.

AB Emotional, cognitive, and family systems processes have been identified as mediators of the association between interparental conflict and children's adjustment. However, little is known about how they function in relation to one another because they have not all been assessed in the same study. This investigation examined the relations among children's exposure to parental conflict, their appraisals of threat and blame, their emotional reaction, and triangulation into parental disagreements. One hundred fifty ethnically diverse 8- to 12-year-old children and both of their parents participated in the study. Comparisons of 3 models proposing different relations among these processes indicated that they function as parallel and independent mediators of children's adjustment. Specifically, children's self-blaming attributions and emotional distress were uniquely associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas perceived threat uniquely predicted internalizing problems and triangulation uniquely predicted externalizing problems.

AB Longitudinal research on the determinants of gambling behavior is sparse. This article briefly reviews the previous seventeen longitudinally designed studies, focusing on the methodology for each study. This is followed by a description of our ongoing longitudinal study entitled the Leisure, Lifestyle, and Lifecycle Project (LLLP). Participants for the LLLP were recruited from four locations in Alberta, Canada, including both rural and urban populations. In the LLLP most participants were recruited using random digit dialing (RDD), with 1808 participants from 5 age cohorts at baseline: 13-15, 18-20, 23-25, 43-45, and 63-65. Individuals completed telephone, computer, and face-to-face surveys at baseline, with the data collection occurring between February and October, 2006. At baseline, a wide variety of constructs were measured, including gambling behavior, substance use, psychopathology, intelligence, family environment, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Finally, the conclusions that can be drawn thus far are discussed as well as the plans for three future data collections.

AB This study aimed to contribute to the dimensional approach to personality pathology by addressing the applicability of a personality pathology questionnaire, originally developed for adults, in adolescent samples. The psychometric properties of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire for Adolescents (DAPP-BQ-A) were studied in two samples including 170 adolescents referred for mental health services and 1,628 nonreferred adolescents, respectively. Factor analysis resulted in a strong replication of the original structure, retaining four factors (Emotional Dysregulation, Dissocial Behavior, Inhibitedness, and Compulsivity), which could be further organized into a two-dimensional structure with factors identifiable as Internalizing and Externalizing, suggesting a possible link between personality and psychopathology. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability proved to be satisfactory for all lower-order dimensions, with the exception of Intimacy Problems. Several of these dimensions showed considerable promise in differentiating nonreferred adolescents, referred adolescents without and referred adolescents with a personality disorder. The present findings underscore the need for a developmental perspective on personality pathology. Promising aspects of the dimensional approach to personality pathology in adolescence are discussed.

AB Decades of research have examined the structure of self-consciousness in adults and its relationship to social anxiety. This study examined the structure of self-consciousness via the Self-Consciousness Scales (Fenigstein et al., J. Consult. Clin. Psychol. 43:522-527, 1975) in a school sample of 175 children and young adolescents (92 girls; mean age=11.5). Confirmatory factor analysis best supported a five-factor solution (Internal State Awareness, Self-Reflectiveness, Appearance Consciousness, Style Consciousness and Social Anxiety). Although some factor based subscales evidenced low internal consistencies, convergent and discriminant correlations with self-report measures of social phobia, negative affect, and positive affect as well as parent-report measures of internalizing and externalizing problems provided additional support for the five-factor model. Future studies should further examine the multidimensional nature as well as the developmental course of self-consciousness and its relation to social anxiety longitudinally.

AB A prospective investigation was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of internalizing and externalizing traits measured at ages 10-12 for predicting a DSM-IV diagnosis of cannabis use disorder manifest by age 22. The sample consisted of 189 boys rated on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by their biological mothers. The results indicated that externalizing but not internalizing disturbance was a significant predictor of cannabis use disorder. Moreover, a construct capturing their common variance did not predict cannabis use disorder better than externalizing behavior alone.

AB In a sample of 107 five-year-olds, cluster analysis was used to identify groups of children with similar profiles of competence and adaptation. A comprehensive set of child characteristics was included in the analysis, together covering the most important aspects of five-year-olds' development and functioning. Three groups of children emerged, which were labeled Well-adapted/Competent, Underachieving/Internalizing, and Maladapted/Externalizing. Well-adapted/Competent children (59%) were competent and well-adjusted in all domains. The Maladapted/Externalizing children (22%) scored low in almost all domains of competence and functioning, and the Underachieving/Internalizing children (22%) showed a mixed profile of competence and adaptation. The differences in the quality of parent-child interaction that were observed between the groups provide clues as to how the different profiles of competence and adaptation are shaped and maintained in the interactions with parents.

AB Opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the government, the grantees or the individuals above.
   Background: Black youth-are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This study examined disparities in patterns and determinants of sexual risk: behaviors among black and white adolescents in substance abuse treatment programs.
   Methods: We used pooled clinical data collected from 4,565 sexually active 12-17-year-old black (29.7%) and white (70.3%) adolescents entering outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment programs nationally. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine racial differences in patterns of sexual risk behavior s and the associations of these behaviors with demographic, socioenvironmental and psychosocial risk factors, including substance use and abuse, symptoms of mental disorders and criminal behaviors.
   Results: Blacks were significantly more likely-than whites to have had sex with multiple partners, purchased or traded sex and used substances to,enhance their sexual experiences, even after adjusting for demographic, socioenvironmental and psychosocial risk factors; Substance use and abuse, internalizing symptom and drug-related crimes ere significantly associated with enaging in >= 2 sexual risk behaviors in both groups: Disparities in determinants of HIV risk were also found. For instance, male gender, single-parent custody and history of criminal justice involvemeht, were-associated with having had sex wiht multiple partners-among blacks but not among whites. Demographic, socioenvironmeintal and psychosocial risk factors accounted for up to 30% of the variance in sexual risk in both groups.
   Conclusions.. Black adolescents with substance use problems are at greater risk for HIV-infection than their white peers because of their higher rates of sexual risk behaviors. Differences in co-occurring psychosocial problems did not fully explain racial disparities in sexual risk behaviors. HIV prevention progams for black adolescents in treatment should consider both individual and broader contextual factors that co-occur with sexual risk behaviors.

AB Intrauterine growth restriction has been linked to infant behavioral problems. While typically only birth weight is examined, here the authors assessed fetal circulatory redistribution, also called the "brain-sparing effect," which is a fetal adaptive reaction to placental insufficiency. They aimed to investigate whether fetal circulatory redistribution protects against behavioral problems. Within the Generation R Study (Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2003-2007), fetal circulation variables for the umbilical artery and the middle and anterior cerebral arteries were assessed with Doppler ultrasound in late pregnancy. Ratios between placental resistance and cerebral resistance were related to behavioral problems, as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist, in 935 toddlers aged 18 months. The umbilical/anterior cerebral ratio was associated with the Total Problems summary score from the Child Behavior Checklist (per standard-deviation increase, odds ratio = 1.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 1.5). Children with higher umbilical/anterior cerebral ratios had higher risks of internalizing problems, emotional reactivity, somatic complaints, and attention problems. A high umbilical/middle cerebral ratio was related to higher scores on the Internalizing and Somatic Complaints scales. The authors conclude that infants with circulatory redistribution in gestation are more likely to have behavioral problems. This suggests that "brain-sparing" does not completely spare the brain and indicates underlying pathology with consequences for later behavior.

AB Objective: To describe the effect of wartime military deployments on the behavior of young children in military families.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Childcare centers on a large Marine base.
   Participants: Parents and childcare providers of children aged 11/2 to 5 years enrolled in on-base childcare centers.
   Main Exposure: Parental deployment.
   Outcome Measures: Mean externalizing, internalizing, and total symptom scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (11/2-5 years) and the CBCL-Teacher Report Form (TRF) (11/2-5 years).
   Results: One hundred sixty-nine of 233 consenting families (73%) participated. Nonresponders did not differ from responders in their child's age or TRF scores. Fifty-five children (33%) had a deployed parent. Parents with children aged 3 years or older and a deployed spouse had significantly higher depression scores than those without a deployed spouse. There were no differences in the demographic characteristics between groups. After controlling for respondent's age, stress and depressive symptoms, deployed service member's rank, and total number of children in the home, we found an age by deployment interaction: children aged 3 years or older with a deployed parent had significantly higher CBCL externalizing and total scores (externalizing, 48.50 vs 43.31, P < .05; total, 47.71 vs 42.68, P < .05) and externalizing and total TRF scores (externalizing, 50.21 vs 45.62, P < .05; total, 48.54 vs 43.73, P < .05) compared with same-aged peers without a deployed parent.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to show that children aged 3 years or older with a deployed parent exhibit increased behavioral symptoms compared with peers without a deployed parent after controlling for caregiver's stress and depressive symptoms.

AB Internalizing disorders of childhood and adolescence are common conditions, but until the past decade, had received little scientific scrutiny. This paper overviews the new knowledge that the past decade of research has given us. The early research began by adopting adult models of disorders, and adult-based modes of treatment. This met with moderate success, but the focus now is on testing whether these models are appropriate for younger clients. The good news is that, for adolescents at least, the adult models do seem to be appropriate. The bad news is that, even in well-resourced treatment trials, barely half of all cases remit. In very recent years, there has been a focus on generating developmentally appropriate models of childhood internalizing disorders, and correspondingly, an increasing interest in developing treatment approaches that are appropriate for young people and their families. The paper concludes with our thoughts on the most important questions for research in the next decade.

AB It is well recognised that mental health disorders in parents are associated with internalizing disorders in their children. For better understanding of the nature of this association, this article presents a critical analysis of 5 theoretical models and of major findings from empirical studies conducted on this question in the past 15 years. Several psychosocial characteristics are found to be more frequent in families of depressed or anxious parents and are associated to a higher prevalence of internalizing disorders in their children. Two hypotheses are drawn from these findings : (a) The presence of internalizing disorders in a parent may contribute to the emergence of other at-risk conditions associated with internalizing disorders in children; and (b) the presence of some psychosocial characteristics may exacerbate the influence of being exposed to parental anxiety or depression.

AB Background 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can be associated with a variety of somatic symptoms, developmental delays and psychiatric disorders. At present, there is little information on behaviour problems, parental stress and possible relations between these factors. Therefore, this study investigates behaviour problems of children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS, and their primary caregivers' stress.
   Methods Parents of 4-17 year old subjects known to the German 22q11.2 deletion syndrome foundation were anonymously asked to fill out several questionnaires, e.g. the Child Behavior Checklist 4-18 (CBCL/4-18).
   Results The primary caregivers of 77/126 children [43 males, 34 females, mean age: 8;0 (4;0-16;11) years] sent back filled-out questionnaires. Forty-six of 76 subjects were rated as clinical on at least one of the CBCL-scales. Males had significantly higher scores on the total problems scale and the internalizing problems scale than females. The patients' age correlated with several CBCL-scales. Eleven of 49 subjects were suspicious of an autism spectrum disorder. Compared with the general population, but not with other parents of mentally and/or physically handicapped children, the primary caregivers experienced higher levels of stress, but showed normal life satisfaction.
   Conclusions In spite of high rates of clinical behaviour problems among children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS and despite increased parental stress, most primary caregivers seem to have effective coping strategies, e.g. partnership support, to sustain normal levels of life satisfaction.

AB Two models of vulnerability to socioenvironmental risk were examined in 337 African American children (M = 7.8 years) recruited to overrepresent prenatal alcohol or cocaine exposure: The cumulative risk model predicted synergistic effects from exposure to multiple risk factors, and the fetal patterning of disease model predicted that prenatal insult will increase vulnerability to environmental risk. Four or more risks emerged as a threshold for poorer cognitive and behavioral outcome among the non-substance-exposed children, whereas substance-exposed children showed greater vulnerability to lower levels of environmental risk. Cumulative risk was associated with increased delinquent and internalizing behaviors only for the substance-exposed group. Results support the cumulative risk model for non-substance-exposed children and increased vulnerability to environmental risk among the substance-exposed group.

AB Teacher-child relationships were examined as predictors of cortisol change in preschool children. Saliva for assays was collected from one hundred and ninety-one 4-year-olds (101 boys) in the mornings and afternoons on 2 days at child care, and before and after a series of challenging tasks and a teacher-child interaction session outside the classroom. Parents reported on children's temperament, teachers and children reported on teacher-child relationship quality, and observers rated group-level teacher insensitivity. Teacher-reported relationship conflict predicted cortisol increases during teacher-child interaction and teacher-reported overdependence predicted cortisol increases from morning to afternoon, even after controlling for individual teacher, child, and classroom characteristics. The findings extend earlier work by suggesting that cortisol change across the child-care day is influenced by teacher-child relationship characteristics.

AB A meta-analysis examined the relations between children's adjustment and children's cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological responses to interparental conflict. Studies included children between 5 and 19 years of age. Moderate effect sizes were found for the associations between cognitions and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and self-esteem problems, negative affect and behavioral responses and internalizing behavior problems, and behavioral responses and self-esteem problems. Small to moderate effect sizes were found for the associations between cognitions and relational problems, negative affect and behavioral responses and externalizing behavior problems, and physiological reactions and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Effect sizes were, with 1 exception, larger for internalizing than for externalizing behavior problems. Age significantly moderated the majority of effect sizes.

AB Recent biosocial theories postulate that both biological risk and the social context influence the development of mental health problems [Boyce and Ellis (2005) Development and Psychopathology, 17(2), 271-301]. Guided by this framework, we examined whether basal cortisol and its diurnal rhythm were associated with mental health symptoms in early adolescence. Because cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations sometimes reveal different cortisol-mental health associations, we examined the association both concurrently and longitudinally when children transition to middle school, a time which entails a major change in social context from single to multiple teachers, classrooms, and sets of classmates. Salivary cortisol was measured three times a day (waking, afternoon, and bedtime) across 3 days when adolescents were 5th graders. Mental health was measured when adolescents were in 5th and 7th grades, just before and after the transition to middle school. To deal with the substantial comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at this developmental stage, mental health measures distinguished overall symptom severity from the preponderance of internalizing versus externalizing symptoms (i.e., directionality). A three-level Hierarchical Linear Model was used to extract basal cortisol and its diurnal rhythm separate from the day-to-day and within-the-day fluctuations in cortisol in response to daily experiences. Results were specific to symptom severity, suggesting that cortisol is a nonspecific risk factor for mental health symptoms in young adolescents. At 5th grade, low basal cortisol was associated with concurrent symptom severity. However, longitudinally, it was adolescents with high cortisol at 5th grade who were tit risk for increasing mental health symptoms by 7th grade. Flat diurnal rhythms in 5th grade were related to levels of symptom severity at both 5th and 7th grades. Considering the change in social context, as defined by the transition to middle school, helped resolve seemingly inconsistent evidence that both hypo- and hyper-arousal were associated with mental health symptoms in early adolescence.

AB This study presents an extended children-of-twins model, which allowed the authors to test the direction of the association between parenting and child adjustment. Three mechanisms were examined: direct phenotypic influence of parenting on child behavior (controlling for both parental and child genotype), passive genotype-environment correlation, and evocative genotype-environment correlation. This model was tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The authors generated data sets consisting of 1,000 twin parent pairs together with their children and 1,000 twin children pairs together with their parents. These simulated data sets were then used to estimate the model, and the procedure was repeated 1,000 times. The simulation results showed that this model recovered the true values of parameters with high precision. The model was also applied to an observed data set to analyze, as a first example, the association between maternal emotional overinvolvement and child internalizing problems. The results showed that this association was best explained by evocative genotype-environment correlation.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of children's perceptions of mother's and father's parental behavior in explaining specific psychopathological problems among children in early adolescence. Children reported mother's and father's parental behavior by filling the Children's Reports of Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI-57, Kerestes, 1999). Their psychopathological problems were assessed by Youth Self-Report (YSR, Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). This research shows that children's perception of parental behavior, to a large extent, is tied to children's externalized problems, rather than internalized ones. Meanwhile, a mother's psychological control has been shown to be the most significant dimension of parental behavior in predicting both types of children's problems. A child's development is adversely affected by subjective experience of control, that is, a mother's psychological control, which is ossociated with the internalization and externalization of problems in children. Also, children's perception of mother's low emotionality predicts children's externalizing problems. These results shows that children's perception of mother's psychological control turned out to be the most significant dimension of parental behavior in prediction of both types of children's problems, and these figures show that the perception of personal autonomy among children, especially by the mother, in the early adolescence period, is extremely important in the regulation of emotions and behaviour.

TI How to Become an Authentic Speaker
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Like the best-laid schemes of mice and men, the best-rehearsed speeches go oft astray. No amount of preparation can counter an audience's perception that the speaker is calculating or insincere. Why do so many managers have trouble communicating authenticity to their listeners?
   Morgan, a communications coach for more than two decades, offers advice for overcoming this difficulty. Recent brain research shows that natural, unstudied gestures-what Morgan calls the "second conversation" - express emotions or impulses a split second before our thought processes have turned them into words. So the timing of practiced gestures will always be subtly off - just enough to be picked up by listeners' unconscious ability to read body language.
   If you can't practice the unspoken part of your delivery, what can you do? Tap into four basic impulses underlying your speech - to be open to the audience, to connect with it, to be passionate, and to "listen" to how the audience is responding - and then rehearse your presentation with each in mind. You can become more open, for instance, by imagining that you're speaking to your spouse or a close friend. To more readily connect, focus on needing to engage your listeners and then to keep their attention, as if you were speaking to a child who isn't heeding your words. To convey your passion, identify the feelings behind your speech and let them come through. To listen, think about what the audience is probably feeling when you step up to the podium and be alert to the nonverbal messages of its members.
   Internalizing these four impulses as you practice will help you come across as relaxed and authentic - and your body language will take care of itself.

AB The goal of this multi-method study was to examine how child gender and coparenting processes influence associations between family stress and toddlers' social adjustment. The participants, 104 dual-earner couples and their 2-year-old children, were videotaped in their home during a freeplay activity. Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires about stress in their roles as partners, workers, and parents and their child's social-emotional adjustment. Consistent with previous research, higher levels of family stress were associated with poorer adjustment for children. Family harmony, represented by warmth and cooperation, was significantly associated with fewer internalizing problems for children even when family stress was considered. Conversely, coparental banter or 'playful humour' between parents moderated the nature of the association between family stress and children's adjustment. Banter between parents was especially protective for girls suggesting that, even in families with toddler-aged children, gender plays an important role in family-level coparenting processes. Future research needs to consider more fully the impact that child characteristics, such as gender, have on the interplay between the family context and children's development.

AB The principal aim of the present study was to obtain a deeper understanding than hitherto of the concurrent correlates and prospective predictors of loneliness and poor peer acceptance, both falling under the umbrella term low social inclusion. Problematic and socially competent behaviours were investigated as possible predictors of low social inclusion in grade 6, as defined by self-rated loneliness and degree of peer non-acceptance, respectively. In grade 6 808 children participated whereof 323 were followed longitudinally from first grade. Loneliness in grade 6 was distinctively associated with high levels of internalizing problems, concurrently as well as prospectively. Peer acceptance, on the other hand, emerged as a complex, multifaceted aspect, with concurrent, independent predictions from both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviours as well as social competence, although prospective analyses found early externalizing problems to be the strongest predictor of peer acceptance. Moderating effects of social competence were sparse, although peer nominated social competence buffered peer acceptance for children with high levels of aggression in the concurrent analyses and social competence boosted peer acceptance for children with low problem levels in the predictive analyses. Social competence did not appear to buffer the negative impact of early problem behaviours on peer relations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study focused on attachment of foster children by examining factors associated with attachment relationships of children raised from birth by the same parents. The sample included 61 children between 26 to 88 months of age and their foster caregivers. Attachment security and caregiver sensitivity were coded on the basis of, respectively, a home-observation (Attachment Q-Set) and a laboratory procedure (Three boxes). Other measures included caregiver reports of child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and symptoms of attachment disorder, including inhibited and disinhibited attachment as well as secure base distortions. For a subsample of children, teacher ratings of behavior problems also were available. Foster parent sensitivity was positively associated with attachment security, but only if symptoms of disordered attachment were partialled out. Symptoms of inhibited and disinhibited attachment as well as Secure base distortions were positively related to parent reports of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems whereas attachment security was negatively related to teacher reports of externalizing behavior problems. Attachment theoretical tenets appeared valid with foster parent-child relationships, except for children with symptoms of attachment disorder.

DE nocturnal enuresis; adolescent; evaluation studies; treatment outcome
AB Purpose Compare parents' reports of youth problems (PRYP) with adolescent problems self-reports (APSR) pre/post behavioral treatment of nocturnal enuresis (NE) based on the use of a urine alarm.
   Materials and Methods. Adolescents (N = 19) with mono-symptomatic (primary or secondary) nocturnal enuresis group treatment for 40 weeks Discharge criterion was established as 8 weeks with consecutive dry nights. PRYP and APSR were scored by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR)
   Results Pre-treatment data: 1) Higher number of clinical cases based on parent report than on self-report for Internalizing Problems (IP) (13/19 vs 4/19), Externalizing Problems (EP) (7/19 vs. 5/19) and Total Problem (TP) (11/19 vs. 5/19); 2) Mean PRYP scores for IP (60 8) and TP (61) were within the deviant range (T score >= 60), while mean PRYP scores for EP (57.4) and mean APSR scores (IP = 52.4, EP = 49.5, TP = 52 4) were within the normal range. Difference between PRYP' and APSR' scores was significant. Post treatment data: 1) Discharge for majority of the participants (16/19); 2) Reduction in the number of clinical cases on parental evaluation. 9/19 adolescents remained within clinical range for IP, 2/19 for EP, and 7/19 for TP 3) All post-treatment mean scores were within the normal range; the difference between pre and post evaluation scores was significant for PRYP.
   Conclusions The behavioral treatment based on the use of urine alarm is effective for adolescents with mono-symptomatic (primary and secondary) nocturnal enuresis. The study favors the hypothesis that enuresis is a cause, not a consequence, of other behavioral problems.

AB Objective: To examine the prevalence of picky eating and the relationship between picky eating, previously supported correlates of picky eating, other child eating and behavioral problems and maternal eating problems in children aged 8-12 years.
   Method. In a cohort study, 426 8- to 12-year-old children and their primary caretakers (91% mothers) were assessed in a small town community. Potenta child eating behaviors associated with picky eating were reported by mothers using the Stanford Feeding Questionnaire. Child eating attitudes and disturbances were obtained from the McKnight Risk Factor Survey, food preferences and avoidances from a food preference list, child behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist. To assess maternal eating disturbances EDI-subscales 1-3 as well as TFEQ-subscales "disinhibition" and "restraint" were used.
   Results: Picky and nonpicky eaters differed significantly on all of the child eating behaviors found to be correlates of picky eating in a previous study with younger children. Overall, picky children were reported to avoid foods in general more often than nonpicky eaters. Picky children did not differ from nonpicky children with regard to their own and maternal eating disturbances. However, picky children displayed more problem behaviors comprising both internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Conclusion: The present study does not support the concept that picky eating is associated with disordered eating but rather with a range of behavioral problems. (C) 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated the impact of social stress on symptoms of psychopathology at the entry into adolescence (111 girls, Mage = 11.84, SD = 0.77). We examined whether peer stress and pubertal timing were associated with internalizing distress and aggression, and whether responses to stress and cortisol reactivity mediated or moderated these associations. Cortisol samples were collected from saliva samples during in-home visits, and the YSR was used to assess psychopathology. Interestingly, pubertal timing demonstrated a trend association with cortisol. Responses to stress mediated the association between social stress and symptoms of internalizing distress and aggression. Specifically, early maturers and girls with higher levels of peer stress exhibited more problematic responses to stress, in turn demonstrating higher levels of internalizing distress and aggression. Significant moderation effects also emerged. For example, early maturers who experienced higher levels of emotional/cognitive numbing in response to peer stress were at greater risk for aggression. Findings identify coping strategies that may be used in evidence-based programming to help girls transition more successfully into adolescence will be discussed.

AB This study used latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine changes in early emotional and behavioral problems in children age 2 to 4 years resulting from participation in a family-centered intervention. A sample of 731 economically disadvantaged families was recruited from among participants in a national food supplement and nutrition program. Families with toddlers between age 2 and 3 were randomized either to the Family Check-Up (FCU) or to a nonintervention control group. The FCU's linked interventions were tailored to each family's needs. Assessments occurred at age 2, 3, and 4. The FCU followed age 2 and age 3 assessments. Latent class analyses were conducted on mother reports of behavior and emotional problems from age 2 to 4 to study transitions among the following four groups: (a) externalizing only, (b) internalizing only, (c) comorbid internalizing and externalizing, and (d) normative. LTA results revealed that participation in the FCU increased the likelihood of transitioning from either the comorbid or the internalizing class into the normative class by age 4. These results suggest family interventions in early childhood can potentially disrupt the early emergence of both emotional and behavioral problems.

This study examined the factor structure of items from three internalizing disorders (Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression) on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV-Child Version (Silverman, W. K., & Albano, A. M. Anxiety disorders interview schedule for children for DSM-IV, child and parent versions. Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, 1996). Two-, three-, and four-factor models emerged in an exploratory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis provided additional empirical support for the four-factor model over the two- or three-factor models. Implications for the structure of the DSM-V taxonomy in children and adolescents are discussed.

AB Objective: Studies utilizing parent-report measures have identified above average levels of internalizing and externalizing problems in siblings of children diagnosed with ADHD. Scant research has examined siblings' self-report on standardized measures of emotional functioning. The current study examined parent-reported and child self-reported symptoms of siblings of children with ADHD compared with a control group. Method: Measures completed included the Children's Depression Inventory, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale. Results: Parent-report measures indicated that siblings of children with ADHD had higher levels of internalizing, hyperactivity, and inattention problems compared with control siblings. Significant differences between groups were not revealed on child self-report measures. Conclusions: Although parent-report measures continue to demonstrate higher levels of symptoms for siblings of children diagnosed with ADHD compared with control siblings, there are no indications that self-reported internalizing symptoms are different.

AB Background: This study examined relations among cumulative risk, nurturant and involved parenting, and behavior problems across early childhood. Methods: Cumulative risk, parenting, and behavior problems were measured in a sample of low-income toddlers participating in a family-centered program to prevent conduct problems. Results: Path analysis was utilized to examine longitudinal relations among these constructs, with results supporting an indirect effect of cumulative risk on externalizing and internalizing problems through nurturant and involved parenting. Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of cumulative risk during early childhood, and particularly the effect that the level of contextual risk can have on the parenting context during this developmental period.

AB The role of aggression in adaptation to family and community violence was examined in a sample of 667 inner-city schoolchildren studied annually over three years in middle school. Regression analysed indicated that the association between year 1 exposure to family and community violence and year 2 aggression was mediated by aggression occuring contemporaneously with Year 1 exposure. Cognitive justification of aggression and friends' delinquency made small independent contributions to prediction of Year 2 aggression, delinquency, and externalizing behaviors. Year 2 aggression mediated the association between Year 1 community violence victimization and Year 3 negative adaptation (internalizing problems, anxiety and depression). Year 2 aggression also mediated the negative association between Year 1 witnessing community violence and Year 3 positive adaptation (self-esteem). Cognitive justification of aggression and friends' delinquency made independent contributions to year 3 negative adaptation. The pattern of relations among variables infrequently varied by gender. Implications for intervention are discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Using a three-wave longitudinal design, the present study examined adolescents' cognitive appraisals and coping strategies following exposure to interparental conflict and their long-term symptoms of emotional and behavioral distress. Participants were 252 adolescents (122 boys, 130 girls; ages 11 to 12 years in the 1 st year of the study), their parents, and their teachers. Controlling for initial symptom levels (Time 1), the proposed theoretical model linked parent reports of interparental conflict at Time 1 (1999) to children's appraisals of self-blame and threat relating to marital conflict at Time 2 (2000) and their coping strategies as indexed by proactive mediation, avoidance, overinvolvement, and masking behavior at Time 3 (2001). Children's appraisals and coping strategies were in turn related to their internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems, assessed at Time 3. Gender differences were found whereby marital conflict exerted direct effects on boys' coping behavior, while for girls, effects were indirect through their self-blame and threat appraisals. Implications for interventions aimed at ameliorating the effects of interparental conflict on children are discussed.

AB Preliminary report of the efficacy of a Web-based treatment program to improve adolescent and family psychosocial functioning following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants: Families of 9 adolescents with TBI (2 severe and 7 moderate) injured less than 24 months ago participated in this study. Intervention: A Web-based family treatment program designed to enhance family problem solving and adjustment, as well as reduce adolescent behavioral and social problems that are common sequelae of moderate-to-severe TBI was used as intervention. The program consisted of 10 core sessions and up to 4 supplemental sessions, each consisting of self-guided Web exercises followed by a videoconference therapy session. Results: Significant improvements were found in parent-reported adolescent internalizing behaviors, self-reported adolescent depressive symptoms, parental depression, and parent-adolescent conflict. Effect sizes were in the medium-to-high range for these same contrasts. Exploratory analyses suggested that providing audio with the Web site may enhance some outcomes. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of family-centered online intervention for improving adolescent and family adaptation following pediatric TBI.

AB Objectives To examine the effect of maternal HIV infection, as well as other individual, family, and contextual factors on the mental health of inner-city, ethnic minority early adolescents.
   Methods Participants included 220 HIV-negative early adolescents (1014 years) and their mothers, half of whom were HIV-infected. Individual interviews were conducted regarding youth depression, anxiety, externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, as well as a range of correlates of youth mental health guided by a modified version of Social Action Theory, a theoretical model of behavioral health.
   Results Although the HIV status of mothers alone did not predict youth mental health, youth knowledge of mothers HIV infection and mothers overall health were associated with worse youth mental health outcomes, as were contextual, self-regulation, and family interaction factors from our theoretical model.
   Conclusions There is a need for family-based mental health interventions for this population, particularly focusing on parentchild relationships, disclosure, and youth self-esteem.

AB BACKGROUND: Sexual risk taking during adolescence such as failure to use contraception or condoms is associated with premature parenthood and high rates of sexually transmitted infection. The relation of childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence has been largely unexplored.
   METHODS: Using data collected from participants in the Child Sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CS-NLSY) when they were 5 or 6 years of age (time 1) and 17 or 18 years of age (time 2), the relation of childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence was investigated. Maternal ratings of childhood personality were used to derive resiliency, undercontrol, and overcontrol prototypical profile scores for a diverse sample of 1219 child participants from the CS-NLSY. At time 2, participants reported whether they failed to use oral contraception or condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of personality to sexual risk taking.
   RESULTS: Proximity to the overcontrolled personality prototype at time 1 was associated with a decreased likelihood of sexual risk taking. Age, male gender, and childhood cognitive achievement were also significant predictors of sexual risk taking.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that children with personality profiles in which internalizing traits are more prominent are less likely than their peers to engage in sexual risk taking during late adolescence. The findings of this study augment previous studies that indicate that personality is an important predictor of development and underscore the importance of conducting research into the processes by which personality influences health behavior.

AB Objective: For 3 decades, studies have reported that the usual sequence of drug initiation is licit drugs, then cannabis, and then other illicit drugs. This article describes the prevalence of violations of this sequence, the predictors of violations, and the relationship between violations and the onset of alcohol or drug dependence. Method: The New Zealand Mental Health Survey is a nationally representative sample with 12,992 face-to-face interviews carried out in 2003-2004, The response rate was 73.3%. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was used in the survey. Reports of the age at first use were obtained for alcohol and drugs but not for smoking. Results: Violations of the usual sequence of drug initiation were uncommon in the population (2.6%). Use of other illicit drugs before cannabis was the main violation, found in 2.3% of alcohol users, 3.0% of cannabis users, 8.6% of cocaine users, and 16.7% of those who had used other illicit drugs. Use of other illicit drugs before cannabis was more predominant in younger cohorts and those with more early-onset internalizing disorders. Violations had little association with the development of dependence in users when other important predictors such as age at onset of use and the number of illicit drugs used were taken into account. Internalizing disorders and early-onset bipolar disorder also predicted dependence. Conclusions: In New Zealand, violations of the gateway sequence are not common and they are not markers of progression to dependence. (J. Stud Alcohol Drugs 69: 789-795, 2008)

AB Peer crowds serve as an identity marker for adolescents, indicating their image and status among peers; but adolescents do not always endorse peer appraisals of crowd affiliation. We report on two studies-one with 924 adolescents in grades 7-12 and a second with a more diverse population of 2,728 students in grades 9-11, followed for 2 years-that examined how congruence between peer and self-appraisals of crowd affiliation relate to self-esteem and internalizing symptoms. Analyses indicate that high-status crowd members may suffer and low-status crowd members benefit by denying their peer crowd affiliation, but effects are modest in size and not entirely consistent across the two studies. Findings underscore the value of symbolic interactionist principles concerning reflected appraisal processes in understanding how peer crowd affiliation affects adolescent self-image.

AB The pre- and post-displacement factors associated with psychological problems among young refugees are not clear. From the existing research it appears that refugee children and adolescents are vulnerable to the effects of pre-migration exposure to trauma, but the long-term effects of such exposure are mediated by certain risk and protective factors at the individual, family and community level. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of traumatic experiences before emigration, as well as social life after immigration, on the mental health of young Middle Eastern refugees 8-9 years after immigration into Denmark. The study group comprises 131 young refugees (76 girls and 55 boys; mean age 15.3 years) from 67 families. They were assessed in 2000-2001 as part of a follow-up study of 311 children, who in 1992-1993 were consecutively registered in Denmark as asylum seekers with at least one parent. Predictors of more externalizing behaviour were: witnessing attack on others after arrival, more schools attended, less attending school or work, lower mother's education in the home country and lower age. Predictors of more internalizing behaviour were: numbers of types of traumatic events before arrival, numbers of types of stressful events after arrival, and numbers of types of experiences of discrimination, lower mother's education in the home country, fewer Danish friends, not Muslim or Christian religion, less Danish proficiency and female gender. It is concluded that aspects of social life in Denmark, including mother's education and indicators of adaptation, as well as a stressful life context in exile, including discrimination, predicted psychological problems 8-9 years after arrival, more than traumatic experiences before arrival. Thus, the prevention of psychopathology in young refugees depends to a large extent on the political will to make provision for the necessary changes regarding reception and treatment of refugees.

AB Objective. Family factors and emotional functioning can play an important role in the ability of adolescents with juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS) to cope with their condition and function in their everyday lives. The primary objectives of this study were to determine 1) whether adolescents with JPFS and their caregivers differed from healthy age-matched comparison peers and their caregivers in terms of emotional distress and functional impairment; 2) whether there were any differences in the family environment of adolescents with JPFS compared with healthy comparison peers; and 3) which individual-, caregiver-, and family-level variables were associated with functional impairment in adolescents with JPFS.
   Methods. Participants were 47 adolescents with JPFS recruited from a pediatric rheumatology clinic and 46 comparison peers without chronic illness matched for age, sex, and race. Participants and their caregivers (all mothers) completed a battery of standardized measures administered in their homes.
   Results. Adolescents with JPFS had greater internalizing and externalizing symptoms than healthy comparison peers. Mothers of adolescents with JPFS reported twice as many pain conditions and significantly greater depressive symptoms than mothers of comparison peers. The JPFS group also had poorer overall family functioning and more conflicted family relationships. In adolescents with JPFS, maternal pain history was associated with significantly higher functional impairment.
   Conclusion. Increased distress and chronic pain are evident in families of adolescents with JPFS, and family relationships are also impacted. Implications for child functional impairment and the need for inclusion of caregivers in treatment are discussed.

AB The experience of out-of-home care has the potential to impact on childrens psycho-social outcomes in significant ways. This article highlights the interactive contribution of carers, teachers and children to the fostering experience. The paper reports on a strand of a longitudinal study of children in long-term foster-care. Using a mixed-methods, repeated-measures, multi-informant approach, it focuses on emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. Children in the study were assessed by carers and teachers for competencies and problem behaviours using the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist and its companion, the Teacher Report Form. The results suggest high prevalence rates of Externalizing and Internalizing problems with demonstrated gains in terms of improved scores and adaptive functioning at subsequent assessments as they progressed in placements. While drawing attention to the adversities reflected in the childrens experience, the findings go some way in demonstrating the positive outcomes of care. One striking finding is the similarity between care children and controls in later assessments. Discussion of results and implications for practice centre on the need for a co-ordinated strategy for improved recognition and integrated responses to childrens psychological and educational needs that draw on resilience oriented interventions and target interrelated systems of service delivery. The findings have broad implications for practitioners concerned with psycho-social outcomes for children in care, and for researchers interested in integrating multiple perspectives in longitudinal research.

AB Objective: Up to 90% of child welfare system cases involve multiple types of maltreatment; however, studies have rarely incorporated multiple dimensions of maltreatment. The present study employed a latent profile analysis to identify naturally occurring subgroups of children who had experienced maltreatment.
   Methods: Reports of maltreatment incidents for 117 preschool-aged foster children were classified along two dimensions: type (e.g., physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, supervisory neglect, or emotional maltreatment) and severity within type.
   Results: The analyses revealed four distinct profiles showing moderate to high levels of maltreatment: (a) supervisory neglect/emotional maltreatment; (b) sexual abuse/emotional maltreatment/neglect (when not otherwise specified neglect refers to both supervisory and physical neglect); (c) physical abuse/emotional maltreatment/neglect; and (d) sexual abuse/physical abuse/emotional maltreatment/neglect. Profile membership was examined with respect to the children's cognitive functioning and externalizing and internalizing problems: lower cognitive functioning was related to profiles with neglect or physical abuse (or both), externalizing was highest in the sexual abuse/physical abuse/emotional maltreatment/neglect profile, and internalizing was highest in the profiles with physical OF sexual abuse (or both).
   Conclusions: There appear to be distinct profiles of maltreatment among preschoolers that have differential associations to measures of adjustment. Policy and practice implications and future research directions are discussed.
   Practice implications: Using different profiles Of Maltreatment to understand specific vulnerabilities may guide in tailoring interventions to the needs of maltreated children. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All Fights reserved.

AB Objectives: Tinnitus has high prevalence and a wide range of etiologies and of impacts on sufferers. Our objective was to develop understanding of the role of personality in the perception of tinnitus in the general population. As a theoretical basis for this, we combined elements of a general model of signal detection with the ideas of ignition (development) and promotion (neural transmission) of tinnitus, and considered plausible roles for personality factors within this conceptual framework.
   Design: We interviewed a birth cohort of 970 people aged 32 yr sampled from the general population. On the basis of questioning, we divided them into three groups, those without tinnitus, those with occasional tinnitus (including those with transient tinnitus of very brief duration), and those who experienced tinnitus most of the time. We also established how annoying or distressing the tinnitus was, and assessed personality using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire.
   Results: Tinnitus was experienced rarely by 38.2% and half the time or more by 6.8% of those studied. Men and women did not differ in the amount of tinnitus reported, but women were more likely to find it annoying. People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to report tinnitus. People with tinnitus were more socially withdrawn, reactive to stress, alienated, and less Self-Controlled. People who were more annoyed by tinnitus were more socially withdrawn, and men were more stress reactive and alienated.
   Conclusions: Our interpretation of the findings is that personality influences the persistence of tinnitus by influencing the tendency to be aware of it. Consideration of personality factors may improve the ability to tailor tinnitus therapies, and the concept of awareness may benefit treatment outcomes by showing tinnitus sufferers a means of internalizing the locus of control over their symptoms.

AB Depression commonly co-occurs with anxiety and externalizing problems. Etiological factors from a central cognitive theory of depression, the Hopelessness Theory (Abramson et al. Psychological Review, 96, 358-372, 1989), were examined to evaluate whether a negative inferential style about cause, consequence, and self interacted with stressors over time to predict prospective elevations in depressive symptoms specifically compared with typically co-occurring symptoms. Negative inferential style was assessed at baseline in a sample of early and middle adolescents (N = 350, sixth to tenth graders). Measures of general depressive, anhedonic depressive, anxious arousal, general internalizing, and externalizing symptoms and occurrence of stressors were assessed at four time points over a 5-month period. Results using hierarchical linear modeling show that a negative inferential style interacted with negative events to predict prospective symptoms of general and anhedonic depression specifically but not anxious arousal, general internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Negative events predicted prospective elevations of symptoms of anxious arousal, internalizing, and externalizing problems.

AB Patterns and correlates of comorbidity, as well as differences in manifest depressive profiles were investigated in a sample of depressed adolescents. A sub-sample of the youth were characterized as belonging to either a Pure depression group, an Internalizing group (depression and co-occurring internalizing disorders), or an Externalizing group (depression and co-occurring externalizing disorders). Item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning (DIF) were used to assess whether the depressed adolescents from the different comorbidity groups presented with different depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the comorbidity groups were meaningfully distinct in terms of psychosocial correlates as well as showed differences in depressive symptom profiles as informed by DIF analyses. In particular, the comorbidity groups differed in terms of presentation of psychomotor changes and cognitive impairments. Implications for assessment are discussed.

AB To evaluate the discriminative power of various items as reported by parents in the OCS-scale extracted from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) problem scale and to compare findings with outcomes of previous validation studies.
   Children referred to a specialized child psychiatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) clinic (OCD group) (it = 185) receiving a formal OCD diagnosis according to DSM IV criteria based on interviews with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) were compared to a sample recruited from regular child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics (CPO group) (n = 177). Both samples were compared to a normative school sample (SS group) and all three groups were matched for age and gender.
   Thirty seven CBCL items, mostly representing core internalizing symptoms and parts of the thought problem scale as well as physical and sleep problems, were first identified. Ten of these items (including all discriminative items in previous validation studies) could distinguish children with OCD from CPO patients. In a subsequent analysis, the results of a logistic regression showed that four CBCL items, "Obsessions," "Fearful and Anxious," "Compulsions," and "Worries" remained significant predictors. These four OCS items and previously used CBCL OCS-scales were further examined by means of ROC-analysis showing that the "Obsessions" and "Compulsions" CBCL items were the strongest predictors.
   These two CBCL items per-formed well as screens for OCS symptoms in children and adolescents and the addition of similar CBCL items did not further increase sensitivity or specificity. It is suggested that parental responses on these two items could preferably be used as screen for OCD in children and adolescents in regular child psychiatric clinics. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Children and adolescents completed the SPAI-C and SASC-R, and their parents completed the CBCL Internalizing scale. Adolescents with HFA/AS scored higher than the community sample on all measures. Behavioural avoidance and evaluative social anxiety increased by age within the HFA/AS group, whereas behavioural avoidance decreased by age in control participants. Data support that HFA/AS in adolescents may be associated with clinically relevant social anxiety symptoms.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychotropic medication utilization over the course of treatment for children and adolescents admitted to a large residential group-home facility for youth with emotional and behavioral disorders.
   Method: Retrospective analyses of psychotropic medication utilization at admission, during treatment, and at departure were examined for 1,010 children and adolescents consecutively admitted to the facility during 2001-2004. The relationship between psychotropic medication utilization and demographic variables, psychiatric diagnoses, objective measures of behavioral and emotional problems, in-program behavior, and ratings of program success were examined.
   Results: The overall utilization rate was 49%, and there was a significant reduction in utilization from admission (40%) to departure (26%). Reductions were evident across all medication classes (e. g., stimulants, antipsychotics, etc.). At admission, medication utilization was related to several psychosocial variables, higher scores on measures of behavioral and emotional problems, and psychiatric diagnoses (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mood disorders). A small percentage (16%) of youth was prescribed novel medication during stay. Being placed on medication during treatment was related to internalizing problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at admission, psychiatric diagnoses, higher rates of in-program behavior problems, and poorer outcomes at departure. Youth departing on medication were more likely to be male, younger, and rated as doing more poorly in the program. They also were more likely to be placed in more restrictive settings at follow-up.
   Conclusions: There was a high rate of psychotropic medication utilization among this population, though utilization rates dropped significantly over the course of treatment.

AB Research consistently shows that children exposed to interparental conflict are at-risk for experiencing psychopathology. Establishing a link, however, between interparental conflict and maladjustment is not the same as understanding how specific outcomes manifest. Therefore, we examined the relation of interparental conflict and appraisal with adolescent outcome with 169 high school students (ages 14-19 years). Specifically, threat and self-blame appraisals were hypothesized to mediate the relation between interparental conflict and both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Results suggest that threat partially mediated the relation between interparental conflict and externalizing problems, interparental conflict and internalizing problems, and interparental conflict and adaptive behaviors. Additionally, self-blame appears to partially mediate the relation between interparental conflict and internalizing problems. Implications of the current findings are discussed.

AB Several studies have documented low rates of agreement between clinician- and researcher-generated diagnoses. However, little is known about whether this lack of agreement has implications for the processes and outcomes of subsequent treatment. To study this possibility, the authors used diagnostic agreement to predict therapy engagement and outcomes for 197 youths treated in 5 community mental health clinics. Diagnostic agreement predicted better therapy engagement, with the agree group having fewer therapy no-shows and cancellations and a decreased likelihood of therapy dropout. Additionally, support for a link between agreement and treatment outcomes was found, as the agree group obtained larger reductions in parent-reported internalizing problems during treatment. These findings suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be an important precursor to successful treatment and highlight the importance of future research to find ways to incorporate standardized diagnostic procedures into clinical care settings.

AB The present study tested the impact of a parent behavior-management intervention on child depressive and internalizing symptoms. One hundred eighty-one children were randomly assigned to receive a videotape modeling parenting intervention, the Incredible Years, or to a wait-list control group. Children who received the intervention were more likely to have lower mother-rated mood and internalizing symptoms at post-treatment, compared with children in a wait-list control group. The effect sizes observed in the present intervention fell in the small-to-medium range for the sample as a whole, and some evidence supported the authors' hypothesis that effects would be strongest for children with baseline internalizing symptoms in the clinical range. Subsequent analyses also revealed that perceived changes in parenting effectiveness mediated the effect of treatment on children's post-treatment internalizing symptoms. The finding was consistent with study hypotheses and social learning explanations of child internalizing symptoms that guided selection of putative mechanisms. Implications for counseling psychologists and for designing interventions and prevention strategies for children with internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB Objective: To test the contribution of maternal depression during late infancy to physical activity in children 5 years later. Method: Children (n = 168) from very low-income households in semiurban Mexico were assessed as toddlers (IS months, Time 1) and at pre-school age (4-6 years, Time 2). Child low activity level (<20 minutes of activity daily for <7 d/wk) at Time 2 was the primary outcome measure and maternal depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) by self-report at Time I was the primary independent variable. Covariates tested included child age, sex, BMI percentile, television viewing and behavior (Behavior Problem index subscales), current maternal depressive symptoms, age, BMI and physical activity level, and family socioeconomic status; all covariates were assessed at Time 2 except for socioeconomic status. Results: At 4 to 6 years old, 27.5% of children were categorized with low activity level. Exposure to high maternal depressive symptoms at child age 15 months was associated with an increased risk of having a low activity level at age 4 to 6 years (OR, 2.38; 95% Cl, 1.05-5.40); results were unchanged with the inclusion of current maternal depressive symptoms. High child TV viewing was significantly associated with low activity level (OR, 5.44; 95% Cl, 2.06-14.3), but did not change the effect of maternal depressive symptoms in early childhood. Tests of mediation revealed that current child internalizing behavior, but not externalizing behavior, significantly attenuated the association between early high maternal depressive symptoms and later childhood activity level. Conclusion: Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in late infancy is a risk factor for low activity level in later childhood and the association may be mediated by child internalizing factors.

AB Using data from a sample of 455 African American children ( ages 10 to 12 years) and their parents, this study tests a hypothesized model linking ( a) maternal work demands to family routines through work-family conflict and depressive symptoms and (b) maternal work demands to children's externalizing and internalizing problems through family routines. Partial support for our hypotheses was found in single-mother families, but not in two-parent families. Work demands decreased family routines in single-mother families by increasing work-family conflict. In addition, higher levels of work-family conflict and maternal depressive symptomatology predicted an increase in children's externalizing problems and these relations were mediated through a decrease in family routines. Contrary to prediction, work demands bore no relation to children's behavior problems either directly or indirectly through family routines. Family structure differences in mediating processes are discussed in relation to mothers' subjective experiences of work and the roles of adults in the household.

AB This study examines international adoptees and factors associated with searching for birth parents. A total of 1,417 international adoptees in The Netherlands, aged 24 to 30 years, were divided into 4 groups: uninterested nonsearchers, interested nonsearchers, searchers, and reunited searchers. In total, 32% of adoptees had searched. Although the majority of searchers were well-adjusted, they had more problems-mainly internalizing problems-than uninterested nonsearchers. These problems, however, were not caused by the search itself. It is concluded that searching is the product of natural curiosity influenced by external factors such as the divorce of adoptive parents and the options for searching.

AB Pathways linking parental depressive symptoms, adult relationship insecurity, interparental conflict, negative parenting, and children's psychological adjustment (internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems) were assessed using a 3-wave longitudinal research design. Two-parent families (N = 352) with 11- to 13-year-old children (179 boys, 173 girls) participated in the study. Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms were associated with insecurity in adult close relationships assessed 12 months later, which was concurrently related to heightened levels of interparental conflict. Controlling for children's initial symptom levels, interparental conflict was related to child appraisals of father and mother rejection assessed an additional 12 months later, which were related to children's internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems, respectively. Results are discussed with regard to the implications for understanding the complex interplay between adult depressive symptoms, attributions in close adult relationships, interparental conflict, negative parenting, and children's psychological adjustment.

AB Although much has been written about transactional models in the Study of parenting practices, relatively few researchers have used this approach to examine how child behavior might be related to parental well-being. This study used latent growth curve modeling to test transactional models of age 2 child noncompliance, parental depressive symptoms, and age 4 internalizing and externalizing behaviors using a subsample of families in the Early Steps Multisite Study. In unconditional models, maternal depressive symptoms showed a linear decrease from child ages 2 to 4, whereas paternal depression did not show significant change. Observed child noncompliance at age 2 showed significant associations with concur-rent reports of maternal depressive symptoms and trend-level associations with paternal depressive symptoms. For both parents, higher levels of initial depressive symptoms were related to increased age 4 child internalizing behaviors. The findings provide support for reciprocal process models of parental depression and child behavior, and this study is one of the first to present empirical evidence that fathers' depressive symptoms have bidirectional associations with their children's behavior in early childhood.

AB Objective To provide an evidence-based review of measures of psychosocial adjustment and psychopathology, with a specific focus on their use in the field of pediatric psychology. Methods As part of a larger survey of pediatric psychologists from the Society of Pediatric Psychology e-mail listserv (American Psychological Association, APA, Division 54), 37 measures were selected for this psychometric review. Measures that qualified for the review fell into one of the following three categories: (a) internalizing or externalizing rating scales, (b) broad-band rating scales, and (c) self-related rating scales. Results Psychometric characteristics (i.e., three types of reliability, two types of validity) were strong for the majority of measures reviewed, with 34 of the 37 measures meeting well-established evidence-based assessment (EBA) criteria. Strengths and weaknesses of existing measures were noted. Conclusions Recommendations for future work in this area of assessment are presented, including suggestions that more fine-grained EBA criteria be developed and that evidence-based profiles be devised for each measure.

AB We examined whether anxious expectations of discrimination among Asian Americans can help explain this group's elevated levels of internalizing symptomatology, such as lower self-esteem (Twenge & Crocker, 2002) and higher depressive symptoms (Okazaki, 1997, 2002) relative to European Americans. Study 1 reports on the development and validation of a scale measuring status-based rejection sensitivity among Asian Americans (RS-A). In Study 2, scores on the RS-A were related to spontaneous discrimination is both applicable and possible for Asian Americans. Study 3 revealed that shame mediated the relationship between RS-A and internalizing symptomatology. Implications for well-being and intergroup interactions are discussed.

AB Whereas the treatment outcome research literature for adolescent alcohol and other drug abuse has shown recent advances (R. J. Williams, S. Y. Chang, & Addiction Centre Adolescent Research Group, 2000), significant knowledge gaps remain. A. E. Kazdin (2001) recently observed that one of the key questions for the field is to identify if client characteristics meaningfully mediate or moderate treatment outcome. There is support from the adolescent clinical literature that internalizing and externalizing personality subtypes are related to the onset and course of youth substance use disorders (D. B. Clark & O. G. Bukstein, 1998). The study extends this literature by examining the association of drug use behaviors outcome and subtyped adolescents (internalizers and externalizers; n = 141) who sought treatment at a 12-Step program. The analysis also includes a community-based control group (n = 94). Specifically, we examined the association of subtype and treatment retention and short-term (Year 1) and long-term (Year 4 and Year 5.5) drug involvement outcomes. Externalizers consistently showed poorer outcomes, including poorer treatment retention and greater drug use and drug disorder symptoms at each follow-up point. The treatment implications of the study are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Greater empirical attention directed toward gender-sensitive assessment strategies that concentrate on family-specific factors is thought to be both timely and necessary, especially with regard to outcome variables associated with mental health and substance abuse in at-risk adolescent populations. A sample of 2,646 court-involved adolescents was used to test two competing models regarding relationships among disruptive family processes, mental health (as both internalizing and externalizing problems), and substance abuse issues according to gender. The results of multiple group structural equation modeling procedures indicated that disrupted family processes were significantly associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and substance abuse in both male and female youth. For females, however, disrupted family processes were more related to internalizing problems and substance abuse than externalizing problems. Further, the relationship between disrupted family processes and substance abuse was not mediated by mental health issues, indicating a lack of support for the alternative model tested in this study. Together, the findings underscore the primacy of the family's impact on issues related to adolescent development and well-being in tandem with the need for a more gender sensitive approach to the needs of court-involved males and females.

AB Objective: Mental health problems often emerge in young adulthood. Although effective treatments are available, young adults are unlikely to seek professional help. This study examined barriers-to-care in young adults with serious internalizing or externalizing problems.
   Methods: Population-based study among 2258 19-32-year olds in the south-west region of the Netherlands. Barriers-to-care were examined in participants with serious internalizing or externalizing problems who did not seek professional help. A potential barrier was that participants denied that they had mental health problems. In those admitting problems, barriers were assessed with the Barriers-to-Care checklist and analyzed with Latent Class Analysis.
   Results: Of 362 participants with serious internalizing or externalizing problems 237 (65.5%) and not seek professional help. Of non-help-seeking young adults 36% denied having problems; additionally Latent Class Analysis revealed that 37% Perceived Problems as Self-Limitin (e.g., they believed that problems were not serious) and 24% Perceived Help-Seeking Negatively (e.g., they believed that treatment would not help).
   Conclusions: Young adults' barriers-to-care reflect limitations in their knowledge of mental health problems and available treatments, but possibly also a failure of existing mental health services to engage young people. More knowledge is urgently needed about the effectiveness of mental health treatments for young adults specifically.
   Practice implications: Treatment accessibility for Young adults may be augmented by improving their mental health literacy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Although gender differences in rates of internalizing disorders, particularly depression, are well documented, the causes of these differences are not well understood. One influential hypothesis [Cutler & Nolen-Hoeksema, Sex Roles (1991), 24, 425-438] proposes that higher rates of depression in females compared to males may be partially attributable to gender differences in the effects of childhood sexual abuse. The present study has evaluated this possibility by reviewing evidence for gender moderating the effects of childhood victimization on psychiatric outcomes.
   Method. Literature search using PsycINFO and Medline, applying the following inclusion criteria: publication from 1996 to 2006, community-based sampling, adequate male-to-female sample ratio, use of clearly defined psychiatric outcomes, and a statistical test of gender differences in the effects of childhood victimization on psychiatric outcomes.
   Results. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, the results were mixed. Nearly half of all studies find no gender differences. In studies that do observe gender differences, victimization tends to be associated with higher psychiatric risk in females in studies with adult samples, whereas in samples of youth, victimization tends to be associated with higher psychiatric risk in males. With respect to outcome, when gender differences were observed, outcomes were distributed across both internalizing and externalizing categories for both genders.
   Conclusions. The gender differences in prevalence rates of internalizing disorders, such as depression, do not appear to be attributable to differential effects of childhood victimization.

AB This study examined the perceptions of a national sample of school psychologists in the United States regarding their knowledge, preferred roles and training needs in the assessment of nine prominent childhood internalizing disorders. Knowledge about all disorders was rated by respondents as being at least fairly important. In particular, knowledge regarding school phobia/refusal and suicidal threats and acts were perceived as being especially important for school psychologists and assessing these disorders was viewed as an appropriate role for school psychologists. The school-based assessment of eating disorders was rated lowest in terms of need for knowledge and as an appropriate role for school psychologists. The majority of the sample indicated they needed some or significant additional training in the assessment of all nine disorders. Participants also rated the utility of various instruments for assessing internalizing disorders, with child self-reports and interviews rated as particularly important.

AB Objective Mental health problems are highly prevalent in young adults. Despite possibilities for effective treatment, only about one-third of young adults with mental health problems seek professional help. Little knowledge exists of which groups of young adults are underusing mental health services and for what reasons. The present study examined socio-demographic inequalities in the use of mental health services by young adults, and examined whether such inequalities were attributable to differences in objective need, subjective need, predisposing or enabling factors. Design Cross-sectional study among the general population aged 19-32 years (2,258 respondents). A postal survey was administered including questions on socio-demographic factors and mental health service use. Data were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. Setting South-West Netherlands. Participants All respondents with serious internalizing and externalizing problems (n = 367). Main outcome measure Twelve-month primary and specialty mental health services use. Results Only 34.6% of young adults with psychopathology had used any mental health services: 16.2% had used only primary mental health services and 18.4% had used specialty mental health services. No socio-demographic differences were found in the use of only primary mental health services. However, recipients of specialty mental health services were more often female (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.14-3.96), economically inactive (OR = 3.12, 95% Cl = 1.59-6.09) or students (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.05-5.42) and they were less often higher educated (OR = 0.49, 95% Cl = 0.25-0.97). The higher odds ratio for specialty service use among young adults who were female or economically inactive attenuated when adjusting for need for care. The other socio-demographic disparities in specialty service use did not attenuate when adjusting for need, enabling or predisposing factors. Conclusion Among young adults, equal use of specialty mental health services for equal needs has not been achieved. The underserved groups of young adults oppose the traditionally underserved groups in the general population, and may inform interventions aimed at improving young people's help-seeking behaviours.

Youths were significantly more likely to be newly identified if they were repeat offenders, if their probation officer knew more about mental health and if they resided in a county without a shortage of available mental health professionals. Probation officers were especially likely to underidentify internalizing disorders. Policy implications for promoting identification of mental health needs and improving linkage to community service providers are discussed.

AB Child behavior problems have been identified as being responsible for the greatest reduction in quality of life for children between ages 1 and 19. In this study, we examine whether neighborhood social processes are associated with differences in child behavior problems in an economically and racially diverse sample of 405 urban-dwelling first grade children and whether parenting behavior mediates and/or moderates the effects of neighborhoods. Furthermore, we examine whether neighborhood social processes play the same role with regards to child behavior problems at differing levels of neighborhood economic impoverishment. Results of multivariate multilevel regression analyses indicate that a high negative social climate is associated with greater internalizing problems. High potential for community involvement for children in the neighborhood was associated with fewer behavior problems, but only in economically impoverished neighborhoods. Differences in parenting behavior did not appear to mediate neighborhood effects on behavior problems, and parenting characterized by a high degree of positive involvement was associated with fewer behavior problems in all types of neighborhoods.

AB Children and adolescents in the U.S. and worldwide are commonly exposed to traumatic events, yet practitioners treating these young people to reduce subsequent psychological harm may not be aware of-or use-interventions based oil (lie best available evidence. This systematic review evaluated interventions commonly used to reduce psychological harm among children and adolescents exposed to traumatic events. Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide) criteria were used to assess study design and execution. Meta-analyses were conducted, stratifying by traumatic exposures.
   Evaluated interventions were conducted in high-income economies, published up to March 2007. Subjects in studies were <= 21 years of age, exposed to individual/mass, intentional/unintentional, or manmade/natural traumatic events.
   The seven evaluated interventions were individual cognitive-behavioral therapy, group cognitive behavioral therapy, play therapy, art therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and pharmacologic therapy for symptomatic children and adolescents, and psychological debriefing, regardless of symptoms. The main outcome measures were indices of depressive disorders, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, internalizing and externalizing disorders, and suicidal behavior.
   Strong evidence (according to Community Guide rules) showed that. individual and group cognitive-behavioral therapy can decrease psychological harm among symptomatic children and adolescents exposed to trauma. Evidence was insufficient. to determine the effectiveness of play therapy, art therapy, pharmacologic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, or psychological debriefing in reducing psychological harm.
   Personnel treating children and adolescents exposed to traumatic events should use interventions for which evidence of effectiveness is available, such as individual and group cognitive-behavior therapy. Interventions should be adapted for use in diverse populations and settings. Research should be pursued oil the effectiveness of interventions For which evidence is currently insufficient.

AB Using a cross-lagged panel design, we investigated the impact of positive family processes on change in autism symptoms and behaviors. A sample of 149 co-residing mothers and their adolescent or adult child with autism was drawn from a large, longitudinal study. Maternal warmth and praise were measured using coded speech samples in which mothers talked about their son or daughter. A high level of relationship quality was associated with subsequent reductions in internalizing and externalizing problems as well as reductions in impairments in social reciprocity and repetitive behaviors. Maternal warmth and praise were also related to symptom abatement in the repetitive behaviors domain.

AB Context: Research on psychiatric disturbances in low-birth-weight (LBW) children (<= 2500 g), which has focused primarily on the extreme low end of the LBW distribution, has suggested an increased risk of attention, externalizing, and internalizing problems.
   Objective: To examine the long-term effects of LBW on psychiatric problems in socially disadvantaged children and in middle-class children.
   Design: A stratified random sample assessed at ages 6, 11, and 17 years.
   Setting: Random samples of LBW and normal-birth-weight children from newborn discharge lists (1983 through 1985) of 2 major hospitals in southeast Michigan, one serving an inner city and the other serving middle-class suburbs.
   Participants: Cohort members with 1 or more assessments (n=823).
   Main Outcome Measures: Attention, internalizing, and externalizing problems rated by mothers and teachers (Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's Report Form, respectively) at ages 6, 11, and 17 years, using standard cutoffs that identify children with disturbances above the normal range.
   Results: Low-birth-weight children had modest excesses of externalizing and internalizing disturbances (adjusted odds ratios = 1.53 and 1.28, respectively) (P = .001 and .02, respectively). An increased risk of attention problems was associated with LBW only in the urban community (adjusted odds ratio=2.78) (P=.001) and was greater among very LBW children (<= 1500 g) than heavier LBW children (1501-2500 g). In the suburban community, there was no increased risk for attention problems associated with LBW. Psychiatric outcomes of LBW did not vary across ages of assessments.
   Conclusions: Effects of LBW on psychiatric disturbance appear to be stable through the period of school attendance. The differential effect of LBW on attention problems between the 2 communities suggests the possibility of interplay between prenatal adversity and social environment.

AB This study examined parent and child reports of parenting practices separately to predict child and parent reports of child externalizing and internalizing features, as well as delinquent activity. Participants included 98 children (51 male, 47 female) from a community sample, aged 9-15 at the beginning of the study. Results revealed that child reports of parenting practices were significantly correlated with a greater number of indices of delinquency and conduct problems than were parent reports. Child reports of parenting also showed some association with delinquency at three yearly follow-ups, whereas parent reports did not. Finally, reports of negative parenting from both informants were concurrently related to internalizing characteristics. Implications for child assessment and planning interventions for children and parents are discussed.

AB We examined the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the stability of withdrawn behavior (WB) in childhood using a longitudinal multiple rater twin design. Maternal and paternal ratings on the withdrawn subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were obtained from 14,889 families when the twins were 3, 7, 10 and 12 years old. A longitudinal psychometric model was fitted to the data and the fit of transmission and common factor models were evaluated for each variance component. WB showed considerable stability throughout childhood, with correlation coefficients ranging from about .30 for the 9-year time interval to .65 for shorter time intervals. Individual differences in WB as observed by the mother and the father were found to be largely influenced by genetic effects at all four time points, in both boys (50-66%) and girls (38-64%). Shared environmental influences explained a small to modest proportion (0-24%) of the variance at all ages and were slightly more pronounced in girls. Non-shared environmental influences were of moderate importance to the variance and slightly increased with age, from 22-28% at age 3 to 35-41% at age 12 years. The stability of WB was largely explained by genetic effects, accounting for 74% of stability in boys and 65% in girls. Shared environmental effects explained 7% (boys) and 17% (girls) of the behavioral stability. Most shared environmental effects were common to both raters, suggesting little influence of rater bias in the assessment of WB. The shared environmental effects common to both raters were best described by a common factor model, indicating that these effects are stable and persistent throughout childhood. Non-shared environmental effects accounted for the remaining covariance over time.

AB The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the relations between three specific parenting behaviors (warmth, monitoring, and discipline) and two child outcomes (internalizing and externalizing problems) within the context of parental depression. Using an approach recommended by A. Caron, B. Weiss, V. Harris, and T. Carron (2006), unique and differential specificity were examined. Ninety-seven parents with a history of depression and 136 of their 9- to 15-year-old children served as participants. Children reported parenting behaviors and parents reported child problem behaviors. The findings indicated that warmth/involvement, but not monitoring or discipline, was uniquely related to externalizing problems and differentially related to internalizing and externalizing problems. The findings suggest that parental warmth has implications for interventions conducted with children living in families with a history of parental depression.

AB This study aims to assess social competence and emotional/behavioral problems and to examine the influence of some clinical and socio-demographic variables on psychological adaptation in transplanted children. Parents of 48 transplanted children and 88 healthy children aged 5-12 completed the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL) which measures social competence and emotional/behavioral problems, and a group of clinical and socio-demographic data. Findings showed that transplanted boys presented significantly less social competence than healthy boys. In contrast, transplanted girls revealed significantly less social competence, especially in school activities, more internalizing behavior problems, particularly in anxiety/depression, and aggressive behavior than healthy girls. Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that rejection problems are significant to explain somatic complaints. Our data suggest the importance of some clinical variables on psychological adaptation in children who have undergone organ transplantation.

AB Objective: This study assessed the unique and interactive effects of child maltreatment and mothers' physical intimate partner violence (IPV) status on low-SES African American children's psychological functioning.
   Methods: Mothers were recruited from a large, inner-city hospital, and those who met eligibility criteria were asked to complete a lengthy face-tor-face interview while their child was assessed separately but concurrently. The sample included 152 mother-child dyads. The children's mean age was 10 years, and 45% were male. Multivariate linear regression analyses tested the main and interactive effects of child maltreatment and mothers' exposure to physical IPV on children's psychological functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, traumatic stress symptoms), while controlling for covariates.
   Results: Children who experienced child maltreatment and children whose mothers experienced physical IPV had higher levels of psychological distress than their respective counterparts. Post hoc analysis of significant interaction effects indicated that child maltreatment was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems and traumatic stress only when mothers reported higher levels of physical IPV. This finding did not hold true for youth whose mothers did not acknowledge elevated rates of physical IPV.
   Conclusions: African American youth from low-SES backgrounds who are maltreated and whose mothers experience physical IPV are at particularly high risk for psychological distress. Targeted prevention and intervention programs are needed for these poly-victimized youth. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Internalizing disposition and preschool children's cortisol fluctuations
SO CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
DE childcare; children; cortisol; internalizing disposition; stress
ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; CARE; TEMPERAMENT; QUALITY; GENDER; AGE
AB Background Research on the impact of childcare suggested that young children's cortisol tends to increase or remain 'flat' across the day while their cortisol levels follow the typical circadian decrease between mid-morning and mid-afternoon at home. However, studies are needed to investigate what is happening to cortisol levels and whether individual variation exists in the cortisol rhythm in childcare.
   Methods Internalizing disposition was examined as a possible moderator of cortisol-linked stress response of young children in full-time, centre-based childcare. Ambulatory salivary sampling for cortisol was performed on 37 preschoolers at four different times for 10 consecutive school days. In order to test the interaction effect of internalizing disposition on cortisol levels, children were divided into four groups - the most internalizing group, the least internalizing group, and two groups in between, based on teacher-rated 'approach' scores.
   Results Repeated measure analyses of variance with polynomial contrast for time indicated that (1) a linear trend of significant increase between mid-morning and mid-afternoon exists for all children without group interactions; (2) quadratic and cubic trends exist and the interaction effects among the groups are significant, meaning the four groups are different in fluctuation pattern. Further analyses demonstrated that (1) the least internalizing children showed significant decreases in cortisol levels from morning to noon and after nap, although there is a considerable increase after lunch, (2) cortisol levels of the other three groups across the day fit the pattern of upward curve.
   Conclusion The tradition of the field in comparing mid-morning and mid-afternoon levels of cortisol as an indicator of childcare effect may not reflect individual variation in the fluctuation patterns of cortisol. Moderating effect of child characteristics needs to be considered in future research of childcare effect.

AB This meta-analytic review of 148 studies on child and adolescent direct and indirect aggression examined the magnitude of gender differences, intercorrelations between forms, and associations with maladjustment. Results confirmed prior findings of gender differences (favoring boys) in direct aggression and trivial gender differences in indirect aggression. Results also indicated a substantial intercorrelation ((r) over bar = .76) between these forms. Despite this high intercorrelation, the 2 forms showed unique associations with maladjustment: Direct aggression is more strongly related to externalizing problems, poor peer relations, and low prosocial behavior, and indirect aggression is related to internalizing problems and higher prosocial behavior. Moderation of these effect sizes by method of assessment, age, gender, and several additional variables were systematically investigated.

AB Although many studies suggest that family violence is associated with child psychopathology, multiple features of the home environment might account for this association, such as poverty and caregiver psychopathology. Studies are needed examining how change in psychopathology symptoms is affected by home violence, controlling for children's own developmental symptom histories and other predictors of psychopathology. This study used latent difference score structural equation modeling to test if witnessing home violence and/or experiencing harsh physical discipline predicted changes in psychopathology symptoms among 2,925 youth aged 5-16 years previously exposed to violence. Results demonstrated that harsh physical discipline predicted child-specific changes in externalizing symptoms, whereas witnessing violence predicted child-specific changes in internalizing symptoms across time. Implications for research and policy are discussed.

TI Subclinical Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children and Adolescents:
   Additional Results From a "High-Risk" Study
SO CNS SPECTRUMS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP; COMMUNITY SAMPLE; FAMILY; 2-YEAR; SYMPTOMS; SCALE
AB Introduction: The concept of subclinical obsessive-compulsive disorder is explored using data from a "high-risk" study of offspring of persons with (OCD) and offspring of controls. Offspring with OCD were compared to those with subclinical OCD, and those without either condition. Subclinical OCD is defined as the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions without functional impairment.
   Methods: Adults with OCD and their offspring 7-18 years of age were recruited through a tertiary care center psychiatric outpatient clinic, while controls (and their children) were recruited via advertisement. Parents and offspring were assessed using structured interviews and validated questionnaires at baseline and follow-up interviews.
   Results: Offspring from both proband groups were pooled to create three subject groups: group 1, offspring with neither condition (n=43); group 2, offspring with subclinical OCD (n=24); and group 3, offspring with full OCD (n=11). Offspring with subclinical OCD held the middle ground for most comparisons. They were more symptomatic than offspring without either condition (group 1), but less symptomatic than subjects with OCD (group 3). Across the board, comparisons of diagnoses, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) results; Motor tic, Obsessions and compulsions, Vocal tic Evaluation Survey results; and Leyton Obsessional Inventory (LOI) results were associated with subject group at baseline and follow-up. In post-hoc comparisons, subjects with subclinical OCD had fewer comor-bid anxiety disorders and lower CBCL internalizing scale scores at follow-up. Parents of children with OCD had higher LOI symptom and severity scores than parents in those of groups 1 or 2.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that subclinical OCD holds the middle ground between full-blown OCD and having neither condition in terms of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and severity, tics, associated mood/anxiety disorders, and general functioning. At least in persons at risk for OCD, the presence of subclinical OCD may herald the onset of OCD, though in others may be an independent condition that does not lead to full OCD.

AB The authors applied I-States as Objects Analysis (ISOA), a recently proposed person-oriented analytic approach, to the study of temperament development in 921 Norwegian children from a population-based sample. A 5-profile classification based on cluster analysis of standardized mother reports of activity, sociability, emotionality, and shyness at ages 18 months, 30 months, 4-5 years, and 8-9 years was interpretable and highly replicable. The prevalence of temperament profiles changed markedly with age, and individual stability in temperament profiles was significant. Specific typical and atypical developmental sequences of profiles were identified. Selective patterns of concurrent group differences in externalizing and internalizing problems by temperament profiles were remarkably similar across ages. The findings to some degree support the notion that individual temperament-variable values take on meaning in relation to the whole individual configuration and indicate some lawfulness in temperament changes over time. Future person-oriented studies of temperament development should replicate the current results using multiple data sources, rigorous tests of gender differences, and latent group modeling.

AB BACKGROUND: The prevalence of childhood obesity is rapidly increasing, and many obese children suffer from emotional and behavior problems and mental disorders. Associations with social stigmatization of obesity, maternal psychopathology, socioeconomic status (SES) and resilience factors are discussed. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize maternal psychopathology to have an impact on the psychological well-being of an obese child. We further hypothesize that competence factors Within the child are important key factors that influence the way a child deals with the psychological burden of obesity. METHOD: A referred clinical sample of 59 obese children with their mothers was assessed using a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis and questionnaires for child and maternal psychopathology, SES, body mass index (BMI), and percent overweight. Correlations, hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between mothers and child and the impact of potential predictors. RESULTS: Mental disorders were found in 37.3% of the obese children in our sample. Maternal anxiety predicted the mother reported child's internalizing problems as well as the child's depression and anxiety self-report scores. The mental disorder status of the mother predicted the child's internalizing problems, and maternal binge eating disorder (BED) had an impact on the mental disorder of the child. If the child's total competences were included in the hierarchical regression model they predicted the child's outcome in all three subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), thereby reducing the effect of maternal anxiety to influencing the child's depression scope only. Neither SES nor the child's percent overweight accounted for the child's wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Although maternal psychopathology and diagnosis of mental disorder had some impact on the psychological well-being of the child, the child's competences showed a significant negative association with the problem scales. More research on parental and children's skills and competences will highlight the complex interaction of childhood obesity comorbidity of mental disorders, and resilience factors and will lead to additional approaches for intervention.

AB Forty-eight children (M age = 4.8 years) infected with HIV/AIDS and living in the Dominican Republic were randomly assigned to a massage therapy or a play session control group. The children in the massage therapy group received two weekly 20-min massages for 12 weeks; the children in the control group participated in a play session (coloring, playing with blocks) for the same duration and length as the massage therapy group. Overall, the children in the massage therapy group improved in self-help abilities and communication, suggesting that massage therapy may enhance daily functioning for children with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, the HIV infected children who were six or older also showed a decrease in internalizing behaviors; specifically depressive/anxious behaviors and negative thoughts were reduced. Additionally, baseline assessments revealed IQ equivalence below normal functioning for 70 of the HIV infected children and very high incidences of mood problems (depression, withdrawn) for 40 of the children and anxiety problems for 20 of the children, suggesting the need for better monitoring and alternative interventions in countries with limited resources to improve cognition and the mental health status of children infected with HIV/AIDS.

AB Strong between-informant discrepancies are found in ratings of (pre)adolescent problems and in co-occurrence rates between different domains of psychopathology. These discrepancies can be caused by differences in the context of measurement and the perspective of informants. The aim of this study was to develop a "Multi-Informant Co-occurrence" model (MIC), which takes into account these differences in context and perspective. In a population-based cohort of (pre)adolescents (n = 2230) from a longitudinal study in the north of the Netherlands, internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) problems were rated by the (pre)adolescents themselves, their teachers, and their parents. As hypothesized Principal Component Analysis revealed four independent main components: Between-domain convergence was captured by a severity component (S), while between-domain discrepancy was captured by a direction component (D). Between-informant discrepancies were captured by a perspective (P) and a context (C) component. The use of this MIC-model will increase reliability and validity of measures of psychopathology and the four components each provide useful specific information.

ID PAIN; CHILDREN
AB Objective: Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in children. However, parents often hesitate to agree to the procedure because of concerns of the possible harmful impact on their child's psychological health. The present study was performed to examine the short-term psychological impact on children who had undergone tonsillectomy.
   Methods: Forty-three pediatric patients aged 3-11 years who underwent tonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. Postoperative pain was assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) on postoperative days 1, 2, 7, and 21. The Korean version of the Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL) was given to the parents of the children to evaluate the psychosocial effect of tonsillectomy on the preoperative day and on postoperative day 21.
   Results: There were no significant differences in postoperative pain according to age, tonsil size, degree of adhesion, or operation time. There was no significant relationship between postoperative pain score and K-CBCL score. Sociality, total behavioral problems, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, anxiety/depression, social immaturity, and emotional lability domain scores on the K-CBCL were improved significantly.
   Conclusions: Improvements in general emotional and social status were observed at 3 weeks after tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy itself does not have a harmful effect on children's psychological status. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EMOTIONALITY; TEMPERAMENT; CHILDREN
AB One of the purposes of the present study was to develop a scale of young children's self-regulation that measured 4 aspects of self-regulation : self-assertiveness, self-inhibition, attention shifting, and attention focusing. A second purpose was to examine the balance of those 4 aspects in relation to social skills and problem behavior. The parents of 452 preschool and kindergarten children rated their children on the self-regulation scale; in addition, the teachers of 262 preschool children rated those children's social skills and problem behavior. Factor analysis (using the principal factor method, Promax rotation) identified 4 factors or subscales, and 23 items. The reliability and validity of the overall scale were confirmed. Cluster analysis of standardized scores on the 4 subscales identified 6 clusters. A comparison of the scores on social skills and problem behavior in each cluster indicated the following : It is necessary for the acquisition of desired social skills that all 4 aspects of self-regulation have high scores. Low scores on all 4 aspects were related to internalizing problems ; high self-assertiveness scores combined with low self-inhibition and attentional control scores were related to externalizing problems.

AB Two studies investigated associations between family instability (changes in parents' intimate partners, work hours, residence, children's schools) and adolescent adjustment. In Study 1 (N = 141, M age = 15.23 years), instability was associated with increased caregiver-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors (including youth-reported cigarette use), reduced teacher-reported frustration tolerance, social skills, task orientation, and lower academic grades. Logistic regression results for instability exposure showed an increased risk for school suspensions, Person in Need of Supervision status, binge drinking, and marijuana use. In Study 2 (N = 225, M age = 13.37 years), instability was linked to adolescent-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors, teacher-reported disruptions. and lower English and math grades. Key sociodemographic factors and negative life events were statistically controlled in regression analyses. Results indicate that a more theoretically coherent measure of family instability, which is distinct from negative life events, may prove valuable in understanding the potentially adverse influence of instability on Youth.

AB The purpose of this study is to gain insight into the level of agreement, in terms of personal problems, between burn survivors and an informant with whom they have a close personal relationship. Participants in the study were 72 young adult burn survivors between the ages of 18 and 28 with a mean age of 20.9 +/- 2.6 years. There were 37 males and 35 females in the group. The mean total burn surface area was 55.34 +/- 19.9% with injuries occurring before the age of 18, a minimum of 2 years prior to the study with a mean of 14.3 +/- 4.9 years since burned. To assess this issue the participants completed The Young Adult Self-Report (YASR), and the informants completed The Young Adult Behavior Checklist (YABCL). In relationship to burn survivors, the informant group comprised 67% mothers, 3% fathers, and 30% domestic partners. Paired t-test and Pearson Correlations Coefficients were calculated to compare the differences and variance of the Total Problems Scale, Internalizing Scale and Externalizing Scale for the YABCL and YASR results. The family members of burn survivors reported more problems for their young adult relatives than did the informants of the reference population. In general, the YACBL scores were higher than and highly correlated to the YASR scores. Although there were not ethic differences in the YABCL and the YASR measures, the correlation between the YABCL and the YASR was excellent for Caucasian families but not good for Black and Hispanic families. This study supports concerns about the need for routine follow-up into adulthood for those individuals who were burned as children. This would seem to be especially critical for the female population.

Data were collected on a sample of preschool and kindergarten students (n = 149) from two medium-sized cities in the Midwest. Analyses of both the parent and teacher versions of the ECBPSS were correlated with the corresponding Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problem scale scores of the CBCL and the C-TRF. The present findings and future research directions and limitations are discussed.

AB Negative emotionality is considered to be the core of the difficult temperament concept (J. E. Bates, 1989; R. L. Shiner, 1998). In this correlational Study, the authors examined whether the relations between children's negative emotionality and problematic behavior (internalizing and externalizing) were partially mediated by parenting style (authoritative and authoritarian) in a community sample of 196 3-year-old children and their mothers. The authors assessed maternal perception of child negative emotionality using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (M. K. Rothbart, S. A. Ahadi, K. L. Hershey, & P. Fisher, 2001) and assessed problematic child behavior by means of maternal report using the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach, 1992). The results showed that the relations between child negative emotionality and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were partially mediated by mothers' authoritative parenting style. Moreover, when the authors used confirmatory factor analysis to decontaminate possible overlap in item content between measures assessing temperament and problematic behavior, the association between negative emotionality and internalizing behavior was fully mediated by authoritative parenting.

AB This study employed a correlated trait-correlated method application of confirmatory factor analysis to disentangle trait and method variance from measures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder obtained at the college level. The two trait factors were Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Inattention and DSM-IV Hyperactivity-Impulsivity. The two source factors were self-reports and parent-reports. Data were collected for an epidemiological sample (N= 1,079) of college freshmen stratified for race/ethnicity, gender, and ability level according to national targets for the U.S. college population. Results revealed (a) parents' ratings were better measures of internalizing behavioral dimensions and that students' ratings were better measures of externalizing dimensions of behavior, (b) informants have a greater impact on behavior ratings than the behavioral construct that is presumed to be the primary cause of the behavior as measured by the CARE, (c) relationships among the method factors revealed a substantial amount of unique variance among informants, and (d) relationships among trait factors were largely within expectation.

AB Two questions were investigated. First, are children with reading problems in first grade more likely to experience behavior problems in third grade? Second, are children with behavior problems in first grade more likely to experience reading problems in third grade? The authors explored both questions by using multilevel logistic regression modeling to analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K). After statistically controlling for a wide range of potential confounds, they found that children with reading problems in first grade were significantly more likely to display poor task engagement, poor self-control, externalizing behavior problems, and internalizing behavior problems in third grade. They also found that children displaying poor task engagement in first grade were more likely to experience reading problems in third grade. Collectively, these findings suggest that the most effective types of interventions are likely to be those that target problems with reading and task-focused behaviors simultaneously.

AB Objective Little is known about factors predicting in-hospital adjustment in children with chronic illnesses or about risk/protective factors for in-hospital behavior compared to out-of-hospital behavior. This study investigated the relationship between illness factors (chronicity and severity) and child adjustment in and out of the hospital. Methods Parents and nurses completed questionnaires about in-hospital and home behavior for a sample of 85 hospitalized children. Results In the hospital, children with acute illnesses demonstrated more internalizing behavior problems than children with chronic illnesses. Children with life-threatening illnesses had more internalizing and externalizing problems than children with non-life-threatening illnesses. Out of the hospital, children with chronic illnesses demonstrated more internalizing problems and a trend toward more externalizing problems than healthy children who later developed acute illnesses. Out of hospital behavior problems were unrelated to illness severity. Conclusions Results suggest that different illness factors may predict in-hospital as compared to out-of-hospital behavioral adjustment.

However, many empirical studies have shown that, in addition to elevations in internalizing symptoms, exposure to stressful life events also produces elevations in externalizing behaviors and conduct problems, which are important risk factors for substance-use disorders. The current study tested adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms as competitive mediators of the effects of stressors on young adult drug dependence. Method: Data from an ongoing study of children of alcoholics (n = 223) and matched controls (n = 204) were collected in two annual interviews in adolescence and two follow-ups in young adulthood. Results: Experiencing stressful life events during adolescence led to increases in both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, but only externalizing symptoms mediated the later effects of adolescent stressors on young adult drug dependence. Conclusions: These findings suggest that understanding how stressors produce elevations in behavioral problems may provide important insights into understanding how broad environmental risk factors lead to substance dependence and suggests that processes other than affect regulation may operate in the pathway from the experiences of stressors to substance use and disorder.

AB Number of lifetime episodes, duration of current episode, and severity of maternal depression were investigated in relation to family functioning and child adjustment. Participants were the 151 mother-child pairs in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) child multi-site study. Mothers were diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder; children (80 males and 71 females) ranged in age from 7 to 17 years. Measures of child adjustment included psychiatric diagnoses, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and functional impairment. Measures of family functioning included family cohesion, expressiveness, conflict, organization, and household control; parenting measures assessed maternal acceptance and psychological control. Children of mothers with longer current depressive episodes were more likely to have internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with this association being moderated by child gender. Mothers with more lifetime depressive episodes were less likely to use appropriate control in their homes.

AB Sexual abuse in children not only occurs with alarming frequency, it also potentially leads to deleterious consequences for victims. Previous narrative reviews have touted the benefits of including the nonoffending caregiver in child sexual treatment. Objective: A meta-analysis is conducted to determine the effects of parent-involved treatment in four major child symptom areas: internalizing, externalizing, sexualized behaviors, and posttraumatic stress. Method: Only comparison/control group studies are included. Participant, treatment, and methodological characteristics of studies arc coded, as well as information to calculate effect sizes. An overall effect size is calculated, though the small number of studies precluded moderator analysis. Results: Seven studies are located that met the inclusion criteria. At posttest, treatment had small effects in the four outcome domains over alternative interventions and was reduced still further at follow-up. Conclusion: Parent-involved treatment confers some advantage over comparison conditions (typically child-only treatment).

AB Objective: We examined the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems, and associated factors in children and adolescents aged 6-18 years that were reared in orphanages. We aimed to compare these children and adolescents with a notionally representative age-matched sample that were raised by their own families and to identify mental health service needs in orphanages.
   Method: This cross-sectional study included 674 children and adolescents aged 6-18 years that were selected from orphanages using stratified and probability cluster sampling. A socio-demographic information form, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and Youth Self-Report Form (YSR) were used for data collection.
   Results: According to the information provided by coregivers, teachers, and youths, the prevalence of problem behaviors ranged between 18.3% and 47% among those in institutional care versus between 9% and 11% among the notional sample. Among those in institutional care, the prevalence of externalizing problems (21.4%-41.9%) was significantly higher than the prevalence of internalizing problems (6.2%-40.1%). At the syndrome level, the prevalence of social problems (5.7%-11.7%), thought disorders (7.2%-18.4%), and attention problems (7.7%-31.4%) among the youths in institutional care was higher than among the national sample (1.6%-5.8%). Age at first admission, receiving institutional care because of neglect and abuse, moves 2 or more times between institutions, recurrent physical illness, receiving poor quality care, lack of regular contact with parents or relatives, lack of regular contact with teachers and the institutional staff poor problem-solving skills, fatalistic beliefs, tobacco and alcohol use, the feeling of stigmatization, and low-level competency were significantly associated with an increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems. In this representative study, only 2.4% of the children received any mental health care services.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop alternative core models and routine screening for mental health. The training of professionals and development of mental health services for children in institutional care should be a priority.

ID CHILD HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; RECURRENT; ILLNESS; ISSUES; IMPACT
AB Background: This study aimed to clarify associations between pain, psychological adjustment, and family functioning with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a sample of adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) utilizing teen- and parent-report.
   Methods: Forty-two adolescents (between the ages of 12 and 18) with SCD and their primary caregivers completed paper-and-pencil measures of pain, teen's psychological adjustment, and HRQOL. In addition, primary caregivers completed a measure of disease-related parenting stress. Medical file review established disease severity.
   Results: Pearson correlations identified significant inverse associations of pain frequency with physical and psychosocial domains of HRQOL as rated by the teen and primary caregiver. Generally, internalizing symptoms (i.e. anxiety and depression) and disease-related parenting stress were also significantly correlated with lower HRQOL. Examination of possible mediator models via a series of regression analyses confirmed that disease-related parenting stress served as a mediator between pain frequency and physical and psychosocial HRQOL. Less consistent were findings for mediation models involving internalizing symptoms. For these, parent-rated teen depression and teen anxiety served as mediators of the association of pain frequency and HRQOL.
   Conclusion: Results are consistent with extant literature that suggests the association of pain and HRQOL and identify concomitant pain variables of internalizing symptoms and family variables as mediators. Efforts to improve HRQOL should aim to address internalizing symptoms associated with pain as well as parenting stress in the context of SCD management.

AB This pilot study examined preliminary effects of Parent Skills Training with Behavioral Couples Therapy on children's behavioral functioning. Participants were men (N = 30) entering outpatient alcohol treatment, their female partners, and a custodial child between 8 and 12 years of age. Couples were randomly assigned to one of three equally intensive conditions: (a) Parent Skills with Behavioral Couples Therapy (PSBCT), (b) BCT (without parent training), and (c) Individual-Based Treatment (IBT; without couples-based or parent skills interventions). Parents completed measures of child externalizing and internalizing behaviors at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6- and 12-month follow up; children completed self-reports of internalizing symptoms at each assessment. Only PSBCT participants reported significant effects on all child measures throughout the 12-month follow up. PSBCT showed medium to large effects in child functioning relative to IBT, and small to medium effects relative to BCT from baseline through follow up. Effect sizes suggest clinically meaningful differences between PSBCT and both BCT and IBT that warrant further empirical evaluation of BCT with parent training for alcohol-abusing men and their partners.

AB Context: Short sleep duration is associated with obesity, but few studies have examined the relationship between obesity and specific physiological stages of sleep.
   Objective: To examine specific sleep stages, including rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep and stages 1 through 4 of non- REM sleep, in relation to overweight in children and adolescents.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 335 children and adolescents ( 55.2% male; aged 7- 17 years) underwent 3 consecutive nights of standard polysomnography and weight and height assessments as part of a study on the development of internalizing disorders ( depression and anxiety).
   Main Outcome Measures: Body mass index ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) z score and weight status ( normal, at risk for overweight, overweight) according to the body mass index percentile for age and sex.
   Results: The body mass index z score was significantly related to total sleep time (beta=- 0.174), sleep efficiency (beta=- 0.027), and REM density (beta=- 0.256). Compared with normal- weight children, overweight children slept about 22 minutes less and had lower sleep efficiency, shorter REM sleep, lower REM activity and density, and longer latency to the first REM period. After adjustment for demographics, pubertal status, and psychiatric diagnosis, 1 hour less of total sleep was associated with approximately 2- fold increased odds of overweight ( odds ratio= 1.85), 1 hour less of REM sleep was associated with about 3- fold increased odds ( odds ratio= 2.91), and REM density and activity below the median increased the odds of overweight by 2- fold ( odds ratio= 2.18) and 3- fold ( odds ratio= 3.32), respectively.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm previous epidemiological observations that short sleep time is associated with overweight in children and adolescents. A core aspect of the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to reduced REM sleep. Further studies are needed to investigate possible mechanisms underpinning the association between diminished REMsleep and endocrine and metabolic changes that may contribute to obesity.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an empirically supported treatment for adult women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), has been increasingly adapted for use with adolescents across a variety of settings. This article describes a community-based application of DBT principles and strategies for adolescents and their families. It is the first study of DBT with suicidal and self-injuring adolescents to provide parent as well as adolescent reports of change. Uncontrolled pre- to posttreatment effects ranged from d =.62 to. 94 for adolescent-reported depressive symptoms, anger, dissociative symptoms, overall symptoms and functional difficulties, and items on which adolescents reported wanting to hurt or kill themselves. Not only did parents report similar changes (d =.55 to. 65) in adolescent internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors, they reported a large change (d =. 72) in their own depressive symptoms as well. The consistency of these effects with those of other preliminary studies of adolescent DBT suggests that this model is indeed feasible within a naturalistic community treatment setting and may have benefits for families as well as adolescents.

AB Background: This study examined the main and interactive effects of parental problem drinking and resilience on problem (externalizing and internalizing) behaviors among Korean adolescents.
   Methods: Data were collected from 482 adolescents (mean age = 14.4 years, 57% girls) from four middle schools in two urban areas in Korea. A revised version of Kim's measure (2003) and Hyun's Problems Behaviors Profiles (2000) were employed to measure resilience and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, respectively.
   Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that parental problem drinking was directly associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Further, the effects of parental problem drinking on both outcomes were moderated by resilience, such that the negative effects of parental problem drinking decreased in magnitude as resilience increased. Simple slope analyses showed that (1) the effects of parental problem drinking on externalizing behaviors were significant only at low levels of resilience and (2) the effects of parental problem drinking on internalizing behaviors were significant at low and average levels of resilience.
   Conclusions: Resilience may confer some protection against the adverse effects of parental problem drinking among Korean adolescents, but these protective effects are small in magnitude. Results highlight the importance of further research on culture-specific dimensions of resilience among Korean Children of Alcoholics (COAs). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate measurement of behavioral functioning is a cornerstone of research on disparities in child development. This study used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) data to test measurement invariance of the Behavior Problem Index (BPI) during middle childhood across three ethnic groups. Using the internalizing and externalizing behavior problem division derived by Parcel and Menaghan (1988) and suggested for use with NLSY79 data, the configural invariance hypothesis was not supported. The BPI factor structure model was revised based on theoretical considerations using the division of items from the Child Behavior Checklist. This model demonstrated configural invariance across ethnic groups and over time. Moreover, measurement invariance of factor loadings and thresholds across ethnic groups at each time point and within each ethnic group over time was also supported. The implications of these findings for educational and cross-cultural research are outlined.

AB Aim This study explored the contribution of two psychosocial factors, locus of control (LOC) and perceived parenting style, to symptoms of internalizing disorders in children with Tourette syndrome (TS). This contribution was further evaluated in relation to TS severity. Methods Sixty-five children (53 boys, 12 girls) ages 9.0-16.9 years, of normal intelligence, completed questionnaires evaluating their depression and anxiety symptoms, LOC, and maternal parenting style. Their mothers rated TS severity, determined by tic severity, symptoms of attention-deficit hypreactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive symptoms (OCS) Results Higher rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with a more external LOC and a more rejecting and controlling parenting style. Additionally, depression correlated significantly with tic severity, ADHD and OCS, whereas anxiety correlated only with ADHD symptoms and OCS, but not with tics. Regression analyses showed that LOC, OCS and ADHD symptoms each significantly contributed to predicting anxiety level, whereas LOC and ADHD symptoms significantly contributed to predicting depression symptoms. Conclusions Rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with TS are markedly influenced by psychosocial factors, extending beyond the influence of ADHD and OCD, both common comorbid disorders in TS. An internal LOC, which is associated with an accepting and autonomy-granting parenting style, appears to be a protective factor against anxiety and depression.

AB This study merged stress-and-coping research with the social model of disability to describe the most frequently experienced disability-related events experienced by 19 parents with acquired physical disabilities and their adolescent children, and examined the relations between these events, severity of disability, and psychological adjustment. Parents and adolescents reported many more positive than negative disability-related events, although parents reported significantly more negative events than did their children. Frequency of parents' experienced negative disability-related events correlated significantly with self-reported anxiety, depression, and weaker feelings of parental self-efficacy, with their reports of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems, and with adolescents' self-reports of depression, anxiety, and lower self-esteem. Frequency of adolescents' negative disability-related events correlated significantly with self-reported depression and lower self-esteem, and approached significance with self-reported anxiety. There were no significant associations between parents' positive events and self-reported or adolescent adjustment. Total frequency of adolescents' positive events correlated significantly with less parent-reported anxiety. There were several significant associations between parental rating of severity of disability and number of physical limitations with their and their children's adjustment. Implications for understanding the daily effects of parental physical disability on parents and their adolescent children are discussed, and recommendations are suggested for prevention interventions.

AB Background: Previous theory and research suggest links between substance use and externalizing behavior problems, but links between substance use and internalizing problems are less clear. The present study sought to understand concurrent links among diagnoses of substance use disorders, internalizing disorders, and behavior disorders at age 18 as well as developmental trajectories of illicit substance use prior to and after this point. Methods: Using data from 585 participants in the Child Development Project, this study examined comorbidity among substance use, behavior, and internalizing disorders at age 18 and trajectories of growth in illicit substance use from age 12 to age 22. Results: In this community sample, meeting diagnostic criteria for comorbid internalizing disorders, a behavioral disorder (conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder) alone, or both internalizing and behavioral disorders predicted higher concurrent substance use disorders (abuse, dependence, or withdrawal). Meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder alone or depression alone did not predict higher concurrent substance use diagnoses. Over time, youths with behavioral disorders at age 18 showed a pattern of increasing substance use across early adolescence and higher levels of substance use than those with no diagnosis at age 18. Substance use declines from late adolescence to early adulthood were observed for all groups. Conclusions: Substance use disorders were more highly comorbid with behavior disorders than with internalizing disorders at age 18, and behavior disorder and comorbid behavior-internalizing disorders at age 18 were related to trajectories characterized by steep increases in illicit substance use during adolescence and high rates of illicit substance use over time.

AB This study examined the impact of treatment adherence and therapist competence on treatment outcome in a controlled trial of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) for adolescent substance use and related behavior problems. Participants included 136 adolescents (62 CBT, 74 MDFT) assessed at intake, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Observational ratings of adherence and competence were collected on early and later phases of treatment (192 CBT sessions, 245 MDFT sessions) by using a contextual measure of treatment fidelity. Adherence and competence effects were tested after controlling for therapeutic alliance. In CBT only, stronger adherence predicted greater declines in drug use (linear effect). In CBT and MDFT, (a) stronger adherence predicted greater reductions in externalizing behaviors (linear effect) and (b) intermediate levels of adherence predicted the largest declines in internalizing behaviors, with high and low adherence predicting smaller improvements (curvilinear effect). Therapist competence did not predict outcome and did not moderate adherence-outcome relations; however, competence findings are tentative due to relatively low interrater reliability for the competence ratings. Clinical and research implications for attending to both linear and curvilinear adherence effects in manualized treatments for behavior disorders are discussed.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type (ADHD-HI) and ADHD combined type (ADHD-C) have different levels of functional impairment in four domains: externalizing (oppositional and disruptive) behaviors, internalizing (anxious) behaviors, social skills, and preacademic functioning. Methods: The subjects were 102 children 3 to 5 years of age, meeting DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Children with ADHD-C versus ADHD-HI were compared across at least two measures for each of the four functional domains. oppositional and anxious behaviors were assessed on the Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales. In addition, off-task and disruptive behaviors were assessed by direct observation in the preschool setting. Social skills were assessed on the parent and teacher versions of the Social Skills Rating System and preacademic skills were assessed on the letter word identification, passage comprehension, and applied problems. subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement and the initial sound fluency subtest of the Dynamic indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills 5th Edition. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups on rating scale T scores for parent-reported oppositional symptoms (ADHD-C vs ADHD-HI; 66.7 +/- 13.5 vs 65.7 +/- 11.7; p = .73); parent-reported anxious symptoms (53.5 +/- 11.1 vs 53.2 +/- 9.7; p = .90); teacher-reported oppositional symptoms (70.9 +/- 15.6 vs 75.5 +/- 14.7; p = .17); or teacher reported anxious symptoms (59.2 +/- 11.6 vs 58.5 +/- 12.2; p = .77). No statistically significant differences were found between the groups when examining off-task and/or disruptive behavior during structured and free play observations at school. No significant differences between the subtypes were found for social skills or preacademic functioning. Conclusions: Across the four areas of functioning assessed in this study, preschool children with ADHD-HI and those with ADHD-C demonstrated similar levels of functioning. This study, in combination with data from longitudinal studies demonstrating that most children with ADHD-HI are later diagnosed with ADHD-C, suggests that ADHD-HI may represent an earlier form of ADHD-C as opposed to a distinct subtype.

AB Objective: Childhood obesity is linked with a number of problematic health conditions. While data suggest that children who are obese are at increased risk of psychosocial distress relative to nonobese peers, there are limited data outlining the rates of psychiatric diagnoses in children with obesity-related health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Methods: This study used Medicaid claims data from the State of Florida to compare the rates of psychiatric diagnoses for children with obesity-related health conditions, aged 5 to 18 years, to those of children with comparison chronic health conditions. Results: Overall, 35% of children with an obesity-related diagnosis had a psychiatric diagnosis. While controlling for age, gender, and race, youths with type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia had higher rates of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) psychiatric diagnoses than children with cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (p < .001), but similar to those of children with asthma. Non-Hispanic white children with an obesity-related health condition had greater odds of receiving a psychiatric diagnosis than African American (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, p < .001) or Hispanic (OR = 0.41, p < .001) children. Males and females differed in rates of externalizing and internalizing diagnoses. Conclusions:The data suggest that children with an obesity-related health condition have higher rates of internalizing and externalizing mental health conditions relative to children with other chronic health conditions. Prospective, longitudinal research is needed to further confirm these findings and examine factors that affect this association and potential impacts on the health care system.

AB This study used self-report symptom inventories administered in school classrooms to examine relations among gender, psychological symptoms, stress, and coping in 1,200 low-income African American urban early adolescents. Girls reported more symptoms than boys, accounted for by higher internalizing symptoms. Boys reported more stress than girls, particularly major events, controllable events, exposure to violence, and sexual stressors. Boys in gangs reported greater exposure to sexual stressors than non-gang members. Expressing feelings coping, used more by girls, was related to more symptoms and is posited to be a type of co-rumination. Rumination coping, used as a primary strategy by both boys and girls, was related to higher symptom levels. Risk to low-income African American boys from high violence exposure and sexual stressors, the problematic effect of maladaptive coping strategies for youth exposed to high stress, and how culture and experience are relevant to understanding gender differences in psychological symptoms are discussed.

AB To explore the link between interparental hostility and adolescent problem behaviors, the current study examines four important maternal parenting dimensions as potential mediators: acceptance, harshness, inconsistency, and psychological intrusiveness. With a primary sample of 1,893 sixth-grade students, the measures included adolescent and teacher reports. Structural equation modeling revealed that each parenting construct partially mediated both internalizing and externalizing adolescent problems. Harshness was the strongest mediator for adolescent externalizing. Psychological intrusiveness and low maternal acceptance were the strongest mediators for adolescent internalizing. Inconsistency linked similarly to both internalizing and externalizing. Stronger linkages were found in families with married parents compared to those with divorced parents, but overall the patterns were similar. Youth gender and ethnic differences in the spillover processes were minimal. The findings provide a process model for understanding interparental conflict and adolescent problems.

AB Parentification, a parent-child dynamic wherein children come to provide ongoing emotional support for their parents, has been documented extensively in the clinical literature; however, it rarely has been studied systematically. Using a community sample of 83 couples and their adolescent children (mean age = 15.26 years; 52% male, 48% female), the authors linked adolescent self-report of parentification to specific youth and adult behaviors using multiple methods and examined its associations with youth adjustment problems. The parentification measure demonstrated strong internal consistency and 1-year stability. Parentification was associated with marital conflict, youth perceptions of threat, low warmth in the parent-child relationship, and the tendency for youths to intervene in marital conflict. Links were also found with youth reports of internalizing and externalizing behavior and poorer competency in close friendships. These findings thus support the parentification construct and provide evidence that parentification may contribute to poor youth outcomes by burdening children with developmentally inappropriate responsibilities.

AB Objective To assess the quality of life and psychosocial functioning among pediatric patients with Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD) types Ia and Ib. Methods Thirty-one youth with GSD types Ia and Ib and 42 healthy controls participated. Quality of life ratings from the GSD types Ia and Ib sample were compared with a previously reported clinical comparison sample. Children completed measures of quality of life, loneliness, family functioning, and sibling relationship quality (e. g., warmth, conflict). Parents completed measures of parental distress, parenting stress, child adaptive behavior, and child emotional and behavioral functioning. Results Quality of life was generally lower in youth with GSD relative to healthy controls but similar to those with a chronic illness. Children with GSD were rated as having more internalizing symptoms, social problems, and lower independent functioning relative to healthy controls. Parents reported greater distress and parenting stress relative to healthy controls. Conclusions The presence of GSD types Ia and Ib are associated with reduced quality of life and independent functioning, and elevated levels of internalizing distress and parental stress relative to healthy peers. Relative to their children, parents generally reported that their child was more impaired, which suggests the need for multiple informants during assessment and active parental involvement during psychological treatment. These points should be kept in mind when assessing and treating youth with this disease and their families as psychological interventions that target areas of concern (e. g., adherence, coping with having a chronic disease) may be helpful for improving child and family outcomes.

AB Young children with problem behavior in the classroom are at risk for developing more conflictual and less close relationships with their teachers. Two studies in kindergarten (N=3798; N=237) shed light on some aspects of classroom climate that can moderate this risk for relational problems. Results showed problematic classroom compositions, in terms of high average levels of internalizing or externalizing behavior, to exacerbate the risk for teachers to form more conflictual relationships with children showing externalizing behavior. Additionally, observed emotional support of teachers was found to be protective for the relational functioning of children at risk due to maladjusted behavior. Specifically, with emotionally supportive teachers, children who expose internalizing or externalizing behavior are no longer at risk for developing less close or more conflictual relationships with their teachers respectively. Practical implications and limitations of the studies are reported and suggestions are made for future research. (C) 2007 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the trajectories of depressive symptomology and self-concept in adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 and to determine whether primary school teacher ratings of adaptive and maladaptive behavior predict self-reported depressive symptoms and self-concept in adolescence. This study is part of an ongoing longitudinal study of a school-based sample of students representing a continuum of risk for developing emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD; N= 212). Results indicated a strong relationship between depressive symptoms and self-concept for both initial status and growth over time (i.e., depressive symptoms decreased, whereas self-concept improved). No effect was found for gender on initial status or growth for either construct. However, for self-concept. the growth trajectory indicated a significant effect for risk classification (not at risk, at risk no special education placement, at risk special education placement). Compared with the other classification groups, adolescents in special education at risk for EBD showed a significant decrease in self-concept after age 15, a markedly different trajectory from their peers. Additionally, high internalizing behavior was associated with more depressive symptoms and lower self-concept. Finally, early teacher ratings of adaptive behavior were predictive of both initial status and growth for depressive symptoms, but only initial status for self-concept. Implications for depression prevention and intervention among children and adolescents are discussed.

AB Research examining the relationship between internalizing symptoms and antisocial behaviors has generally been cross-sectional in design. Thus, although extant data have substantiated a strong correlation between internalizing symptoms and antisocial behaviors, few studies have focused on describing the nature of the co-occurrence over time. This study examined the relation between growth in internalizing symptoms and longitudinal patterns of antisocial behavior in a sample of 283 inner-city males and their caregivers assessed as part of a longitudinal developmental risk study. Participants were assessed annually in four waves. Non-offenders and escalating offenders had lower levels of internalizing problems at wave 1 than did chronic minor and serious-chronic-violent offenders. Results revealed a developmental trend of decreasing internalizing problems across study years for most participants, as would be expected, with adolescents participating in serious, chronic, and violent patterns of antisocial behavior displaying greater internalizing problems than those participating in stable patterns of less serious or no antisocial behavior. Further, when there was escalation of seriousness and frequency of antisocial behavior, there also was increased internalizing problems relative to non-escalating juveniles. Results are discussed in the context of developmental psychopathology.

AB Knowledge of health-related quality of life (QOL) and psychosocial adjustment (PA) in children after renal transplantation (RTPL) is limited. QOL and PA were evaluated by standardized tests in patients after RTPL. Thirty- seven children of median age 14.5 years (range 6.5 +/- 17 years) were investigated a mean 4.5 years (range 0.5 +/- 12.8 years) after RTPL. Child- and parent- rated QOL was evaluated with the Child Quality of life Questionnaire of The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research Academical Medical Centre (TNO-AZL). PA was assessed by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) providing parental reports of a child's behaviour. In patients' self- ratings, the QOL dimension physical complaints (P < 0.0005) scored significantly better than that of healthy controls, whereas the dimension positive emotional functioning was impaired (P= 0.02). Parents rated motor functioning (P= 0.002), autonomy (P= 0.01), cognition (P= 0.04) and positive emotions (P < 0.0005) as significantly impaired. Parents also assessed PA significantly (P= 0.02) impaired with regard to internalizing behaviour. Dialysis duration, young age at RTPL, living- related donation, steroid treatment, adverse family relationships and maternal distress had a significantly negative impact on QOL and PA (P < 0.05). Patients rated QOL higher than did healthy controls. Parents evaluated their children's QOL and PA more pessimistically than did the patients themselves. Both illness-related variables and family environment played an important role.

AB The current study examined child- and parent-reported child psychosocial functioning in a large sample of children who received solid organ transplantation. Participants included 64 children who received kidney or liver transplantation and 64 parents who completed a standardized measure of children's psychosocial functioning (BASC; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992). Although post-transplant children reported significantly fewer psychosocial difficulties than the normative average, parents reported that children had some psychosocial difficulties, particularly internalizing problems. There were no differences in psychosocial functioning between deceased donor organ and living donor organ recipients. Given the discrepancy between parent and child report, the results suggest that children may underreport psychosocial difficulties following transplantation or parents may over-report children's difficulties. Clinicians and researchers are encouraged to obtain assessment information from multiple reporters when assessing psychosocial functioning in this population.

AB BACKGROUND. No study has investigated the association between enterovirus 71 central nervous system infection and symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In this study we evaluated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - related symptoms and internalizing problems as long-term sequelae resulting from enterovirus 71 central nervous system infection in children.
   METHODS. We enrolled 86 children 4 to 16 years old with virus-culture - confirmed enterovirus 71 infection and central nervous system involvement diagnosed 3 to 7 years before the study and 172 control subjects, matched for age, gender, and parents' education levels. Their mothers and teachers were asked to report on possible attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - related symptoms, and their mothers were asked to report on possible internalizing problems. All of the children previously infected with enterovirus 71 received intelligence tests.
   RESULTS. Forty-two (49%) of the children previously infected with enterovirus 71 had had viral meningitis; 35 (41%) had severe central nervous system involvement, such as encephalitis, poliomyelitis-like syndrome, or encephalomyelitis; and 9 (10%) had cardiopulmonary failure and central nervous system involvement. The children previously infected with enterovirus 71 had higher scores than matched control subjects on teacher- and mother-rated scales of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, oppositional symptoms, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder index. The rate of elevated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - related symptoms among children with enterovirus 71 central nervous system infection was 20%, whereas that rate among matched control subjects was only 3%. They also had more internalizing problems. Their verbal and performance IQs, as well as verbal comprehension indices, were significantly inversely correlated with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder index scores.
   CONCLUSIONS. Enterovirus 71 central nervous system infection may affect long-term regulation of attention and emotion and cause hyperactivity-impulsivity in children.

AB To estimate the personality profile for adolescents at psychopathological risk, a community sample of 762 adolescents, ages 12 to 16 years (M= 13.8, SD= 1.3), 53% boys and 47% girls, from the city of Barcelona, Spain, were tested with the Youth Self-Report and the High School Personality Questionnaire. Among this group, 140 adolescents were identified as showing symptoms of psychopathological risk for internalizing or externalizing syndromes as defined by Achenbach's theory. Analysis indicated that adolescents who scored high for internalizing and externalizing symptoms showed differing personality profiles, which also differed by sex. Boys scoring high on internalizing tended to adopt an inhibited, shy, and apprehensive behavior, while girls showed a tendency to display a more distant and cold affect and changeable emotionality. The personality pattern of boys and girls who scored high on externalizing symptoms showed both similar and different aspects. Both sexes displayed characteristics such as dominance, poor rule conformity, and low self-discipline. However, girls who scored high on externalizing symptoms also tended to show impulsiveness, social boldness, and low sensitivity.

AB Behavioral problems in young children can take on a variety of forms, which are [inked to distinct antecedents and co-occurring markers. Internalizing difficulties in young children, for example, have been linked to individual differences in infant temperament and cortisol levels. In addition, there is growing evidence that these biobehavioral. mechanisms are also shaped by gender. Four-year-old children participated in a study examining the relations between salivary cortisol and behavioral maladjustment as a function of gender and temperament. Both longitudinal (maternal report of infant temperament at 9 months) and concurrent (morning salivary cortisol at age 4) data were used to predict two forms of maladjustment: 'Withdrawal' (maternal report of internalizing behavior and Laboratory observation of social reticence) and 'Acting Out' (maternal report of externalizing behavior and laboratory observation of solitary active play). High basal cortisol levels were strongly associated with Withdrawal in mate participants. However, the relation was significant only in boys who exhibited high levels of negative temperament in infancy. There were no comparable findings with 'Acting Out' beyond a main effect of gender reflecting greater difficulty in boys. The data suggested that there are unique biobehavioral mechanisms shaping specific patterns of maladjustment in childhood. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our objective was to compare cognitive, educational and psychosocial outcomes, and quality of life (QOL) of pediatric hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) survivors with those of their siblings, 2 years post-HSCT. Forty-six HSCT survivors, with age ranging from 3 to 16 years, and 33 siblings, with age ranging from 3 to 20 years, participated. Standardized tests were performed and questionnaires were completed by the participating children and their mothers. Survivors' full, verbal and performance IQ scores did not differ significantly from those of their siblings. Survivors, however, had significantly higher perceptual organization scores than their siblings. Siblings' mean scores on spelling were significantly higher than those of survivors, but arithmetic and reading scores were not. Siblings had significantly more internalizing problems than survivors. Siblings' physical QOL scores were significantly better than those of survivors. Finally, child age, maternal depression scores and age, and family cohesion were related to cognitive and educational differences. A history of cranial radiation and a diagnosis of neuroblastoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma in survivors were related to the difference in internalizing scores. Except for some deficits in educational outcomes and physical QOL, survivors' cognitive and psychological outcomes at 2 years post-HSCT were similar to those of their siblings. Family and clinical factors were identified as critical for these outcomes.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the role of organised sport participation as a moderator of the links between shyness and psychosocial maladjustment in childhood. Participants at Time I were 355 elementary schoolchildren (M-age = 10.1 years, SD = 0.6); at Time 2, 1 year later, 201 children (56%) were retained. At both time points, children completed self-report assessments of their shyness and aggression, sport participation, and psychosocial adjustment. Parents also rated children's social skills. Overall, results indicated that sport participation was positively related to indices of positive adjustment (e.g., social skills, self-esteem). In contrast, shyness was associated with social skill deficiencies and internalizing problems. However, some evidence was also found to suggest that sport participation plays a unique protective role for shy children. Shy children who participated in sport over time reported a significant decrease in anxiety. Results are discussed in terms of the role of sport as a social context to enhance shy children's peer relations.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of child religiosity in the development of maladaptation among maltreated children.
   Methods: Data were collected oil 188 maltreated and 196 nonmaltreated children from low-income families (ages 6-12 years). Children were assessed oil religiosity and depressive symptoms, and were evaluated by camp counselors on internalizing symptomatology and externalizing symptomatology.
   Results: Significant interactions indicated protective effects of religiosity. Child reports of the importance of faith were related to lower levels of internalizing symptomatology among maltreated girls (t= -2.81, p <.05). Child reports of attendance at religious services were associated with lower levels of externalizing symptomatology among non trial treated boys (t= 1.94, p =.05).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that child religiosity may largely contribute to stress coping process among maltreated and nonmaltreated children from low-income families. The results also indicate that the protective roles of religiosity varied by risk status and gender.
   Practical implications: The results indicate that a range of child religiosity behaviors and practices can be assessed in translational prevention research. It is recommended that healthcare professionals, psychologists, and social workers working with maltreated children and their families assess for salience of religiosity and may encourage them to consider the role religiosity plays in the development of prevention and intervention programs to alleviate distress and enhance stress coping.

AB The diverse clinical presentation of refugee children and adolescents after their traumatic experiences requires a treatment model that can mitigate a number of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Refugee populations also require interventions that can adjust to the wide-ranging experiences likely encountered during preflight, flight, and resettlement. There is some evidence that immigration stressors or social stressors, such as discrimination, are associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in refugee youth. Therefore refugee youth may benefit from multiple levels of services, ideally integrated. This article focuses on the mental and behavioral health component of services for refugee youth.

ID RENAL-FAILURE
AB The purpose of this study was to assess illness severity and its relation to psychosocial factors in children with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD) and kidney diseases (KD), two chronic health conditions having received little empirical study in the pediatric psychology literature. A secondary goal was to assess families' use of physicians for psychosocial support. Participants included 64 caregiver-youth (youths aged 8-20 years) dyads. Children with diagnoses of PIDD or KD were placed into one of three illness severity groups (mild, moderate, severe) based on objective ratings and compared with a healthy comparison group. Results indicated that children with mild illness reported less adaptive coping, and their caregivers reported more maladaptive coping compared to the other groups. In addition, children in the mild severity group were reported to have higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. Physicians were being utilized at a high rate by all groups regarding families's concerns of psychosocial issues. These findings have a number of clinical implications, including the importance of intervention for children and their caregivers across illness severity levels and the need for adequate education for physicians regarding psychosocial issues.

AB In a 19-year longitudinal study, the 15% most inhibited and the 15% most aggressive children at ages 4-6 years were followed up until age 23 years and were compared with controls who were below average in preschool inhibition or aggressiveness. As adults, inhibited boys and girls were judged as inhibited by their parents and showed a delay in establishing a first stable partnership and finding a first full-time job. However, only the upper 8% in terms of inhibition tended to show internalizing problems, including self-rated inhibition. Aggressive boys showed an externalizing personality profile in the parental and self-judgments, were educational and occupational underachievers, and showed a higher adult delinquency rate than the controls, even after sex and socioeconomic status were controlled. The results suggest delayed social transitions without internalizing problems for most male and female inhibited children and a significant long-term risk of an externalizing profile for aggressive children.

AB The authors examined the degree to which disparities in parent and child acculturation are linked to both family and child adjustment. With a sample of 1st- and 2nd- generation Mexican American children, acculturation and parent-child relationship quality at 5th grade, and parent-child conflict, child internalizing, and child externalizing at 7th grade were measured. Acculturation gaps with fathers were found to be related to later father-child conflict as well as internalizing and externalizing outcomes. Many of the associations between father-child acculturation gaps and outcomes were moderated by the child's report of the relationship quality between the child and his or her father. Father-child acculturation gaps were associated with negative outcomes only when children reported a poor relationship with their fathers. Mother-child acculturation gaps were not associated with mother-child conflict or adjustment indices.

AB Thirty-seven siblings (aged 6-18) of children with intractable epilepsy were surveyed regarding their anxiety, depression, and quality of life, by both self-report (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, RCMAS; Children's Depression Inventory, CDI; and Peds QL) and parental report (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL). Completed forms were returned by 37 of 58 (64%) eligible families. No sibling had a score in the clinical range on the CDI, and only 2 of 37 (6%) scored in the clinical range on the RCMAS, a proportion similar to the normative population. In contrast, 25% were rated by their parents to have elevated Internalizing Behaviors scores on the CBCL. There was a trend for PedsQL scores to be lower than the normative mean. Comorbid behavior and attention problems in the child with epilepsy and sibling CDI and RCMAS scores correlated significantly with self-reported quality of life. However, other epilepsy, child, and family variables (income, parental education, family function, maternal depression) did not correlate. We conclude that siblings of children with intractable epilepsy are functioning well overall and have a good quality of life. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The convergent validity and clinical utility of two parent-report child behavior. rating, scales, the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Parent Rating Scales (BASC-PRS),and Child Behavior Checklist/Ages 6-18 (CBCL), in children with epilepsy were examined. Analogous broadband and-narrowband behavior rating scales were evaluated in 60 subjects aged 6-17 years (mean = 11:0, SD = 3.4) with Full Scale-IQ > 70. Correlations for each similarly labeled scale were statistically significant (P < 0.002) and greater with broadband (r = 0.71-0.79) than with narrowband (r = 0.41-0.78) scales. The BASC captured significantly:less composite internalizing symptoms (P < 0.002), but more unusual thought processes (P < 0.0002) and attention problems versus a CBCL DSM-oriented attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scale (P < 0.002). Variation in the correlations between measures may stem from underlying differences between rationally-and empirically-derived approaches to test construction. Both the CBCL and BASC have diagnostic and clinical utility in assessing behavior problems in pediatric epilepsy. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Elucidating the genetic and environmental aetiology of effortful control (mother and father reports at two time points), attentional control (observer reports), and their associations with internalizing and externalizing symptoms (mother and father reports) is the central focus of this paper. With a sample of twins in middle childhood participating in the Wisconsin Twin Project, broad sense heritability for parental-report effortful control ranged from 68% to 79%, with a slightly higher heritability estimate of 83% for observer report attentional control, and no influence of the shared environment on either trait. Further, measures of control were negatively correlated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms longitudinally, concurrently, and across reporters. Importantly, shared additive genetic influence accounted for the covariation between the control variables and symptoms of psychopathology. These results encourage identification of common genes that affect both effortful control and symptoms, and environmental triggers that uniquely influence symptoms of psychopathology.

Analysis of the inter-relations was conducted between self-reported measures of political violence, socio-demographic characteristics, perceived parents' psychological adjustment problems and internalizing (i.e., somatization, withdrawal, anxiety, and depression) and externalizing (i.e., thought, attention and social problems, delinquent and aggressive behaviors) symptoms. It showed the significant net effect of retrospectively reported exposure to political violence on both internalizing symptoms and externalizing symptoms over and above the effect of socio-demographic characteristics and perceived parents' psychological adjustment problems. The discussion addresses the meaning of these results in light of the conceptual and methodological limitations of this study.

ID PROCESS MODEL; REINTERPRETATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Although bidirectional parent and child influences have been incorporated in theoretical models pertaining to the development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in youth, studies have historically focused on the socializing influence that parents have on their children. This has left several important research questions unanswered about the nature of bidirectional parent-child relations across development, including how these bidirectional effects are related to different types of child and adolescent psychopathology. The goal of this special section is to examine some longstanding issues regarding the nature of bidirectional parent-child effects across time using a diverse array of longitudinal datasets. The results from these studies emphasize the importance of considering bidirectional effects in developmental psychopathology research, particularly the often overlooked influence that children and adolescents have on their parents' behavior and emotional well-being. Following these empirical articles, an expert in the field provides a scholarly commentary designed to outline the progress that has been made in understanding bidirectional parent-child effects across development as well as to propose fruitful areas for future research.

AB Background: Little is known about the predictive association between childhood bullying behavior with depression and suicidal ideation at age 18.
   Methods: The sample included 2348 boys born in 1981. Information about bullying was gathered at the age of 8 from self, parent and teacher's reports. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed during the Finnish military call-up examination.
   Results: Based on regression models, boys who were bullies frequently, but not merely sometimes, were more likely to be severely depressed and to report suicidal ideation compared to boys who were not bullies. When controlling for depression at age 8 the association between frequent bullying and severe depression was maintained but the association with suicidal ideation became nonsignificant. Boys who were only victimized were not more likely to be depressed or to report suicidal ideation at age 18. Boys who were frequently both bullies and victims were found to be at risk for later depression.
   Limitations: Our finding can only be generalized to boys who were involved in bullying at elementary school age. Data at age 18 was based only on self-reports and the bullying/victimization questions were very general.
   Conclusions: Childhood bullying behavior is a risk factor for later depression. Screening and intervention for bullying behavior in the early school years is recommended to avoid subsequent internalizing problem in late adolescence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE ADHD symptoms; comorbid psychopathology; Russian adolescents
AB Objective: To assess the prevalence of ADHD symptoms and their relationship to psychopathology in adolescents from the European North of Russia. Method: The prevalence of ADHD symptoms is assessed by teacher reports in 536 adolescents. Internalizing and externalizing problems are assessed by teacher ratings and student self-reports. Results: Prevalence of individual ADHD symptoms ranges between 3.3% and 35%. Only 8.9% of boys and 3.6% of girls have positive ratings on six items in either inattention or hyperactivity subtype. These adolescents fare significantly worse regarding externalizing but not internalizing problems. Compared to girls with ADHD, boys with ADHD report higher levels of violent and nonviolent delinquency and are described by teachers as having more conduct problems. Possible ADHD status is associated with depressive symptoms in boys but not in girls. Conclusion: The estimates of ADHD prevalence rates obtained in this study are similar to those of other countries, suggesting the need for identification and treatment of the disorder. Evaluation of associated disruptive behavior disorders and depression, particularly in boys, is warranted. (J. of Att. Dis. 2008; 12(1) 54-63)

AB Background: Longitudinal studies on risk indicators of internalizing problems in childhood are in short supply, but could be valuable to identify target groups for prevention. Methods: Standardized assessments of 294 children's internalizing problems at the age of 2-3 years (parent report), 4-5 years (parent and teacher report) and 11 years (parent and teacher) were available in addition to risk indicators from the child, family and contextual domain. Results: 4 Low socioeconomic status, family psychopathology at child age 2-3, parenting stress at child age 4-5 years, and parents' reports of child internalizing problems at age 4-5 years were the strongest predictors of internalizing problems at the age of 11. If these early risk factors were effectively ameliorated through preventive interventions, up to 57% of internalizing cases at age 11 years could be avoided. Conclusions: Predictors from as early as 2-5 years of age are relevant for identifying children at risk of internalizing problems in late childhood. The methodological approach used in this study can help to identify children who are most in need of preventive interventions and help to assess the potential health gain and efficiency of such interventions.

AB The current study tests a theoretical model illustrating a potential pathway to reactive aggression through exposure to a traumatic event (Hurricane Katrina) in 166 adolescents (61% female, 63% Caucasian) recruited from high schools on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion. The proposed model fits well for both boys and girls; however, results suggest that minority youth in this sample were more likely to experience emotional dysregulation in relation to posttratlmatic stress than Caucasian youth. Further, results indicate that hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, and poorly regulated emotion are associated with reactive aggression even after controlling for proactive aggression. These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services. Researchers examining mental health problems in youth after a significant disaster have traditionally focused on the presence of internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very little empirical attention paid to the incidence of post-disaster externalizing problems such as aggression. Specific types of aggressive responses, particularly those that involve poorly regulated emotion (i.e., reactive aggression), have been shown to be associated with a history of trauma and thus may be especially common following a traumatic event such as a hurricane.

AB Hurricane Katrina dramatically altered the level of social and environmental stressors for the residents of the New Orleans area. The Family Stress Model describes a process whereby felt financial strain undermines parents' mental health, the quality of family relationships, and child adjustment. Our study considered the extent to which the Family Stress Model explained toddler-aged adjustment among Hurricane Katrina affected and nonaffected families. Two groups of very low-income mothers and their 2-year-old children participated (pre-Katrina, n=55; post-Katrina, n=47). Consistent with the Family Stress Model, financial strain and neighborhood violence were associated with higher levels of mothers' depressed mood; depressed mood was linked to less parenting efficacy. Poor parenting efficacy was associated to more child internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB This study investigated the role of maternal psychopathology in predicting children's psychological distress in a disaster-exposed sample. Participants consisted of 260 children (ages 8-16) recruited from public schools and their mothers. These families were displaced from New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Assessment took place 3 to 7 months postdisaster. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that global maternal psychological distress and maternal posttraumatic stress disorder moderated the relation between child hurricane exposure and mother-reported child internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB Effects of lifetime histories of grandparental (G1) and parental (G2) major depressive disorder (MDD) on children's (G3) internalizing problems were investigated among 267 G3 children (ages 2-18 years) who received Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings and had diagnostic data available on 267 biological G2 parents and 527 biological G1 grandparents. Results indicated that G1 MDD conferred risk for G2 MDD, but not for G3 CBCL scores. G2 MDD predicted higher G3 Internalizing and Anxious/ Depressed scores. Also, there was an interaction between G1 MDD and G2 MDD in predicting higher G3 Anxious/Depressed scores such that scores were highest among children with both depressed parents and grandparents. These effects were robust to statistical adjustments for status variables and parental relationship measures but not to adjustment for concurrent parental depressive symptoms.

AB This article compares characteristics of families, mothers, and children on the basis of whether their household is multigenerational, using data from Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study, which samples low-income culturally diverse families. Few differences were found between multigenerational and nonmultigenerational households, although mothers in multigenerational households reported more internalizing behaviors and fewer positive behaviors in their children. However, interactions between household type, mothers' age, and race/ethnicity reveal that all multigenerational households are not alike. Multigenerational households with younger mothers tend to use less effective parenting and have children who are experiencing more problem behaviors. Race/ethnicity further moderates these associations in models predicting mothers' mental health and children's academic achievement. Possible reasons for these differences by mothers' age and race/ethnicity are discussed.

AB Faced with anywhere between one half and two thirds of its youth having a diagnosable mental illness, the identification and treatment of mental health concerns is a critically important endeavor for professionals working with youth who have contact with the juvenile justice system. In addition, the literature suggests that factors related to both the family and to the gender of the adolescent must be incorporated into any approach to assessment and intervention within this special population. Further, prior work that has documented the interaction of gender and family issues with adolescent race/ethnicity warrants further empirical attention, as does the intermediary role that the family may play in the development of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The present study extends this literature by examining factors related to gender, race/ethnicity, family factors, and mental health issues in a sample of 2,549 Caucasian and African American youth coming to the attention of juvenile courts. Multivariate analysis of variance results indicated significant main effects for gender and race/ethnicity, as well as a significant gender X race/ethnicity interaction for the family and externalizing variables. A multiple group structural equation modeling procedure was employed in order to test the hypothesis that family environment mediates the relationship between gender and mental health problems, as well as to test for potential differences in these relationships as a function of race/ethnicity. Results indicated support for the mediation model in the sample of African American youth but not in the sample of Caucasian youth.

AB Objective To describe developmental and functional outcomes of children with congenital heart defects (CHDs) at school entry after open heart surgery.
   Study design Infants with CHDs who underwent surgical repair in infancy were recruited and assessed prospectively for developmental progress. At 5 years of age (64.2 +/- 11.3 months), 94 subjects were evaluated in a blind fashion by using a variety of standardized measures.
   Results Mean IQ scores were in the low average range (90-94). Receptive language was in the average range (103.6 +/- 14.4). Behavioral difficulties were common (27.1%), with internalizing problems being more frequent. Functional limitations in socialization (93.0 +/- 17.1), daily living skills (94.6 +/- 16.4), communi-cation (90.0 +/- 14.1), and adaptive behavior (92.1 +/- 15.8) were noted in 11% to 17% of children. With the Functional Independence Measure for Children, 20% to 22% of subjects were more dependent than their peers in self-care and social cognition, although few (4.5%) had mobility restrictions. Predictors of developmental and functional limitations included: abnormal postoperative neurologic examination, microcephaly, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time, palliation, acyanotic heart lesion, age at surgery, and maternal education.
   Conclusions After infant open-heart surgery, children with CHDs may exhibit a range of developmental difficulties at school entry that enhances risk for learning challenges and decreased social participation.

AB Depression in childhood or adolescence is associated with increased rates of depression in adulthood. Does this justify efforts to detect (and treat) those with symptoms of depression in early childhood or adolescence? The aim of this study was to determine how well symptoms of anxiety/depression (A-D) in early childhood and adolescence predict adult mental health. The study sample is taken from a population-based prospective birth cohort study. Of the 8556 mothers initially approached to participate 8458 agreed, of whom 7223 mothers gave birth to a live singleton baby. Children were screened using modified Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scales for internalizing and total problems (T-P) at age 5 and the CBCL and Youth Self Report (YSR) A-D subscale and T-P scale at age 14. At age 21, a sub-sample of 2563 young adults in this cohort were administered the CIDI-Auto. Results indicated that screening at age 5 would detect few later cases of significant mental ill-health. Using a cut-point of 20% for internalizing at child age 5 years the CBCL had sensitivities of only 25% and 18% for major depression and anxiety disorders at 21 years, respectively. At age 14, the YSR generally performed a little better than the CBCL as a screening instrument, but neither performed at a satisfactory level. Of the children who were categorised as having YSR A-D at 14 years 30% and 37% met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and anxiety disorders, respectively, at age 21. Our findings challenge an existing movement encouraging the detection and treatment of those with symptoms of mental illness in early childhood. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To study whether prenatal smoking only relates to externalizing problems or whether it is associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems from childhood into late adolescence. Method: Child Behavior Checklist-derived, parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems of 396 children were longitudinally assessed at ages 5, 10 to 11, and 18 years. The influence of self-reported prenatal smoking on the course of internalizing and externalizing problems over these ages was assessed, controlling for the co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing problems and co-occurring pre- and perinatal risk factors, demographic characteristics, maternal mental health, and child social and attention problems. Results: Children whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy had increased levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems over the period of ages 5 to 18 years when compared with children whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy. These associations remained significant after controlling internalizing for externalizing and vice versa and possible confounding variables. Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a predictor of internalizing as well as externalizing psychopathology in offspring. The association between prenatal smoking and internalizing and externalizing problems persists throughout childhood and late adolescence.

AB Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group structural equation modeling were used to test correlates of overt and relational aggression between young adolescent siblings across four groups (i.e., male/male, male/female, female/male, and female/female sibling pairs), using 433 predominately European American families. Similar patterns of associations were found across groups when distinguished by gender composition. Family environment emerged as an important factor in explaining internalizing problems as well as overt/relational aggression for both younger and older siblings. While perceived maternal psychological control was significantly positively related to overt/relational aggression and internalizing problems for younger siblings, it was significantly positively associated with only relational aggression for older siblings. Findings also provided partial support for the positive linkages between young adolescents' aggression and their own and siblings' internalizing problems above and beyond the aforementioned family and maternal variables. Results of the current study extend the understanding of adolescent aggression to a new relational context, or among siblings, and highlight the role of family factors in promoting or buffering the impact of aggression on internalizing behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE. Although most children and adults who are born very preterm live healthy lives, they have, on average, lower cognitive scores, more internalizing behaviors, and deficits in social skills. This could well affect their transition to adulthood. We studied the tempo of first leaving the parental home and starting cohabitation with an intimate partner and sexual experience of young adults with very low birth weight (< 1500 g).
   METHODS. In conjunction with the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults, 162 very low birth weight individuals and 188 individuals who were born at term (mean age: 22.3 years [range: 18.5-27.1]) and did not have any major disability filled out a questionnaire. For analysis of their ages at events which had not occurred in all subjects, we used survival analysis (Cox regression), adjusted for gender, current height, parents' ages at the birth, maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational attainment, number of siblings, and parental divorce/death.
   RESULTS. During their late teens and early adulthood, these very low birth weight adults were less likely to leave the parental home and to start cohabiting with an intimate partner. In gender-stratified analyses, these hazard ratios were similar between genders, but the latter was statistically significant for women only. These very low birth weight adults were also less likely to experience sexual intercourse. This relationship was statistically significant for women but not for men; however, very low birth weight women and men both reported a smaller lifetime number of sex partners than did control subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS. Healthy young adults with very low birth weight show a delay in leaving the parental home and starting sexual activity and partnerships.

AB Schizophrenia is associated with severe deficits in social functioning. Similar deficits may be present prior to psychosis onset, in childhood and adolescence. If so, then prepsychosis social deficits could provide clues to the development of pathological processes in preschizophrenia children and could potentially improve early identification of the disorder and suggest targets for intervention. Evidence is reviewed from birth cohort, case-control, and familial high-risk studies within distinct periods of development to clarify the nature, timing, and specificity of social deficits in preschizophrenia children and adolescents. The results indicate that poor social functioning does differentiate preschizophrenia children and adolescents from their peers and can be a sensitive and potentially specific predictor of schizophrenia, not just psychopathology in general. Furthermore, age (but not sex) appears to be an important moderator of the strength and specificity of the association between particular social deficits (e.g., externalizing, internalizing) and later schizophrenia. Results are discussed in the context of current developmental theories of timing and pathophysiology of schizophrenia involving hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation. Implications for the early identification and treatment of preschizophrenia individuals are also considered.

AB Contradictory findings on the relationship between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity and externalizing behavior problems could be due to studies not accounting for issues of comorbidity and gender. In a population-based cohort of 1768 (10- to 12-year-old) early adolescents, we used a person-oriented approach and a variable-oriented approach to investigate whether comorbidity with internalizing behavior problems and gender moderate the relationship between HPA-axis activity (cortisol awakening response and evening cortisol levels) and externalizing behavior problems. We found that: (1) in early adolescents with pure externalizing behavior problems, there was a particularly strong effect of gender, in that girls showed significantly higher total cortisol levels after awakening (AUCG levels) and a significantly higher cortisol awakening response (AUC, levels) than boys. (2) Girls with pure externalizing behavior problems showed a significantly higher cortisol awakening response (AUC, levels) than girls without behavior problems or girls with comorbid internalizing behavior problems. This effect was absent in boys. (3) Externalizing behavior problems, in contrast to internalizing behavior problems, were associated with higher evening cortisol levels. This effect might, however, result from girls with externalizing behavior problems showing the highest evening cortisol levels. Overall, we were unable to find the expected relationships between comorbidity and HPA-axis activity, and found girls with pure externalizing behavior problems to form a distinct group with regard to their HPA-axis activity. There is need for prospective longitudinal studies of externalizing behavior problems in boys and girls in relation to their HPA-axis activity. It would be useful to consider how other risk factors such. as life events and family and parenting factors as well as genetic risks affect the complex relationship between externalizing behavior problems and HPA-axis activity.

AB This study assesses associations between mothers' use of relational aggression with their peers and psychological control with their children, and child adjustment in a sample of fifty U.S. mothers of elementary and middle school children. Mothers completed surveys assessing their relational aggression and psychological control. Teachers completed surveys assessing children's externalizing behavior, internalizing symptoms, and relational aggression. Results suggest that mothers who are relationally aggressive with their peers are more likely to be psychologically controlling with their children. Results also showed that relational aggression predicted adjustment problems in youth. Relational aggression was associated with externalizing problems among boys and girls, and with internalizing problems among boys. Few gender differences in mean levels of maternal or child behaviors emerged.

AB Background: The stimulation-seeking theory posits that individuals with low habitual autonomic arousal levels will seek stimulation to increase their arousal to more optimal levels. Because of their assumed high optimal stimulation levels, persons characterized by low autonomic arousal may be better able to endure stressors than those with higher levels. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that low resting heart rate (HR) and high respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) protect against the detrimental effects of stressors on mental health in early adolescents from the general population.
   Methods: Data were collected as part of TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a large prospective cohort of Dutch (pre)adolescents (N = 1478), with measurements at approximately age 11(T1) and age 13.5 (T2). Internalizing and externalizing mental health problems were assessed at both waves, using multiple informants. Resting HR ands RSA were assessed at T1 and the amount of parent-reported stressors and long-term difficulties at T2.
   Results: Stressors predicted mental health problems in adolescents with intermediate and high HR, but not in those with low HR. These findings were consistent regardless of the measure used to assess stressors and of adjustment for T1 mental health problems. Furthermore, the stress-buffering effects of low HR pertained to both externalizing problems and internalizing problems. No stress-buffering effects were found for RSA, suggesting predominantly sympathetic influences.
   Conclusions: Our study, which linked physiologic measures to stress sensitivity in real life, suggests that low HR is a marker of resilience to the effects of environmental challenges in early adolescence.

AB Building upon the link between inadequate parenting and child noncompliance, aggression, and oppositionality, behavioral parent training has been identified as a well-established treatment for externalizing problems in children. Much less empirical attention has been devoted to examining whether inadequate parenting and, in turn, behavioral parent training programs, have specific effects on child externalizing problems or more diffuse effects on both internalizing and externalizing problems. As an initial attempt to examine the specificity of parenting and childhood externalizing problems, this review examines prior research on the association of three parenting behaviors (parental warmth, hostility, and control) with child externalizing versus internalizing problems. Notably, findings revealed relatively little evidence for the specificity of parenting and child externalizing behaviors in the general parenting literature or in the family context of parent depression. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forty percent of participants scored 22 or higher on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, indicating that they might have a serious depression. Perceived personal control, subjective distress, and role disruption mediated the association between internalizing child behavior problems and depressive symptoms. Tangible social support moderated the association between internalizing behavior problems and depressive symptoms. Intangible social support moderated the association between externalizing behavior problems and depressive symptoms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The CDI was applied to 4,707 Spanish children and adolescents with an age range between 7 and 16 years. Results show that best models considered five or six factors, including Social Problems (Anhedonia), Negative Affect, Externalizing, School Problems, and Negative Self-Esteem (Self-Deprecation). Also, a factor of Biological Dysregulation obtained some support. Higher-order factors do not reproduce the classical distinction between internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Finally, no large developmental differences in the CDI structure were found between children and adolescents samples.

The children (N = 252) ranged from 6 to 12 years of age; most were male (71%) and over half were African American (59%). Externalizing behavior symptoms were associated with a younger age upon admission and internalizing behavior symptoms were associated with an older age. Parental social isolation was associated with a younger child's age upon admission, whereas difficulty with parental attachment was associated with an older age.

AB The present study aimed to examine somatic complaints in children with anxiety disorders compared to non-anxious control children and whether somatic complaints predict poorer academic performance. The sample consisted of 108 children and adolescents (aged 8-14 years) assessed by a structured diagnostic interview: 69 with a principal (i.e., most severe and/or interfering) anxiety disorder diagnosis and 39 non-anxious community controls. Established child and parent report measure of somatic complaints, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms were completed. The participants' primary teacher was used to assess academic performance. Findings indicated that children with anxiety disorders reported more somatic complaints than the non-anxious community controls. Furthermore, a greater frequency of somatic complaints uniquely predicted poorer academic performance beyond that accounted for by anxiety and internalizing symptoms based on both child and parent report measures. Knowledge about somatic complaints in children with anxiety disorders and their relation to academic functioning may allow for early identification and prevent academic problems.

AB This study examined youth mental health service (MHS) use as a function of family immigrant status and type of mental health need (internalizing vs. externalizing). A sample of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander families (youth ages 11-18; N = 457) involved with public sectors of care provided reports of youth mental health need during an initial interview and MHS use was examined prospectively over 2 years. While externalizing need predicted specialty and school-based MHS use in the overall sample, family immigrant status moderated the association between youth need and specialty MHS use such that immigrant youth were more likely to receive services for externalizing need and less likely to receive services for internalizing need relative to non-immigrant youth.

AB Using language appropriately and effectively in social contexts requires pragmatic language competencies (PLCs). Increasingly, deficits in PLCs are linked to child and adolescent disorders, including autism spectrum, externalizing, and internalizing disorders. As the role of PLCs expands in diagnosis and treatment of developmental psychopathology, psychologists and educators will need to appraise and select clinical and research PLC instruments for use in assessments and/or studies. To assist in this appraisal, 24 PLC instruments, containing 1,082 items, are assessed by addressing four questions: (1) Can PLC domains targeted by assessment items be reliably identified?, (2) What are the core PLC domains that emerge across the 24 instruments?, (3) Do PLC questionnaires and tests assess similar PLC domains?, and (4) Do the instruments achieve content, structural, diagnostic, and ecological validity? Results indicate that test and questionnaire items can be reliably categorized into PLC domains, that PLC domains featured in questionnaires and tests significantly differ, and that PLC instruments need empirical confirmation of their dimensional structure, content validity across all developmental age bands, and ecological validity. Progress in building a better evidence base for PLC assessments should be a priority in future research.

AB Children's behavior problems may stem from ineffective cortical mechanisms for regulating negative emotions, and the success of interventions may depend on their impact on such mechanisms. We examined neurophysiological markers associated with emotion regulation in children comorbid for externalizing and internalizing problems before and after treatment. We hypothesized that treatment success would correspond with reduced ventral prefrontal activation, and increased dorsomedial prefrontal activation, at the time point of an event-related potential (ERP) associated with inhibitory control. Twenty-seven 8- to 12-year-old children (with usable data) were tested before and after a 14-week community-based treatment program and assessed as to improvement status. Fifteen 8- to 12-year-olds from the normal population (with usable data) were tested over the same interval. All children completed an emotion-induction go/no-go task while fitted with a 128-channel electrode net at each test session. ERP amplitudes, and estimates of cortical activation in prefrontal regions of interest, were measured at the peak of the "inhibitory" N2 and compared between improvers, nonimprovers, and nonclinical children. ERP amplitudes showed no group differences. However, improvers showed an overall reduction in ventral prefrontal activation from pretreatment to posttreatment, bringing them in line with nonclinical children, whereas ventral activation remained high for nonimprovers. Both improvers and nonimprovers showed high dorsal activation relative to nonclinical children. Supplementary analyses indicated that only ventral prefrontal regions, and only within the N2 time window, showed decreased activity from pre- to posttreatment, suggesting changes in regulatory processes rather than in overall emotional arousal. These cortically mediated changes may permit a reduction in the overengaged, rigid style of emotion regulation characteristic of children with behavior problems.

AB Objective To determine the level of behavioral and emotional problems among a sample of Algerian children and adolescents aged 6-18 years living in Algiers. Method A school-based sample of 1,405 children and adolescents was recruited; problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist filled out by parents or surrogates. Results The scores varied with age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Contrary to findings in other samples, most Problem scores increased with age. As found in many other cultures, girls scored higher than boys on the Internalizing scales, but lower on Externalizing scales. Youths from lower socioeconomic families tended to score higher on some Problem scales. But, above all, Algerian children and adolescents had raw scores on all Problem scales much higher than those yielded by most previous cross-cultural studies. Conclusions The high level of problems may be attributable to traumatic environmental factors (terrorism and natural catastrophes), but the lack of data from countries that have similar geographic and cultural environments makes it hard to exclude explanations based on cultural factors.

AB We examined differences in self-reported anxiety and depression according to the number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age = 11.87, S.D. = 2.67; range = 7-17) with a primary diagnosis of social phobia. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) children with comorbid anxiety disorders would show significantly higher scores than children with social phobia-only on self-report measures, (2) self-report measures would significantly differentiate between children with social phobia and comorbid internalizing versus externalizing disorders, and (3) self-report measures would significantly differentiate children according to the type of anxiety comorbidities present. Multinomial logistic regressions showed that children with three anxiety disorders scored significantly higher than children with one and two diagnoses on two of three self-report measures used. Logistic regressions revealed that children's scores on measures did not differ according to the nature of the comorbid diagnoses (internalizing vs. externalizing). Finally, ROC curves showed that the MASC and the SPAI-C accurately classified children with additional diagnoses of SAD and GAD, respectively. The potential of self-report measures to further our understanding of childhood anxiety comorbidity and the clinical implications of their use to screen for comorbidity are discussed along with suggestions for further study.

AB Although attention has been given to presence of sleep related problems (SRPs) in children with psychiatric conditions, little has been reported on SRPs in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Sixty-six children and adolescents with OCD were administered the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and completed the Children's Depression Inventory and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale. Their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and Children's Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale. A subset of youth (n = 41) completed a trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Frequency of eight specific SRPs was examined in relation to age, gender, OCD symptom severity, child-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety, parent-proxy ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems, and functional impairment. Ninety-two percent of youth experienced at least one SRP, with 27.3% reporting five or more SRPs. Total SRPs were positively associated with OCD symptom severity, child-rated anxiety, and parent-proxy ratings of internalizing problems. Total and several specific SRPs were reduced following cognitive-behavioral treatment. These results suggest that SRPs are relatively common in youth with OCD, are associated with symptom severity, and warrant attention during assessment and treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined a brief program aimed at preventing anxiety and other problems in early childhood. Participants (N = 734, age 3-6 years) were drawn from 25 preschools across Brisbane, Australia. Assessments occurred four times over 14 months, with a diagnostic interview at follow-up. Parent and teacher reports included information on child temperament, social behavior, inhibition, parent characteristics, and parent-child interactions. REACH for RESILIENCE, a universal prevention program developed for this study, consisted of a six-session training program for parents focusing on building positive expectations and social competency in children. Parents rated the program positively and attended well, especially highly stressed parents who thus became over-represented in the treatment group as time progressed. Despite this difficulty with interpreting results, the intervention resulted in decreases in child problems via teacher report for both internalizing and externalizing problems. However, the effect sizes were not impressive and no changes were noted in parent's diagnostic ratings. Results, directions for further research, and refinement of methods are discussed.

AB This study examined exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), a major public health problem. ETS has been found to be associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects in children. This study utilizes data from a community-based, longitudinal investigation examining the relation between children's exposure to ETS and later internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors. Interviews were administered to a representative community sample of participants from two New York State counties in 1983, with subsequent interviews in 1985-1986, 1992, 1997, and 2002-2003 (when the participants' mean age was 32). Data was collected on various personality and behavioral characteristics of the participants, and on internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors demonstrated by their children. Results indicated that children's exposure to ETS was associated with an increased risk for both internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors. This relationship was maintained despite control on a number of parental psychosocial risk factors ( e. g., demographic variables, personality and behavioral attributes) that have been found to be associated with both parental cigarette smoking and behavior problems among children. These data, which indicate an association between exposure to ETS and internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors among children, support public health policies to further restrict children's exposure to ETS.

AB In the present study, we sought to extend instrument validation research for a strength-based emotional and behavior rating scale, the Teacher Rating Scale of the Behavior and Emotional Rating Scale-Second Edition (BERS-2; Epstein, M. H. (2004). Behavioral and emotional rating scale (2nd ed.). Austin, TX: PRO-ED) through the use of convergent validation techniques. The associations between the strength-based domains of the BERS-2 were examined in relation to problem syndrome subscales of the Teacher's Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, T. M. (1991b). Manual for the teacher's report form and 1991 profile. Burlington: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry). Both measures were conducted with 58 students with emotional disturbance in grades 2 through 12. The overall convergent validity of the BERS-2 and the TRF was strong, particularly for TRF externalizing problems and associated syndromes. However, less evidence emerged for the convergence of domain subscales characterized by behaviors of an internalizing nature. These results provide further support for the use of the BERS-2 in the assessment of the social and behavioral functioning of students with emotional disturbance.

AB This study assessed the influence of clinical and socio-demographic variables on the psychological adaptation of transplanted adolescents. Twenty-six transplanted adolescents and 25 healthy adolescents, aged 13-17, and their parents participated in the study. The following domains were measured: social competence, emotional/behavioral problems, self-concept, self-esteem and subjective well-being. The findings revealed that transplanted boys presented significantly less social competence (U = 26,000, p < .05) and more externalizing problems (U = 25,000, p < .05), social problems (U = 25,000, p < .05) and attention problems (U = 17,500, p < .01) than healthy boys. In contrast, transplanted girls displayed significantly more internalizing problems (U = 47,000, p < .05) and lower physical self-concept (U = 49,500, p < .05) than healthy girls. Hierarchical regression analysis showed clinical variables, especially waiting-list time, significantly predicted attention problems (beta= .364, p < .05) and negative affect (beta= .632, p < .05) in transplanted adolescents. Also, male (beta= -0.554, p < .01) and younger (beta= -0.444, p < .01) transplanted adolescents were at risk for attention problems. Our data suggest the importance of the waiting-list time for transplanted adolescents. Efforts to reduce the pretransplant phase would help adolescents achieve better psychological adaptation at long-term posttransplant.

AB The Systematic Screening,for Behavior Disorders (SSBD), a multistage screening system designed to identify elementary school-age children at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders, was evaluated for use with middle and junior high school students. During SSBD Stage I, teachers identified 123 students in grades 6 through 9 with characteristics of internalizing and externalizing disorders. Teachers then completed SSBD Stage 2 behavior rating scales, the Teacher Report Form, and the Social Skill Rating System on 119 of these students identified as at-risk during Stage 1. Office discipline referrals and cumulative grade point averages for at-risk students were compared to those of students not designated by teachers. SSBD Stage 2 scores were compared with scores from the Teacher Report Form and Social Skill Rating System. Internal consistency and interrater reliability of the SSBD were also examined. Results provide evidence for the reliability and validity of SSBD ratings of early adolescent students.

AB The authors collected questionnaire data from college students (N = 79) at 2 time points during their freshman year to examine how changes in a sense of university belonging, quality of friendships, and psychological adjustment were associated. Students who had positive changes in university belonging had corresponding positive changes in self-perceptions (e.g., scholastic competence, self-worth) and decreases in their internalizing problem behaviors. Although the results did not link improvements over time in friendship quality to changes in self-perceptions, the authors linked them to decreasing levels of problem behaviors. The authors discuss the importance of educators' fostering university belonging and positive friendships among students as they transition to college.

AB Maladaptive perfectionism has been postulated as an intervening variable between psychologically controlling parenting and adolescent internalizing problems. Although this hypothesis has been confirmed in a number of cross-sectional studies, it has not yet been examined from a longitudinal perspective. Findings from this 3-wave longitudinal study show that parental psychological control (as indexed by parent and adolescent reports) at age 15 years predicted increased levels of maladaptive perfectionism 1 year later. Maladaptive perfectionism, in turn, predicted increased levels of adolescent depressive symptoms again 1 year later and acted as a significant intervening variable between parental psychological control at Time 1 and depressive symptoms at Time 3. Multigroup analyses show that the model tested was consistent across gender for paternal psychological control but not for maternal psychological control. Suggestions for future research are outlined.

AB In the present study, the author examined the independent and interactive effects of support and conflict within a triadic familial context (mother-father-youth). The sample consisted of 6th- and 7th-grade inner-city Latino youths (N = 329; 142 boys, 187 girls). Using multiple regression techniques, level of conflict with either mother or father was consistently related to higher levels of both boys' and girls' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interaction effects were significant in predicting boys' externalizing behavior problems-a supportive parental relationship significantly reduced the risk associated with high conflict with the opposite parent. For boys' internalizing problems, mother and father support served a protective function regardless of the level of conflict with the opposite parent. Conflict with the mother was especially detrimental for Latina girls-highly conflictive mother-daughter relationships were associated with increased internalizing and extemalizing symptomatology, and father support added little in predicting symptomatology. The study adds to the understanding of risk and protection in Latino families and underscores the importance of examining the parent-youth relationship from a triadic perspective, noting similarities and differences in mother-son, mother-daughter, father-son, and father-daughter relations.

AB Objective To examine predictors and moderators of parent-training outcomes for treatment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) in pediatric primary care. Methods Parents of 117 children with ODD, ages 36 years, seen in primary care received either a minimal intervention bibliotherapy treatment (MIT), or a 12-session parenting program led by a nurse or psychologist. Results More initial total life stress, parenting distress, internalizing problems, functional impairment, and difficult temperament were associated with more improvement, but families scoring lower on those variables had fewer behavior problems at posttreatment and follow-up. Gender was a significant moderator, with more improvement for girls than boys in the nurse-led group but more improvement for boys than girls in the MIT group. Less well-educated mothers treated by psychologists showed the greatest change. Conclusions Predictors and moderators may play a role in deciding, which families receive a particular form of treatment for ODD in primary care.

AB Objective To assess social lifestyle, risk-taking behavior, and psychopathology in young adults born very preterm or with a very low birthweight.
   Study design This study was part of the 19-year follow-up in a large ongoing collaborative study in the Netherlands (the POPS study) on the long-term outcome of prematurity and dysmaturity. 656 adolescents from the POPS study without serious handicap were compared with peers in the general population in lifestyle, risk-taking behavior, psychopathology, and social participation.
   Results Adolescents from the POPS study smoked significantly less than their peers. Compared with their peers, boys from the POPS study consumed alcohol less often, and girls from the POPS study consumed alcohol approximately as often. Lifetime drug-use was significantly lower than in the reference group. With the exception of fare-dodging, criminal behavior in POPS adolescents was significantly lower than in control subjects. Boys had more trouble in establishing a relationship. The clinical psychopathology reported by POPS subjects was not significantly higher than in control subjects.
   Conclusion Adolescents born very preterm or with a very low birthweight without serious disabilities engaged less in risk-taking behavior, did not show more psychopathology, but bad more difficulties in establishing social contacts. The latter might be attributable to a more prominent internalizing behavior.

AB Taxonomic structure is examined in two large samples of delinquent youth in a domain of socio-psychological and personality factors. This paper offers a partial empirical test of the overlapping theoretical taxonomies of Moffitt (Pshycol Rev 100:674-701, 1993), Lykken (The antisocial personalities, 1995) and Mealey (1995). The first sample consisted of juvenile offenders (n = 1,572) from three state systems. Multiple cluster analysis methods were applied (Wards method, standard K-means, bootstrapped K-means and a semi-supervised pattern recognition technique). Core or exemplar cases were identified by means of a voting procedure. Seven clusters recurrently emerged across replications. While clear analogues of Moffitt's two main categories were found, several additional stable subtypes emerged that were clearly reminiscent of Lykken's sociopathic, neurotic-internalizing and "normal" types. However, boundaries between types were fuzzy and unstable, and many unclassified cases existed. Internal validation was assessed by cross-method verification. External validation assessed type differentiation on several delinquent behaviors. Finally, generalizability was assessed by repeating the clustering on a large replication sample (n = 1,453) from another state. Six of the seven initial types re-emerged.

AB Context: A growing number of children reside with methamphetamine-abusing parents in homes where the illicit drug is produced. Yet, the effects of a methamphetamine environment on psychological child outcome are still unknown. Purpose: To examine whether preschoolers who lived in methamphetamine-producing homes are at increased risk for developing psychological problems. Methods: The participants were 58 white children between the ages of 4 and 5 years; 31 with a history of living in methamphetamine-producing homes and 27 children who live in non-methamphetamine producing homes in rural Tennessee. The groups were similar in age, gender, and socioeconomic background. The groups were compared for behavioral and emotional adjustment using the behavior assessment system for children-parent rating scale-preschool (BASC-PRS-P) form. Biological or custodian parents completed a rating on their preschoolers that provided information about the children's pattern of behavior and feelings. Findings: Preschoolers from the methamphetamine-producing homes showed more externalizing problems than their peers, but were comparable on internalizing problems. On specific behaviors, the data indicate that preschoolers in the methamphetamine group showed higher aggression symptoms than their peers from non-methamphetamine-producing homes. Conclusions: These findings, if replicated, point to the need for mental health screening when a child is removed from a methamphetamine-producing home.

AB The present study investigated the association between children's representations of their mothers' and teachers' reports of children's problem behavior. The research team conducted semistructured narrative interviews with a community sample of 203 Israeli 9- to 11-year-old children. Ten months later, researchers collected teachers' reports of children's internalizing and externalizing problems. This study investigated whether children's self-representation narratives and their maladaptive relatedness stances questionnaire scores mediated this association. Results indicated that children reporting benevolent representations of their mothers exhibited lower levels of problem behavior. More positive self-representations and lower levels of skewness in children's relatedness stances to their mothers both mediated this association. This article includes a discussion of these results in light of factors contributing to maladjustment in middle childhood.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of and investigate the association between mental health problems, asthma, allergy and eczema in Norwegian and immigrant youths. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed of all 10th-grade students in Oslo, Norway, in two school years; 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. Of the 8316 eligible students, 7345 (88.3%) participated. Internalized mental problems were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Check List 10-version, and two subscales of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire were used to study externalizing mental health problems. All questions are based on self-report, and 25% of the sample had an immigrant background. Results: Immigrant boys had higher scores on internalizing problems than Norwegian boys. First-generation immigrants reported less asthma and eczema than Norwegians. The strongest association between mental health problems and inflammatory conditions was for allergy and internalizing problems for boys (odds ratio (OR)=2.5 for immigrants and OR=1.8 for Norwegians). For girls, it was allergy in Norwegians (OR=1.6) and asthma for immigrants (OR=2.2). For externalizing problems, the association was strongest for asthma in boys and eczema in girls. Immigrant boys had stronger associations between number of inflammatory conditions and internalizing mental health problems than Norwegians (OR=3.2 vs. OR=2.4). Among girls, the figures were 1.7 for Norwegians and 1.8 for immigrants. Conclusions: There is a strong association between number of inflammatory conditions and internalizing mental health problems, especially among boys with an immigrant background. The association with externalizing mental health problems was less prominent.

AB Aims To identify childhood and adolescent predictors of alcohol use and harmful drinking in adolescence and adulthood. Design Longitudinal data from childhood to mid-life from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) were used, including predictors collected at ages 7, 11, 16 years and alcohol outcomes collected at ages 16, 23, 33 and 42 years. Setting The NCDS is an ongoing longitudinal study of a cohort of 1 week's births in Britain in 1958. Participants Childhood and adolescent predictors and alcohol use data from at least one adolescent or adult wave were available from 7883 females and 8126 males. Measurements Social background, family, academic and behavioural predictors measured at ages 7, 11 and 16 years were entered into hierarchical multiple and logistic regressions to predict quantity of alcohol use at ages 16, 23, and 33 years and harmful drinking [i.e. Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener (CAGE) questionnaire score] by age 42 years. Findings Previous drinking was controlled in final models to predict change. Drinking was heavier among those with greater childhood and adolescent social advantage (especially females), less harmonious family relationships, more social maladjustment, greater academic performance, less internalizing problems, more truancy and earlier school-leaving plans. Conclusions Alcohol use and problems in adulthood can be predicted by indicators of social background, adjustment and behaviour in childhood and adolescence. Results demonstrate that the early roots of adolescent and adult alcohol use behaviours begin in childhood.

AB Aims To identify childhood and adolescent factors differentiating heavy alcohol users in early adulthood from more moderate users or abstainers. Design Low-income participants followed from birth to age 28 years. Participants A total of 178 adults (95 males) who were first-born children of low-income mothers recruited in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during their third trimester of pregnancy. Measurements Maternal hostility (24/42 months), externalizing and internalizing behavior problems (9 years), peer acceptance and academic achievement (12 years), maternal alcohol use and participants' drinking behavior (16 years), quantity of alcohol use per occasion (19, 23 and 26 years), alcohol use disorders (28 years). Findings For men: (i) higher amounts of alcohol consumption at age 16 increased the odds of being a heavy drinker compared to an abstainer (age 19) and a moderate drinker (ages 23 and 26); (ii) lower achievement scores at age 12 and having a mother who drank more when the participant was age 16 increased the odds of being a heavy drinker compared to moderate drinker (age 26). Higher levels of externalizing behavior problems at age 9 and drinking more when the participants were age 16 increased the odds that men would have a current alcohol use disorder at age 28. For women: (i) drinking more at age 16 increased the odds of being a heavy drinker compared to being either an abstainer or a moderate drinker (age 26); (ii) having higher levels of achievement at age 12 increased the odds of being a heavy drinker compared to an abstainer at age 23. Adolescent alcohol use mediated the relation between externalizing behavior at age 9 and alcohol use at age 26 for women. Conclusions Problem drinking may be the result of a long-term developmental process wherein childhood externalizing behavior problems sets a pathway leading to heavy drinking during and after adolescence.

AB Objective.-Predictive factors associated with prescription of psychostimulant drugs to children remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify child-related factors that predict receipt of methylphenidate (MPH: Ritalin) by children in a large population-based study.
   Methods.-With data from time 1 (1994-1995) and time 2 (1996-1997) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, we analyzed the role of child background, and behavioral and functional characteristics, all measured at time 1, in predicting receipt of MPH at time 2 in a series of logistic regression models.
   Results.-Parent- and teacher-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms were consistent and significant predictors of receipt of MPH (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 5.3-7.0, and from 3.2-4.1, respectively), particularly when concordant. Parent-reported aggressive behaviors (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.96) and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms (OR 3.01, 95% CI, 1.74-5.54) also predicted receipt of MPH, whereas higher levels of academic functioning predicted lower likelihood of receiving MPH (OR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.34-0.85), even after controlling for child background characteristics, ADHD symptoms, and prior receipt of MPH. Across models, male gender predicted a higher likelihood of receiving MPH (ORs ranging from 3.5-4.5) over and above ADHD and other behavioral symptoms. The strongest predictor of MPH receipt across models was prior receipt of MPH (ORs ranging from 83.7-128.3).
   Conclusions.-Child characteristics and behavioral symptoms other than ADHD symptoms predict prescription and uptake of MPH, possibly attributable to their serving as clinically convenient indicators of impairment. Gender effects in receipt of stimulant medications among children with ADHD symptoms warrant further investigation.

AB Despite being a core characteristic of anxiety disorders, little data have been reported on somatic symptoms (SSs) in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Eighty-five children and adolescents with OCD were administered the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and completed the Children's Depression Inventory and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children. Their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and Children's Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale. A subset of youth (n = 62) completed a trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy. The frequency of specific SSs was examined in relation to age, gender, OCD symptom severity, child-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety, parent-proxy ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems, and functional impairment. Ninety-six percent of youth experienced at least one SS, with 67% reporting five or more SSs. Child-rated SSs were positively associated with parent-ratings of child SSs, child-rated anxiety and depression, and parent ratings of the children's internalizing problems. Parent-rated SSs were positively related to parent-proxy ratings of internalizing problems and OCD-related impairment, clinician-rated OCD symptom severity, and child-rated generalized anxiety. Total and several specific SSs were reduced following cognitive-behavioral treatment. These results suggest that SSs are prevalent in youth with OCD, are associated with symptom severity, are reduced after participation in cognitive-behavioral therapy, and warrant attention during assessment and treatment.

AB Objectives: Since the late 1980s, there has been a strong theoretical focus on psychological and social influences of perpetration of child sexual abuse. This paper presents the results of a review and meta-analysis of studies examining risk factors for perpetration of child sexual abuse published since 1990.
   Method: Eighty-nine studies published between 1990 and April of 2003 were reviewed. Risk factors were classified into one of the following six broad categories: family factors, externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, social deficits, sexual problems, and attitudes/beliefs. Sex offenders against children (SOC) were compared to three comparison groups identified within the 89 studies: sex offenders who perpetrated against adults (SOA), non-sex offenders, and non-offenders with no history of criminal or sexual behavior problems.
   Results: Results for the six major categories showed that SOC were not different from SOA (all d between -.02 and.14) other than showing lower externalizing behaviors (d = -.25). Sex offenders against children were somewhat different from non-sex offenders, especially with regard to sexual problems and attitudes (d =.83 and.51). Sex offenders against children showed substantial differences from non-offenders with medium sized effects in all six major categories (d's range from.39 to.58).
   Conclusion: Child sex offenders are different from non-sex offenders and non-offenders but not from sex offenders against adults.
   Practice implications: This study suggests that the presence of general risk factors may lead to a variety of negative behavioral outcomes, including the perpetration of child sexual offending. Family factors were strongly related to the perpetration of child sex offending (vs. non-sexual offending or non-offending) and may be valuable intervention points for interrupting the development of child sex offending, as well as other negative behaviors. Other potential points for intervention may focus on the development of appropriate social and emotional skills that contribute to sexual offending. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A depth-of-processing incidental recall task for maternal-referent stimuli was utilized to assess basic memory processes and the affective valence of maternal representations among abused (N = 63), neglected (N = 33), and nonmaltreated (N = 128) school-aged children (ages 8-13.5 years old). Self-reported and observer-rated indices of internalizing symptoms were also assessed. Abused children demonstrated impairments in recall compared to neglected and nonmaltreated children. Although abused, neglected, and nonmaltreated children did not differ in valence of maternal representations, positive and negative maternal schemas related to internalizing symptoms differently among subgroups of maltreated children. Valence of maternal schema was critical in differentiating those with high and low internalizing symptomatology among the neglected children only. Implications for clinical intervention and prevention efforts are underscored.

AB Mood and anxiety disorders in youth are disabling, distressing, and prevalent. Furthermore, depression and anxiety frequently co-exist, may share several etiological factors, and respond to similar interventions. In this paper, we report Preliminary results from a treatment adaptation project designed to condense existing cognitive behavioral therapy Protocols for anxiety and depression to their core components and combine them into a brief, integrated treatment suitable for the broad population of internalizing youth seen in primary care. Specifically, we discuss: (a) the rationale for targeting anxiety and depression in pediatric primary care and the deployment-focused treatment development model; (b) the content of our behaviorally based treatment program; and (c) clinical outcomes of 2 sample cases with comorbid depression and anxiety.

AB This study examined psychosocial influences on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in 105 4-year-old children transitioning to primary school. Measuring before, during, and after school transition over a period of up to 12 months, salivary cortisol was assessed on awakening and early evening. Parents reported child temperament and teachers recorded adaptive behovior Whilst cortisol at awakening and early evening increased from baseline to school transition, effects were not significant. A significant decrease occurred between transition and follow-up and front baseline to follow-up for both awakening and evening cortisol. Poorer effortful control was associated with high morning and steeper diurnal slope of cortisol at transition whilst surgency/extroversion was associated individually with greater morning and evening cortisol at transition and adaptation. Greater increase in internalizing social isolation during the first 6 months of school in more surgent/extrovert children predicted higher morning and evening cortisol at follow-up. This study is the first to explore these adaptive relationships over a 12-month period and supports social isolation over time as a key element in developmental endocrine activation.

AB Culture influences the acceptability of the overt expression of anger. In many cultures, overt expression of anger is considered legitimate for males but not for females. We explored the implications of anger expression among early adolescents in Cuba, expecting that overt, explosive expression of anger would be particularly maladaptive in a society that is collectivistic by virtue of both its cultural heritage and ideology. Given the sharp gender-role distinctions in traditional Latin American society, we expected to find more overt expression of anger by males. However, the analyses revealed no significant gender differences in anger expression. Overt expression of anger was significantly associated with multiple measures of maladjustment. Evidence that the inhibition of anger is associated with maladjustment was not as consistent, but holding anger in was linked with internalizing difficulties. Sociometric data indicated that early adolescents who demonstrate control of their anger are highly accepted and considered as leaders.

AB Relations among past maternal depressive disorder, current depressive symptoms, current maternal interaction behaviors, and children's adjustment were examined in a sample of 204 women and their young adolescent offspring (mean age = 11.86, SD = 0.55). Mothers either had (n = 157) or had not (n = 57) experienced at least one depressive disorder during the child's life. Mothers and children participated in a problem-solving task, video-taped for later coding. Mothers with current depressive symptoms and those with histories of chronic/severe depressive disorders displayed fewer positive behaviors toward their children; mothers with current depressive symptoms also showed more negative behaviors with their children. The relation between mothers' depression history and their behavior during the interaction with their child was partially mediated by mothers' current mood state. Moreover, high levels of maternal negativity and low levels of positivity during the problem-solving task were related to children's externalizing problems. Maternal positivity partially mediated the relation between maternal depression and children's externalizing symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of providing parenting interventions for depressed mothers.

AB We examined relations among cortisol, markers of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity (including salivary alpha-amylase and skin conductance level), and children's adjustment. We also tested the Bauer et al. (Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 23(2), 102-113, 2002) hypothesis that interactions between the SNS and cortisol would be associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. Saliva samples were obtained from 8- to 9-year-olds before and after a laboratory assessment battery, and were assayed for cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA). Basal skin conductance level (SCL) was measured during resting conditions. Parents reported on child adjustment. Interactions between basal SNS and cortisol levels explained moderate amounts of unique variance in children's externalizing and internalizing problems. More specifically, higher basal cortisol levels were positively associated with higher internalizing and externalizing problems among children with higher SNS activity, as compared to children with lower SNS activity. Findings underscore the utility of including information about the coordination between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and SNS activity in biosocial models of atypical child development.

AB The present study examined the psychometric properties of the screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders (SCARED) in a large community sample of Chinese children. The 41-item version of the SCARED was administered to 1559 primary and junior high school students (774 boys and 785 girls, mean age 11.8 +/- 2.11) in 12 Chinese cities. The SCARED demonstrated moderate to high internal consistency (alpha = 0.43-0.89) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.46-0.77 over 2 weeks and 0.24-0.67 over 12 weeks), moderate parent-child correlation (r = 0.49-0.59) and good discriminant validity (between anxiety and non-anxiety disorders). The SCARED total score was significantly correlated with the internalizing factor of the child behavior checklist (0.41). Factor analyses revealed the same five-factor structure as the original SCARED. These findings support that the SCARED is a reliable and valid anxiety screening instrument in Chinese children.

AB Adopting an ecological framework, this study examines the role of community violence exposure, interpartner conflict, positive parenting, and informal social support in predicting the social skills and behavior problems of low-income African American preschoolers. Participants were 184 African American mothers and female caregivers of Head start children who completed study measures in a structured interview Regression analyses revealed that greater community violence exposure predicted more internalizing and externalizing child behavior problems and lower levels of self-control and cooperation. Greater interpartner conflict predicted more internalizing problems. Positive parenting was predictive of fewer internalizing and externalizing problems and higher levels of child self-control and cooperation. Greater informal social support predicted higher levels of all four child social skills, including self-control, cooperation, assertion, and responsibility Positive parenting and informal social support failed to moderate the relationships between community violence exposure and interpartner conflict and child outcomes. Implications of the findings for intervention and future research are discussed.

AB Background: All previous longitudinal community studies assessing the continuity of child behavioral/emotional problems were conducted in developed countries. Method: Six hundred and one children randomly selected from a Brazilian birth cohort were evaluated for behavioral/emotional problems through mother interview at 4 and 12 years with the same standard procedure - Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: CBCL Total Problem score presented a medium stability (r = .42) with externalizing problems showing higher stability and more homotypic continuity than internalizing problems. Of the children presenting deviant scores at the age of 4, only 31% remained deviant at the age of 12 (p < .001). A deviant CBCL Total Problem score at 12 years old was predicted by Rule-Breaking Behavior [OR = 7.46, 95% CI 2.76-20.19] and Social Problems [OR = 3.56, 95% CI 1.36-9.30] scores at 4 years of age. Either Rule-Breaking or Aggressive Behavior - externalizing syndromes - were part of the predictors for the three broad-band CBCL scores and six out of the eight CBCL syndromes. Conclusions: Behavioral/emotional problems in preschool children persist moderately up to pre-adolescence in a community sample. Externalizing problems at the age of 4 comprise the developmental history of most behavioral/emotional problems at pre-adolescence. Our findings concur with findings from developed countries and are quite similar for continuity, stability and predictability.

AB Background: The development of youth psychopathology may be associated with direct and continuous contact with a different culture (acculturation) and to distress related to this process (cultural stress). We examine cultural experiences of Puerto Rican families in relation to youth psychiatric symptoms in two different contexts: one in which migrant Puerto Ricans reside on the mainland as an ethnic minority and another in which they reside in their place of origin. Methods: Sample: Probability samples of 10- to 13-year-old youth of Puerto Rican background living in the South Bronx, New York City (SB) and in the San Juan Metropolitan area in Puerto Rico (PR) (N = 1,271) were followed over time. Measures: Three assessments of internalizing psychiatric symptoms (elicited through the DISC-IV) and of antisocial behaviors (ASB) quantified through a six-point index were carried out. Independent variables included scales of adult and child acculturation and cultural stress, and other putative correlates. Data analysis: Within each study site, multilevel linear regression models were examined. Results: Parental acculturation was associated with ASB in youth at both sites, but youth acculturation itself was not related to psychiatric symptoms. At both contexts, cultural stress was a more consistent correlate of youth psychiatric symptoms than acculturation after controlling for nativity, maternal education, child gender, stressful life events and parental psychopathology. However, the strength of the youth cultural stress association decreased over time. Conclusions: The association between cultural factors and child psychiatric symptoms is not restricted to contexts where an ethnic group is a minority.

AB The present study includes externalizing problems, internalizing problems, mother-adolescent relationship quality, and father-adolescent relationship quality in the same structural equation model and tests the longitudinal reciprocal association among all four variables over a 1-year period. A transactional model in which adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems are negatively related to the quality of adolescents' relationships with their parents and relationship quality is related to internalizing and externalizing problems is hypothesized. Moderation by gender, ethnicity, and parental marital status is also investigated. The sample consists of 246 boys and 253 girls from the sixth and seventh grades of a large public middle school. The study's final model suggests a longitudinal, reciprocal association between the quality of adolescents' relationships with their mothers and internalizing problems. Results suggest longitudinal unidirectional effects from externalizing problems to the quality of adolescents' relationships with their fathers and from the quality of adolescents' relationships with their mothers to externalizing problems.

AB This study examined if mother or child's perceived social support decreased the emotional and behavioral consequences of intimate partner conflict for 148 African American children ages 8-12. Results revealed that children's perceived social support mediated the relation between intimate partner conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Findings also indicated a mediational role of mother's perceived social support in the link between both physical and nonphysical partner abuse with children's internalizing problems. Results from this study suggest that diminished levels of perceived social support associated with intimate partner conflict is a risk factor for psychological problems in children from low-income, African American families. Based on these findings, it is recommended that interventions to address adjustment problems for children exposed to high levels of intimate partner conflict target enhancing the social support of both children and their mothers.

AB Suicide is extremely rare among persons under age 15 years old. Nationwide, it has been reported that 18% of students in grade 6 had thoughts of killing themselves. The Social Disintegration Model (SDM) summarizes intra-personal, interpersonal, peer network, physical and heath risk behaviour characteristics that may influence suicide ideation. As part of a larger study to test a family strengthening programme, 179 later elementary school children from two cities responded to 20 items about their participation in health risk behaviour. Sixteen youth indicated they had thought of killing themselves. Based on the SDM, these 16 youth were compared with the larger sample on measures of ways of coping; family communication, functioning and caring; school connectedness, pubertal development; and alcohol use and weapon carrying. Youth who responded positively to the,thought of killing self' screening question, felt less connected to their school, used more internalizing behaviours and reported less cohesion, open communication, supervision and family caring than youth who answered no. Youth who thought of killing themselves may benefit from additional school support to feel more comfortable and connected at school. Community resources may help parents modify child-rearing behaviours. Building communication among parents and youth may prevent suicidal behaviour among young adolescents.
