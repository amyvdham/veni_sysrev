AB Although it has been well established that cyberbullying leads to mental health problems, less is known about the factors that confer resilience to the adverse effects of cyberbullying among young people. To address this gap, adolescents aged 13-19 years (n = 476) completed a survey measuring cyberbullying victimisation, attachment styles, perceived social support, coping styles, and mental distress. Compared to non-victims, victims of cyberbullying experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety and endorsed more self-statements indicative of attachment anxiety. Peer support, security in attachment relationships, and the endorsement of positive coping strategies attenuated the positive relationship between cyberbullying victimisation and mental health difficulties. Family support did not appear to buffer adolescents from mental distress in this context. However, family support was the strongest bivariate predictor of reduced mental distress. Although peer relations should be the target of intervention programmes within school settings, the findings highlight the importance of including families in cyberbullying prevention programmes.

AB This cross-sectional study examines gender-informed teachers' and early adolescents' reports of emotional competencies within the school setting. The sample for the current study consisted of 290 emerging adolescents (114 boys, 170 girls) recruited from 24 schools. Social-emotional competencies were assessed by students' self-report questionnaires and teacher and parent reports. Results showed significant positive associations between teacher-rated emotional competencies and emerging adolescents' self-reports with three of the four Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales (Perspective Taking, r=.231, p=.000; Fantasy, r=.303, p=.000; and Empathetic Concern, r=.196, p=.007). Significant gender differences were also found as both adults and adolescents' rated girls as showing greater emotional competencies than boys. Results are discussed in terms of future research directions and implications for educational strategies and practices to help build prosocial and emotional abilities and behaviours.

AB Sociodemographic variables may have important implications for understanding the role of global and discrete-level emotion regulation ability in the prediction of elementary school children's peer victimization. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 109 elementary school children from economically and racially diverse backgrounds. There was a positive relation between sadness regulation and overt victimization for children in early elementary grades, but not for children in later grades. In addition, there was a positive relation between sadness regulation and relational victimization for boys and a negative association between the two variables for girls. Girls were rated higher than boys on global emotion regulation ability. In addition, economically disadvantaged children reported more relational victimization than their more affluent peers. Affluent children also received higher ratings on global emotion regulation as well as sadness regulation. Anger regulation was also positively associated with overt victimization.

AB This study explores the prevalence of bullying and victimization among Cypriot adolescents diagnosed with mental health problems. Their psychosocial adjustment in relation to bullying is studied. The sample consisted of 187 adolescents (60.2% boys; M age = 13.2) and their parents. The present sample reported significantly higher rates of victimization than existing published normative values chi(2) (1, N = 187) = 27.0, p < .001. An alarming finding was that a total of 25.8% reported to be involved in bullying. There was a significant positive correlation between bullying and emotional symptoms (r = 0.36, p < .001), conduct problems (r = 0.35, p < .001), hyperactivity (r = 0.23, p < .003) and peer problems (r = 0.48, p < .001). The study suggests that there is increased victimization and psychosocial difficulties among Cypriot clinical population in regards to bullying.

Three high school students who were assessed with high levels of math anxiety met individually twice a week for 6 weeks with the school counselor who used a manualized MBCT treatment for anxiety as the intervention. A weekly administration of a math anxiety measurement tool showed a decrease in math anxiety for all three participants.

AB Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), continue to disproportionately affect Black adolescents. Those experiencing the psychological sequelae of mental illnesses are at increased risk. Here, we outline the development of an HIV/STI prevention intervention for heterosexually active Black adolescents with mental illnesses. This research was guided by a psychosocial expansion of the Theory of Planned Behavior, nested within a broader social determinants of health framework. A youth community advisory board provided study oversight. Heterosexually active Black adolescents aged 14-17 were recruited from community-based outpatient mental health providers for focus groups, surveys and two 'dress rehearsals' of the intervention protocol (N = 68). The qualitative and quantitative findings indicated that knowledge, attitudes and skills related to consistent condom use, reduced number of sexual partners, routine HIV/STI testing, abstinence and emotion regulation were important areas to target. These elicitation data provided insight into the context of HIV/STI risk for the study population, and were used to develop the intervention content. 'Project GOLD: We are Kings and Queens' was designed to be delivered over two days (3 hours per day), with eight, 45-min modules. The activities address behaviors, as well as cognitive, emotional, psychological and social processes associated with HIV/STI risk. Alongside evidence-based HIV/STI prevention strategies (e.g. sexual partner communication skills), the intervention activities are rooted in principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Dress rehearsal participants were in favor of the intervention and provided feedback on activity length, gender and cultural relevance and strategies to sustain attention; this information was used to finalize the curriculum. In partnership with the community, we developed a theoretically driven, gender and culturally relevant, developmentally and psychologically appropriate HIV/STI prevention program. Our ultimate goal is to standardize sexual health assessment and intervention in outpatient mental health treatment settings to meet sexual health needs in this underserved population.

AB Emerging adulthood is a new, distinct life stage for 18- to 29-year-olds in the United States. In the sixth wave of data collection in a longitudinal cohort study (started in 1986), predictors of mental health were examined in the emerging adult offspring within lesbian-parent parent families. The donor-conceived offspring were 25 years old. In cross-sectional analyses, we assessed whether their mental health (life satisfaction and behavioral/emotional problems) was associated with personal characteristics, family characteristics, quality of important relationships, and experiences of homophobic stigmatization. The findings revealed that the predictors of mental health in these offspring were typical of what has been previously reported on emerging adults. However, offspring who reported stigmatization because of their parents' sexual identity had higher rates of behavioral/emotional problems than those who did not.

AB Objectives: The present study is conducted aiming to explain students' addiction potential based on psychological dysregulation with the mediation of perceived stress.
   Methods: This research was of descriptive-correlational type in which 318 male high school students of Jolfa city were selected via cluster sampling, and filled out Iranian addiction potential scale (IAPS), Abbreviated Dysregulation Inventory (ADI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation), Pearson correlation coefficient, and structural equation modelling.
   Results: Findings showed that there is a significant and positive relationship between perceived stress (r=0.70, p<00.01) and psychological dysregulation (r=0.68, p<0.01) with addiction potential. The suggested model has suitable fitness with the data, and psychological dysregulation with direct effect (beta=0.75, p<0.001) and also indirect and medium effect (beta=0.18, p<0.01) have explained students' addiction potential.
   Conclusions: Considering the results of this research, psychological dysregulation and perceived stress can make the students vulnerable to addiction; and regarding the pathological role of these factors in adolescence period, one can prevent the initiation and development of addiction in subsequent periods and adulthood.

AB Worldwide, homeless girls are a highly vulnerable group. They suffer sexual exploitation and forced labor, discrimination, and social exclusion at a higher rate than the rest of the general population. They often present anxiety and depression, unassertiveness and emotion dysregulation, among other psychosocial characteristics. All of these factors negatively impact subjective well-being, further worsening their mental health. Subjective well-being has both immediate (mental health, health behaviors) and long-term, cumulative effects on health (physical health, mortality), representing opportunities for investment in population health. Despite the relevance of subjective well-being and its associated factors, there is scarce research on the plight of homeless girls in Mexico and Latin America, which leads to ineffective interventions, policy actions and to a diminished quality of life. This study was carried out to develop and test a path model of well-being in 240 Mexican homeless girls ages 6-23 years old. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, assertiveness and emotion regulation strategies were used as factors influencing subjective well-being. Results showed that symptoms of depression and functional emotion regulation strategies have a significant direct influence on subjective well-being. Symptoms of anxiety and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have an indirect influence on subjective well-being with symptoms of depression as the mediating variable. Assertiveness did not significantly influence well-being directly and indirectly. Functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have a positive significant correlation. Fit indexes obtained indicate an excellent adjustment to data. R square indicates that 38% of the variance in subjective well-being can be explained by this model. Hence, the current study provides unique findings in terms of a model of well-being through which it is possible to design and implement interventions that increase such well-being in order to promote healthier social and emotional developmental trajectories in homeless girls, especially in the context of Latin American cities.

In accordance with this purpose, a qualitative research is conducted by interviewing two high school students, 16 and 18 years old, and two other high school students' mothers. Thematic analysis method was implemented to the data collected by personal information form, interview content reports, survey reports and supervision reports. MAXQDA which is a software package for qualitative and mixed methods research was utilized during qualitative analysis. It was determined that all participants were exposed to neglect and abuse which started in early childhood and proceeded into adolescence period. It was observed that another environment participants were exposed to abuse was school environment. In addition, it was seen that all participants have difficulty in regulating their emotions. We argue that participants who have traumatic attachment and insecure attachment patterns, are the victims of developmental trauma. The fact that participants have difficulty in regulating emotions may be explained via insecure attachment pattern and developmental trauma. It was determined that the attachment-oriented therapeutic intervention that is implemented in the research has positiveimpact on healing thanks to the participants' statements.

AB Severe mental disorders, frequent offences and/or very serious offences can signify an unfavorable legal prognosis for young patients in forensic psychiatric treatment. So far, there are no studies on processes of change during the course of forensic psychiatric treatment of adolescents in Germany. The present study describes developments of 16 patients admitted for long term treatment in a forensic department at Viersen Mental Hospital (Rhineland, Germany). Beside specific behavioral goals (using goal-attainment-scales), features like stress due to physical and psychological symptoms, aggression, emotion regulation as well as self-control and openness were examined. Part of the sample approached individual behaviour goals during the course of treatment, showed less aggression and stress symptoms and improved affect regulation. Other participants showed no significant changes, and in some cases, undesirable developments were found. The results indicate that young people can benefit from treatment in forensic psychiatry. The confinement itself and in particular dynamics within the group of delinquent peers are possible factors leading to a worsening of symptoms. These processes require particular attention in the treatment.

AB Background : Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is a critical indicator of one's perception of health and well-being. The objective of the study was to assess and compare HRQoL among undergraduate students at different categories of body mass index. Method: 140 undergraduate students at the mean age 19 +/- 0.70 years were randomly assigned into underweight <18.5 kg/m(2) [n=37: 26.4%], normal-weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) [n=31: 22.1%], obese >= 30.00 kg/m(2) [37: 26.4%] and obese class III >= 40.00 kg/m(2) [n=35: 25%] groups. HRQoL was also measured using CDC HRQOL-14. Results: SRH-good results were as the following: underweight students 87%, normal weight 94%, obese 73% and obese-III 57%. The activity limitation days were observed more among obese and obese-III category expressing lack of sleep, worrisome and depression. Underweight and obese category students exhibited less energetic days. Conclusion: HRQoL was low among obese and obese class III students. Normal weight category students exhibited better SRH-good. Obese class had more unhealthy days with regard to physical and mental issues and reported more days of activity limitation due to pain, depression and lack of sleep. Obese students had greater impairments in emotional problems.

AB In the last few years, an increasing number of studies have investigated the Self-harming behaviours, particularly widespread among young women, and the development of websites relating to Self-harm, in which the users are most often females. From a psychodynamic perspective, this article aims at identifying the most prevalent topics shared in blogs written by young people who Self-harm, in order to understand their experiences of suffering. We performed a thematic analysis of 70 Italian blogs relating to Self-harming behaviours. From our analysis all the blogs were declined in the feminine. Four thematic clusters were found: troubled relationships with the Other; the hidden Self; loneliness, hate and guilt: the melancholic emotions; the Self-harming act. Some specific functions of Self-harm blogs emerged: they can be a mean for self-disclosure and for emotion regulation. They are also spaces where young women meet to share their pain and offer and find support. Clinical implications for blogs as a place for illness narratives will be discussed.

AB Sexting as a common adolescent behavior might me related with difficulties of emotion regulation, a skillset that draws on identifying the relationship between behaviors and emotions and then creating strategies for regulating such emotions. The aim of this study was to explore the relation between sexting and emotional regulation strategies. The study involved 440 respondents, aged 18 to 25. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used to measure emotional regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). Sexting Behaviors Scale was used to assess the frequency of receiving, sending and posting sexually suggestive or provocative texts, photos or videos. Result showed that boys use the strategy of expressive suppression more intense than girls. Statistically significant low correlation was found between posting sexually suggestive content and cognitive reappraisal. Furthermore, gender has been found to be a significant predictor of engagement in the activity of sexting behavior. The results suggest that exchange of sexually suggestive content among youth, which shows low incidence, cannot be defined as an indicator of difficulties in emotional regulation.

AB Research to date has paid little attention to positive affect regulation in adolescence. Our aims were to examine psychometric properties of a questionnaire to assess responses to positive affect in adolescents and to study the relationships these responses have with psychological adjustment. A sample of 1,810 adolescents completed the responses to positive affect questionnaire (with three dimensions: emotion-focused and self-focused positive rumination, and dampening) and three self-report measures of psychological adjustment (i.e. life satisfaction, self-esteem and depressive symptoms). The questionnaire had good internal consistency reliability and the same factor structure as previous studies using adult samples. Secondly, a structural equation model showed that emotion-focused and self-focused responses were positively related to life satisfaction and self-esteem, and negatively to depressive symptoms, while dampening presented opposite associations.

AB Background: Emotional intelligence refers to how individuals deal with intrapersonal or interpersonal emotional information and how a subject identifies, expresses, understands, regulates, and uses his/her own emotions or those of others. The purpose of the present study was to validate the Arabic version of the "Profile of Emotional Competence" (PEC) questionnaire.
   Methods: A sample of 285 Tunisian participants (153 men and 132 women) was recruited, age range: 12-18 years (15.2 +/- 2.4 years). The participants were prospectively classified into the following two groups: athletes (n= 101) and nonathletes (n = 184).
   Results: Findings of the present study indicated that the Arabic version of the PEC questionnaire has good psychometric properties. The Cronbach's a suggested that all subscales had adequate internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was excellent. The correlations between interpersonal and intrapersonal subscales were low to moderate (from 0.37 to 0.59), except for the regulation interpersonal, utilization interpersonal, and utilization intrapersonal subscales, which showed negligible correlations with the other subscales. The two-factor solution (interpersonal and intrapersonal competence models) accounted for 62.1% of variance. All subscales loaded on the expected factor, except for the utilization intrapersonal and regulation interpersonal subscales, which did not yield a satisfactory loading. Age and athletes' status impacted on all the PEC dimensions, except for some subscales.
   Conclusion: Finally, psychologists and practitioners in the Arab world could use the PEC questionnaire as a valid and reliable instrument for planning ad hoc interventions.

AB The present study sought to know emotional aspects of children with hearing difficulties and to check their influence on language development from the perspective of the children themselves, their parents and their teachers of Gran Canaria and Tenerife islands. We analyzed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) administered to 300 children who used cochlear implants or hearing aids compared to the perceptions of their families and teachers in the same questionnaire. In addition, a regression analysis was applied to know if the results in the SDQ influence those obtained by the children in the Illinois Psycholinguistic Aptitude Test (ITPA). The findings showed that the assessment of the emotional dimensions of the children in terms of strengths and weaknesses were judged differently in the three groups of informants studied, the scale being the most difficult emotional issue. Both evaluative instruments were correlated and a linear regression analysis that the score linked to the measurement of the emotional aspects predicts the results in the different dimensions of ITPA. The findings of this study are relevant for the design of educational programs in the field of communication and language of children.

AB Objective: Twin studies suggest that genetic factors contribute to continuity in mental health problems and that environmental factors are the major contributor to developmental change. The authors investigated the influence of psychiatric risk alleles on early-onset mental health trajectories and whether the trajectories were subsequently modified by exposure to childhood victimization.
   Methods: The sample was a prospective U.K. population-based cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The developmental trajectories of emotional problems were estimated in childhood (approximately ages 4-8 years) and adolescence (approximately ages 12-17 years). Psychiatric risk alleles were indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia using genome-wide association study results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Chronic peer victimization in late childhood (ages 8.5 and 10.5 years) was assessed as an index of environmental exposure. Individuals with sufficient data on emotional problems, the PRS, and victimization were included in the main analyses (N=3,988).
   Results: Higher schizophrenia PRSs were associated with a trajectory of early-onset increasing emotional problems (odds ratio=1.18, 95% CI=1.02-1.36) compared with a trajectory of low-stable emotional problems. Subsequent exposure to victimization increased the likelihood of transitioning from a trajectory of low-stable emotional problems during childhood (before exposure) to an increasing trajectory in adolescence (after exposure) (odds ratio=2.59, 95% CI=1.48-4.53).
   Conclusions: While the early development of emotional problems was associated with genetic risk (schizophrenia risk alleles), the subsequent course of emotional problems for those who might otherwise have remained on a more favorable trajectory was altered by exposure to peer victimization, which is a potentially modifiable environmental exposure.

TI Brain Mechanisms of Attention Orienting Following Frustration:
   Associations With Irritability and Age in Youths

AB Objective: Childhood irritability is a common, impairing problem with changing age-related manifestations that predict long-term adverse outcomes. However, more investigation of overall and age-specific neural correlates is needed. Because youths with irritability exhibit exaggerated responses to frustrating stimuli, the authors used a frustration functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm to examine associations between irritability and neural activation and tested the moderating effect of age.
   Method: The authors studied a transdiagnostic sample of 195 youths with varying levels of irritability (disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, N=52; anxiety disorder, N=42; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, N=40; and healthy volunteers, N=61). Irritability was measured by parent and child reports on the Affective Reactivity Index. The fMRI paradigm was a cued-attention task differentiating neural activity in response to frustration (rigged feedback) from activity during attention orienting in the trial following frustration.
   Results: Whole-brain activation analyses revealed associations with irritability during attention orienting following frustration. Irritability was positively associated with frontal-striatal activation, specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and caudate. Age moderated the association between irritability and activation in some frontal and posterior regions (the anterior cingutate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, cuneus, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule [F= 19.04-28.51, df=1, 189, partial eta squared=0.09-0.13]). Specifically, higher irritability was more strongly related to increased activation in younger youths compared with older youths.
   Conclusions: Following frustration, levels of irritability correlated with activity in neural systems mediating attention orienting, top-down regulation of emotions, and motor execution. Although most associations were independent of age, dysfunction in the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior regions was more pronounced in young children with irritability.

AB Objective We previously tested via randomized controlled trial a novel intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and above-target glycemic control that combined web-delivered incentives for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and brief web counseling with working memory training and parental contingency contracting training. Results showed improved SMBG and decreased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. However, it has not been elucidated if improvements in SMBG mediated the immediate benefits of this treatment on HbA1c nor if this intensive intervention uniquely benefited a subgroup of adolescents with higher problems in emotional control.
   Methods Adolescents with type 1 diabetes and above-target glycemic control (n=61) were randomized to receive the 6-month intervention (n=30) or usual care (n=31). Adolescents completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Self-Report, problems with emotional control subscale at baseline, and provided meter downloads to assess frequency of SMBG and completed an HbA1c blood draw at baseline and 6 months later.
   Results At 6-month follow-up, improvements in SMBG mediated the effects of receiving the treatment on having lower average HbA1c. Further, problems in emotional control moderated the benefits of the intervention on improvements in SMBG and in turn HbA1c. Only adolescents with above average problems in emotional control evidenced improvements in SMBG in response to treatment, which then explained lower HbA1c levels at 6-month follow-up.
   Conclusions This multicomponent, web-delivered intervention provided unique benefits for improving SMBG and lowering HbA1c in teens with higher problems in emotional control.

AB There is general agreement about the benefits of school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions in relation to children and young people's social-emotional competence, mental health, and academic achievement. However, we know little about the theorized mechanisms through which SEL leads to improved academic outcomes. The current study is the first to present an integrative model (derived from the SEL logic model) using a 3-wave (annual assessment, T1, T2, T3) longitudinal sample of 1626 (51% boys, n = 832) 9-12-year-old students (M = 9.17, SD = .31 at baseline) attending 45 elementary schools in England, drawn from a major randomized trial of a universal SEL intervention (the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies curriculum; PATHS). Using structural equation modeling that accounted for within-time covariance, data clustering, gender and prior academic attainment, we examined the temporal relations between social-emotional competence (F1), school connectedness (T2), mental health difficulties (T2), and academic attainment (T3). It was hypothesized that social-emotional competence would directly and indirectly influence academic attainment through school connectedness and mental health difficulties. Our analyses also examined whether these hypothesized relations varied as a function of intervention exposure (PATHS versus usual provision). The theorized model was partially supported. Social-emotional competence at T1 exerted a significant influence on school connectedness and mental health difficulties at T2. However, the latter was the only significant predictor and mediator of academic attainment at T3 after controlling for gender and prior academic performance. Students with greater social-emotional competence at T1 were reported to experience fewer mental health difficulties at T2, and this in turn predicted higher academic attainment at T3. Intervention exposure did not markedly influence the magnitude or statistical significance of these identified pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate some possible revisions to our current understanding regarding the role of social-emotional competence in promoting academic attainment, as its contribution appears to lay primarily in buffering the adverse effects of mental health difficulties.

AB Objective: To develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Second Edition (CY-BOCS-II) in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
   Method: Youth with OCD (N = 102; age range 7-17 years), who were seeking treatment from 1 of 2 specialty OCD treatment centers, participated in the study. The CY-BOCS-II was administered at an initial assessment, and measures of OCD symptom severity, anxiety and depressive symptoms, behavioral and emotional problems, and global functioning were administered. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities were assessed on a subsample of participants (n = 50 and n = 31, respectively) approximately 1 week after intial assessment.
   Results: The CY-BOCS-II demonstrated moderate-to-strong internal consistency (alpha = 0.75-0.88) and excellent inter-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86-0.92) and test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95-0.98) reliabilities across all scales. Construct validity was supported by strong correlations with clinician-rated measures of OCD symptom severity and moderate correlations with measures of anxiety symptoms. Exploratory factor analysis showed a 2-factor structure, which was generally inconsistent with its adult counterpart, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Second Edition.
   Conclusion: Initial findings support the CY-BOCS-II as a reliable and valid measure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in youth.

AB Close parent-child relationships are protective against the development of delinquent behavior. By creating a context for open communication and trust, parents positively influence adolescent development. The current study examined the associations among attachment quality, family problem-solving, and adolescent risk-taking behavior, as well as the mediating effect of family problem-solving on the relationship between attachment quality and adolescent risk-taking behavior. Participants included 520 adolescents (ages 10 to 19, M = 14.24) and their parents or guardians (N = 520). Two path analyses were conducted to test study hypotheses. As predicted, attachment quality was negatively associated with parent and adolescent perceptions of adolescent risk-taking behavior and positively related to family problem-solving ability, after controlling for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Contrary to our hypothesis, family problem-solving ability did not mediate the effect of attachment quality on parent or youth perceptions of adolescent risk-taking behavior. Preventive interventions that encourage warm, supportive bonds between parents and youth may aid families in deterring youth from negative risk-taking behavior. Further research should examine other family-level factors that might influence adolescent risk-taking via direct and indirect pathways.

AB The current study demonstrated that chronic peer victimization, as compared to time-limited victimization, is particularly associated with peer status and peer-reported adjustment at the adolescent transition. Using a cohort sequential design, a sample of 653 adolescents (48% female, 87% Caucasian) in Grades 6-8 were assessed at 3 annual time points; data captured indices of peer victimization, likeability, popularity, and several peer-reported indices of internalizing (e.g., sadness, worry) and externalizing (e.g., anger, fighting) symptoms across Grades 6-10. Four trajectories of victimization experiences were identifiedchronic, high decreasing, low increasing, and low stablesuggesting instability in victimization experiences over time. Adolescents who experienced chronic victimization, as compared to those with low-stable, decreasing, or increasing levels of victimization, were rated by peers more often on indices of maladjustment and less often on measures of popularity and likeability. Findings highlight negative associations with chronic victimization and underscore the need for targeted interventions to prevent chronic victimization. Overall, findings further emphasize the role of chronicity in victimization and highlight the importance of identifying chronic victims for intervention and prevention efforts.

AB This study aimed to examine the concurrent relation between six dimensions of emotion dysregulation, proposed by Gratz and Roemer (2004), and suicide ideation and attempt in a large sample of psychiatric adolescent inpatients. A sample of 547 adolescent inpatients completed measures on dimensions of emotion dysregulation, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicidal ideation and attempt. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that limited access to emotion regulation strategies, difficulties in impulse control, and mood disorder diagnosis, were significantly associated with past year suicidal ideation, covarying for other emotion dysregulation subscales, anxiety and externalizing diagnoses, sex, and age. However, difficulties in impulse control was not significantly related to suicide ideation when analyses were conducted separately by sex. Binary logistic regressions also revealed that past year suicidal ideation uniquely and significantly associated with lifetime attempt, covarying for sociodemographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and all emotion dysregulation subscales; these results held when analyses were also conducted separately by sex. Results indicating an association between perceived limited emotion regulation strategies and suicide ideation are consistent with existing research and suicide-focused theory. This finding may have some tentative benefit to informing clinical assessment and treatment of suicidal thoughts. Other findings are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE
   The aim of the present study was to determine the emotional and behavioral problems among school-age children of mothers with breast cancer (BC) and the difficulties they experienced during the mothers' illness.
   METHODS
   The participants included 40 children and adolescents of patients with BC and age- and sex-matched 40 healthy controls between the ages of 6 and 17 years. The study group filled out a sociodemographic data form that was prepared by the researchers and evaluated the demographic data and psychosocial effects of maternal cancer on children. The parents of all participants filled out the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Parent Form to determine the emotional and behavioral problems in children.
   RESULTS
   Conduct problems, attention deficit and hyperactivity, and total difficulty scores of the SDQ were significantly higher in children of mothers with BC (p<0.05). Scores for emotional problems, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviors were similar in both groups. Scores for emotional problems, peer problems, and total difficulties were significantly higher in girls of patients with BC than in boys. There was positive correlation between child's age and total difficulty scores (p<0.05). There were several problems, such as changes in new family responsibilities and some life difficulties, in children and adolescents of patients with BC.
   CONCLUSION
   The results of the present study showed that the emotional and behavioral problems of children and adolescents of mothers with BC were higher than those of controls, and that maternal illness caused distress for children in many areas of their lives. Our results may increase the awareness of health care providers that some children may have difficulties in adjusting to their parents' illness.

AB ObjectiveThe purpose of the present study was threefold: first, to analyse the psychometric properties of a 10-item Spanish version of the Purpose in Life Test, which assesses meaning in life (MiL), in a sample of community adolescents; second, to analyse the differences between the age and gender groups; and third, to analyse whether MiL buffers the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness.
   MethodParticipants were 1,599 adolescents from 12 to 19years old, M=15.69, SD=2.14. The Purpose in Life Test-10 Items, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale were used.
   ResultsA nine-item version showed good fit, psychometric properties (internal consistency, construct, and concurrent validity), and factorial invariance across gender and age (12-15years/16-19years). Difference in MiL between boys and girls was not significant, whereas between age groups was significant. MiL had a strong buffering effect on the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness.
   DiscussionIt is desirable to promote the sense of MiL in adolescents. MiL plays a significant and strong mediator role in the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness, reinforcing the positive role of MiL in mental health and as a resource for facing adversity.

AB Introduction: It is known that music may enhance emotional well-being which may have a positive effect on sleep. The goal of the present study was to examine whether a specific type of music, rapping and singing (Rap & Sing Music Therapy (Rap&SingMT)) could serve as a motivating engagement strategy to improve sleep in adolescents.
   Methods: Fifty-two adolescents received Rap&SingMT, 45 min, once a week, during four months in a group school setting. Twenty-three adolescents in the control group received a program of various mental activities - but no music. Actigraphy assessed six sleep variables: sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep episodes, snooze time, onset latency and wake percentage. Sleep assessments took place at baseline and after four months (post-testing).
   Results: A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance failed to demonstrate a significant effect of Rap&SingMT on "overall" sleep. However, a decline in total sleep time over a period of four months was less in the Rap&SingMT group than in the control group.
   Discussion: Despite the fact that the participants did not suffer from sleep disturbances, a seasonal change over the experimental period of four months appeared to have less impact on total sleep time in the Rap&SingMT group. These findings will be addressed in more detail.

AB Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display alterations in both emotion reactivity and regulation. One mechanism underlying such alternations may be reduced coherence among emotion systems (i.e., autonomic, facial affect). The present study sought to examine this. One hundred children (50 with ADHD combined presentation), 7-11 years of age (62% male, 78% White), completed an emotion induction and suppression task. This task was coded for facial affect behavior across both negative and positive emotion eliciting task conditions. Electrocardiogram and impedance cardiography data were acquired throughout the task. Time-linked coherence of facial affect behavior and autonomic reactivity and regulation were examined during the induction conditions using hierarchical linear modeling. Although ADHD and typically developing children did not differ with respect to rates of facial affect behavior displayed (all Fs < 2.09, ps > .29), the ADHD group exhibited reduced coherence between facial affect behavior and an index of parasympathetic functioning (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia), gamma(10) = -0.03, SE = 0.02, t(138) = -1.96, p = .05. In contrast, children in the control group displayed a significant, positive, gamma(10) = 0.06, SE = 0.01, t(138) = 4.07, p < .001, association between facial affect behavior and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Children with ADHD may receive conflicting emotional signals at the levels of facial affective behavior and parasympathetic functioning when compared to typically developing youth. Weakened coherence among these emotion systems may be an underlying mechanism of emotion dysregulation in ADHD. Implications for etiology and treatment are discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to examine age, gender, alexithymia and social anxiety as predictors of computer gaming addiction among children. Method: The research was carried out on a total of 321 persons, 148 of whom were girls and 173 were boys. The ages of the participants were between 8 and 12 and their average age was 10.48. Research data were collected via Computer Gaming Addiction Scale for Children, Alexithymia Scale for Children, Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Personal Information Form. Parametric tests were used because it was found that the data of research were normally distributed and met the necessary assumptions for multiple regressions. The data obtained from the research were analyzed by Pearson Correlation Analysis and Hierarchical Regression Analysis method. Results: A positive correlation has been found between computer gaming addiction and alexithymia and social anxiety. In addition, age, gender, alexithymia and social anxiety were significantly predictive of computer gaming addiction at 24.1%. In the research, it was identified that the most effect in explaining computer gaming addiction was alexithymia, followed by gender and social anxiety. Discussion: It is found out that gender, alexithymia and social anxiety affect computer gaming addiction in children significantly. The results of research were discussed in the light of the related literature and suggestions were made to the researchers and experts studying in the field.

AB The aim of the article is to discuss the standards of clinical diagnosis in children and adolescents in the context of theoretical models and psychological practice. Contemporary clinical practice standards refer to evidence-based practice (including evidence-based psychological practice, EBPP). A correct interdisciplinary diagnosis, as in the global standards, is primarily required due to an observed increase in the prevalence of emotional problems, behavioural difficulties and mental disorders among younger and younger children. The clinical psychological diagnostic process plays a key role in this respect. It is a process that takes into account both the individual and developmental context as well as the biopsychosocial nature of difficulties experienced by the child. Inference based on the interview, observation and results of standardised psychological tools, referring to clinical research and scientific theories, is an essential part of this process. The paper discusses in detail the worldwide standards of a clinical psychological diagnostic process and the specificity of clinical diagnosis in children and adolescents. At the same time, guidelines for clinical psychological diagnosis in children and adolescents have been proposed in relation to the Polish realities of clinical practice. The authors prepared and shared a list of psychological tests for use in clinical assessment of children and adolescents. The list is divided based on the studied development period (early childhood, pre-school age, school age, adolescence) and the specificity of measuring psychological variables (diagnosis of development, intelligence, cognitive abilities, emotional and social competence and personality, language development, family context, symptoms of mental disorders). The proposed psychological test list corresponds to the contemporary approach to clinical diagnosis, taking into account both the psychological profile and the socio-cultural context of the examined person's functioning (psychosocial diagnosis). The evidence-based practice and the proposed list of psychological tools assume that good clinical practice should be based not only on the clinician's experience, but above all on verified, reliable data and available scientific research.

AB We analyze how life satisfaction changes when adolescents leave school and enter the German vocational and educational training (VET) system. We draw on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS, Starting Cohort 4) and apply fixed effect regression models. Our findings suggest that leaving school and entering the VET system is associated with an increase in life satisfactionregardless of the occupational status (i.e., whether the individual is in dual or school-based vocational training or in a vocational preparation program). Moreover, our results provide evidence that adolescents are happy to leave school; that having high self-esteem leads to a smaller increase in life satisfaction, and that reaching or failing one's educational aspirations does not explain changes in life satisfaction.

AB Body appreciation, a facet of positive body image with important implications for women's wellbeing and mental health, has been reported to associate with important emotion regulation mechanisms such as self-compassion and psychological flexibility. Using a sample of adult women from the Portuguese general population (N=288), the present study aimed to explore how self-compassionate engagement and action competences may differentially impact on body appreciation, and whether psychological flexibility mediates self-compassionate engagement's relationship with self-compassionate action. Path analysis' results showed that while self-compassionate action directly associates with body appreciation, the effect of self-compassionate engagement on self-compassionate action and body appreciation appears to be mediated by psychological flexibility. It thus seems that psychological flexibility may be involved in the positive association between self-compassionate sensitivity and motivation and effective self-compassionate action, which altogether associate with higher body appreciation. The combination of strategies of Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may potentiate the promotion of positive body image in adult women.

AB The Affective Style Questionnaire assesses the 3 emotion regulation strategies suppression, adjusting/reappraisal, and acceptance and was adapted for adolescents (ASQ-Y) and validated using an adolescent sample (N = 1,092). The results confirmed the expected dimensionality of the English and German versions for adults. An exploratory structural equation modeling procedure (ESEM) yielded model-fit indicators that ranged from acceptable to very good values. The comparative fit index reached an acceptable value of.938, the Tucker-Lewis index yielded an acceptable value of.911. The root mean square error of approximation reached a very good value of.050, and the standardized root mean square residual resulted in a good value of.030. The internal consistencies of the 3 scales reached satisfactory values and were comparable to the English and German versions for adults (suppression: alpha =.77; adjusting/reappraisal: alpha =.76; acceptance: alpha =.76). The 3 subscales showed expected correlations with established instruments in the field of emotion regulation, providing evidence for construct validity. In sum, the ASQ-Y is a suitable and economic instrument for assessing three distinct strategies of emotion regulation in adolescents. The ASQ-Y may be applicable not only in the healthy general population and for prevention purposes but also in clinical settings after appropriate validation studies.

AB The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 is a large population-based birth cohort, which aims to promote health and wellbeing of the population. In this paper, we systematically review the psychiatric research performed in the cohort until today, i.e. at the age of 32 years of the cohort (2018). We conducted a systematic literature search using the databases of PubMed and Scopus and complemented it with a manual search. We found a total of 94 articles, which were classified as examining ADHD, emotional and behavioural problems, psychosis risk or other studies relating to psychiatric subjects. The articles are mainly based on two large comprehensive follow-up studies of the cohort and several substudies. The studies have often used also nationwide register data. The studies have found several early predictors for the aforementioned psychiatric outcomes, such as problems at pregnancy and birth, family factors in childhood, physical inactivity and substance use in adolescence. There are also novel findings relating to brain imaging and cognition, for instance regarding familial risk of psychosis in relation to resting state functional MRI. The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 has been utilised frequently in psychiatric research and future data collections are likely to lead to new scientifically important findings.

AB Although the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is involved in aggression and social affiliation, it has not been examined in gene-environment interaction studies. This longitudinal study examined the effect of genetic variants in OXTR and its gene-environment interaction with perceived deviant peer affiliation in the trajectories of antisocial behavior in 323 adolescents (182 males) from 13 to 18 years. Annual assessments of reactive and proactive aggression, delinquency, and friends' delinquency, as well as DNA at age 17 were collected. Gene-based tests yielded no main effect of OXTR, but revealed a significant gene-environment interaction in proactive aggression and delinquency. Variation in the OXTR might affect the influence of deviant peer affiliation on antisocial behavior, contributing to a better understanding of individual differences in antisocial behavior.

AB Coping Power is an evidence-based preventive intervention for youth with aggressive behavior problems that has traditionally been delivered in small group formats, but because of concerns about potentially diminished effects secondary to aggregation of high-risk youth, an individual format of Coping Power has been developed. The current study examined whether physiological characteristics of the child may provide information about which intervention delivery format works best for that individual. Indicators of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system functioning were examined in 360 fourth-grade children (65% male; 76.4% self-reported African-American) who were randomly assigned to Group Coping Power (GCP) or Individual Coping Power (ICP) (Lochman et al. 2015). Longitudinal assessments of teacher- and parent-reported proactive and reactive aggression were collected through a 1-year follow-up. For children with higher initial levels of aggression, those with lower parasympathetic functioning at pre-intervention showed greater reductions in teacher-rated proactive aggression in the ICP condition than the GCP condition. For children with high parasympathetic functioning, there was no differential effect of intervention format. Regardless of intervention format, youth with lower levels of sympathetic functioning at pre-intervention demonstrated greater reductions in teacher-rated proactive aggression. These findings suggest that physiological indicators may be worth considering in future studies examining which youth respond best to specific types of interventions.

AB Background: Emotional and behavioral problems place a heavy burden on the adolescents and their families. Many factors are known to influence adolescent mental health. The current study was designed to determine the predictors of emotional and behavioral problems among Indian adolescents.
   Methods: The parents of adolescents in the age group of 10 to 18 (N = 81) were recruited from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (Parent version), Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (Parent version) and, the Parent Interview Schedule (PIS) were used to assess the parental practices, emotional and behavioral problems and abnormal psychosocial environment of the adolescents. The data were analyzed with stepwise multiple linear and Quantile regression to find out significant predictors of emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents.
   Results: Adolescent's age, parental involvement, and paternal age are the significant predictors of emotional problems. Parental mental disorder or deviance, gender, and inconsistent discipline are the significant predictors for conduct problems. Poor monitoring and supervision, paternal and maternal age are statistically significant predictors of prosocial skills among the adolescents. Inadequate or distorted intrafamilial communication and parental mental disorder are the significant predictors of total difficulties among the adolescents.
   Conclusion: The study validates the role of abnormal psychosocial environments and negative parenting practices as risk factors for emotional and behavioral problems among the adolescents. A comprehensive analysis which covers all possible variables related to adolescent mental health is mandatory for the health professionals before planning the intervention.

AB The present study examined the impact of frustration on risk-taking in college students with low and high ADHD symptomatology (L-ADHD and H-ADHD). Participants completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) following induced frustration from a mood manipulation task (experimental session) and following no mood manipulation (control session). A manipulation check revealed a significant three-way interaction where the H-ADHD group reported higher frustration levels compared to the L-ADHD group, particularly in response to the frustration induction in the experimental condition. Primary results revealed that the L-ADHD group exploded significantly fewer balloons in the experimental condition compared to the control condition; there was a nonsignificant difference of balloon explosions across conditions for the H-ADHD group. The study provides initial laboratory-based support for the impact of frustration on the risk behavior of those with low and high levels of ADHD, with potential implications for future studies and ultimately for intervention.

AB Research on early childhood predictors of violent behaviors in early adulthood is limited. The current study investigated whether individual, family, and community risk factors from 18 to 42 months of age were predictive of violent criminal arrests during late adolescence and early adulthood using a sample of 310 low-income male participants living in an urban community. In addition, differences in trajectories of overt conduct problems (CP), hyperactivity/attention problems (HAP), and co-occurring patterns of CP and HAP from age 11/2 to 10 years were investigated in regard to their relationship to violent and nonviolent behaviors, depression, and anxiety at age 20. Results of multivariate analyses indicated that early childhood family income, home environment, emotion regulation, oppositional behavior, and minority status were all significant in distinguishing violent offending boys from those with no criminal records. In addition, trajectories of early childhood CP, but not attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, were significantly related to self-reports of violent behavior, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Implications for the prevention of early childhood risk factors associated with adolescent and adult violent behavior for males are discussed.

AB The study examined the efficacy of a school-based mindfulness intervention on mental health and emotion regulation outcomes among adolescents in a wait-list controlled trial. The study also explored mediators and moderators of intervention effects. A total of 145 predominantly ethnic minority (Asian and Latino) 9th grade students with elevated mood symptoms were randomized to receive a 12-week mindfulness intervention at the start of the academic year, or in the second semester of the year. Students completed measures of emotion regulation and mental health symptoms at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant treatment effects of the mindfulness intervention for internalizing symptoms and perceived stress at post-treatment. Pooled pre-to-post treatment analyses of the entire sample revealed a small effect size for attention problems, medium for internalizing and externalizing problems, and large for perceived stress. We also found a small effect size for cognitive reappraisal, medium for expressive suppression, emotional processing, emotional expression, and rumination and large for avoidance fusion. Mediation analyses showed that treatment effects on internalizing symptoms and perceived stress were mediated by reductions in expressive suppression and rumination. Moderation analyses revealed that treatment effects were larger among youth with more severe problems at baseline for internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and perceived stress. However, for attention problems, students with lower severity at baseline appeared to have larger treatment gains. The study provided evidence that mindfulness intervention was beneficial for low-income ethnic minority youth in reducing perceived stress and internalizing problems, and improving emotion regulation outcomes. Furthermore, mindfulness training was associated with reduced mental health symptoms via improvements in emotion regulation.

AB Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was included in the Addendum to DSM-5 as a condition for further study. Studies of community samples using a diagnostic interview are lacking, and evaluations of the proposed symptoms, comorbidities, and predictors of IGD are scarce. To provide such information participants in a Norwegian prospective community study were assessed with a clinical interview at age 10years. Symptoms of other psychiatric disorders were measured with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment at ages 8 and 10 (n=740). Children, parents, and teachers provided information on demographics, temperament, intelligence, executive functions, self-concept, social skills, victimization, emotion regulation, family climate, and parenting. Results indicated that IGD was present in 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.7-2.7) of the participants (3.0% boys and 0.5% girls). Factor analysis revealed two factors: heavy involvement and negative consequences. The positive predictive value of withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming symptoms to the disorder was low. Symptoms of other common disorders correlated weakly with IGD-symptoms (i.e., from r=0.07 to r=0.15). Upon adjusting for gender and gaming at age 8, only limited social and emotion regulation skills at age 8 predicted more age-10 IGD symptoms. In conclusion, IGD is already present in a small percentage of Norwegian 10-year olds. At least three of the proposed symptoms -- withdrawal, tolerance and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming -- merit further study given their weak associations with the disorder. Symptoms of IGD are only marginally associated with symptoms of other psychiatric disorders and only predicted by social skills and emotion regulation deficits.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study investigated reciprocal longitudinal associations between media use/physical activity and adolescents' psychological health.
   METHODS: Data were collected between 2011 and 2017 in the LIFE Child study in Germany. The sample included 814 10-to 17-year-old adolescents. The participants provided information on their media use per day (hours of television/video, computer/Internet, and mobile phone use), physical activity (frequency of organized and non-organized physical activity per week), behavioral difficulties (emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems), and quality of life (physical and psychological well-being; satisfaction with parents, peers, and school) at 2 time points 12 months apart. Multiple regressions were applied to analyze reciprocal longitudinal associations between media use/physical activity and behavioral difficulties/quality of life.
   RESULTS: Frequent use of computers/Internet at baseline was associated with an increase in internalizing behavioral difficulties (emotional problems and peer relationship problems) at follow-up. Additionally, a high frequency of computer/Internet and mobile phone use was related to a decrease in psychological well-being, whereas a high frequency of organized physical activity was linked to improved physical well-being. The analyses also revealed a link between more behavioral difficulties at baseline and increased television consumption at follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests mutual dependencies between electronic media use and psychological health over time.

AB Depression in adults is associated with deficits in a number of cognitive domains, however it remains less clear how early in development theses deficits can be detected in early onset depression. There are several different hypotheses about the links between cognitive function and depression. For example, it has been argued that executive function deficits contribute to emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn increase risk for depression. Further, it has been suggested that some cognitive deficits, such as episodic memory, may reflect hippocampal abnormalities linked to both depression and episodic memory. We examined these questions in adolescents participating in a longitudinal study of preschool onset depression. We measured cognitive function at adolescence using the National Institutes of Health toolbox (vocabulary, processing speed, executive function, working memory and episodic memory), and examined relationships of cognitive deficits to depression, emotion regulation, life stress and adversity, as well as hippocampal volume trajectories over three imaging assessments starting at school age. Depression related deficits in episodic memory were found. Youths with either current and past depression showed episodic memory deficits even after controlling for other psychopathology and family income. Depression seventy, emotion dysregulation, and life stress/adversity all predicted episodic memory impairment, as did smaller intercepts and slopes of hippocampal growth over time. Modest relationships of depression to hippocampal volume and strong relationships between emotion regulation and both episodic memory and hippocampal volume were found. These data are consistent with prior work in adults linking depression, episodic memory, emotion regulation, life stress/adversity, and hippocampal volume in adults and suggest similar relations are evident as early as adolescence when memory systems are under development.

AB The ability to process and manage one's own feelings and those of others in order to attend and solve emotional problems is part of the emotional competences. The development of these skills during adolescence influences positively their personal, social and school functioning. The aim was to study the impact of emotional competence and self-esteem on adolescents' psychological adjustment, focusing on potential sex and age differences. Participants were 855 Spanish adolescents aged 12-15 years old (M = 13.60; SD = 1.09), from de Valencian Community. The Emotional Skills and Competencies Questionnaire (ESCQ), the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSE) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were assessed. Descriptive statistics, correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were performed. The results indicated significant sex differences, but not regarding age. Girls were observed to be more competent in perceiving and understanding emotions than boys, however they reported more emotional symptoms. Boys obtained higher levels of self-esteem than girls, presenting more behavioural difficulties. Regression analysis showed that emotional competence and self-esteem are associated with less emotional symptoms and less conduct problems. Our findings reveal the predominant role of self-esteem in predicting adolescents' psychological adjustment, especially emotional symptoms.

AB There is a large evidence base supporting the efficacy of mindfulness interventions in adulthood, and growing support for the efficacy of these interventions in adolescence. Historically mindfulness interventions have been delivered in person and in groups, with recommendations for home practice being a critical part of the intervention. However, compliance with these practice recommendations in adolescence is very poor. Past studies indicate that using mobile technology to promote skill transfer to real life can be an effective strategy, particularly when used as a supplement to an in-person intervention strategy. To date, however, mobile technology has largely been used to create stand-alone mindfulness interventions. The goals of the current paper are to discuss the potential opportunities and challenges with a mobile-technology-enhanced mindfulness intervention, and to present the rationale that such an approach is not only theoretical and empirically sound but also a critical next step to increase the efficacy and developmental appropriateness of mindfulness interventions for adolescents. This discussion is grounded in a specific example of a mindfulness intervention supplemented by a momentary intervention we are developing.

AB This study explores whether the associations between mindfulness and self-compassion skills and emotional eating are mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation in adolescents with overweight/obesity, and whether the direct and indirect effects vary according to nutritional treatment and weight status. The sample included 245 adolescents (12-18 years old) with overweight (85(th)Body Mass Index (BMI)<97(th) percentile) and obesity (BMI97th percentile; WHO 2006) undergoing or not nutritional treatment. Participants completed self-reported measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, difficulties in emotion regulation and emotional eating. Regardless of undergoing or not nutritional treatment and of weight status, difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the associations between mindfulness and emotional eating, and between self-compassion and emotional eating. Specifically, higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion skills were associated with less difficulties in emotion regulation, which, in turn, were associated with less emotional eating (mindfulness: point estimate=-0.14, SE=0.06, 95%CI=-0.26/-0.05; self-compassion: point estimate=-1.76, SE=0.67, 95%CI=-3.20/-0.58). Moreover, whereas mindfulness skills were directly associated with emotional eating, self-compassion was only indirectly associated with emotional eating, suggesting that self-compassion skills are related to emotional eating only because these skills enable more adaptive emotion regulation. Mindfulness and self-compassion may help adolescents with overweight/obesity develop more adaptive responses to emotional distress, which consequently may help them develop healthier eating behaviors. Future research should be developed on the adequacy of mindfulness and compassion-based approaches for adolescents with overweight/obesity.

AB The individual predictors of drinking behaviors among second-generation immigrant adolescents are still understudied. This study investigated emotion regulation strategies and alcohol abuse in 472 adolescents (86 second-generation immigrants and 386 Italian natives; age range: 17-18). The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were used to assess cognitive reappraisal, emotional suppression, and alcohol abuse, respectively. Immigrants reported lower alcohol abuse than natives. A negative relationship between cognitive reappraisal and alcohol abuse was found for immigrants, but not for natives. Specifically, cognitive reappraisal was a protective factor against alcohol abuse only for immigrant adolescents. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB Background Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and spina bifida (SB) are at an increased risk for mental health problems. Aim of this study was to correlate disease specific and psychosocial risk factors with characteristic mental health problems.
   Patients 271 children with CP and 84 with SB aged 3-17 years were included in a cross sectional study of 15 centers.
   Methods Parents answered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for mental health problems, rated social participation of their children and gave data to their own educational and professional level. IQ and motor impairment were tested or rated by the caring pediatricians.
   Results Abnormal Total-Difficulties Scores were found in CP (30,2%) and SB (18,1%) as compared to the norm (10,0%). Increased prevalences persisted after controlling for IQ as covariate. In both groups, moderate correlations between externalizing problems and levels of cognitive and motor impairment were found. Emotional problems correlated with participation irrespective of level of impairment. Weak correlations were found with age and gender in both groups. After controlling for IQ as covariate mental health problems showed no systematic difference between both groups.
   Discussion Mental health problems in children and youth with CP and SB are frequent. They correlated with various risk factors (IQ, motor impairment, age, gender, participation). Early recognition, participation and psychotherapeutic facilities should be strengthened.

AB Successful emotion regulation (ER) is a central aspect of psychosocial functioning and mental health and is thought to improve and be refined in adolescence. Past research on ER has mainly focused on one-time measurements of habitual ER. Linking regulatory strategies to emotions in daily lives is key to understanding adolescents' emotional lives. Using an Experience Sampling Method with 78 adolescents (M-age = 13.91, SDage = .95, 66% girls), we investigated the use, selection, and success in down-regulating negative emotions of eight ER strategies across 44 assessments. Acceptance was the strategy employed most often followed by problem-solving, rumination, distraction, avoidance, reappraisal, social support, and suppression. Interestingly, negativity of the event influenced the use of ER strategies: With low intensity negative emotions, acceptance was more likely to be used, and with high intensity negative emotions, suppression, problem-solving, distraction, avoidance, social support, and rumination were more likely to be used. With regard to success, multilevel models revealed that problem-solving, reappraisal, and acceptance were more successful in down-regulating negative emotions than rumination. Further, among girls, no relations between the momentary use of ER strategies and depressive symptoms was found. Among boys, a negative relation between acceptance and depressive symptoms emerged. Results from this study suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between the intensity of negative emotions and ER strategies and that gender differences may exist. Taken together, this study showed which ER strategies are used by a healthy adolescent sample, and these results are discussed with regard to their theoretical and practical importance.

AB Evidence-based parenting programmes are beneficial for children's behavioural and emotional problems as well as parenting practices. Along with effectiveness, attendance affects the programme outcome and identification of risks associated with dropout may aid in development of special policy to increase engagement. In this study, we aimed to compare sociodemographics, parental attitudes, child behavioural and emotional problems of programme-completing and dropout parents from Level-4 Triple-P parenting programme applied at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). We also aimed to determine the attrition rate. In addition, we inquired whether there was a change in parenting styles and child behaviour and emotional problems before and after Level-4 Triple-P for the programme-completing parents at CAMHS. Results displayed that 52% (n = 58) of the parents who were significantly less educated, used hostile rejecting attitudes, and reported more hyperactive/inattentive behaviour in their children compared to the parents who competed the programme (p = 0.022, p = 0.016, p = 0.027, respectively) discontinued the programme. Parents who were able to complete the programme (n = 54) reported a reduction in over-parenting and improvements in children's conduct problems along with overall stress levels before and after Triple-P (p = 0.009, p = 0.040, p = 0.023). Parents at risk of discontinuing parenting programmes may require special policy to be engaged since these programmes may offer significant benefits for parenting practices and, in turn, children's well-being.

AB Objective This study examined baseline child social and emotional functioning as predictors of therapeutic alliance during a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with anxiety disorders. It was hypothesized that better social and emotional functioning at baseline would be related to stronger alliance initially and over the course of treatment. Method Ninety-two anxious youth, ages 7-11 years (M age = 8.93 years, SD = 1.64; 42% female) participated. Children, caregivers, and teachers completed measures of child social and emotional functioning. Therapeutic alliance was measured using therapist-rated and observer-coded reports. Results Receiving prosocial support from peers and emotion regulation (ER) were both related to initial rating and slope of alliance. Conclusions Child social and emotional functioning enhances our understanding of how the alliance is formed and in identifying children who might be at risk for difficulties in developing a strong therapeutic relationship.

AB Inhibitory control and the effects of negative emotional feedback were investigated in adolescents with a history of violent behavior and normal adolescents using the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), a task simulating real situations of social interaction to elicit aggressive behavior and negative emotions, with concurrent event related potential recordings. The Reactive Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPAQ), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Negative Mood Regulation (NMR) Scale were also presented. These showed that reactive scores, proactive scores, and BIS scores were all significantly higher for the violent offender group whereas scores from the NMR scale were significantly lower for this group. In the TAP, the violent offender group chose significantly higher levels of punishment, indicative of both higher proactive and higher reactive aggression, for their opponent than did the control group. The ERP data showed the N2 amplitude for the decision phase, indicative of inhibitory control, was lower for the violent offender group than for the control group, with mediation analysis showing that the N2 component was related to proactive aggression. The decision-related negativity and the feedback-related negativity in the result phase were also both lower for the violent offender group than for the control group. Adolescent violent offenders showed higher levels of aggressive behavior than normal adolescents. This is associated with both worse inhibitory control and worse negative emotion regulation. Investigation of common factors underlying these processes, in conjunction with possible ways in which they might be improved, should be a priority for future work.

AB Aggression is prevalent in early- to mid-adolescence and is associated with physical health and psychosocial adjustment difficulties. This underscores the need to identify risk processes that lead to externalizing outcomes. This study examined the extent to which the effects of three dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression on physical aggression and externalizing behavior are mediated by anger dysregulation and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Three waves of data were collected from a primarily African American (77%) sample of 265 middle school students between the ages of 11 and 15 (52% were female). We found evidence supporting mediation such that the effects of beliefs supporting instrumental aggression and beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary at Wave 1 on student-reported physical aggression at Wave 3 were mediated by CU traits at Wave 2, and relations between beliefs supporting reactive aggression at Wave 1 and teacher-report of student frequencies of physical aggression and externalizing behavior at Wave 3 were mediated by anger dysregulation at Wave 2. Our findings demonstrated the importance of distinguishing between dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression, as differential paths emerged between specific beliefs, CU traits and anger dysregulation, and externalizing outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications, as they suggest that specific dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression could be targeted based on whether an individual is at risk for behavior patterns characterizing CU traits or anger dysregulation.

AB Low-income families are less likely to effectively engage in Behavioral Parent Training (BPT), the standard of care for early-onset (3-8 years old) disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs); however, relatively little is known about predictors of treatment process and outcome within this vulnerable group. Given literature to suggest compromises associated with both low-income status and DBDs, this study examined the role of caregiver emotion regulation and socialization practices in 15 low-income families who participated in one evidence-based BPT program, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC). Findings suggest baseline caregiver emotion regulation predicted variability in BPT treatment duration and outcomes, whereas baseline caregiver emotion socialization practices explained variation in the severity of child disruptive behaviors concurrently, as well as BPT treatment outcomes. Furthermore, BPT yielded pre- to posttreatment effect sizes that were equivalent to or better than treatments designed to more explicitly target emotion regulation and socialization processes. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Because intrinsic motivation affects substance use treatment engagement and outcomes, interventions to increase readiness for change are needed. The Treatment Readiness and Induction Program (TRIP) effectively increases intrinsic motivation among youth in community-based residential treatment, but its utility for youth in secure settings is unknown. The current study uses a sequential comparison design to examine the added benefit of TRIP over standard operating practice (SOP) among 125 male adolescents in a juvenile justice treatment facility. Youth receiving TRIP in addition to SOP showed greater increases in problem recognition and desire for help, were three times more likely to want help for emotional problems, and were four times more likely to want individual counseling. Relationships remained after controlling for age and race; however, desire for help was not significant after controlling for substance use severity. Findings document the effectiveness of TRIP for promoting readiness among adolescent males in a secure treatment setting.

AB The present study examined the way in which neighborhood impoverishment, neighborhood social processes, and parenting practices relate to the development of aggressive behavior among children aged 6-8 years raised in low-income neighborhoods. A total of 424 children (male = 207, female = 217) and their families participated in the study. Hierarchical linear regression revealed that neighborhood impoverishment, neighborhood social processes, and parental monitoring/supervision were associated with childhood aggression 2 years later. Neighborhood social processes did not mediate the relation between neighborhood impoverishment and childhood aggression, nor did parental monitoring/supervision mediate the relation between neighborhood characteristics and childhood aggression. Children residing in neighborhoods with substantial poverty are at greater risk of developing aggressive behavior. Strong neighborhood social processes and high levels of parental supervision/monitoring are associated with lower levels of aggression. Despite the protective benefits of neighborhood social processes and high-quality parenting, neighborhood economic deprivation continues to elevate risk of developing aggressive behavior.

AB A better understanding of emotion regulation (ER) within daily life is a growing focus of research. This study evaluated the average use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and concurrent and lagged relationships between these two ER strategies and affect (positive and negative affect) in the daily lives of adolescents. We also investigated the role of the same strategies at the trait level on these within-person relationships. Thirty-three adolescents provided 1,258 reports of their daily life by using the Experience Sampling Method for one week. Regarding the relative use of ER strategies, cognitive reappraisal (M = 2.87, SD = 1.58) was used more often than expressive suppression (M = 2.42, SD = 1.21). While the use of both strategies was positively correlated when evaluated in daily life (p = .01), the same did not occur at the trait level (p = .37). Multilevel analysis found that ER strategies were concurrently related to affect (p<.01), with the exception of cognitive reappraisal-positive affect relationship (p = .11). However, cognitive reappraisal predicted higher positive affect at the subsequent sampling moment (beta = 0.07, p = .03). The concurrent associations between cognitive reappraisal and negative affect vary as function of the use of this strategy at the trait level (beta = 0.05, p = .02). Our findings highlighted the complex associations between daily ER strategies and affect of a normative sample of adolescents.

AB BackgroundCurrent treatments for adolescents with substance use disorder (SUD) have had only limited success. In recent years, research has underlined the role of self-regulatory processes and impulsivity in the development and maintenance of SUD in adolescents. Mindfulness has gained much attention due to its capacity to influence self-regulatory processes, particularly in adult populations. Initial studies have shown the potential of mindfulness-based approaches in younger SUD patients. The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate the added treatment effect of a mindfulness-based group psychotherapy (Mind it!) for adolescents with SUD in comparison to the current standard treatment. Moreover, we seek to explore the feasibility of the intervention and possible mediators of treatment effects.Methods/designThere will be N=340 participants aged between 13 and 19years who are receiving child or adolescent psychiatric or psychotherapeutic inpatient or day treatment targeting their SUD and who have reported substance use 30days before detoxification and do not show acute psychotic or suicidal symptoms at baseline. The study is a prospective randomized controlled multi-center trial in which patients are assessed: (1) after completing a prior detoxification phase (t(0)), (2) at 4 weeks (t(1)), (3) at 8 weeks (t(2)), and (4) at 6 months after t(2) (t(3)). Participants in the intervention group will receive mindfulness-based group psychotherapy in addition to their existing treatment regime. The primary outcome is substance use in the past 30days at follow-up based on the Timeline Followback self-report. Secondary outcomes include craving, severity of dependence, and abstinence motivation. Mindfulness, impulsivity, and emotion regulation will be analyzed as possible mediators of treatment effects.DiscussionThis trial is expected to provide evidence of the added effect of a novel, safe, and feasible treatment option for adolescents with SUD.Trial registrationGerman Register of Clinical Studies, DRKS00014041.

   CHILDREN; STYLE
AB Background: Overweight and obesity are growing problems, with more attention recently, to the role of stress in the starting and maintaining process of these clinical problems. However, the mechanisms are not yet known and well-understood; and ecological momentary analyses like the daily variations between stress and eating are far less studied. Emotional eating is highly prevalent and is assumed to be an important mechanism, as a maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategy, in starting and maintaining the vicious cycle of (pediatric) obesity.
   Objectives: The present study aims to investigate in youngsters (10 - 17 years) the daily relationship between stress and the trajectories of self-reported eating behavior (desire to eat motives; hunger eating motives and snacking) throughout 1 week; as well as the moderating role of emotion regulation and emotional eating in an average weight population.
   Methods: Participants were 109 average weighted youngsters between the age of 10 and 17 years (M-age = 13.49; SD = 1.64). The youngsters filled in a trait-questionnaire on emotion regulation and emotional eating at home before starting the study, and answered an online diary after school time, during seven consecutive days. Desire to eat motives, hunger eating motives and snacking were assessed daily for seven consecutive days.
   Results: Using multilevel analyses results revealed that daily stress is significantly associated with trajectories of desire to eat motives and hunger eating motives. No evidence was found for the moderating role of maladaptive ER in these relationships; marginally significant evidence was found for the moderating role of emotional eating in the trajectories of desire to eat and snacking.
   Discussion: These results stress the importance of looking into the daily relationship between stress and eating behavior parameters, as both are related with change over and within days. More research is needed to draw firm conclusion on the moderating role of ER strategies and emotional eating.

AB BackgroundAs many refugee minors have gone/go through stressful life experiences and uncertainty, one might expect mental health issues, including self-injury. However, literature on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in refugee minors is scarce. This study explores the prevalence, methods, and functions of NSSI in refugee minors in Belgium, and compares research results to the existing literature on NSSI in Western adolescents.MethodsData were obtained from 121 refugee minors (mean age=16.12, SD=1.23; range 14-18years) through schools located in the Flemish and Brussels-Capital regions of Belgium. The sample consists of 39.7% girls and 60.3% boys. Self-report questionnaires were used to explore socio-economic data, NSSI behaviour (e.g. The Brief Non-Suicidal Self-injury Assessment Tool; BNNSI-AT) and emotional and behavioural difficulties (The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; SDQ). Non-parametric Chi square tests were used for statistical comparisons of the obtained data as well as independent-sample t-tests and Fisher's exact tests.ResultsResults show a lifetime NSSI prevalence rate of 17.4%. Being accompanied or not, having both parents around, or living in an asylum centre did not influence NSSI prevalence. An average of 2.65 methods of NSSI was applied (SD=2.50; range 1-9). The mean number of functions per person was six (SD=4.97, range 0-16), with automatic functions reported the most. The data do point towards a greater psychological strain, with 68.4% reporting more than five acts of NSSI. Results of the SDQ's Total Difficulties Scale and, more specifically, of the Emotional Problems, Conduct Problems, Peer Problems and Impact Scales indicate a substantial risk of clinically significant problems within the NSSI group. The Peer Problems and Impact Scales also point towards a high risk for suicidality amongst self-injuring refugees.ConclusionsPrevalence rates, methods and functions are comparable to Western samples. However, the higher incidence of the NSSI and the results on the SDQ also emphasise the vulnerability of refugee minors.

AB This study investigated the role of parental emotion regulation (ER) on children's core symptoms in families of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in middle childhood; the study also explored whether children's physiological ER functioning served as a risk or protective factor with respect to parental relationships. Thirty-one Chinese children with ASD (age 6-11) and their primary caregivers participated in this study. Parental ER and child ASD symptoms were collected via questionnaires from parents. Child cardiac vagal activity (derived from heart rate variability) was measured at rest and during a parent-child interaction task. Using moderation analyses, the results showed that parental ER was not directly associated with children's core ASD symptoms; rather, it interacted significantly with children's resting cardiac vagal activity, but not task-related changes of cardiac vagal activity, to exert an impact on children's core ASD symptoms. Specifically, our findings suggested that parents' difficulties with their own ER significantly impacted their children's core ASD symptoms only for the children who showed blunted resting cardiac vagal activity. Implications for the future measurement of ER in the family context and future directions for intervention are discussed.

AB Introduction and aim : The examination of trait emotional intelligence as an important component of adolescent psychological adjustment and coping has received a great deal of attention. Trait emotional intelligence is expected to reduce the vulnerability to emotional problems by reducing mood deterioration in adverse situations. Most research to date has addressed the regulation of negative affective states, with less attention paid to the responses to positive affect. Thus, the aim of this research was to examine the cross-sectional and prospective associations between trait emotional intelligence dimensions (i.e., trait emotional attention, trait emotional clarity, and trait emotional repair), response styles to negative affect (i.e., depressive rumination and distraction) and response to positive affect (i.e., emotion-focused and self-focused positive rumination and dampening) in adolescence.
   Methods: A 1-year follow-up study was conducted with a sample of 880 adolescents (52.4% girls) aged 14-17 years old (M = 14.74, SD = 0.68) who were enrolled in 18 high schools in Andalusia (Spain). Participants completed self-report measures of trait emotional intelligence, response to negative affect and response styles to positive affect. To analyse the data, hierarchical regression analyses and path analysis were performed.
   Results: Our results showed that high trait emotional attention was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with more dampening of positive affect and more depressive rumination. Furthermore, high trait emotional repair was cross-sectionally and longitudinally related to more distraction to negative affect and more self-focused positive rumination. Some gender differences were also found; girls reported higher trait emotional attention, higher dampening, and higher depressive rumination. Furthermore, boys reported higher trait emotional repair, higher self-focused positive rumination and higher distraction to negative affect.
   Conclusions and discussion: Our findings provide longitudinal evidence of the relationships between trait emotional intelligence and responses to both positive and negative affect during adolescence. Consequently, interventions designed to promote resilience during adolescence could target the development of more adaptive responses to both negative and positive affect within the framework of school-based emotional education programmes.

AB Purpose: To explore the use of International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) based profiles of children's functional abilities in relation to their social competence. Subgroups based on shared profiles of functional ability were investigated as an alternative or complement to subgroups defined by disability categories. Methods: Secondary analysis of a nationally representative data set of young children identified for special education services in the United States was used for the present study. Using five subgroups of children with shared profiles of functional ability, derived from latent class analysis in previous work, regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between social competence and functional abilities profile subgroup membership. Differences among the subgroups were examined using standardized effect sizes. R-2 values were used to examine explained variance in social competence in relation to subgroup membership, disability category, and these variables in combination. Results: Functional ability profile subgroup membership was moderately related to children's social competence outcomes: social skills and problem behaviors. Effect sizes showed significant differences between subgroups. Subgroup membership accounted for more variance in social competence outcomes than disability category. Conclusions: The results provide empirical support for the importance of functional ability profiles when examining social competence within a population of young children with disabilities. Implications for Rehabilitation The extent to which children with disabilities experience difficulty with social competence varies by their functional characteristics. Functional ability profiles can provide practitioners and researchers working young children with disabilities important tools to examine social competence and to inform interventions.

AB Objective: Despite a long history of interest in personality traits and psychosis, the association between personality traits and psychotic experiences in the general population is not yet well understood. One possible factor that could influence the degree of distress from psychotic experiences is emotion regulation. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the association between personality and psychotic symptoms is already apparent in non-clinical youth as well as the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies between personality traits and psychotic experiences.
   Methods: Three thousand one hundred and forty seven college students were surveyed via self-report questionnaires measuring the Five-Factor model of personality, emotion regulation strategies, and psychotic experiences.
   Results: Neuroticism was found to be significantly positively correlated with psychotic experiences, while Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were found to be significantly negatively correlated. Both the suppression and reappraisal strategies mediated the relationship between personality traits and psychotic experiences.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that youth with certain personality traits are more likely to have psychotic experiences. The reappraisal emotion regulation strategy could serve as a protective factor against the distress of psychotic experiences.

AB With access to a unique sample of post-institutionalized Hungarian children, this study focused on the hypothesis that children who had been institutionalized for at least six months after birth have less developed capacities for emotion regulation; 90 children, aged 4-6, were placed in 1 of 3 groups: (1) children who had been institutionalized straight after birth and were adopted from institutional care after the age of 6 months; (2) children adopted within 6 weeks of birth; and (3) children raised by their biological parents. Emotion regulation was assessed in a pretend-play context using the MacArthur Story Stem Batteries by analysing play narratives. Our results supported the hypothesis that early institutional care results in less developed capacities for emotion regulation. Results also indicated that early adopted children's emotion regulation abilities also show some developmental delays when compared to those of children raised in birth families.

AB Objective: The present study aimed to explore the relationship between traumatic experiences, difficulties in emotion regulation, identity confusion and psychopathology.
   Method: Six hundred and thirty five university students volunteered to participate to the first step of the study (460 (72.4%) females and 175 (27.6%) males). The mean age was 20.57 (17-29) years. The participants who scored above the group mean (X = 44) on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) were invited for a diagnostic interview. A total of 69 participants, consisting of 46 females (66.7%) and 23 males (33.3%), with a mean group age of 20.93 (17-29) years, were included in the second step of the study. All participants completed the General Information Form, the CTQ-SF, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Sense of Identity Assessment Form (SIAF), SCID-I and SCID II.
   Results: Prevalence of childhood traumas in the study group was 31.3%. Participants who came from low income groups, who were using psychotropic medications, who had family or personal history of self harm behaviour and who attempted suicide had significantly higher CTQ-SF scores. The SIAF scores of the subgroup diagnosed with psychiatric disorders were significantly higher than those of the undiagnosed. However, they did not differ with respect to their CTQ-SF and DERS scores. Results showed that difficulties in emotion regulation played a partial mediating role in the association of childhood traumatic events, in particular emotional abuse, with identity confusion.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that childhood traumatic events not only have effects on emotion regulation and the development of sense of identity, but also may be associated with self harm behaviours in the later stages of life. For prevention studies, enhancing parenting skills and raising community awareness to this issue would be beneficial.

AB Introduction. This paper presents an assessment of the impact of a social and emotional competencies development program, based on the SEA theoretical model (attention to and understanding emotions, emotional regulation and repair, and adaptive social expression of emotions), in adolescents and preadolescents.
   Method. Students' homeroom teachers implemented the program in a public secondary school over one school year. The participants of this study were 156 young people from ages 11 to 14 years old, all of them students in the first year of the Spanish secondary education system. A quasi-experimental design, with pre/post-test measurements and a control group, was used to evaluate program effectiveness. The tests used for this assessment measured variables of participants' social-emotional competencies, empathy and social adjustment. In addition, a follow-up assessment was carried out 3 months after the end of program implementation.
   Results. The study demonstrates a significant improvement in the social-emotional competencies of program participants, especially in the competencies most related to adaptive social expression of emotions. There were also significant improvements in empathy and social adjustment.
   Discussion and conclusions. The possibility of enhancing social-emotional competencies through the application of a direct classroom intervention program during one school year was confirmed, and the SEA program becomes a candidate to achieve this goal.

DE youth; vandalism; urban environment; urban youth; vandalism functions;
   vandal behaviour; destruction
AB Introduction. Graphic vandalism has become a widespread phenomenon in the space of modern cities. Traditionally, vandalism has been assessed as a negative phenomenon, leading to the destruction of the material, visual and social environment of urban public space. Recently, however, the discourse on the positive meaning of certain forms of vandalism (graffiti, street art, etc.) has been activated. At the same time, there is no discussion of the role and influence of vandalism on public and individual life, although, like any socio-cultural and socio-psychological phenomenon, vandalism has the basis and carries certain messages.
   The aim of this research was to identify and describe the functions of graphic vandalism, taking into account socio-cultural and socio-psychological aspects.
   Methodology and research methods. The study was conducted in the spatial environment of the megalopolis (Ekaterinburg, Russia) by photographing results of vandal acts (more than 6000 photographs) with subsequent trace-assessment and content analysis of images.
   Results and scientific novelty. The structural functions of vandalism at the socio-environmental and individual-subjective levels are identified and characterised. The signalling and designing functions, preparation of social changes and management of public mood are referred to the first level. At the second (individual-subjective) level, the demonstrative-and-protest function, functions of reactions, compensation and self-expression are allocated.The functions are illustrated with the examples of visual representations. A two-dimensional model of vandalism functions is formed, where the functions are distributed in the spaces of "construction / reconstruction", "emotional regulation / moral regulation". It is noted that any function of vandal activity at the individual level becomes a kind of marker "points of tension" at the socio-environmental level.
   The functional variety of vandalism becomes the reason of its ambiguous perception with diverse and occasionally contradictory estimates. The authors came to the conclusion that vandalism is socially considered as the evolutionary managerial instrument of social development, which is capable to weaken impermeability of the normatively and traditionally established limits, providing adjustability of the cultural and material environment in the conditions of innovative and mobilisation changes of society. From the perspective of the personality, vandalism is concerned as individual behaviour over the socially defined limits of activity among ordinary members of the society. Thus, vandalism as the phenomenon of public life acts as a norm and a deviation, to which an assessment is given in dependence on functional significance and subject self-identification of the specific vandal act.
   Practical significance. The research materials and the results obtained can be used to improve and optimise the technologies for management youth vandal activity in megapolises, for prevention and sublimation of destructive forms of youth behaviour in an urban environment.

AB Introduction: Expressive writing interventions consist of brief writing sessions on thoughts and emotions and are known to yield positive benefits on adolescents' mental health. However, the psychological mechanisms explaining these effects are not clear.
   Method: This review explored the psychological processes underlying school-based expressive writing interventions with adolescents. A thematic synthesis of qualitative research consisted of identifying, appraising and summarizing the qualitative evidence of eligible studies.
   Results: Only six of the 510 identified studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. Results provide some validation for cognitive-processing, emotion-regulation, and disinhibition as psychological mechanisms underlying school-based expressive writing with adolescents.
   Conclusions: However, these conclusions are still preliminary because of the paucity of the qualitative evidence found, both in quantity and quality. We recommend that more rigorous and in-depth qualitative research be undertaken to: 1) explore adolescents' subjective experience about the expressive writing intervention, using in-depth individual interviews; 2) thoroughly assess the content of students' texts written during the intervention; and 3) document the process of expressive writing interventions through observational methods. The results of such investigations would support the development and implementation of school-based expressive writing-type of interventions adapted to adolescents.

AB Objective: This study served to establish German norms for the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire self-report (SDQ-S) by using data from a representative epidemiological sample from the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS study). Although the German version of the SDQ has been widely used and normative data for the parent version (SDQ-P) exist, no German norms for the self-report version have been reported, so that practitioners had to rely on the available British norms. In addition, we investigated whether sex- and age-specific norms are necessary. Methods: At the baseline of the KiGGS study, SDQ-S ratings were collected from n = 6,726 children and adolescents between 11 and 17 years (n = 3,440 boys und n = 3,286 girls). We assessed the internal consistency and age/sex effects of the SDQ-S. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the factor structure of the SDQ-S. Banding scores were developed to differentiate children and adolescents with levels of difficulties and categorized them as normal, borderline, and abnormal. General as well as age- and sex-specific bandings were created for both total score and subscales of SDQ-S. In addition, the German norms of the SDQ-S were compared with those of the UK, Norway, and Thailand. Results: The five-factor solution of the SDQ-S (including Emotional symptoms, Conduct problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention, Peer problems, and Prosocial behavior) provided a satisfactory fit to the data. Moderate internal consistencies (Cronbachs ?) were observed for the scales Emotional symptoms, Hyperactivity/Inattention, and Total difficulties score, whereas insufficient internal consistency was found for the scales Peer problems and Conduct problems. However, using McDonalds ? as a more appropriate measure of homogeneity, internal consistencies were found to be satisfactory for all subscales and for Total difficulties. Normative banding scores were established conservatively to avoid producing too many false positives in the category abnormal. In line with previous research, girls showed more emotional problems but fewer Peer problems than boys. German normative bandings of SDQ-S were similar to the original British bandings and those of other countries. Conclusions: This study of the German SDQ-S in a large representative epidemiological sample presents evidence of partly moderate to good psychometric properties. It also supports the usefulness of SDQ-S as an effective and efficient instrument for child and adolescent mental health problems in Germany. German normative banding scores of SDQ-S established in this study were comparable with the original British norms as well as with those of other countries, so that SDQ-S can be recommended as a psychopathological broadband-screening tool.

AB Maternal history of childhood abuse has consistently been linked to increased risk for poor emotional adjustment and parenting as an adult. The aim of this study was to examine a model that may explain the link between maternal history of childhood abuse and mothers' tendencies to respond negatively to their adolescent children's negative emotions. A community sample of 66 mothers with adolescent children participated. Path analysis supported associations between mothers with a history of high betrayal trauma revictimization (i.e., trauma perpetrated by someone close to the mother during childhood and again as a young adult) and increased difficulty regulating their emotions. In turn, mothers who struggled to regulate their own emotions were also more likely to respond negatively to their adolescent's negative emotions. Findings highlight effects of childhood trauma may be particularly problematic for mothers who are revictimized as young adults. These results provide the foundation for future research evaluating clinical interventions targeted at increasing maternal emotion regulation skills.

AB Doxing is the searching for and intentional disclosure of private information about a particular individual on the Internet without his or her consent, and is often used to exact punishment. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between doxing victimization and emotional problems in secondary school students, paying particular regard to the impacts of different types of doxed information, the relationship between the perpetrators and victims of doxing, and the nature of the online platforms where doxing occurs. A sample of 2120 Hong Kong secondary school students of differing socioeconomic backgrounds participated in the study. The results show that almost all types of disclosed personal information result in negative feelings in victims, including depression, anxiety, and stress. Girls were also found to be more likely than boys to be doxed. Significant associations were found between emotional problems and the disclosure of mobile phone numbers and personal photos and videos; doxing conducted by schoolmates and anxiety and depression, and doxing through Instant Messenger and anxiety. Further exploration of integrated cyber violence prevention programs and research on the details of doxing are recommended.

It is possible to hypothesize a significant discouragement in dyslexics enrolled at university, as a result of their learning difficulties, which may result in psychopathological disorders secondary to these difficulties. This study, for the first time, administered the Self Administrated Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA) test to university students and investigated whether male and female university students with dyslexia demonstrated more psychopathological symptoms than males and females without dyslexia.
   Methods
   This study involved a total of 80 monolingual Italian university students: 27 students with dyslexia (16 males and 11 females) and 53 non-dyslexic students (21 males and 32 females). The mean age of the dyslexic group was 19.87 (SD = 1.21) and that of the control group was 21.51 (SD = 1.27). Psychiatric symptoms were examined with the standardized SAFA test. We administered to our groups the Anxiety, Depression, Obsessive-compulsive disorders, Psychogenic eating disorders, Somatic symptoms and hypochondria scales and subscales. Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to assess potential differences in the SAFA scales and subscales both between male university students with dyslexia and without dyslexia and between females with dyslexia and without dyslexia.
   Results
   Relative to males without dyslexia, the male students with dyslexia obtained significantly higher scores on SAFA Total Anxiety scale and on Social Anxiety, School/university Anxiety and Insecurity subscales. No significant differences were found on the SAFA scales and subscales between the two group of female university students. Examining the number of university students who fell within pathological range we found a higher number of male students with dyslexia that appeared to show psychopathological disorders on almost all the SAFA scales and subscales, relative to the control group.
   Conclusions
   Despite our findings should be considered as preliminary results, our study provides evidence that the psychopathological consequences of the dyslexia appear to be life-long. The present work had the strength of focusing on university students with dyslexia, that have been under-investigated to date, and of examining male and female university students with dyslexia separately. The males appear at higher risk for anxiety disorders than females with dyslexia. Thus, our results call attention to the importance of separately considering male and female university students with dyslexia when their psychiatric symptoms are investigated. Finally, our preliminary data seem to provide support to the effectiveness of the SAFA test for the identification of psychopathological conditions and for suggesting deeper examination and specific interventions in young adults.

AB Problematic mobile phone use is an important problem which has increasing prevalence among adolescents. We should address risk factors to create intervention frameworks related to this problem. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of problematic smartphone use among adolescents who were referred to clinics, its relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric symptoms and emotion regulation problems. We included 150 adolescents aged 12-18 years who own smartphones. All participants filled out the Sociodemographic Information Form, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale (PMPUS). Problematic smart phone use was detected in 50.6% of the sample. Adolescents with problematic use were found to be older than the others, with lower levels of matemal education and self-achievement. Regression analysis revealed that the factors predicting the risk of problematic smartphone use are somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and hostility symptoms. According to our results, we suggest psychiatrists consider the high prevalence of problematic smartphone use, address the relationship between hostility, somatic symptoms and interpersonal sensitivity (susceptibility) and the effects of this current problem on social-academic functioning while evaluating and treating adolescents.

AB Social cognition deficits and emotion dysregulation (ED) are frequently separately studied in relation to ADHD. This study aimed to examine the link between theory of mind (ToM) abilities and ED in children with ADHD. Participants were 200 children aged 11-17 years (study group, n = 100; healthy controls, n = 100). Emotion regulation skills were quantified by using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). ToM was quantified by three different tasks. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale parents form was used for determination of ADHD symptom severity (ADHD-SS). Children in the study group had more overall difficulties regulating their emotions than healthy controls. Within the study group, a significant correlation was found between the scores of DERS-total and ADHD-SS; and between the scores of DERS-total and gender. The linear regression showed that the predictor variables accounted for 56% of the variation in DERS-total. Unexpected Outcomes Test (UOT) scores significantly improved the accountability of the total variance when added to the linear regression. Our findings show that theory of mind deficits may partly explain ED in children with ADHD.

AB Less is known about nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents and young adults living in areas under prolonged political violence. This study aims to explore the frequencies of NSSI as well as the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, and sleep problems among 889 Palestinian adolescents and young adults. The participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, PTSS, depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep difficulties. The results found that 13.8% of the total sample are frequently engaging in some form of NSSI behavior. Moreover, 43.1% exhibited severe symptoms of PTSD, and almost one-third of the sample reported severe symptoms of depression (30.1%); more than two-thirds of the sample (68.4%) experience sleep difficulties. Those who engage in NSSI were found to be at higher risk for sleep problems, depression, and PTSS. Avoidance/numbing, as well as hyperarousal symptoms clusters of PTSS, were significantly associated with NSSI above and beyond depressive symptoms. These results suggest that NSSI is frequently a sequelae of prolonged exposure to trauma and violence, and highlight the importance of routine assessment of this behavior. It is crucial to be familiar with the association between PTSS, sleep difficulties, and NSSI in a clinical setting to implement programs focusing on preventing these domains.

AB The current study examined the mediating effects of emotional/behavioral problems and academic competence between parental abuse/neglect and a child's school adjustment by investigating 2070 student surveys from the Korean Child Youth Panel Study (KCYPS). A path analysis yielded the following key findings. Firstly, childhood abuse and neglect showed a significant negative and direct effect on school adjustment. It is particularly important to note that the effect of neglect was bigger than that of abuse in this study. Secondly, emotional/behavioral problems were found to partially mediate between abuse/neglect and school adjustment. Thirdly, academic competence partially mediated the effect of neglect on school adjustment, while it did not mediate the effect of abuse on school adjustment. The indirect effect of parental neglect via emotional/behavioral problems and academic competence was stronger than that of parental abuse. The influence of parental abuse and neglect on children's school adjustments was discussed in terms of emotional/behavioral problems and academic competence considering unique Korean cultural context.

AB Objective: To achieve the grand challenge goal of unleashing the power of prevention, we must determine how and under what conditions an intervention leads to desired outcomes. These questions remain largely unknown partly due to analytical challenges involving testing mediation and moderation hypotheses with multiple dependent variables in nested data. This paper introduces multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) and demonstrates multilevel mediation and moderation analysis to understand the mechanisms by and contexts in which preventive interventions work. Method: Using illustrative research questions, we review the conceptual backgrounds of multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling and explain how MSEM combines these methods. We then analyze longitudinal data from a quasi-experimental study of a social and emotional learning program to examine how classroom teachers' baseline social-emotional competence (SEC) relates to students' year-end SEC, focusing on the mediation of instruction and the moderation of implementation leadership. Results: Teachers' SEC was directly related to students' year-end SEC (95% CI [.04, .95]) and indirectly related through the number of lessons delivered (95% CI [.01, .35]), controlling for students' baseline SEC and grade level. When teachers reported more implementation leadership at baseline, however, teachers' own SEC contributed less to the number of lessons they delivered (95% CI for interaction effect [-2.50, -.27]). MSEM techniques enabled examination of how teachers' SEC relates to their implementation behaviors and, in turn, to students' social and emotional development, and how these relationships are modified by implementation contexts. Conclusions: Identifying mechanisms and contexts in which students benefit from classroom-level interventions can help refine interventions and/or target implementation supports for taking preventive interventions to scale.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience difficulties related to emotional reactivity and regulation. The current study examines differences in the emotional reactivity and regulation of children with and without ADHD in the context of their real-life experiences of negative emotion using a novel ecologically valid methodology. Eighty-three 8-12-year-old children (46 ADHD, 38 non-ADHD) participated in the study. Children completed the negative emotion narrative recall task, a novel task whereby children provided a narrative recall of a real-life event where they experienced negative emotion. ANCOVA indicated children with ADHD recalled significantly more overall frustration and intense frustration than children without ADHD. Children with ADHD exhibiting more negative emotional reactivity while recalling negative emotions than children without ADHD. The current study suggests that children with ADHD are uniquely impacted by negative emotional experiences and represents an important step in understanding the emotional reactivity and regulation of children with ADHD.

TI Early Variations in White Matter Microstructure and Depression Outcome
   in Adolescents With Subthreshold Depression
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAIN; NETWORKS; DISORDER
AB Objective: White matter microstructure alterations have recently been associated with depressive episodes during adolescence, but it is unknown whether they predate depression. The authors investigated whether subthreshold depression in adolescence is associated with white matter microstructure variations and whether they relate to depression outcome.
   Method: Adolescents with subthreshold depression (N=96) and healthy control subjects (N=336) drawn from a community-based cohort were compared using diffusion tensor imaging and whole brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) at age 14 to assess white matter microstructure. They were followed up at age 16 to assess depression. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct white matter streamlines spreading from the regions identified in the TBSS analysis and along bundles implicated in emotion regulation, the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum. The authors searched for mediating effects of white matter microstructure on the relationship between baseline subthreshold depression and depression at follow-up, and then explored the specificity of the findings.
   Results: Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity were found in the anterior corpus callosum in the adolescents with subthreshold depression. Tractography analysis showed that they also had lower FA in the right cingulum streamlines, along with lower FA and higher mean diffusivity in tracts connecting the corpus callosum to the anterior cingulate cortex. The relation between subthreshold depression at baseline and depression at follow-up was mediated by FA values in the latter tracts, and lower FA values in those tracts distinctively predicted higher individual risk for depression.
   Conclusions: Early FA variations in tracts projecting from the corpus callosum to the anterior cingulate cortex may denote a higher risk of transition to depression in adolescents.

AB Objective. The main objective of the study was to examine the relationships between parental rejection, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and the emotional eating style of youngsters who finished an inpatient multidisciplinary weight loss treatment program and were back in their home environment.
   Method. Participants were 52 youngsters (age 11-17 years) with an average percent over ideal BMI of 186.11% (SD = 27.54) before treatment and 136.37% (SD = 19.65) at a mean follow-up of 4 months. Participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal and paternal rejection, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and emotional eating. Data were analysed using bootstrapping procedure.
   Results. Mediation analyses showed that maladaptive emotion regulation partially mediated the association between maternal rejection and the youngsters' emotional eating style. Paternal rejection was directly related to emotional eating.
   Conclusion. The results suggest that the family climate may have an impact on the eating style of the youngsters after weight loss treatment.

AB This study explores the levels and psychosocial consequences of social anxiety in adolescents to determine the predictive value of social anxiety in these effects. A total of 2.060 secondary school students (47.9% girls; mean age: 14.34) completed five scales to measure social anxiety, self-esteem, emotion regulation, and peer victimization (off and online). Three groups of youth with social anxiety along a continuum ranging from very low to higher degrees of the disorder were stablished. Differences were found among the groups regarding self-esteem, use of the cognitive reappraisal strategy, and peer and online victimization, with students suffering from higher levels of social anxiety showing the most negative effects. The predictive value of anxiety on these effects ranged from 9% to 33.5%. The results are discussed regarding the impact of social anxiety on well-being versus social discomfort and the need for interventions depending on the degree of this condition.

AB The present investigation examined the underlying role of anxiety sensitivity and its facets in the association between emotion dysregulation and three of the most prevalent and debilitating symptom classes among trauma-exposed psychiatric inpatient youth: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression symptoms. Participants (N= 50; 52.0% female; M-age =15.1 years, SD = .51, range 12-17 years) completed an assessment battery that included measures of emotion dysregulation anxiety sensitivity, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Consistent with hypotheses, the global construct of anxiety sensitivity, as well as its mental incapacitation concerns and disease concerns facets, explained, in part, associations between emotion dysregulation and the three symptom classes. The study results provide novel and clinically meaningful findings regarding the potential mechanistic role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation of emotion dysregulation to PTSD and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. As such, findings underscore the potential value of targeting anxiety sensitivity in general, and mental incapacitation and disease concerns specifically, as a means of reducing risk for internalizing psychopathology among trauma-exposed inpatient youth.

AB The main goal of the current study is to verify the relationships between emotion dysregulation, mentalization, and romantic attachment in late adolescent girls (N=120). Adolescence is a very dynamic and sensitive period, in which many changes occur in attachment and emotion regulation. The role of the primary attachment figures is gradually taken over by peers, and the beginnings of the development of romantic attachment are seen. In summary, this study was able to determine that the level of dysregulation of emotions in girls during late adolescence can be partially explained by mentalization and levels of anxiety (though not of avoidance) regarding a romantic partner, though attachment anxiety is more important for explaining emotion dysregulation than the level of mentalization. Only two aspects of emotion dysregulation show relationships with mentalization: nonacceptance of emotional responses and lack of emotional clarity. Adolescence is considered to be a critical period for interventions to protect against the onset of psychopathology. Confirmation of these relationships appears to be important for the design of therapeutic interventions. Our findings may suggest that attachment patterns, mentalization and emotion dysregulation may be good targets for therapeutic intervention in adolescence.

AB A great deal of research has focused on acculturation and enculturation, which represent the processes of adapting to a new culture. Despite this growing literature, results have produced inconsistent findings that may be attributable to differences in terms of the instruments used to assess acculturation and enculturation. Utilizing a 3-year longitudinal data set (with 1-year lags between assessments), the present study explored the psychometric properties of the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire-Short Version (BIQ-S) and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II (ARSMA-II) and examined the overlap between changes in these measures as they relate to internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. The present sample consisted of 216 immigrant Latino youth (43% boys; mean age 13.6 years at baseline; SD = 1.44 years, range 10 to 17). Exploratory structural equation modeling identified factor structures for the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II that diverged from their hypothesized structure. Growth curve models also indicate divergence between the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II in terms of change in acculturation and enculturation processes. Finally, the present findings emphasized that measures of acculturation and enculturation are not equivalent in terms of their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Using multilevel models, we examined mother-, father-, and child-reported (N = 1,336 families) externalizing behavior problem trajectories from age 7 to 14 in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States). The intercept and slope of children's externalizing behavior trajectories varied both across individuals within culture and across cultures, and the variance was larger at the individual level than at the culture level. Mothers' and children's endorsement of aggression as well as mothers' authoritarian attitudes predicted higher age 8 intercepts of child externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, prediction from individual-level endorsement of aggression and authoritarian attitudes to more child externalizing behaviors was augmented by prediction from cultural-level endorsement of aggression and authoritarian attitudes, respectively. Cultures in which father-reported endorsement of aggression was higher and both mother- and father-reported authoritarian attitudes were higher also reported more child externalizing behavior problems at age 8. Among fathers, greater attributions regarding uncontrollable success in caregiving situations were associated with steeper declines in externalizing over time. Understanding cultural-level as well as individual-level correlates of children's externalizing behavior offers potential insights into prevention and intervention efforts that can be more effectively targeted at individual children and parents as well as targeted at changing cultural norms that increase the risk of children's and adolescents' externalizing behavior.

AB Much like other parts of Asia, late adolescence in India is a particularly stressful time with academic pressures of a highly competitive examination system that determines future occupational success. The present study examined interrelations among reports of parenting, adolescents' regulation of academics-related emotions, school engagement, adolescent socio-emotional functioning and state-exam performance. Four hundred and fifty 10th and 12th graders from suburban high schools in India participated, along with their mothers. At the beginning of the school year, mothers completed measures of parenting, and adolescents completed measures of emotion regulation, school engagement and behaviour problems. At the end of the school year, grades from state exams were obtained from the schools. A multiple mediator model was tested using structural equation modelling. Authoritarian parenting was positively related to adolescent behaviour problems, but not adolescent state-exam performance. Maternal non-supportive responses to adolescent negative emotion were indirectly positively related to adolescent behaviour problems through adolescent emotion dysregulation. Adolescent school engagement mediated the positive relation between maternal supportive responses to adolescent negative emotion and adolescent state-exam performance. These findings underscore the relevance of adolescent emotions for their academic functioning, with implications for the development of interventions for those who struggle during these highly stressful years.

ID ADOLESCENCE; PERSPECTIVE
AB Empathy and prosocial behaviour are crucial factors for children's positive social adjustment. Contemporary models of empathy highlight the capacity to regulate vicariously experienced emotions as a precursor to empathy-related responses (e.g., prosocial behaviour). The goal of this study was to examine the role of emotion regulation (ER) in situational empathy-related responding and prosocial behaviour. A sample of 157 children (76 boys and 81 girls; M-age = 9.94years) participated in a two-tiered interview procedure that utilised vignettes to assess empathy and prosocial behaviour. Between both phases of the interview, a negative affect was induced to investigate the influence of ER on the change between the two phases. Results from a latent change model showed that ER strategies positively predicted change scores, that is, children with higher abilities to regulate emotions showed a higher increase in empathy and prosocial behaviour. Implications for the promotion of social-emotional learning in school are discussed.

AB Background: The family is the most important institution in identifying the personal coping strategies and emotion regulation skills of the individual.
   Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of emotion regulation and mindfulness modulators in the relationship of parenting stress and parenting styles with coping strategies.
   Methods: The sample was composed of 400 adolescents in 2016 who were selected from different districts of Tehran by multistage cluster sampling. They completed the adolescent coping scale, the Baumrind parenting style questionnaire, an emotion regulation checklist, and a mindfulness assessment tool for children and adolescents. Data were analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: The results showed that mindfulness and emotion regulation are modulators in the relationship between parenting stress and coping strategies (P < 0.0001) and parenting styles and coping strategies (P < 0.0001). There were improper parenting stress and parenting styles but if adolescents developed emotion regulation and mindfulness skills, they would reduce the undesirable effects of bad parenting.
   Conclusions: Emotion regulation and mindfulness skills along with coping strategies in adolescents can modulate the relationship between parenting stress and parenting style.

AB Background and Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is defined as emotion dysregulation. Since such dysregulation is also present during remission, it may be a risk factor for the development of further affective episodes. Therefore, the current study aimed at examining the impact of group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT), in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), on the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of patients with BD.
   Patients and Methods: The current single - blind, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was performed from 2015 TO 2017 at the Psychiatric Clinic of Razi Hospital affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. A total of 70 adolescents with early - onset BD were selected by the convenience sampling method based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders - fourth edition - text revision (DSM-IV-TR) and allocated into receive either12 sessions of GCBT (N=35) or TAU (N = 35). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were evaluated by cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (CERQ) at baseline, after the intervention, and at 3 - month follow - up. Efforts were made to follow up all randomized participants even if they withdrew from the assigned treatment prior to completion of GCBT sessions.
   Results: Compliance with treatment was moderate and the mean number of GCBT sessions that the participants attended was 6.97 (2.81). The 2 groups had significant differences in terms of post - test scores for other - blame (P = 0.001), rumination (P = 0.049), positive refocus (P = 0.008), positive reappraisal (P = 0.005), and putting into perspective (P = 0.001). In the 3-month follow-up, the 2 groups were significantly different only in other - blame (P = 0.001), positive reappraisal (P = 0.001), and putting into perspective subscales (P = 0.001). Therefore, the effects of the intervention were not effectively sustained after 3 months and there was room for improvement in terms of both outcome and compliance.
   Conclusions: The GCBT is more effective when the participants are involved in the studyand get instructions on emotion regulation. However, since the effects of the intervention were not sustained for most of the subscales after 3 months, booster sessions might improve and prolong the impact of psychotherapies.

AB IMPORTANCE Bipolar disorder (BD) is difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies can identify objective markers of BD risk.
   OBJECTIVE To identify neuroimaging measures in emotion processing and regulation neural circuitries and their associations with symptoms specific to youth at risk for BD.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional (August 1, 2011, to July 31, 2017) and longitudinal (February 1, 2013, to November 30, 2017) neuroimaging study performed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center compared a sample of 31 offspring of parents with BD (OBP) with 28 offspring of comparison parents with non-BD psychopathologies (OCP) and 21 offspring of healthy parents (OHP); OBP, OCR and OHP were recruited from the Bipolar Offspring Study and the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms Study.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Group differences in activity and functional connectivity during emotional face processing and n-back task performance in amygdala, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC), caudal anterior cingulate cortices (cACC), and rostra! anterior cingulate cortices (rACC) neuroimaging measures showing between-group differences and symptom severity (anxiety, affective lability, depression, mania). We hypothesized that elevated amygdala activity and/or lower PFC activity and abnormal amygdala to PFC functional connectivity would distinguish OBP from OCP and OHP, and magnitudes of these abnormalities would positively correlate with elevated symptom severity. We explored associations between changes in neuroimaging and symptom measures over follow-up (mean [SD]. 2.9 [1.4] years) in a subset of participants (n = 30).
   RESULTS Eighty participants were included (mean [SD] age, 14.2 (2.1) years; 35 female). Twelve neuroimaging measures explained 51% of the variance in the results of neuroimaging measures overall. Of the 12, 9 showed significant main associations of the group; however, after post hoc analyses and Bonferroni corrections, only 7 showed statistically significant associations between groups (corrected P < .05 for all). Of the 7, 2 showed significant relationships with symptoms. Offspring of parents with BD had greater right rACC activity when regulating attention to happy faces vs OCP (mean [SD] difference, 0.744 [0.249]; 95% CI, 0.134-1.354; P = .01), which positively correlated with affective lability severity (p = 0.304; uncorrected P = .006). Offspring of parents with BD had greater amygdala to left cACC functional connectivity when regulating attention to fearful faces vs OCP (mean [SD] difference, 0.493 [0169]; 95% CI, 0.079-0.908; P = .01). Increases in this measure positively correlated with increases in affective lability over follow-up (r = 0.541; P = .003).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Greater anterior cingulate cortex activity and functional connectivity during emotion regulation tasks may be specific markers of BD risk. These findings highlight potential neural targets to aid earlier identification of and guide new treatment developments for BD.

AB Evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for children and young people's well-being is growing, particularly within educational settings. To date, very few studies have explored how children experience and apply mindfulness. This qualitative study investigated how children who received long-term mindfulness training applied mindfulness to their everyday lives. Year 6 Children (average age 11) were interviewed in three focus groups with their peers, in a semi-structured format, and the data was analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. The findings indicated that the children described mindfulness as assisting with their emotion regulation. Four themes were identified: (1) processes of emotion regulation (2) dysregulation prompt to apply mindfulness (3) challenges and strategies and (4) the conditions that support or hinder mindfulness use. These findings are discussed in the context of theories and evidence on emotion regulation, attachment, and mechanisms of mindfulness. Implications of these findings for future research of meditation-based approaches in schools, for example, self-compassion and kindness practices, are considered.

AB The current study aimed to investigate the intergenerational transmission of parenting and internalizing problems in children. Serial mediation models were used to assess parental psychological control and child emotion regulation as mediators in linking grandparents' parenting (care or overprotection) and children's internalizing problems. The sample consisted of 150 Chinese children (M-age = 8.54, SD = 1.67) and their parents. The parents reported the grandparents' parenting and children's internalizing problems, and the children reported on their emotion regulation. Both the children's ratings and behavioral observations were used to assess the parents' psychological control. The results showed that grandmothers' parenting was significantly associated with children's internalizing problems, and this relationship was mediated by perceived (but not observed) parental psychological control and children's emotion regulation. These results highlighted the differential role of children's perceptions of parental control and the observed parental psychological control on internalizing symptoms in children.

AB Background
   Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a broad term describing the full spectrum of disorders in any of the stages of bladder function-storage or voiding LUTD is a clinical condition associated with emotional and behavioral disorders in children. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association of emotional andbehavioral symptoms and their impact on the quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents with LUTD.
   Methods
   Eighty-eight patients and their parents enrolled in an interdisciplinary program for children and adolescents with LUTD were included in the analysis. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to estimate the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems through the assessment of 14 items. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (versions for parents and children) was applied in the versions for parents and children to evaluate the QoL. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-PedsQL, version 4.0-was applied separately for parents and patients. The association of clinical variables and aspects related to QoL of patients were evaluated through non-parametric correlations (Spearman) and multiple linear regression analysis.
   Results
   According to CBCL's clinical scores, 56% of the patients showed total behavioral problems, 55% internalizing, and 38% externalizing. When comparing the conditions of LUTD and the CBCL scores, patients with voiding postponement had the lowest rates of total problems (P=0.036). Children and adolescents with LUTD who also had enuresis showed a higher frequency of externalizing problems (P=0.001), especially aggressive behavior (P=0.013). Scores of patients with LUTD were significantly lower in all domains of QoL than normative data. Presence of behavioral problems was associated with worse QoL in all evaluated aspects. The total QoL was most influenced by the CBCL school competence scale according to the regression model analysis.
   Conclusions
   The study findings suggest the relevance of evaluation of behavioral and social repercussions of LUTD to improve the multidisciplinary approach for this condition in pediatric population.

AB Despite evidence that ADHD is associated with disruptions in emotion regulation, few studies have examined the biological correlates of emotion dysregulation among children with this disorder. Prior work has pointed to roles of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, as indexed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP), respectively. Work in typically developing populations suggests that parenting behavior and parental emotion expression may shape the development of these systems. To date, a single study has examined the independent and interactive roles of autonomic nervous system functioning and parent emotion expression in youth with ADHD. This study seeks to extend that work. 86 children (42 with ADHD), aged 8-12years, and a parent completed a parent-child interaction task, while electrocardiography and impedance cardiography data were recorded to derive RSA and PEP. Parent and child emotion word use (positive and negative valence) were coded from recordings of the task. Parents of youth with ADHD used fewer positive emotion words throughout the task. Additionally, throughout the task, children with ADHD engaged in excessive RSA withdrawal from baseline. Further, the association between RSA reactivity and ADHD diagnosis was moderated by parent positive emotion word use. Specifically, those with RSA augmentation and parents displaying high positive affect across the task conditions were least likely to have an ADHD diagnosis. If replicated and extended, these results support the use of interventions specifically designed to increase parental modeling of positive emotions, while simultaneously focusing on building emotion regulation skills in youth with ADHD.

AB There are few studies of the child psychodynamic psychotherapy process. This study investigates the psychotherapy process within regulation-focused psychotherapy for children (RFP-C; Hoffman, Rice, & Prout, 2016). RFP-C is a manualized, psychodynamic treatment for children with disruptive behaviors. Three expert clinicians used the Child Psychotherapy Q-Set to develop an RFP-C prototype, which can be used in future studies to measure adherence in actual RFP-C sessions. As expected, the RFP-C prototype was associated with established prototypes of child psychodynamic psychotherapy and child-centered play therapy. There was no relationship between RFP-C and the cognitive behavior therapy process prototype. Reflective functioning was also associated with the RFP-C prototype, providing additional evidence for mentalization as a common factor in child psychotherapy. Implications for clinical practice and future research use are discussed.

AB We proposed that having mutually hostile interactions with others is a strong environmental stress factor that, together with diverse psychosocial problems, characterizes adolescents who self-harm. Using cluster analysis, this study examined the naturally occurring patterns of hostility conditions and psychosocial difficulties in a normative sample of 2,029 adolescents (50% boys; M-age = 13.89). Results showed that self-harming behavior was significantly higher among the subgroup of adolescents with mutually hostile interactions who exhibited both internalizing and externalizing problems than among adolescents with other interpersonal-psychosocial configurations. Also, this subgroup of adolescents reported high impulsivity, anger dysregulation, and low self-esteem. These findings support recent research that indicates that adolescents who self-harm also tend to expose others to hostility and display externalizing symptoms.

AB Loneliness has been linked to many physical and mental health problems, especially during adolescence. From evolutionary, social needs, and cognitive approaches, this study examined whether emotional repair, relatedness need, and peer-rated indicators of relations behave in predicting loneliness, considering all approaches together. The sample consisted of 373 adolescents measured longitudinally at three time points. Results of a cross-lagged panel design found that, considering all the influences together, relatedness need showed the highest strength to predict loneliness. Furthermore, adolescents who were accepted by their peers and whose relatedness need was satisfied activated emotional regulation which additionally produced a decrease in prospective feelings of loneliness. In addition, loneliness has been shown to be a consequence of these variables.

AB This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 24 primary research studies on the Second Step social emotional learning program. Program content knowledge, outcomes related to pro-sociality, and outcomes related to antisociality are examined as outcome categories in randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and, separately, single-group repeated measures design studies. Students participating in Second Step demonstrated increased knowledge of program content and increased prosocial outcomes. Participation in the program was not associated with significant changes in antisocial outcomes. Evidence suggests the possibility of publication bias in studies reporting knowledge outcomes but no evidence of publication bias in studies reporting prosocial and antisocial outcomes. This study complements broader meta analyses on SEL programs and aims to inform local decision making by providing an estimate of the overall effects of the Second Step program on a variety of student outcomes.

AB Introduction: Peer relationships play a vital role in adolescents' lives and are considered to be especially critical for youth who experience elevated depressive symptoms. Unfortunately, depressed youth tend to have difficulties with existing friendships (e.g., fewer and lower quality friendships), which may exacerbate their symptoms. Little is known, however, about how depressed youth approach the initial stages of friendship formation, which may have implications for the types of social support they can access. Method: Using a conversation task designed to build intimacy, older adolescents (N = 228, M age = 19.54 years) with and without elevated depressive symptoms interacted with a previously unknown, same-gender partner. Results: Results suggested that adolescents with elevated symptoms experienced interactions differently (e.g., speculated more about their conversation partner and thought their partner was speculating more about them, experienced more negative affect) than nondepressed peers. The depression status of the potential friend also mattered, as participants paired with partners of similar emotional adjustment status wanted to talk more and felt closer to one another than did mismatched partners. Discussion: Findings underscore that depressive symptoms impact even the earliest stages of friendship formation. From the perspective of interpersonal theories of depression, implications for bolstering depressed adolescents' relationships are discussed.

AB Religiosity and spirituality are influential experiences that buffer adverse effects of stressors. Spirituality typically declines during adolescence, although not universally. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis, we examined changes in spiritual connectedness among 188 early (52% female; M age=10.77, SD=0.65 years) and 167 middle (56% female; M age=13.68, SD=0.82 years) predominantly African American adolescents participating in a 4-year longitudinal study. Three distinct profiles of spiritual connectedness emerged: low and steady, moderate with declines over the study period, and high and steady. Profile distributions varied across developmental level: there were more early adolescents in the high and steady profile and more middle adolescents in the decliner profile. Youth in the high and steady profile evidenced more goal-directedness and life satisfaction and more effective emotion management and coping strategies than youth in other profiles. Contributions to the positive development literature are discussed.

AB Purpose Findings from cross-sectional research indicate that the relationship between sleep quality and physical activity is mixed. For research that does indicate a significant association, the interpretation of the finding most often is that physical activity leads to better sleep, or less frequently, that better sleep leads to more involvement in physical activity (see sleep deprivation studies). Cross-sectional studies, however, are not able to assess the direction of these effects, and experimental studies have tested only one direction of the effects. Longitudinal studies, with their focus on temporal order, are needed to specifically examine the link between sleep and physical activity as well as the direction of effects. The current study had three goals: to examine 1) the longitudinal relationship between sleep and physical activity, 2) the direction of effects, and 3) whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between sleep and physical activity.
   Methods Participants included a sample of 827 (M-age at baseline = 19.04 yr, SD = 0.92 yr, 73.88% female) students at a university in Southwestern Ontario, who took part in a larger longitudinal survey that started in their first year of university. Participants were surveyed annually for 3 yr (2011, 2012, 2013; retention, 83.9%). Measures assessed sleep quality, physical activity, emotion regulation, and involvement in sports clubs.
   Results A cross-lagged autoregressive path analysis revealed that sleep quality indirectly predicted increased high-, moderate-, and low-intensity physical activity over time through its positive effect on emotion regulation. Moderate levels of physical activity indirectly predicted sleep quality over time through emotion regulation.
   Conclusions Overall, there appears to be support for a bidirectional relationship between sleep and physical activity over time (at least for moderate physical activity) but only indirectly through emotion regulation.

AB Mindfulness-based education (Mind-Edu) is increasingly being recognized as an effective educational approach to promote children's social and emotional competence. Although it has been implemented in several schools in Thailand for many years, studies examining its impact on the developing brain have been scarce. We hypothesized that the Mind-Edu might have some effects on resting state brain activities in school-aged students; therefore, we investigated long-term effects of Mind-Edu on the EEG power spectrum and compared with the control. Participants are 53 typically developing children (27 girls) studying in the 6th grade, mean aged 11.7years, SD=0.4. They were divided into the Mind-Edu group (N=22) and the control group (N=31). These two groups are different in school curriculums. One school uses the Mind-Edu curriculum for all levels of education, and another one uses the country's core curriculum. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded; eye-closed EEG segment was used for quantitative analysis and compared between groups. The results revealed that there was no significant difference between groups on the mean value of absolute beta, alpha, and delta powers over all electrode sites. However, the Mind-Edu group had a significant lower absolute theta power over the posterior brain regions and a significant smaller theta/beta ratio over the Cz electrode as compared to the control. Our results suggested that implementation of the Mind-Edu into the regular elementary school curriculum would be of benefit for enhancing maturation in brain areas involved with cognitive control and self-regulation, which might provide support for a smooth transition into the adolescence.

AB The aim of this study was twofold: to identify different emotional intelligence (EI) profiles and to verify possible statistically significant differences in school refusal factors that result in a demotivation to attend school. Participants were 2362 Chilean adolescents aged from 13 to 17 (M= 15.25; SD= 1.33), who completed the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) and the School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised (SRAS-R). Cluster analysis identified four EI profiles: high scores in repair and low in attention, high scores in attention and low in clarity and repair, low EI and high EI. Students with high scores in attention and low in repair scored higher in the first three factors of the SRAS-R, whereas in the fourth factor of the SRAS-R, students with high EI had significantly higher scores. Emotional regulation seems to be one of the determinant factors to prevent the appearance of school refusal. Based on these findings, we recommend that EI training be a part of future programs to overcome school attendance demotivation issues.

AB There is accumulating evidence that both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol play an important role in regulating physical maturation and brain development. High DHEA levels tend to be associated with neuroprotective and indirect anabolic effects, while high cortisol levels tend to be associated with catabolic and neurotoxic properties. Previous literature has linked the ratio between DHEA and cortisol levels (DC ratio) to disorders of attention, emotional regulation and conduct, but little is known as to the relationship between this ratio and brain development. Due to the extensive links between the amygdala and the cortex as well as the known amygdalar involvement in emotional regulation, we examined associations between DC ratio, structural covariance of the amygdala with whole-brain cortical thickness, and validated report-based measures of attention, working memory, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children and adolescents 6-22 years of age. We found that DC ratio predicted covariance between amygdalar volume and the medial anterior cingulate cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. DC ratio had a significant indirect effect on working memory through its impact on prefrontal-amygdalar covariance, with higher DC ratios associated with a prefrontal-amygdalar covariance pattern predictive of higher scores on a measure of working memory. Taken together, these findings support the notion, as suggested by animal and in vitro studies, that there are opposing effects of DHEA and cortisol on brain development in humans, and that these effects may especially target prefrontal-amygdalar development and working memory, in a lateralized fashion.

AB The objective of the present study was to analyze the relationships between child-to-parent violence and parental socialization styles with the problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia and attitude towards institutional authority in adolescents. A sample of 2,399 adolescents (50.2% boys and 49.8% girls) enrolled in schools in Andalusia, aged between 12 and 18 years (M= 14.63, SD = 1.91) participated in the study. A MANOVA 4 x 2 x 2 was carried out. The results showed that high child-to-parent violence was related to high levels of problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and a more positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. It was also found that adolescents from families with an indulgent style showed the lowest scores in problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. Additionally, in situations of high child-to-parent violence, girls had higher scores in problematic use of social networking sites and alexithymia than boys. Finally, the results and their practical implications are discussed.

AB Depression has long been a clinical concern in youth with autism, yet systematic research examining its prevalence, presentation, and treatment has only begun to emerge more recently. Using the search terms autism, asd, or autistic and depression, depressive, dysthymia, or dysthymic, this systematic review identified 43 articles focused on symptoms of depression in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders published between 2012 and 2016. The results of the review indicate that depression is more common in youth with autism spectrum disorders than in typically developing youth and is associated with a multitude of other medical and psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, few intervention studies have been conducted despite evidence of need and preliminary efficacy for some psychosocial and pharmacological treatments.

AB Children in Sub-Saharan Africa are living under chronic adversity due to poverty, serious health issues, physical and sexual abuse, and armed conflicts. These highly stressful conditions have deleterious effects on their mental health and socio-emotional adjustment. Since many children lack adequate access to mental health care, culturally adapted school-based resiliency programs could provide a resource to scaffold their development and promote their mental health. This study evaluated the efficacy of a universal school-based intervention in enhancing the resiliency of Tanzanian primary school children and cultivating prosocial behaviors. A total of 183 students from grades 4 to 6 were randomly assigned to either the 16-session "ERSAE-Stress-Prosocial (ESPS)" structured intervention or to a Social Study curriculum (SS) active control group. The original ESPS program was adapted by Tanzanians mental health professionals who modified the program based on local idioms of distress and indigenous practices. Students' resilience was evaluated before, after and 8 months following the intervention by assessing social difficulties, hyperactivity, somatization, level of anxiety, prosocial behaviors and school functioning as well as academic achievements and disciplinary problems. There was significant improvement on all outcome measures for the ESPS group compared to the control group post-intervention and at the 8-month follow up. The ESPS intervention was equally effective on most measures for students experiencing different adversity levels. The results indicate that a culturally adapted universal school-based intervention can be effective in enhancing Tanzanian students' resiliency and promoting prosocial behaviors. Should these results be replicated and found enduring, the modified ESPS could be a valuable mental health-promoting intervention in other low-income countries.

AB Background: Chronic daily headache is a serious disease, causing significant problems such as disability. It is characterized by pain localized to the head (headache) and headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months (> 180 days per year). Programs for pain and health improvement in patients with painful diseases, such as headache, are not still fully developed. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a new psychotherapy, which appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic pain.
   Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of ACT in cognitive emotion regulation strategies, headache-related disability, and headache intensity in patients with chronic daily headaches.
   Methods: In the current study, a semi-experimental method was applied. The study was conducted at Shahid Beheshti Governmental hospital of Kashan, Iran in 2016. The sample consisted of 40 patients with chronic daily headache, who were selected via convenience sampling. The participants were randomly allocated into medical treatment as usual (MTAU) and ACT groups (20 samples per group) via block randomization. The ACT group received eight 90-minute weekly treatments, based on the ACT protocol. The cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (CERQ), diary of headache severity, and headache-related disability inventory(HDI) were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and three-month follow-up in both groups.
   Results: In the current study, no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of demographic variables (P > 0.05). In the ACT group, the mean (SD) scores of emotional and functional aspects of headache disability were 26.87 +/- 10.11 and 28.50 +/- 9.04, respectively before the intervention, which decreased to 17.75 +/- 8.32 and 18.12 +/- 9.42 after the intervention and 21.37 +/- 8.53 and 21.37 +/- 9.87 in the follow-up, respectively (P < 0.05). In addition, the mean (SD) score of nonadjustment cognitive emotion regulation strategies was 54.31 +/- 10.02 at pretreatment, which significantly reduced to 44.43 +/- 7.7 at posttreatment and 49.78 +/- 9.1 in the follow-up (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean (SD) score of adjustment cognitive emotion regulation strategies was 61.43 +/- 12.02 in the pretest, which significantly increased to 72.06 +/- 8.66 in the posttest and 69.62 +/- 11.84 in the follow-up (P < 0.05). The mean score of headache intensity decreased from 6.40 +/- 1.19 to 5.00 +/- 1.09, compared to the pretest (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the groups in the follow-up (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: The results of the present study suggested that ACT is an effective treatment for reducing nonadjustment cognitive emotion regulation strategies, headache-related disability, and headache intensity and improving adjustment emotion regulation strategies in patients with chronic daily headache.

AB The practice of mindfulness appears effective in promoting adaptive eating patterns in adolescents and adults. However, despite significant data suggesting that maladaptive eating patterns emerge at a very early age, there is a dearth of research examining the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in promoting healthy eating patterns with young children. Sixty-five children across four school research sites participated in the present experiment to examine whether mindfulness promotes eating enjoyment and diverse eating behaviors in preschool- and early elementary-aged children. Children, ages 3-10years old, were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness intervention condition or a 4-week exposure, control condition. Each week for 4days, children received one of four different foods (celery, cauliflower, kidney beans, or garbanzo beans). Children either received instructions to mindfully engage with the food or were given the food and allowed to eat without mindfulness prompts from the researchers. Following each eating exercise, children participants recorded the amount eaten and rated their enjoyment level. Across all sessions and both conditions, group leaders modeled eating behaviors for the children by eating all of the offered food. Results suggested that a brief mindfulness intervention promotes more overall food consumption of typically not preferred and unfamiliar foods (celery, cauliflower, and garbanzo beans) compared with an exposure, control condition. However, food enjoyment ratings did not significantly differ between the two conditions for any of the foods.

AB Psychological dysregulation is a complex and multidimensional construct encompassing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. Research on psychological dysregulation emphasizes its importance in relation to several psychological disorders. However, assessing psychological dysregulation is often problematic because many of the existing instruments address a specific dysregulation dimension at a time, predominantly emotional dysregulation. The Abbreviated Dysregulation Inventory (ADI) was developed to assess three dimensions of psychological dysregulation: emotional, cognitive and behavioral. This study's goal was to analyze the factor structure, internal consistency, and validity in relation to external variables of the Portuguese version of the ADI in a sample of 511 adolescents aged between 12 and 19 years old. The 3-factor solution was confirmed, and high internal consistency was found for the three subscales. Peculiar findings on the cognitive dysregulation subscale raised issues addressed in the discussion section. Results indicated that dysregulation associates positively with aggressive behavior and negatively with quality of life. Age and gender presented small influence on the cognitive and behavioral subscales scores, respectively. Findings suggested that ADI can be a valuable self-report measure to assess cognitive, behavioral or emotional dysregulation in youths, within research and psychological intervention settings.

AB The evaluation of mental health services is an important tool for understanding treatment efficacy, aswell as for engaging clients in their treatment. Because adolescents are often more reluctant consumers ofmental health services relative to adults, progress monitoring and evaluation may be particularly importantwith these clients. Standardized assessment tools are useful, but the use of open-ended questionsaddressing perceived change and progress made toward recovery is likely to yield important information ina developmentally appropriate way. This mixed-method exploratory study captured adolescents' (N=74)perceptions of their mental health status in their own words, as well as specific changes they have noted intheir mental health at six months following a brief psychiatric hospitalization. Adolescents' qualitativedescriptions of their mental health status were classified: improved, worse, mixed, and same. Theseoutcome classifications corresponded well with baseline and follow-up scores on several standardizedmeasures of mental health and wellbeing. In articulating their perceptions of change over time, participantsdiscussed symptoms, interpersonal relationships, coping, and future orientation. Our findings revealadolescents' perspectives on recovery and well-being, and suggest ways that treatment evaluation can beadapted to better meet the developmental needs of young people.

ID MATERNAL CRITICISM; EMOTION REGULATION; CHILDREN
AB Siblings' influence on youth aggressive behavior has been found in previous studies, but further research is needed in order to better understand both the shared relations between siblings' levels of proactive and reactive subtypes of aggression as well as the factors contributing to this relationship, such as parent behavior. The current study extended the literature by examining the influence of older siblings' proactive and reactive aggression on younger siblings and whether these associations were influenced by levels of observed parental criticism. Participants were 50 parent-child dyads. Children in each dyad (52% female; 76% Caucasian) were between the ages of 10 and 15 (M=11.52; SD=1.25). Parent-reported measures of their younger and older siblings' proactive and reactive aggression were collected. Next, parents and the younger child engaged in a conversation task which was coded for parental criticism using a modified version of the Family Interaction Task. Results demonstrated that older siblings' reactive aggression was positively associated with younger siblings' reactive aggression and that the strength of this influence depended on levels of parental criticism (=0.21; SE=0.10; p 0.00), such that stronger sibling influence was observed at greater levels of parental criticism. No influence of older siblings' levels of proactive aggression was evident. Findings suggest that the degree of parental criticism is particularly salient when examining the association between siblings' aggression.

AB Objectives Children's and adolescents' coping styles are associated with distress and adjustment. Despite the significance and implications of children's coping responses, no accepted standard exists to measure children's coping behavior. The purpose of the present study was standardization and study of the psychometric properties of Children's Coping Behavior Questionnaire (CCBQ) in Northern Iran (Guilan).
   Methods This was a correlation study and was implemented among 10- to 16-year-old students of Guilan. Among statistical population, 300 students (139 girls and 161 boys with an average age of 13.23) were selected using multistage sampling, and they responded to the items in CCBQ. To assess reliability and validity we used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and convergent validity. The reliability was assessed by using two methods; Cronbach's alpha and test-retest. The face validity and construct validity of the questionnaire were approved by a professors of psychology.
   Results Based on factor analysis using principal components and varimax rotation, final analyses revealed a 41-item coping measure with a 3-factor solution of "diversion", "ameliorative coping", and "destructive coping", which explained more than 60.9% of the total variance. Convergence validity of the questionnaire showed a satisfactory correlation in the total score of CCBQ. To determine concurrent validity with the CCBQ we used State-Trait Anxiety Children Inventory correlations that were satisfactory (P<0.05). Cronbach's alpha and test-retest for the total scale were between 0.74 and 0.91. The measurement showed strong reliability and good preliminary validity data.
   Conclusion Our results established that the Children's Coping Behavior Questionnaire is a reliable and valid method and is capable to be used in Iranian society to investigate emotional problems. Future studies need to be undertaken in a clinical population.

AB The links between low socioeconomic status and poor health are well established, yet despite adversity, some individuals with low socioeconomic status appear to avoid these negative consequences through adaptive coping. Previous research found a set of strategies, called shift-and-persist (shifting the self to stressors while persisting by finding meaning), to be particularly adaptive for individuals with low socioeconomic status, who typically face more uncontrollable stressors. This study tested (a) whether perceived social status, similar to objective socioeconomic status, would moderate the link between shift-and-persist and health, and (b) whether a specific uncontrollable stressor, unfair treatment, would similarly moderate the health correlates of shift-and-persist. A sample of 308 youth (Mean(age) = 13.0, range 8-17), physician diagnosed with asthma, completed measures of shift-and-persist, unfair treatment, asthma control, and quality of life in the lab, and 2 weeks of daily diaries about their asthma symptoms. Parents reported on perceived family social status. Results indicated that shift-and-persist was associated with better asthma profiles, only among youth from families with lower (vs. higher) parent-reported perceived social status. Shift-and-persist was also associated with better asthma profiles, only among youth who experienced more (vs. less) unfair treatment. These findings suggest that the adaptive values of coping strategies for youth with asthma depend on the family's perceived social status and on the stressor experienced.

AB PurposeBinge eating is predicted by emotion dysregulation and poor emotional awareness. Dysfunctional metacognition is also implied in several eating disorders, but research has not yet investigated the interactions among emotional and metacognitive processes involved in binge eating. The present study investigated the relation between metacognition and binge eating in a sample of adolescents, testing the interaction effect between the need to control thoughts and thelack of emotional awareness on binge eating.MethodsParticipants were 804 adolescents (age range 15-20; 49.7% female), who completed self-report instruments assessing binge eating, emotion regulation, and metacognition.ResultsBinge eating was predicted by gender, BMI, emotion dysregulation, lack of emotional awareness, and dysfunctional metacognition dimensions (cognitive confidence and need to control thoughts). An important moderating effect was found, whereby the relationship between binge eating and lack of emotional awareness was only significant for individuals with a high need to control thoughts.ConclusionsResults described emotional and metacognitive functioning in binge eating adolescents, suggesting that the need to control thoughts is a risk factor, whereas good metacognitive competencies are protective from binge eating, even in presence of poor emotional awareness.Level of evidenceLevel V, cross-sectional descriptive study.

AB Societal change in western societies may impact emotional and behavioural problems of adolescents. Firm epidemiological evidence of changes in emotional and behavioural problems during the last decade is lacking. Insight into secular changes in emotional and behavioural problems among adolescents from various sociodemographic groups is crucial for adequate and targeted policy making. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine 10-year time trends in emotional and behavioural problems among adolescents, and potential differences in time trends between sociodemographic groups. Analyses were based on annually repeated cross-sectional data including 56,159 multi-ethnic students (13-14years old) in the second year of various levels of secondary education in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, using the internationally validated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In general, emotional and behavioural problems increased over a 10-year time period (i.e., relative increase of total difficulties by 19%). This increase was mainly due to an increase in hyperactivity/inattention problems, while peer-relationship problems decreased. Time trends differed somewhat by sex: total difficulties and emotional problems increased in girls but remained fairly stable in boys. In Amsterdam, emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents seemingly increased over time, especially hyperactivity/inattention problems. Further research is needed to clarify the underlying causes. We cannot totally exclude potential confounders underlying our findings. Our findings can inform policies to target health programs at sociodemographic groups at increased risk.

AB Despite prior extensive investigations of the interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, few studies have simultaneously considered activation and structural connectivity in this circuit, particularly as it pertains to adolescent socioemotional development.
   The current multi-modal study delineated the correspondence between uncinate fasciculus (UF) connectivity and amygdala habituation in a large adolescent sample that was drawn from a population-based sample. We then examined the influence of demographic variables (age, gender, and pubertal status) on the relation between UF connectivity and amygdala habituation. 106 participants (15-17 years) completed DTI and an fMRI emotional face processing task. Left UF fractional anisotropy was associated with left amygdala habituation to fearful faces, suggesting that increased structural connectivity of the UF may facilitate amygdala regulation. Pubertal status moderated this structure-function relation, such that the association was stronger in those who were less mature. Therefore, UF connectivity may be particularly important for emotion regulation during early puberty. This study is the first to link structural and functional limbic circuitry in a large adolescent sample with substantial representation of ethnic minority participants, providing a more comprehensive understanding of socioemotional development in an understudied population.

AB Background: Anxiety can be a significant difficulty for people with autism, and rates increase during childhood and early adolescence. Nevertheless, little is known about the subjective experience of anxiety in this population. This study aimed to explore this phenomenon using a method conducive to gaining richer insight into participants' lived experiences.
   Method: This study used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the lived experience of anxiety, in 14 male adolescents (aged 13-18 years) with autism.
   Results: Participants described anxiety which in some ways resembled typically developing adolescent concerns, such as a desire to belong and feel connected to others, and stress linked to academic pressure. However, they also described how their anxiety could be further compounded by qualities that are characteristic of autism, such as difficulty knowing what others felt and how to comfort them, difficulty regulating emotions and the challenge of sensory sensitivities. Some managed their anxiety in ways that might differ from the typically developing population, for example through use of fantasy and role-play. Participants also outlined details about the format and nature of support that they found most helpful.
   Conclusions: Themes highlight participants' sensitivity and vulnerability in their unique struggle during this time of adolescence, as well as their resilience and resourcefulness in navigating this. A compassionate response is required from health and education professionals, which considers these young people's human need to feel socially connected, which is sensitive to the way that support is provided, and perhaps makes greater use of creative means of intervention (such as involving fantasy and role-play).

AB This study investigated the links between parental worry, parental over-control and adolescent social anxiety in parent-adolescent dyads. Using a longitudinal sample of adolescents (M-age=14.28) and their parents (224 mother-daughter, 234 mother-son, 51 father-daughter, and 47 father-son dyads), comparisons were conducted using cross-lagged path models across two time points. We used adolescent reports of social anxiety and feelings of being overly controlled by parents, and mother and father self-reports of worries. Our results show that boys' social anxiety predicted higher perceived parental overcontrol, whereas girls' social anxiety predicted higher paternal worry over time. In addition, girls' reports of feeling overly controlled by parents predicted higher maternal worry but lower paternal worry over time. For boys, feeling overly controlled predicted less social anxiety instead. The study illustrates how mothers and fathers might differ in their behaviors and concerns regarding their children's social anxiety and feelings of overcontrol.

AB Living with congenital heart disease (CHD) presents survivors with numerous stressors, which may contribute to emotional problems. This study examined (a) whether coping with CHD-related stress predicts symptoms of depression and anxiety, and (b) whether associations between coping and emotional distress are moderated by involuntary stress reactivity. Adolescents and young adults diagnosed with CHD (M-age=26.4) were recruited from pediatric and adult outpatient cardiology clinics. Participants (N=168) completed online self-report measures. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that secondary control coping (e.g., cognitive restructuring, positive thinking) predicted lower depression and anxiety. Primary control coping (e.g., problem-solving) and stress reactivity (e.g., rumination, emotional numbing) interacted to predict depression and anxiety: the higher individuals were in involuntary stress reactivity, the stronger was the association between primary control coping and lower depression and anxiety. These results can inform clinical efforts to prevent or reduce emotional distress among CHD survivors.

AB Background: Some meta-analyses have demonstrated the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and different health indicators. With the increase of suicide cases in the world, more andmore professionals have been interested in the link between both variables.
   Aim: To study all the available evidence on the association between EI and suicidal behavior.
   Method: We systematically reviewed all available literature (in English or Spanish) on the relationship between both variables through the main databases.
   Results: Twenty-five articles were included. EI and suicidal behavior correlated inversely in almost all the articles that the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), The Emotional Intelligence Test (EIT), The Spanish Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS/SSEIT), Barchard's Emotional Intelligence Scale, were used, that is, the higher suicidal behavior level the lower the EI score. The same results were found in two out of four investigations that used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) between clarity (emotional understanding) and emotional repair (emotional regulation) and suicidal behavior. Two out of three studies that used theMayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) found that only the Strategic component of EI (emotional understanding and regulation) was a protective factor.
   Conclusions: The results appear to indicate that a high level of EI plays an important role in protecting against suicidal behavior, and should thus be integrated into suicide prevention programs.

AB Coexistence in schools inevitably carries a higher risk of conflicts among peers. This fact can be detrimental to the well-being and academic achievement of the students. In many developed countries, about 90% of the pupils in compulsory secondary education report witnessing assaults among peers. In this regard, recognizing, controlling and managing emotions is key to ensure a healthy and effective interaction with others. Negative emotions, such as anger, can trigger conflicts or even episodes of violence if not regulated properly. Interactive tools, such as specialized software's, have shown high rates of efficacy for the training of different kinds of competences like the regulation of emotions. The aim of the present work is to describe the Happy Emotional Education Program and its effects over a sample of secondary school students. This software focuses in the training of emotional competences of the students with the objective of solving conflicts in a more assertive way. The design employed in the present work was a quasiexperimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. Results show that Happy Emotional Education Program contributes to the management of emotions and the absence of negative affect or anxiety in a significant way. Additionally, the constant use of this interactive tool enhances motivation and the learning process of students. Results also indicate the importance of assessing the effects of the program in the long term. This would enable researchers to further assess the effects of the program over those emotional competences that are more resistant to change given its stable nature.

AB Current neurocircuitry models of PTSD do not account for developmental effects, despite that early life assaultive violence is a potent risk factor for PTSD. Here, we preliminarily evaluated developmental stage as a moderator of the effect of early life assaultive violence on resting-state connectivity amongst regions associated with emotion generation and regulation using fMRI. Participants were adult women (n = 25) and adolescent girls (n = 36) who had or had not experienced early life assaultive violence. We found significant interactions between developmental stage and trauma exposure on resting-state functional connectivity (FC). Left amygdala connectivity with the left ventral anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) was reduced among trauma-exposed compared to control adolescents, but increased among trauma-exposed compared to control adults. A corresponding pattern of results was identified for FC between rostral anterior cingulate gyrus seed region and a similar right ventral anterior superior frontal gyrus cluster. Increased FC in both regions for assaulted adult women scaled positively with self-reported emotion regulation difficulties. Our results should be viewed tentatively due to sample limitations, but provide impetus to examine whether neurocircuitry models of PTSD may be strengthened by accounting for developmental stage.

AB In adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), effective treatment has been associated with increases in both heart rate variability (HRV) and cortical thickness. However, the impact of treatment on these indices has not yet been examined in adolescents. Cortical thickness and HRV were measured in twelve adolescents with MDD before and after 8 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We examined treatment-related changes in depression symptoms, HRV, heart rate (HR), and cortical thickness, and analyzed correlations among these change indices. At follow-up, patients showed significantly decreased depression severity, increased HRV and increased thickness of the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Clinical improvement was associated with increased HRV and decreased HR. Increased HRV was associated with increased cortical thickness of left lateral OFC and superior frontal cortex. Due to the small sample size, results represent preliminary findings that need replication. Further, in the absence of a placebo arm, we cannot confirm that the observed effects are due solely to medication. These preliminary findings suggest that SSRI treatment in adolescents impacts both cortical thickness and autonomic functioning. Confirmation of these findings would support OFC thickness and HRV as neurobiological mediators of treatment outcome.

AB BackgroundTo investigate the outcome of an integrated individual and family therapy (Intensive Contextual Treatment: ICT) in terms of reducing suffering and increasing functional adjustment among self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents with high symptom loads and their families.MethodsForty-nine self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents, M-age=14.6, of predominantly Swedish origin and female gender (85.7%) participated with their parents. The study had a within group design with repeated measures at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six- and twelve-months follow-ups. Self-reports were used for the main outcomes; self-harm rates, suicide attempts, parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care, internalized and externalized symptoms, perceived stress, emotion regulation, school hours and adjustment. Secondary outcomes were levels of reported expressed emotions within family dyads, as well as parental anxiety, depression and stress.ResultsFrom pre- to post-assessment, the adolescents reported significant reductions of self-harm (p=.001, d=0.54) and suicide attempts (p<.0001, d=1.38). Parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care were reduced, as well as parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, school attendance and adjustment were improved, and the adolescents reported experiencing less criticism while parents reported less emotional over-involvement. The results were maintained at follow-ups.ConclusionsThe adolescents and the parents reported improvements for the main outcomes. This treatment appears promising in keeping the families in treatment and out of hospital, suggesting that an integrative approach may be beneficial and feasible for this group.Trial registrationThis study has been approved 19/12 2011, by the regional review board in Stockholm (Dnr 2011/1593-31/5).

AB Cognitive regulation of emotion develops from childhood into adulthood. This occurs in parallel with maturation of prefrontal cortical (PFC) regulation over the amygdala. The cellular substrates for this regulation may include PFC activation of inhibitory GABAergic elements in the amygdala. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PFC regulation over basolateral amygdala area (BLA) in vivo is immature in adolescence, and if this is due to immaturity of GABAergic elements or PFC excitatory inputs. Using in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings from anesthetized male rats we found that in vivo summation of PFC inputs to the BLA was less regulated by GABAergic inhibition in adolescents (postnatal day 39) than adults (postnatal day 72-75). In addition, stimulation of either prelimbic or infralimbic PFC evokes weaker inhibition over basal (BA) and lateral (LAT) nuclei of the BLA in adolescents. This was dictated by both weak recruitment of inhibition in LAT and weak excitatory effects of PFC in BA. The current results may contribute to differences in adolescent cognitive regulation of emotion. These findings identify specific elements that undergo adolescent maturation and may therefore be sensitive to environmental disruptions that increase risk for psychiatric disorders.

AB Purpose: The present study investigated the associations between the aspects of sleep problems and mental health in Norwegian young adolescents. Materials and methods: Adolescents (12-13 years) were recruited from the primary schools in Telemark County, Norway. Sleep related problems were assessed by asking parents three questions related to their childrens' sleep quality, sleep sufficiency, and daytime sleepiness. Parents reported data on mental health by the extended version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and information on the child's physical activity, screen time, eating pattern, gender, and background variables. Height and weight were objectively measured. Complete data were obtained for 690 adolescents. Results: Multiple logistic regressions were used. Bivariate analyses indicated important associations between the sleep aspects and mental health. When adjusting the sleep variables for each other, lifestyle factors and background variables, sleep quality problems were associated with any psychiatric problem (ORadj: 4.0, CI: 2.0-8.2), emotional problems (ORadj: 15.1, CI: 3.4-66.8), and hyperactivity-inattention problems (ORadj: 5.1, CI: 2.2-12.1). Daytime sleepiness problems were associated with any psychiatric problem (ORadj: 2.3, CI: 1.2-4.4), and hyperactivity-inattention problems (ORadj: 2.5, CI: 1.1-5.5). Bivariate associations between problems with sufficient sleep and mental health problems lost the significance when adjusted for other sleep variables. Conclusions: The results indicate that different aspects of sleep problems may be important underlying factors for mental health problems in adolescents, independently of lifestyle factors, BMI-category, gender, and background variables. This highlights the importance of examining specific sleep problems when investigating associations between sleep and mental health.

AB Behavioral systems and emotional regulation are key components of adolescents' emotional development. However, little is known about their role in addiction potential. This research was conducted to evaluate the role of behavioral inhibition systems (BIS), behavioral activation systems (BAS) and difficulty with emotional regulation (DER) in adolescents' addiction potential. The present work is applied correlative research. The 1,900 participants included male adolescents from high schools in the north, south, east, and west of Tehran were the society of this research. The sample was randomly selected by using Morgan's table for as many as 320 students. The entry criteria were gender, age, grade of education, and non-drug abuse. The research measures were behavioral activation and inhibition systems scales, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, as well as the Addiction Prone Personality scale. The results showed the correlations among BIS, BAS, and DER were positively significant (p < .05). The correlation between BIS and addiction potential was significantly negative (p < .05). Finally, BAS, BIS, and DER, respectively, predicted 57%, 20%, and 22% of the addiction potential?s variance. According to the findings, BAS is the best predictor of the addiction potential. It seems that reward responding and seeking pleasure, which were behavioral activation systems subscales, and DER most contributed to predicting addiction potential.

AB Bidirectional relations are likely to exist between adolescents' friendship involvement and their emotional competencies. Therefore, longitudinal selection and socialization effects were probed in a sample of N = 299 German adolescents in a 30-month study that started in grade 7 (152 boys, M-age = 12.6 years). Cross-lagged panel modeling of the three waves of measurement indicated a pattern of initial selection effects followed by socialization effects, which are best described as spiral effects. Adolescents who were more willing to self-disclose emotions at T1 had more reciprocal friends at T2, which in turn contributed to an increase in their emotional self-disclosure at T3, even after controlling for previous friendship involvement, previous emotional self-disclosure, peer acceptance, gender, and classroom membership. Adolescents with less adaptive coping with sadness and tendencies towards social isolation at T1 were likely to have fewer friends at T2, which in turn intensified these reclusive tendencies at T3. Upward and downward spiral effects are discussed.

AB Objectives: Irritability is among the most bothersome emotional symptoms in children. It often leads to mental health services referral, significant impairment, and distress to their families. Although there is increasing scientific evidence supporting the existence of extreme irritability in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, few studies have investigated the measurement of irritability in children. This pilot study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-irritability subscale. In addition, we investigated adaptive difficulties among children with irritability. Methods: A total of 97 children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age (M=10.20, SD=2.70) were recruited from the psychiatric outpatient department of a university hospital in Taipei. The participants completed the Chinese version of the ARI self-report form and the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents (SAICA). Their parents completed the ARI parent report form, the Chinese version of the ABC-irritability subscale, and the Child Behavior Checklist. Diagnostic interviews were administered based on diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 to confirm the participants' psychiatric diagnoses. Results: The Chinese ABC-irritability subscale and the parent and self-report scales of the Chinese ARI showed good test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity. Scores from the ABC-irritability subscale and two forms of the ARI were all significantly correlated with aggressive behaviors, anxious/depressed symptoms, and social problems. In addition, irritability among children was significantly associated with maladjustment in school, with peer problems, and with problems at home. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that irritability may be associated with impaired social adaptive functioning among children and adolescents. The Chinese version of the ARI and the ABC-irritability subscale are useful for measuring irritability in both clinical and research settings in the Chinese population.

AB The current study contributes to previous work on measuring the social phenotype in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by validating a multidimensional test of social competence developed for use with individuals with and without ASD. The "Multidimensional Social Competence Scale" (MSCS) was previously validated as a parent-rating scale with youth 11-18 years with ASD without intellectual disability and typically developing adolescents of comparable age. The current study presents a validation of a self-report version of the MSCS in a non-clinical young adult population (N= 1178, males = 360, females= 817, age range =17-25 years). The MSCS consists of seven domains that represent social competence: social motivation, social inferencing, demonstrating empathic concern, social knowledge, verbal conversation skills, nonverbal sending skills, and emotion regulation. These domains are theorized to be indicative of the higher-order construct of social competence. A second higher-order theorization of the MSCS structure posits that 3 of these factors are indicative of social responsiveness, and the remaining 4 factors are indicative of social understanding and emotion regulation. Our findings indicated support for each of the theorized multidimensional factor structures. Reliability, optimal scoring, convergent and discriminant validity of the measure, as well as implications for future research are discussed.

AB INTRODUCTION. Parental exercise itself constitutes a very demanding challenge - however, when pregnancy occurs in adolescence, often unplanned, it converges tasks of different stages of development, irreversibly modifying an identity, roles and functions, not only of the young woman, but also of her family.
   OBJECTIVES. Applying the Dynamic Model of Family Assessment and Intervention (MDAIF), by Figueiredo (2012), and assessing the impact of nursing care in the promotion of skills for a transition to the parental role's exercise in the teenager and her family.
   METHODS. Qualitative study, conducted based on MDAIF, as a theoretical and operational reference, in clinical and community context in Primary Health Care, based on the process of family intervention who experienced an adolescent pregnancy. Seven nursing consultations to family were carried out, as a unit, from April to May 2016.
   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Extended family, with several subsystems and strict limits. Middle-class family. Although unplanned, and the antagonistic relationship with her parents, the instrumental and emotional support provided by them became critical in adapting to motherhood and the newborn's development.
   CONCLUSIONS. With MDAIF's use, nurses have developed their skills for a personalized approach to the family, centered on the adaptation and holistic transition to the parental process. It also made it possible to respond to the identified family needs, not only through the restructuring of a parental and personal identity, based on values, personal and professional goals and priorities (the teenager pursued her academic training), but also promoting a family environment based on trust and harmony.

AB This study examines the meaning of personal rituals for the adolescent identity development and emotion regulation. Both are ritual functions and can be characterized as adolescent developmental tasks. However, there is no consistent pattern in previous research to explain the processes for how identity is formed and emotions are regulated during the performance of personal rituals. Therefore, a questionnaire study among 410 (182 male) adolescents (age: M = 15.06, SD =.61) was carried out. The questionnaire used the Berzonsky Identity Style Inventory and various measures to assess different experiences during the ritual (i.e. mood, emotion regulation, reality-transforming experiences). After separating spiritual from non-spiritual rituals, the results showed that spiritual rituals were used as a means for emotion regulation. Furthermore, self-reflection was closely related to the information-oriented identity style. The findings are discussed against the background of the impact of spiritual practices for emotional and identity development in adolescence.

AB Research on cyberbullying has boomed in the past two decades. Findings from studies among adolescents suggest that they can be classified into distinct groups based on their cyberbullying experience, and that cyberbullying seems to be related to poor emotion regulation. So far, only a few studies have examined cyberbullying among adult workers and it is unclear whether cyberbullying develops similarly in that population. Therefore, in this study cyberbullying victimization was assessed in adolescents and adult workers simultaneously to address three aims: (1) to explore which groups can be distinguished based on their cyberbullying experience; (2) to analyze the associations of group membership with the way people regulate their emotions; and (3) to examine whether the results are comparable in adolescents and adults. Latent class analysis was used to analyze data from 1,426 employees and 1,715 adolescents in the first year of secondary education (12-13 years old). In each population, three profiles differing in their patterns of cybervictimization were identified: no cybervictimization (80%), work-related cybervictimization (18%), and pervasive cybervictimization (3%) for adults, and no cybervictimization (68%), similar-to-offline cybervictimization (27%), and pervasive cybervictimization (4%) for adolescents. Furthermore, these profiles differed in their use of emotion regulation strategies, with pervasive cyber-victims suppressing their emotions significantly more than other groups. Future research is needed to clarify the role of emotion regulation in cyberbullying as an antecedent or consequence of victimization.

AB There is a growing literature focusing on the emerging idea that behavioral flexibility, rather than particular emotion regulation strategies per se, provides greater promise in predicting and influencing anxiety-related psychopathology. Yet this line of research and theoretical analysis appear to be plagued by its own challenges. For example, middle-level constructs, such as behavioral flexibility, are difficult to define, difficult to measure, and difficult to interpret in relation to clinical interventions. A key point that some researchers have made is that previous studies examining flexible use of emotion regulation strategies (or, more broadly, coping) have failed due to a lack of focus on context. That is, examining strategies in isolation of the context in which they are used provides limited information on the suitability, rigid adherence, or effectiveness of a given strategy in that situation. Several of these researchers have proposed the development of new models to define and measure various types of behavioral flexibility. We would like to suggest that an explanation of the phenomenon already exists and that we can go back to our behavioral roots to understand this phenomenon rather than focusing on defining and capturing a new process. Indeed, thorough contextual behavioral analyses already yield a useful account of what has been observed. We will articulate a model explaining behavioral flexibility using a functional, contextual framework, with anxiety-related disorders as an example.

AB Callear, Harvey, and Bimler (2016, International Journal of Behavioral Development, 41, 456) organized children's emotion regulation behaviours into a coherent structure. However, further investigation is needed to identify core patterns of these emotion regulation behaviours. To identify clusters and prototypal constellations of emotion regulation behaviours, the 85 behavioural items comprising the Children's Emotion Regulation Inventory (ChERI) were ranked by 151 parents in order of applicability, using an ordinal sorting procedure (Method of Successive Sorts). Responses were aggregated in empirical scales, for classification of the cases using hierarchical and k-means clustering. The scales were based on nine key 'hotspots' of children's emotion regulation behaviours, interpreted as Outward Engagement, Inward or Somatic Focus, Disengagement, Disruptive, Impulsive/Labile, Social Connectedness/Compliance, Generating Closeness/Intimacy, Establishing Order and Generating Disorder. Five summary styles of children's emotion regulation emerged and are characterized on those scales. These hotspots and styles provide guidance to clinicians, parents, teachers, and other invested adults to assess and support children's emotional development.

AB By using a person-centered approach (i.e., latent profile analysis), this study examined possible groupings of adolescents as reflected by their parent and peer attachment scores in a sample of 941 adolescents in mainland China. The results showed that four groups with distinct parent and peer attachment profiles were identified, with different combinations of secure and insecure parent and peer attachments. The groups of adolescents as defined by these profiles were compared on positive psychological traits (resiliency, hope, and optimism), life satisfaction, psychological distress, and gender ratios. The findings showed that the adolescents with different profiles of parent and peer attachments significantly differed on positive psychological traits, life satisfaction, psychological distress, and gender ratios. The findings suggest that parent and peer attachments do not always go together, and adolescents may have different combinations of parent and peer attachments. These results should be taken into consideration in future studies concerning the impact of attachment on adolescents.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between cognitive coping strategies and the experience of autonomy, competence, relatedness and quality of life in homeless young adults. The sample consisted of 251 young adults (age 18 to 25) who had just entered a Dutch shelter facility. In addition, moderating effects of cognitive coping in the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes were examined. The analyses were conducted by means of linear regression. Our results indicated that adaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to the constructs of self-determination. Both adaptive and maladaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to quality of life. Positive reappraisal and positive refocusing moderated the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes. The implications of interventions will be discussed.

AB Negative urgency predicts both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Although it is hypothesized that urgency is characterized by reflexive responses to negative emotion that focus on immediate relief from distress, little research has addressed this hypothesis. Using data from four independent samples of adolescents and college students (n = 1,268), we estimated the association between trait negative urgency and emotion regulation strategies that reflect either reflexive responses or disengagement. We verified these effects in two ecological momentary assessment samples (EMA; n = 198). In retrospective data, negative urgency was correlated with using more disengagement or reflexive emotion regulation strategies relative to engagement strategies, r = .39, .38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.30, 0.49], [0.18, 0.57]. This finding replicated in EMA data, r = .24, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.38]. Emotion regulation may be a key mechanism of the effects of urgency on psychopathology. Interventions targeting emotion regulation among those high on urgency may be warranted.

AB For the first time, the present study investigates disorder-specific attachment characteristics and childhood trauma in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa (n = 30, girls/boys: 28/2, age: M = 14.84, SD = 1.20), a major depressive episode (n = 30, girls/boys: 27/3, age: M = 15.14, SD = 1.50), and controls (n = 60, girls/boys: 44/16, age: M = 16.10, SD = 1.20). We used the Structured Clinical Interview to diagnose Axis I disorders, the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System to classify attachment representations, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to assess child maltreatment. Our findings demonstrate an overrepresentation of the unresolved attachment status in the patient samples. A one-way analysis of variance succeeded by Bonferroni post hoc tests indicated that adolescents with anorexia nervosa show more isolation and dissolution of boundaries between life and death when confronted with situations of solitude. Although they report moderate to severe levels of traumatic childhood experiences, they tend to minimize those. Adolescents with a major depressive episode report higher levels of emotional abuse and neglect in their childhood, leaving them in a state of failed protection and danger during attachment distress. Integrating these attachment-related characteristics into specific psychotherapeutic interventions might be associated with a better outcome in that age group.

AB Background: Decreased amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neural functional connectivity (FC) positively predicts alcohol use among adolescents. Low amygdala-OFC FC is also associated with poor emotion regulation, a trait robustly linked to alcohol use. Thus, decreased amygdala-OFC connectivity may represent a risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) via impaired emotion regulation or reward processing. In this study, we examined amygdala-OFC FC among young adult binge drinkers at high risk for AUD. We also tested if amygdala-OFC FC mediates the relationship between externalizing personality traits and alcohol use.
   Methods: Healthy male and female (n = 39) binge drinkers completed a resting state fMRI scan and the Eysenck Impulsive Personality questionnaire. We utilized seed-based connectivity of the left and right amygdala to prefrontal regions as well as mediation analysis.
   Results: Individuals with higher weekly alcohol use displayed decreased right amygdala-OFC FC. Furthermore, high trait venturesomeness, but not impulsivness, was associated with decreased right amygdala-OFC FC. Finally, right amygdala-OFC FC mediated the relationship between trait venturesomeness and weekly drinking; individuals with high trait venturesomeness displayed decreased right amygdala-OFC FC, which in turn predicted greater weekly drinking.
   Conclusions: Our findings corroborate and extend the adolescent literature by showing that decreased amygdala-OFC FC is associated with higher alcohol consumption among adults at elevated risk for AUD. This study also demonstrates for the first time that this neural profile reflects a tendency to sensation seeking. In sum, our findings suggest that amygdala-OFC FC may be an objective neural target for alcohol use prevention and intervention.

TI Children with high potential and difficulties: Contributions of clinical

DE High intellectual potential; Scholastic problems; School failure;
   Anxiety disorders; Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
ID GIFTED-CHILDREN; ANXIETY; STUDENTS; INTELLIGENCE; SELF
AB We have been sensitized to children with high intellectual potential (HIP) having difficulties given the number of children consulting in our outpatient medico-psychological centres for scholastic problems (possibly leading to school failure), anxiety disorders or behavioral disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and in which a high intellectual potential was discovered during psychological assessments. It is the contrast, and more precisely the paradox, between the high intellectual potential of these children and their scholastic difficulties (including school failure), and the psychic suffering expressed by some of them, which led us to question, challenge and propose therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children. It is in this context that we created in December 2005 the CNAHP (National Center for Assistance to High Potential children and adolescents) which is a public centre integrated into the hospital-university department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rennes. It is noteworthy that not all children with HIP have difficulties, and children with school failure or behavioral problems are not always children with HIP. However, it is necessary not to minimize the problem raised by children with HIP with difficulties by ignoring its frequency or by considering that these children are "intelligent" enough to manage by themselves and do not need to be helped, whereas some of them can show school failure and even be de-scholarized. Indeed, based on the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) of an intellectual Quotient (IQ) above 130 (level corresponding to a statistical threshold), the frequency of children with HIP represents 2.3% of the population of schoolchildren aged 6 to 16. The frequency is therefore not so rare. However, it remains to be determined by French epidemiological studies what is the actual frequency of children with difficulties within a population of children with HIP. The analysis of the CNAHP research data from a clinical population (children with HIP consulting for difficulties) highlights that children with HIP can show major school problems (including school failure, defined here as having or foreseeing repetition of a grade), which corresponds to 7.5% of 611 children with HIP consulting at the CNAHP) and socioemotional problems (emotional regulation disorders) in relation to their high intellectual potential. In particular, anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders observed in this population (40.5%) and were significantly associated with high verbal potential. This significant association requires further studies to avoid establishing a simplistic unidirectional and reductive linear cause-effect relationships. Indeed, a high verbal potential can elicit and/or reinforce anxiety-producing representations, but anxiety disorders may also lead to a defensive over investment of verbal language. The results are discussed in this article and suggest that scholastic and/or psychological difficulties encountered by some children with HIP can be related to their high intellectual potential. It is necessary to develop therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children from a better understanding, based on research results, of their possible difficulties but also cognitive abilities.
   Even when children with HIP have scholastic and/or psychological difficulties, some of their cognitive skills can be preserved contrary to appearances, with for example, as seen in the CNAHP results, excellent attentional capacities shown by cognitive tests contrasting with behavioral attention deficit reported by parents. These skills are important to identify as they are resources which support the therapeutic and educational project. It is probably through an articulation among professionals from national education, health and research, in alliance with the family (parents, child, and siblings), that advances will be made. In the same way that professionals have been interested in children with intellectual disabilities, it is important to be concerned by children with HIP and difficulties located at the other end of the continuum. It is a question of ethics which concerns both caregivers and teachers. It is also a societal issue that concerns all of us given that the expression of high intellectual and creative potential in children may be essential to the societal development of innovative strategies and each nation's future. Finally, the discussion can be extended to all children, independent of their potential. What we learn from children with HIP and difficulties can be applied to each child: it is important at family, school and societal levels to facilitate the expression of the potential of children, to value their skills, and to help them to remove possible inhibitions of their potential based on individualized projects. The acceptance of singularity and differences in children can contribute to tolerance and the development of creativity, in the interest of the subject and of society. (C) 2018 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB Shared vulnerability in offspring of individuals with schizophrenia (SzO) and bipolar disorder (BpO) might manifest early during development through common temperament traits. Temperament dimensions in child and adolescent BpO (N = 80), SzO (N = 34) and the offspring of community controls (CcO) (N = 101) were assessed using the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. The association between temperament dimensions and lifetime psychopathology (including threshold and subthreshold DSM-IV-TR diagnoses) and current socio-academic adjustment was assessed using logistic regression. Fully adjusted models showed that both BpO and SzO scored significantly lower in the positive mood dimension and in the adaptability factor than CcO, with small-medium effect sizes (Cohen's d similar to 0.3-0.5). BpO also scored lower in the activity factor and the activity dimensions than CcO (Cohen's d similar to 0.3). Lower scores in the positive mood dimension were associated with increased risk of impaired adjustment both in BpO [OR 2.30, 95% CI (1.18-4.46)] and in SzO [OR 2.87, 95% CI (1.07-7.66)]. In BpO, lower scores in positive mood were also associated with increased likelihood of internalizing [OR 1.84, 95% CI (1.28-2.64)] and externalizing disorders [OR 1.48, 95% CI (1.01-2.18)]; in SzO, higher scores in activity and flexibility were associated with increased likelihood of internalizing [OR 2.31, 95% CI (1.22-4.38)] and externalizing disorders [OR 3.28, 95% CI (1.2-9)], respectively. Early difficulties in emotion regulation might represent a shared vulnerability phenotype in BpO and SzO. The identification of extreme temperament traits could help to characterize subgroups at greater risk of psychopathology and impaired adjustment, in which targeted interventions are warranted.

AB Background: Depressive symptoms are common in children with developmental language disorder (DLD). However, risk and protective factors contributing to these problems are currently underspecified.
   Aims: The current longitudinal study examined the role of emotion-regulation (ER) strategies in the severity of depressive symptoms in children with and without DLD, taking into account the severity of communication problems of children with DLD.
   Methods & Procedures: We followed clinically referred children with DLD (n = 114, 49% girls) and without DLD (n = 214, 58% girls) between the ages of 8 and 16 years across an 18-month period. Participants completed self-report questionnaires at three time points. Parents of children with DLD reported on their child's communication problems.
   Outcomes & Results: Multilevel analyses confirmed higher levels of depressive symptoms in youngsters with DLD compared with peers without DLD, with a decrease across time in the DLD group. In both groups, higher levels of approach and increasing avoidant strategies aimed at distraction or trivializing a problem explained lower depressive symptoms, whereas more worry and externalizing strategies contributed to more depressive symptoms. Within the DLD group, semantic language problems were associated with higher depressive symptoms. However, this relation was mediated by the tendency to worry or use externalizing strategies.
   Conclusions & Implications: Results suggest that interventions for children with DLD should focus on enhancing their adaptive ER strategies to help them cope with daily stressors just as in the general population.

AB Background: Mental health and substance use disorders are the leading causes of global disability in children and youth. Both tend to first onset or escalate in adolescence and young adulthood, calling for effective prevention during this time. The Climate Schools Combined (CSC) study was the first trial of a Web-based combined universal approach, delivered through school classes, to prevent both mental health and substance use problems in adolescence. There is also limited evidence for the cost-effectiveness of school-based prevention programs.
   Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the CSC follow-up study, which aims to determine the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the CSC prevention program for depression, anxiety, and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use) up to 7 years post intervention.
   Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial (the CSC study) was conducted with 6411 participants aged approximately 13.5 years at baseline from 2014 to 2016. Participating schools were randomized to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) control (health education as usual), (2) Climate Substance Use (universal substance use prevention), (3) Climate Mental Health (universal mental health prevention), or (4) CSC (universal substance use and mental health prevention). It was hypothesized that the CSC program would be more effective than conditions (1) to (3) in reducing alcohol and cannabis use (and related harms), anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as increasing knowledge related to alcohol, cannabis, anxiety, and depression. This long-term study will invite follow-up participants to complete 3 additional Web-based assessments at approximately 5, 6, and 7 years post baseline using multiple sources of locator information already provided to the research team. The primary outcomes include alcohol and cannabis use (and related harms) and mental health symptoms. An economic evaluation of the program will also be conducted using both data linkage as well as self-report resource use and quality of life measures. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, social networks, peer substance use, emotion regulation, and perfectionism. Analyses will be conducted using multilevel mixed-effects models within an intention-to-treat framework.
   Results: The CSC long-term follow-up study is funded from 2018 to 2022 by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1143555). The first follow-up wave commences in August 2018, and the results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2022.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to provide a long-term evaluation of combined universal substance use and mental health prevention up to 7 years post intervention. Evidence of sustained benefits into early adulthood would provide a scalable, easy-to-implement prevention strategy with the potential for widespread dissemination to reduce the considerable harms, burden of disease, injury, and social costs associated with youth substance use and mental disorders.

AB The lack of sensitive measures suitable for use across the range of functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a barrier to treatment development and monitoring. The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is a caregiver-report questionnaire designed to capture emotional distress and problems with emotion regulation in both minimally verbal and verbal individuals. The first two phases of the EDI's development are described, including: (1) utilizing methods from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) project to develop the item pool and response options; and (2) assessment of the EDI in psychiatric inpatients with ASD. The results suggest that the EDI captures a wide range of emotion dysregulation, is sensitive to change, and is not biased by verbal or intellectual ability.

AB Background: Mental health problems are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and difficulties with emotion regulation processes may underlie these issues. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10-session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods: Sixty-eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent-, child-, and clinician-reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10-week follow-up. Results: Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

AB Peer victimization is a highly stressful experience that impacts up to a third of all adolescents and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, including elevated anxiety, depression, drug use, and delinquency, as well as reduced self-esteem, school attendance, and academic achievement. Current prevention approaches (e.g., the Olweus program) have a mixed record in American schools. We propose a new approach to prevention that leverages theory and research surrounding the social aspects of bullying and victimization, particularly peer relations. Our approach attempts to (a) break down the process of homophily among bullies and (b) provide a mechanism by which socially isolated students can develop new friendships. Our approach asks teachers to increase opportunities for positive peer interaction through carefully structured, group-based learning activities in school (i.e., cooperative learning). We hypothesized that these positive peer interactions would result in reductions in bullying, victimization, perceived stress, and emotional problems, as well as increases in peer relatedness, among more marginalized students. Using a cluster randomized trial with 15 rural middle schools in the Pacific Northwest (N = 1,460 7th-grade students), we found that cooperative learning significantly reduced bullying, victimization, and perceived stress for marginalized students (i.e., moderated effects) and reduced emotional problems and enhanced relatedness for all students (i.e., main effects). Given that cooperative learning has already been shown to enhance student engagement and achievement in prior research, our results demonstrate that cooperative learning should be a permanent, sustainable component of teacher training and school culture.
   Educational Impact and Implications Statement
   Our findings indicate that cooperative learning can address many of the social problems in middle school that can give rise to bullying and victimization. Due to its established ability to enhance academic achievement, cooperative learning can be seen as a low-risk, high-reward approach to prevention that should enhance, rather than detract from, academic outcomes. Considering its straightforward implementation and flexibility, we hope that our results contribute to increased interest in cooperative learning as a means to support positive academic, social, and behavioral outcomes simultaneously.

AB Background
   This study explored the role of demographic, psychosocial, stress and life event-related risk factors for psychopathology and challenging behaviour in a clinical sample of adults with Down syndrome.
   MethodResultsA convenience sample of adults with Down syndrome seen through a specialised clinic was assessed through interviews and questionnaires specifically designed for use in people with intellectual disabilities.
   Recent negative life events and stressors were significantly correlated with mental and behavioural health, and significantly predicted irritability, lethargy and depressed mood. Social avoidance was predicted by stress related to anticipation and social-environmental stressors, and negatively predicted by verbal ability. Ritual-related stress predicted obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Participants who did not have a job or vocational placement were significantly more depressed than participants who did.
   ConclusionsAdults with Down syndrome should be provided increased supports for coping with negative life events and stressors. Interventions should also emphasise community engagement, such as employment, and access to psychosocial supports that teach coping and self-regulation skills when faced with stressors and negative life events.

AB Patterns of pubertal maturation have been linked to vulnerability for emotion dysregulation disorders in girls, as well as white matter (WM) development, suggestive of a potential mechanism between pubertal maturation and emotional health. Because pubertal processes begin at varying ages (i.e., status, timing) and proceed at varying rates (i.e., tempo), identifying individual differences in the pubertal course associated with subsequent WM microstructure development may reveal clues about neurobiological mechanisms of girls' emotional well-being. In a prospective cohort study of 107 girls, we examined associations between pubertal status at age 9, pubertal timing and tempo from ages 9-15, and WM microstructure at age 19. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that girls with more advanced pubertal status at age 9, specific to gonadal-related physical changes, had higher fractional anisotropy, and lower mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity in tracts relevant to cognitive control and emotion regulation (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and uncinate fasciculus). Additionally, girls with earlier pubertal timing showed lower MD in the left anterior cingulum bundle. Tempo was unrelated to WM measures. These findings implicate specific aspects of pubertal maturation in subsequent neural signatures, suggesting possible neuroendocrine mechanisms relevant to emotional development. Future work incorporating longitudinal neuroimaging in parallel with pubertal measures may contribute to the understanding of individual variation in pubertal course and WM development.

AB Obesity has become an increasingly widespread endemic with social implications;. however, the relationship between higher body mass index (BMI) and psychological functioning is still not fully understood. This study examined the differences in affect-related psychological variables among BMI classes. A total of 134 adults seeking treatment for obesity and 124 controls completed a set of questionnaires to assess: trait emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, anxiety, depression, binge eating behaviors and happiness. Correlations and multivariate analysis of variance were run per each study variable controlling for BMI class (normal weight, overweight, or obesity class I, II, III). Individuals with obesity class III were characterized by reduced trait emotional intelligence and happiness, and a higher tendency to use emotion suppression compared to normal weight individuals. All individuals with obesity also showed higher levels of depression and binge eating behaviors compared to both normal weight and overweight adults. Depression and emotion suppression were the most relevant discriminant factors across BMI classes, while trait emotional intelligence resulted as an important psychological factor clustering individual differences between obese and non-obese individuals. These results suggest that more attention to the affective domain of psychological functioning is needed for proper and comprehensive treatment of obesity.

AB Links between emotion dysregulation, suicide ideation, and suicidal versus non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are poorly understood within military samples. United States service members and beneficiaries (N = 186), psychiatrically hospitalized following a suicidal crisis, completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004), and reported lifetime suicide ideation, attempts, and NSSI. We expected that emotion dysregulation would positively associate with worst lifetime suicide ideation, multiple suicide attempt status, and lifetime NSSI. Suicide ideation severity and multiple suicide attempts did not associate with DERS components. Notably, difficulties with impulse control (feeling out of control while distressed) was positively associated with NSSI history. Theoretical models that clearly describe the role of emotion dysregulation in suicidal thoughts, its progression to suicidal actions, and NSSI are needed to advance clinical care for this highly vulnerable group. Longitudinal and micro-longitudinal study designs require further investigation.

AB Converging evidence suggests that psychosis emerges from the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Stressful life events (SLEs) play a prominent role in combination with coping strategies and with a dysfunctional hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). It has been proposed that the framework of schizotypy might help disentangle the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of psychosis. Similarly, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is considered as a genetic model of psychosis vulnerability. However, SLE and coping strategies remain largely unexplored in 22q11DS. Moreover, the HPAA has not been systematically investigated in this population. Here, we explored the correlation between SLE, emotional coping strategies, schizotypal personality traits, subthreshold psychotic symptoms in a sample of 43 healthy controls (HCs) compared with 59 individuals with 22q11DS. In the latter, we also explored the correlation with pituitary volume as estimated from structural magnetic resonance imaging. We found that SLE and negative coping strategies were correlated with schizotypal personality traits in both HCs and 22q11DS, and with psychotic symptoms in the 22q11DS group only, whereas reduced pituitary volume correlated with general psychopathology. Moreover, dysfunctional coping mediated the effect of SLE on schizotypal personality traits and psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS. Our findings recapitulate evidence in nonsyndromic patients and confirm the central role of stress and coping in the pathogenesis of psychosis. More broadly, they highlight the importance of environmental factors in the pathway to psychosis in 22q11DS, suggesting a strong rationale for the implementation of stress and particularly coping-oriented interventions in this population.

AB We examined how family functioning and emotion regulation strategies relate to both a history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and recovery from NSSI. Participants were 272 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 14.50 years, SD = 1.46 years), of whom 17.6% reported a history of NSSI. As expected, poor family functioning was associated with engagement in NSSI. Among the emotion regulation variables, higher use of self-blame and lower use of refocus on planning was associated with NSSI. Self-blame and refocus on planning also mediated the relationship between family functioning and NSSI. Similarly, better family functioning and adaptive emotion regulation were related to recovery, while maladaptive emotion regulation was negatively related to recovery. Adaptive emotion regulation moderated the relationship between family functioning and NSSI recovery. We discuss how family-based interventions combined with emotion regulation education may help deter NSSI engagement.

AB Background
   The relationship between generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and alexithymia has been poorly studied in adolescents. The present study examined the alexithymia levels in adolescents with GAD and their parents compared with healthy control participants (adolescents and their parents).
   MethodResultsThe sample included 300 participants: 50 adolescents with GAD and 50 healthy adolescents, 13-18 years of age, and their 200 parents (100 mothers and 100 fathers). The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children was performed to evaluate adolescents' mental health while the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale was performed to assess alexithymia levels in both adolescents and their parents.
   Adolescents with GAD showed a significantly higher rate of alexithymia when compared with control adolescents. The mothers of adolescents with GAD showed an alexithymia score higher than did the controls' mothers. The fathers of the two groups showed no differences of in their rate of alexithymia. Moreover, in the clinical sample, adolescent and maternal alexithymia scores were not correlated, while significant directed correlations were found between these adolescents and their own fathers.
   ConclusionsOur findings show an association between GAD and alexithymia in adolescents. A significant presence of alexithymic traits in the mothers of the patients with GAD was shown. An intergenerational transmission of alexithymia could be supposed but this cannot be a linear mechanism. The assessment of alexithymia in adolescents with psychological disorders, and in their parents, could be useful to plan a more targeted therapeutic approach.

AB Despite growing research on the impact of borderline personality pathology (BPP) on treatment outcomes for emotional disorders among adults, no studies have examined this question in adolescents. Moreover, no studies have examined mediators of the relation between BPP and changes in mood and anxiety symptoms during treatment. This study examined the impact of BPP on treatment outcomes in 141 adolescents in psychiatric residential treatment, as well as the mediating role of change in emotion regulation (ie, adaptive responses to emotions) in the relation between baseline BPP and improvements in psychiatric symptoms during treatment. Participants completed questionnaires assessing emotion regulation and depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at baseline and posttreatment. Although BPP was not directly associated with the magnitude of change in psychiatric symptoms from baseline to posttreatment, it was positively associated with greater improvement in emotion regulation during treatment. Furthermore, results revealed significant indirect effects of BPP on improvements in all psychiatric symptoms through improvement in emotion regulation.

AB To further understand the role of drinking to cope (DTC) motivation in the development of drinking-related problems during young adulthood, we tested whether the association between episode-specific levels of nighttime DTC motivation and next-day negative affect and self-control depletion symptoms (SCDS) changed from college years to postcollege years (5 years later). We also examined whether these changes were moderated by recent life stress, adult social role attainment and gender, and whether mean levels of these variables were associated with changes in drinking-related problems from college to postcollege years. Participants (N = 927; 54% women) completed a 30-day daily diary during college and again 5 years later in which they reported their previous night's drinking level and motivation and their current negative affect and SCDS. We assessed drinking-related problems at both waves and recent life stress and adult social roles at Wave 2. DTC motivation was positively associated with next-day levels of negative affect and SCDS. The effect of DTC motivation on anxiety and SCDS became stronger over time. The effect of DTC motivation on depressive affect and anger (a) decreased across time among individuals who attained more adult roles and (b) was weaker among individuals who reported lower levels of postcollege life stress. Mean levels of postcollege DTC motivation was indirectly related to changes in drinking-related problems from college to postcollege through mean levels of negative affect and SCDS. Our findings indicate that DTC might exert its unique long-term effects on alcohol use disorders through disruption of daily emotion-regulation processes.

AB Adolescence represents a developmental stage in which initiation of drug use typically occurs and is marked by dynamic neurobiological changes. These changes present a sensitive window during which perturbations to normative development lead to alterations in brain circuits critical for stress and emotional regulation as well as reward processing, potentially resulting in an increased susceptibility to psychopathologies. The occurrence of early life stress (ELS) is related to a greater risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUD) during adolescence. Studies using nonhuman primates (NHP) are ideally suited to examine how ELS may alter the development of neurobiological systems modulating the reinforcing effects of drugs, given their remarkable neurobiological, behavioral, and developmental homologies to humans. This review examines NHP models of ELS that have been used to characterize its effects on sensitivity to drug reinforcement, and proposes future directions using NHP models of ELS and drug abuse in an effort to develop more targeted intervention and prevention strategies for at risk clinical populations.

AB This study examined the efficacy of the Juvenile Justice Anger Management (JJAM) Treatment for Girls, an anger management and aggression reduction treatment designed to meet the unique needs of adolescent girls in residential juvenile justice facilities. This randomized controlled trial of JJAM compared changes in levels of anger and aggression among girls who participated in the JJAM treatment with those of girls who participated in treatment as usual (TAU) at the facilities. This study also investigated the theoretical model underlying the JJAM treatment, which proposed that reductions in hostile attribution biases, development of emotion regulation skills, and improvement in social problem solving would serve as mechanisms of action in JJAM. Participants were 70 female youth who ranged in age from 14 to 20 years (M = 17.45. SD = 1.24) and were placed at 1 of 3 participating juvenile justice facilities; 57 youth completed the study and were included in analyses. Results revealed greater reductions in anger, reactive physical aggression, and reactive relational aggression among girls in the JJAM treatment condition when compared to girls in the TAU control condition. The proposed theoretical model was partially supported via significant mediation findings; changes in hostile attribution bias were identified as a significant mechanism of action in the JJAM treatment. Results suggest that JJAM is a promising treatment to effectively reduce anger and reactive aggression among adolescent girls in juvenile justice placements.

AB Despite the acknowledged importance of friendships in emotional development during adolescence, little research has empirically examined emotion socialization processes within friendships. Co-rumination is one such process that may involve many emotion-related skills due to its negative emotional focus and links to emotional distress. The current study examines whether adolescent friends' emotional competencies (i.e., emotional awareness, emotion regulation) relate to co-rumination. Adolescents (N = 192; 53% girls; M-age = 12.67; 76% European American, 17.7% African American) participated with a reciprocated same-sex best friend. Adolescents reported on their own and their friends' emotional competencies and participated in observed video-taped problem discussion task that was coded for co-rumination. Results indicated that indices of poor emotional competence related to greater co-rumination for girls. For boys. stronger emotional competence related to greater co-rumination. There were more significant links to co-rumination from adolescents' perceptions of their friends' emotion regulation than self-reports of their own emotion regulation. Results are discussed with a focus on implications for emotion socialization within the best friend context during early adolescence.

AB Ethnoracially diverse families living in poverty are vulnerable to stress, discrimination, and adversities that can be 'toxic' to parenting and to a wide range of psychosocial and academic outcomes in youth. Thus, there is high need to identify malleable protective and promotive factors that may lead to improved developmental trajectories and outcomes for at-risk youth and families. In this study of 2,233 low-income families with ethnoracially diverse children (49.5% girls; 42.5% European Americans, 38.4% African Americans, and 19.1% U.S. Latino/as), we tested a model positing that child-rearing beliefs at 24 months and parenting practices at 36 months are precursors to the development of children's self-regulation at pre-kindergarten, with self-regulation as a mediating mechanism between parenting in toddlerhood and psychosocial and academic functioning at fifth grade. Results confirm that child-rearing beliefs are precursors to parenting practices, and both parenting practices and self-regulation are mediating mechanisms by which child-rearing beliefs are linked to youths' psychosocial and academic outcomes. The results have implications for early parent education and parenting interventions, including public health approaches that have the potential for positive impacts on vulnerable children, youth, and families.

AB Community violence exposure is a common stressor, known to compromise youth cognitive and emotional development. In a diverse, urban sample of 22 adolescents, participants reported on community violence exposure (witnessing a beating or illegal drug use, hearing gun shots, or other forms of community violence) in early adolescence (average age 12.99), and underwent a neuroimaging scan 3-5 years later (average age 16.92). Community violence exposure in early adolescence predicted smaller manually traced left and right hippocampal and amygdala volumes in a model controlling for age, gender, and concurrent community violence exposure, measured in late adolescence. Community violence continued to predict hippocampus (but not amygdala) volumes after we also controlled for family aggression exposure in early adolescence. Community violence exposure was also associated with stronger resting state connectivity between the right hippocampus (using the manually traced structure as a seed region) and bilateral frontotemporal regions including the superior temporal gyrus and insula. These resting state connectivity results held after controlling for concurrent community violence exposure, SES, and family aggression. Although this is the first study focusing on community violence in conjunction with brain structure and function, these results dovetail with other research linking childhood adversity with smaller subcortical volumes in adolescence and adulthood, and with altered frontolimbic resting state connectivity. Our findings suggest that even community-level exposure to neighborhood violence can have detectable neural correlates in adolescents.

AB Many children with autism spectrum disorder display challenging behaviors. These behaviors are not limited to those with cognitive and/or language impairments. The Collaborative and Proactive Solutions framework proposes that challenging behaviors result from an incompatibility between environmental demands and a child's "lagging skills." The primary Collaborative and Proactive Solutions lagging skills-executive function, emotion regulation, language, and social skills-are often areas of weakness for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether these lagging skills are associated with challenging behaviors in youth with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Parents of 182 youth with autism spectrum disorder (6-15 years) completed measures of their children's challenging behaviors, executive function, language, emotion regulation, and social skills. We tested whether the Collaborative and Proactive Solutions lagging skills predicted challenging behaviors using multiple linear regression. The Collaborative and Proactive Solutions lagging skills explained significant variance in participants' challenging behaviors. The Depression (emotion regulation), Inhibit (executive function), and Sameness (executive function) scales emerged as significant predictors. Impairments in emotion regulation and executive function may contribute substantially to aggressive and oppositional behaviors in school-age youth with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Treatment for challenging behaviors in this group may consider targeting the incompatibility between environmental demands and a child's lagging skills.

AB BackgroundMethodWhole school approaches to mental health are recommended where schools and community partners work together to support positive mental health for young people. Universal interventions which adopt this approach are limited however. This study evaluates the pilot implementation of DBT STEPS-A, a social-emotional learning programme for adolescents, in Ireland.
   Data were collected at the beginning and end of the academic year from students who participated in DBT STEPS-A and a control group. Amatched comparison was conducted where a subset of the data was analysed consisting of 72 adolescents aged 15-16years from two schools in the south of Ireland. Outcomes included emotion symptoms, dysfunctional coping and DBT skill use. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the treatment effect (intervention vs. control).
   ResultsConclusionsA statistically significant treatment effect was observed on two of four outcome measures (emotion symptom index: p=0.011; internalising problems: p=0.012). The effect sizes were large (Cohen's F squared=0.65 and 0.83 respectively).
   Significant reductions on measures which assess constructs including depression, anxiety and social stress were found for the intervention group. The results suggest that DBT STEPS-A may yield positive effects for adolescents who complete the intervention. Feedback from adolescents and teachers suggests that refinement of content, structure and implementation may make the programme more accessible to an adolescent population.

AB Given the association between child maltreatment and a host of negative behavioral consequences, there remains a need to continue to identify mechanisms underlying this association as a means of improving intervention efforts. The present study examined one potential mechanism, namely, disengagement coping. We asked 6- to 17-year-old maltreated (n = 249) and comparison (n = 133) youth questions about emotional experiences that induced sadness and anger, strategies they used to cope with those emotions, and behavioral functioning (i.e., behavioral problems and aggression). Maltreated adolescents reported higher levels of behavioral problems and aggression relative to comparison adolescents, and adolescents who disengaged from emotional situations reported more behavioral problems relative to those who did not disengage. Tests of mediation suggested that, for adolescent-age youth, part of the association between maltreatment status and behavioral problems was explained by disengagement. In children, maltreatment was not associated with disengagement or behavioral problems. Results have implications for understanding age-related differences in the emotional and behavioral consequences of maltreatment.

AB Research on individuals severely affected by autism, including those who are minimally verbal, have intellectual disability or challenging behaviors, has become less common. The Autism Inpatient Collection (AIC) was initiated so data on this group is available to the research community. Ten studies utilizing phenotypic data from the first 350 AIC participants are presented. Greater autism severity, sleep disturbance, and psychiatric disorders are risks for hospitalization; fluently verbal youth experience more depression and oppositional symptoms; lower adaptive/coping skills are associated with increased problem behaviors; lower IQ is a risk for SIB; post-traumatic and suicidal symptoms are common; and challenging behaviors improve with specialized inpatient treatment. A new measure of emotion regulation and prescribing practices are described and future research discussed.

AB Difficulties regulating emotion have been linked to comorbid psychopathology in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but little empirical work has examined predictors of dysregulation in this population. Forty-six families of children with ASD participated in a laboratory visit that included direct measurement of children's IQ, ASD symptoms, and psychophysiological reactivity. Child emotion regulation was observed during independent and co-regulatory tasks, and parental scaffolding was rated in the dyadic context. ASD symptom severity emerged as the strongest predictor of child emotion dysregulation across contexts. Child age and parental scaffolding also uniquely predicted child dysregulation in the dyadic task. Implications for conceptualizing intrinsic and extrinsic influences on emergent emotion regulation in children with ASD are discussed, as are applications to intervention.

AB This study investigated whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype moderated inhibitory control during an emotionally valenced task in a sample of internationally adopted adolescents (N = 109, ages 12-13 years) who spent their early years in institutional care. Participants were genotyped for the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene. Inhibitory control in different emotional contexts was assessed via a Go-NoGo task where letters appeared at the center of positive, negative, neutral, or scrambled images. Carriers of one or more methionine (Met) alleles demonstrated a significant association between poorer performance and increased adversity, indexed by age at adoption, while valine/valine (Val/Val) carriers did not. Thus, Val/Val genotype was associated with resilience to increased impulsivity with more prolonged deprivation. These results do not converge with research suggesting differential susceptibility effects for this polymorphism, but more closely reflect a diathesis-stress model for the impact of BDNF genotype on a behavioral measure of impulsivity during emotional distraction.

AB Young children are disproportionately exposed to maltreatment but are underrepresented in research on effective treatments. Universal Teacher-Child Interaction Training (TCIT-U), developed from Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, may be especially appropriate for maltreated children as they often experience caregiver disruptions which pose challenges to traditional parent-child treatment. Furthermore, research suggests that teachers can play an important role for children who lack positive caregiving experiences. The current study examined the effectiveness of TCIT-U versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) at a therapeutic preschool for youth exposed to maltreatment. Thirty-eight children (2-5 years old) and eight teachers from four classrooms participated in the study. Teacher behaviors were observed and coded at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Teachers reported on children's behavior and social-emotional skills at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. TCIT-U teachers demonstrated substantial increases in positive attending skills (PRIDE [Praise, Reflection, Imitation, Description, and Enjoyment] skills) and decreases in negative talk and questions during intervention phases, and these skills were maintained at follow-up. In addition, children in the TCIT-U classrooms demonstrated a significantly greater increase in overall social-emotional skills by post-treatment than children in the TAU classrooms, and effect sizes were moderate for all child outcomes. Findings provide preliminary support for TCIT-U's effectiveness in a therapeutic setting for children exposed to maltreatment.

AB Emotion lability and emotion regulation are critical processes that have been shown to have important contributions in the successful development of children. While these two emotion processes are intertwined, they have been distinctly associated with a diverse range of behavioural, academic, and social outcomes. Given the important implications of these emotional processes, it is essential to understand the factors that influence the development of emotion lability and emotion regulation. The present study aimed to contribute to the current research pertaining to parents' role in the emotional development of children through examination of maternal and paternal psychological functioning and emotion regulation as potential predictors of child emotion lability and emotion regulation. Participants included ninety-three preschool children and their parent(s). Parents completed self-report measures regarding their own emotion regulation and psychological functioning, as well as their child's emotion regulation and emotion lability. Correlational analyses revealed that although, in general, maternal and paternal emotion regulation and psychological functioning were not significantly associated with child emotion regulation, significant associations were evident in the relationship between numerous parent variables and children's emotion lability. Interestingly, both parent and child gender differences were evident in these relationships. Multiple regression analyses indicated that mothers' overall emotional well-being predicted children's emotion lability for both boys and girls, however, these same models were not significant for fathers' emotional well-being. The importance of emotion lability as it relates to fostering positive emotional development in early childhood is highlighted, and implications for future research on emotion regulation is discussed.

AB The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity has been demonstrated as one of the physiological mechanisms underlying the long-lasting effects of peer victimization on physical and mental health. However, the mechanisms linking peer victimization to dysregulations of HPA axis activity remain inadequately understood. The present study examined the potential mediating role of emotional regulation in the association between peer victimization and HPA axis activity in a large community-based sample of 645 children affected by parental HIV (M-age = 10.67 years, ranging from 8 to 15 years old). The three-level growth curve model revealed that higher peer victimization was associated with lower emotional regulation, which in turn was related to lower cortisol at awakening and more blunted diurnal slopes in girls, but not in boys. The findings highlight the protective effect of emotional regulation in relation to HPA axis activity in victimized children, particularly in girls.

AB ObjectiveTo examine adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as a prospective predictor of the day-to-day associations between worries and positive thinking among late adolescents.
   MethodCumulative ACEs were measured from parent and youth reports between the ages of 9.9 and 18.1. Late adolescents (N=103) reported daily worries and positive thoughts across ten days.
   ResultsAdverse childhood experiences predicted higher and more variable levels of day-to-day worry. Increases in positive thinking on one day predicted less next-day worry for adolescents with low, but not high, ACE scores.
   ConclusionsDaily worry during late adolescence may be an important consequence of earlier exposure to ACEs. Early interventions focused on worry reduction and improved emotion regulation might mitigate worry among high-ACE youth.

AB Background: Research exploring the nature of anxiety symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has thus far focused on children and adolescents, providing evidence for both typical and atypical anxiety symptom presentations associated with ASD. This study builds on previous research by focusing on young adults, and comparing anxiety presentation between individuals with ASD and non-ASD individuals with anxiety disorders. We anticipated that while the non-ASD group would report only typical anxiety symptoms, and the ASD group would report both typical and atypical presentations of anxiety symptoms.
   Method: Ten individuals with ASD and anxiety (M = 21.8 years, SD = 6,76), and 10 individuals with anxiety (M = 24.4 years, SD = 4.17) participated in focus groups. Participants responded to semi-structured interview questions specifically developed using the DSM-5 criteria for each of the anxiety disorders, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. These questions focused on carefully elucidating experiences of anxiety including DSM-5 anxiety symptomatology and ASD-specific anxiety symptomatology.
   Results: Thematic analysis revealed a theme structure for the ASD group composed of both DSM5-related (e.g., social anxiety themes) and ASD-specific anxiety presentations (i.e., related to core ASD symptomatology). In contrast, the non-ASD group described predominantly DSM-5-related anxiety symptomatology.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the predicted outcome that there are both ASD-specific anxiety and DSM-5-related anxiety symptomatology in young adults with ASD, compared with young adults with anxiety who show only DSM-5 symptomatology. Future research elucidating the relationship between ASD symptomatology and anxiety in ASD, utilising both quantitative and qualitative measures, is crucial to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the nuances of anxiety in ASD. Gaining this knowledge is a crucial step for the development of more accurate and appropriate assessment and treatment tools that can target their specific anxiety experiences.

AB Dysregulation of emotions is a risk for social anxiety symptoms, whereas dispositional mindfulness has been proposed as assisting with emotion regulation. The aim of the current study was to examine the unique associations of dysregulation and mindfulness with adolescents' social anxiety, while focusing on the conceptual overlap and the empirical connection between dysregulation and mindfulness. Participants were 336 Australian adolescents (53% girls; 12-15 years) who completed questionnaires. Dysregulation and mindfulness were moderately correlated. Factor analysis revealed two factors accounting for 59% of the variance. The first factor, active dysregulation, had high positive loadings for five dysregulation and high negative loadings for two mindfulness subscales. The second factor, passive regulation, had a high negative loading for one dysregulation and high positive loadings for three mindfulness subscales. Both active and passive composite scores had unique associations with heightened anxiety symptoms. Regression analyses of the original subscales indicated that the dysregulation subscale limited strategies, and the mindfulness subscales observing and describing were uniquely associated with anxiety; strategies and observing were associated with more symptoms, whereas describing was associated with fewer. Interventions that address dysregulation and low capacity for mindfulness may be beneficial for adolescents with heightened social anxiety symptoms.

AB Background: Most neuroimaging studies of adolescent depression employ tasks not designed to engage brain regions necessary for the cognitive control of emotion, which is central to many behavioral therapies for depression. Depressed adults demonstrate less effective activation of these regions and greater amygdala activation during cognitive reappraisal; we examined whether depressed adolescents show similar patterns of brain activation.
   Methods: We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during cognitive reappraisal in 41 adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 34 matched controls (ages 13-17). We examined group differences in (1) activations associated with reappraisal and reappraisal success (i.e., negative affect reduction during reappraisal) using whole brain and amygdala region-of-interest analyses, and (2) functional connectivity of regions from the group-by-reappraisal success interaction.
   Results: We found no significant group differences in whole brain or amygdala analyses during reappraisal. In the group-by-reappraisal success interaction, activations in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) were associated with reappraisal success in healthy controls but not depressed adolescents. Depressed adolescents demonstrated reduced connectivity between the left dmPFC and the anterior insula/inferior frontal gyri bilaterally (AI/IFG) and between left dlPFC and left AI/IFG.
   Limitations: Our results should be considered exploratory given our less conservative statistical threshold in the group-by-reappraisal interaction.
   Conclusions: We find preliminary evidence that depressed adolescents engage cognitive control regions less efficiently than healthy controls, suggesting delayed maturation of regulatory prefrontal cortex regions; more research is needed to determine whether cognitive therapies improve functioning of these regions in depressed youth.

AB BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying body dissatisfaction and emotional problems evoked by social comparisons in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are currently unclear. Here, we elucidate patterns of brain activation among recovered patients with AN (recAN) during body comparison and weight estimation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).MethodsWe used fMRI to examine 12 patients with recAN and 13 healthy controls while they performed body comparison and weight estimation tasks with images of underweight, healthy weight, and overweight female bodies. In the body comparison task, participants rated their anxiety levels while comparing their own body with the presented image. In the weight estimation task, participants estimated the weight of the body in the presented image. We used between-group region of interest (ROI) analyses of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal to analyze differences in brain activation patterns between the groups. In addition, to investigate activation outside predetermined ROIs, we performed an exploratory whole-brain analysis to identify group differences.ResultsWe found that, compared to healthy controls, patients with recAN exhibited significantly greater activation in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) when comparing their own bodies with images of underweight female bodies. In addition, we found that, compared with healthy controls, patients with recAN exhibited significantly smaller activation in the middle temporal gyrus corresponding to the extrastriate body area (EBA) when comparing their own bodies, irrespective of weight, during self-other comparisons of body shape.ConclusionsOur findings from a group of patients with recAN suggest that the pathology of AN may lie in an inability to regulate negative affect in response to body images via pgACC activation during body comparisons. The findings also suggest that altered body image processing in the brain persists even after recovery from AN.

AB Background: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. When untreated, PKU leads to a significant intellectual deficiency. Although early initiation of dietary therapy allows normal cognitive development, low adherence to treatment may result in neuropsychological deficits, including attention problems. This study was performed to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems in early-treated children and adolescents with PKU using the Child Behavior Checklist - CBCL/6-18 answered by parents.
   Material/Methods: The study included 36 PKU patients. The mean scores of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, syndrome scales, and DSM-IV-oriented scales of patients were compared with those of controls. An analysis to evaluate the importance of adherence to treatment and presence of intellectual disability was also performed.
   Results: There were no significant differences between patients and controls for almost all CBCL/6-18 scales, with the exception of the Attention Problem Scale - CBCL-APS. The mean (+/- SD) of the CBCL-APS scores of patients (7.86+5.33) was considerably higher than the mean of the controls (6.07 +/- 4.37; p=0.016), but not different from the mean of a matched control subsample (6.69 +/- 4.46; p=0.316). The difference between the mean of the scores of DSM-IV/ADHD scale of patients (6.72 +/- 4.07) and controls (5.73 +/- 3.56; p=0.102) was not significant. Non-adherence to treatment and intellectual disability had a negative impact on both CBCL-APS and DSM-IV/ADHD scale scores.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate a significant prevalence of parents' complaints of attention problems and hyperactivity in non-adherent to treatment and intellectually low performing patients with PKU.

AB Bullying behavior alters the way in which students coexist together in the classroom and negatively affects adolescents' well-being. Research highlights the importance of emotional skills in promoting positive youth development and optimal social functioning. Therefore, education in these skills is a potential target for interventions aimed at reducing cyberbullying and promoting satisfaction with life during adolescence. This study analyzes the impact of an emotion education program in adolescents to promote classroom coexistence and well-being. The sample comprised 148 students from 7th and 8th grade of secondary school aged between 12 and 15 years (M-age = 12.63, SDage = 0.74; 57% girls). A quasi-experimental design with longitudinal data collection was used in this study with randomized classroom assignment to the experimental group and the control group. The intervention program was based on the emotional intelligence model of Mayer and Salovey (1997). Its objective was to develop adolescents' emotional skills to improve the quality of interpersonal relationships and reduce conflicts between peers, positively influencing coexistence and well-being. The intervention took place in eleven sessions during school hours over a period of 3 months. Participants completed the emotional competence questionnaire, the cyberbullying scale and the life satisfaction scale before (T1), immediately after (T2), and 6 months after the intervention (T3). The results showed that the intervention program reduced victimization and assault via mobile phones and the Internet in T2 and T3. In the follow-up (T3), the intervention group had enhanced emotional perception and regulation skills and reported an increase in life satisfaction in comparison to the control group. Our findings suggest that implementing classroom intervention programs to develop students' emotional competencies could be beneficial for their subjective well-being and peer coexistence.

AB Forced displacements and their psychosocial consequences in adolescent refugees and their families have received increasing attention in recent years. Although supportive family relations play a key role in buffering the impact of traumatization in adolescents, parental ability to provide such is often subject to extreme pressure. Under conditions of forced dislocation and fear, maladaptive interpersonal strategies in the parent-child relationships may develop, contributing to the onset of psychopathology. We explore new aspects of attachment-related issues for the understanding and treatment of adolescent refugees who have experienced multiple traumas in their childhood. We used a multimethod assessment battery including the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), the Structured Clinical Interview, the Youth Self Report and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale in an adolescent boy with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our subject was an adolescent refugee from the Middle East who demonstrated an unresolved attachment when confronted with loss and fear. His responses on the AAP evoked aspects of insecure-unresolved attachment, including his belief that it is not safe to trust in attachment figures, his limited access to traumatic attachment experiences, his impaired ability to take concrete actions when dealing with threatening attachment situations and the unintentional role-reversal shed new light on our understanding of his traumatic experiences, family functioning and psychopathological symptoms. Our results demonstrate the utility of the AAP in an adolescent refugee with PTSD by expanding our knowledge of a diverse range of experiences across the interpersonal, cognitive, cultural and developmental contexts that formed the basis for an individualized treatment plan.

AB Objective: To develop a theoretically grounded measure of self-perceived ability to cope with stress in a flexible (i.e. non-rigid) manner and test associations with well-being. Method: Participants in Study 1 (N = 395, 17-56 years) completed surveys to report flexible coping with stress and well-being. In Studies 2 (N = 645, 17-27 years) and 3 (N = 558, 12-19 years), youth completed surveys with the 18-item Self-Perception of Flexible Coping with Stress (SFCS), and coping and well-being measures. Results: Three SFCS factors were supported, which aligned to the conceptualization including multiple coping strategy use (multiple CSU), coping rigidity, and situational coping. The SFCS subscales had good reliability and were modestly correlated with each other. Also, multiple CSU and situational coping were linked to better mental health, emotion regulation, greater use of adaptive coping strategies, and better self-worth. Coping rigidity was linked with more symptoms of anxiety and depression, more emotion dysregulation, greater use of problem-coping behaviors, and lower self-worth. Older participants reported they were higher in flexible coping and sex differences in multiple CSU and situational coping were found. Conclusions. The SFCS, a measure of the deployment of a coping "toolbox" that could allow individuals to respond adroitly to stressors, is reliable, valid, and associated with well-being.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric disorder of childhood and adolescence which has been linked to deficient emotion processing and regulation. The behavioral and neuronal correlates targeting the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition are still under investigation. Whole-brain event-related fMRI was applied during an affective Stroop task in 39 adolescents with CD and 39 typically developing adolescents (TD). Participants were presented with an emotional stimulus (negative/neutral) followed by a Stroop task with varying cognitive load (congruent/incongruent/blank trials). fMRI analysis included standard preprocessing, region of interest analyses (amygdala, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and whole-brain analyses based on a 2(group) x 2(emotion) x 3(task) full-factorial ANOVA. Adolescents with CD made significantly more errors, while reaction times did not significantly differ compared to TD. Additionally, we observed a lack of downregulation of left amygdala activity in response to incongruent trials and increased anterior insula activity for CD relative to TD during affective Stroop task processing [cluster-level family-wise error-corrected (p < 0.05)]. Even though no three-way interaction (group x emotion x task) interaction was detected, the findings presented still provide evidence for altered neuronal underpinnings of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD. Moreover, our results may corroborate previous evidence of emotion dysregulation as a core dysfunction in CD. Future studies shall focus on investigating the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD subgroups (e.g., variations in callous-unemotional traits, impulsivity, or anxiety).

AB The increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population triggers a deep concern within public health. This alarming trend stresses the need for the development of effective strategies that might aid with this growing population. Exergaming has several advantages as an ASD intervention, such as flexible play, a private space for exercise, and diverse types of physical activity. The study aims to analyze the effectiveness of exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies which employed exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion. Exergaming-related changes in participants' physical and cognitive functions were the main interest of the current review. Ten articles satisfied the predetermined eligibility criteria. Thematic coding categorized the main outcomes into two higher-order themes and five subthemes. The higher-order themes were physical performance and cognitive performance. The emerged subthemes were physical fitness, motor performance, intensity of physical activity, executive function, and self-perception. Following exergame interventions, individuals with ASD indicated significant improvements in physical fitness, executive function, and self-perception. Exergaming also increased participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In contrast, exergaming indicated small impact on emotional regulation and did not provide adequate opportunities for motor skill development. It is worth noting that only one randomized controlled trial was included in the current review. Future research would require more rigorous study designs to provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of exergaming interventions for individuals with ASD. Exergaming interventions lead to improved physical and cognitive functions in individuals with ASD. It is suggested that exergaming be used as a feasible supplement to traditional physical activity programs for individuals with ASD.

AB Twin studies have shown that emotional problems (anxiety and depression) in childhood and adolescence are moderately heritable (similar to 20-50%). In contrast, DNA-based ` SNP heritability' estimates are generally < 15% and nonsignificant. One notable feature of emotional problems is that they can be somewhat transient, but the moderate stability seen across time and across raters is predominantly influenced by stable genetic influences. This suggests that by capturing what is in common across time and across raters, we might be more likely to tap into any underlying genetic vulnerability. We therefore hypothesised that a phenotype capturing the pervasive stability of emotional problems would show higher heritability. We fitted single-factor latent trait models using 12 emotional problems measures across ages 7, 12 and 16, rated by parents, teachers and children themselves in the Twins Early Development Study sample. Twin and SNP heritability estimates for stable emotional problems (N = 6110 pairs and 6110 unrelated individuals, respectively) were compared to those for individual measures. Twin heritability increased from 45% on average for individual measures to 76% (se = 0.023) by focusing on stable trait variance. SNP heritability rose from 5% on average (n. s.) to 14% (se = 0.049; p = 0.002). Heritability was also higher for stable within-rater composites. Polygenic scores for both adult anxiety and depression significantly explained variance in stable emotional problems (0.4%; p = 0.0001). The variance explained was more than in most individual measures. Stable emotional problems also showed significant genetic correlation with adult depression and anxiety (average = 52%). These results demonstrate the value of examining stable emotional problems in gene-finding and prediction studies.

AB BackgroundBeing overweight and obesity during adolescence are worldwide public health problems. This study examined the relationship between actual weight, body image, and emotional and behavioral problems among Chinese adolescents.MethodsA total of 3841 adolescents (age range, 11-16years) from 5 Chinese cities were included in this cross-sectional study. All of the study participants were asked to complete questionnaires (including demographic features, strengths and difficulties questionnaires, pubertal development scale), and their height and weight were measured at the same time. Body image was measured in two ways: self-perceived weight and body satisfaction. The relationship between weight status and mental health was estimated by multivariate logistic regression for boys and girls.ResultsOur study showed a difference by sex for prevalence of being overweight/obesity and body dissatisfaction among Chinese adolescents. Boys were more likely to be overweight or obese than girls (30.4% vs. 21.5%, p<0.05), but girls were more likely to be dissatisfied with their bodies than boys (41.2% vs. 27.9%, p<0.05). In the logistic regression, body image, not actually being overweight, was significantly associated with a higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems. Compared to perceived normal weight boys, boys who perceived themselves as underweight had an increased likelihood of emotional problems (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-2.57), conduct problems (OR=1.73; 95% CI, 1.20-2.50), and total difficulties (OR=1.50; 95% CI, 1.09-2.05). Compared to body satisfaction, body dissatisfaction was a risk factor for emotional problems (boys: OR=2.80; 95% CI, 1.84-4.25; girls: OR=2.18; 95% CI, 1.42-3.36), conduct problems (boys: OR=1.87, 95% CI, 1.26-2.76; girls: OR=2.79; 95% CI, 1.46-5.30), hyperactivity problems (boys: OR=1.67; 95% CI, 1.09-2.55; girls: OR=2.04; 95% CI, 1.13-3.69), and total difficulties (boys: OR=2.03; 95% CI, 1.45-2.84; girls: OR=2.30; 95% CI, 1.46-3.56).ConclusionsBeing overweight and obese during adolescence are very serious public health problems in China. Body image was a more substantial predictor for adolescent emotional and behavioral problems than actually being overweight/obesity.

AB This study presents the first evaluation of Dat-e Adolescence, a dating violence prevention program aimed at adolescents in Spain. A cluster randomized control trial was used involving two groups (a control group and experimental group) and two waves (pre-test and posttest six months apart). 1,764 students from across seven state high schools in Andalucia (southern Spain) participated in the study (856 in the control group and 908 in the experimental group); 52.3% were boys (n = 918), with ages ranging from 11 to 19 years (average age = 14.73; SD = 1.34). Efficacy evaluation was analyzed using Latent Change Score Models and showed that the program did not impact on physical, psychological or online aggression and victimization, nor did it modify couple quality. It was, however, effective at modifying myths about romantic love, improving self-esteem, and improving anger regulation, as a trend. These initial results are promising and represent one of the first prevention programs evaluated in this country. Future follow-up will allow us to verify whether these results remain stable in the medium term.

AB Background: Prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been on the rise. MJ use has been reported to impact several brain regions, including frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC is involved in emotion regulation and processing and has been associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, we hypothesized that adolescent MJ users would show disruptions in OFC connectivity compared with healthy adolescents (HC) which would be associated with symptoms of mood and anxiety.
   Methods: 43 MJ-using and 31 HC adolescents completed clinical measures including the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was also acquired for all participants.
   Results: In MJ users, increased depressive symptoms were associated with increased connectivity between the left OFC and left parietal regions. In contrast, lower ratings of anxiety were associated with increased connectivity between right and left OFC and right occipital and temporal regions. These findings indicate significant differences in OFC connectivity in MJ-using adolescents, which correlated with mood/anxiety.
   Limitations: Future studies with an increased number of female participants is required to address potential sex differences in connectivity patterns related to symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the association between OFC connectivity, MJ use, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. These findings provide further insight into understanding the neural correlates that modulate the relationship between comorbid MJ use and mood disorders and could potentially help us better develop preventive and treatment measures.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is common among adolescents and associated with negative outcomes. However, treatments developed specifically for NSSI and the proposed NSSI disorder (NSSID) are scarce, and access to empirically supported treatments for NSSI in many areas is limited. Online treatments carry the potential to increase the availability of evidence-based treatments. Emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA) has shown promise in the treatment of adolescents with NSSID.
   Method: The present study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of an online version of ERITA. Twenty-five adolescents (aged 13-17) with NSSID and their parents were included in an uncontrolled open trial. Self-report and clinician-rated assessments of outcomes such as NSSI, self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and global functioning were administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3- and 6- month follow-up. Measures of NSSI, self-destructive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were also assessed weekly during treatment.
   Results: Ratings of treatment credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction were acceptable, and the therapeutic alliance and treatment completion rate (96%) were high. Adolescent participation in the treatment was associated with a statistically significant increase in past-month NSSI abstinence (p = .007), large-sized improvements in past-month NSSI frequency (55% reduction, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29, 72; Cohen's d = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.06) and global functioning (d = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.32), and medium-sized improvements in emotion dysregulation (d = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90) and NSSI versatility (d = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.77) from pre- to post-treatment. These improvements were further strengthened at 3-month follow-up and maintained at 6-month follow-up. The online therapist-guided parent program was associated with small-to large-sized (ds = 0.47-1.22) improvements in adaptive parent behaviors, and these improvements were maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, in line with the theoretical model underlying ERITA, change in emotion dysregulation mediated changes in both NSSI frequency and self-destructive behaviors over the course of treatment.
   Conclusions: Together, results suggest that online ERITA is an acceptable, feasible, and promising low-intensity treatment for adolescents with NSSID. The results of this open trial must be replicated in controlled studies.

TI Alterations in electrophysiological indices of perceptual processing and

AB Background: Many young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience emotional and behavioural problems. However, the causes of these co-occurring difficulties are not well understood. Perceptual processing atypicalities are also often reported in individuals with ASD, but how these relate to co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems remains unclear, and few studies have used objective measurement of perceptual processing.
   Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to both standard and deviant stimuli (which varied in pitch) in an auditory oddball paradigm in adolescents (mean age of 13.56 years, SD = 1.12, range = 11.40-15.70) with ASD (n = 43) with a wide range of IQ (mean IQ of 84.14, SD = 24.24, range 27-129). Response to deviant as compared to standard stimuli (as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN)) and response to repeated presentations of standard stimuli (habituation) were measured. Multivariate regression tested the association between neural indices of perceptual processing and co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems.
   Results: Greater sensitivity to changes in pitch in incoming auditory information (discrimination), as indexed by increased MMN amplitude, was associated with higher levels of parent-rated behaviour problems. MMN amplitude also showed a trend positive correlation with parent-rated sensory hyper-sensitivity. Conversely, greater habituation at the later N2 component was associated with higher levels of emotional problems. Upon more detailed analyses, this appeared to be driven by a selectively greater ERP response to the first (but not the second or third) standard stimuli that followed deviant stimuli. A similar pattern of association was found with other measures of anxiety. All results remained in covariation analyses controlling for age, sex and IQ, although the association between MMN amplitude and behaviour problems became non-significant when controlling for ASD severity.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that alterations in mechanisms of perceptual processing and discrimination may be important for understanding co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems in young people with ASD.

AB Background: Many patients with an eating disorder report difficulties in regulating their emotions and show a high prevalence of self-injurious behaviour. Several studies have stated that both eating disorder and self-injurious behaviour help emotion regulation, and are thus used as coping mechanisms for these patients. We aimed to determine the prevalence of self-injurious behaviour, its characteristics and its emotion-regulation function in patients with anorexia nervosa or an eating disorder not otherwise specified (n = 136).
   Methods: A cross-sectional design using a self-report questionnaire. Mann-Whitney U-tests were conducted to compare the background and clinical variables between patients with self-injurious behaviour and patients without this type of behaviour. Changes in emotional state before and after self-injurious behaviour were tested by Wilcoxon signed rank tests.
   Results: Our results showed a 41% prevalence of self-injurious behaviour in the previous month. Patients who performed self-injurious behaviour had a statistically significant longer treatment history for their eating disorder than those who did not. Whereas 55% of self-injuring patients had a secondary psychiatric diagnosis, only 21% of participants without self-injurious behaviour did. Regarding the impact of self-injurious behaviour, our results showed a significant increase in "feeling relieved" and a significant decrease in "feeling angry at myself", "feeling anxious" and "feeling angry at others". This indicates that self-injurious behaviour can be regarded as an emotion-regulation behaviour. Participants were usually aware of the causes of their self-injurious behaviour acts.
   Conclusions: Professionals should systematically assess the occurrence of self-injurious behaviour in eating disorder patients, pay special attention to patients with more severe and comorbid psychopathology, and those with a long treatment history. This assessment should be followed by a functional analysis of the self-injurious behaviour and by effective therapeutic interventions alongside the eating disorder treatment.

AB Background: Emotion dysregulation is associated with many mental disorders. Objective: This study aimed to explore the reliability and validity of the German version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in adolescents. Method: The sample consisted of a school sample of 324 adolescents (M = 15.15 years, SD = 1.14, 57% female) and a clinical sample of 97 adolescents (M = 16.25 years, SD = 1.28, 83 % female). To validate the DERS, other questionnaires were completed. Confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were applied. Results: The DERS demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the school and the clinical sample. The ESEM resulted in a six-factor model and an additional factor consisting of reverse-scored items. Conclusion: The results provide support for the use of the German DERS version.

AB There is a dearth of research evaluating the relationship between obsessive-compulsive (OC) phenomena and emotion regulation (ER) in youth. The current study bridges this gap by utilizing multiple informants to evaluate the relationship between ER processes (e.g., suppression) and OC features in 27 diagnostically-assessed youth. As predicted, after controlling for children's age and distress, obsessive beliefs (e.g., the importance of/need to control thoughts) and OCS dimensions (e.g., washing) possessed negative associations with adaptive skills (ER) and positive relationships with maladaptive processes (emotional lability). Notably, expressive suppression possessed the strongest relationship with obsessive beliefs and OCS domains, and mediated the relationship between these two constructs. Results are discussed in the context of experiential avoidance. Clinical recommendations and future directions are discussed.

AB Music has a positive effect on psychological adjustment and relieve tension and this view has been supported by clinical evidence. However, there is still no in-depth analysis of whether there are differences in the regulating effect of music with different characteristics on human psychology, which leads to the fact that current therapeutic schemes using the music to relieve tension are not targeted. In this context, this paper uses the method of EEG clinical trials to explore the role of differences in music rhythm and music mode in psychological regulation. By monitoring the variance of brainwaves of the subjects and the synchronic characteristics of brainwaves in different regions, the research proves that there are great differences in the psychological regulation effect of music with different characteristics: Compared to fast-rhythm music, the effect of slow-rhythm music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. Compared with major music, the effect of minor music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. The above conclusions can be well applied to the treatment of psychological disorder diseases such as anxiety disorder and depression, providing a reference for the targeted design of music therapeutic schemes.

AB Background: Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly demonstrate prominent social communication deficits, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and chronic irritability. These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD. Methods: This two-part six-week study involved four school children with ASD from a public elementary school. The study incorporated an initial three-week feasibility stage followed by a three-week controlled longitudinal efficacy stage. Both stages involved the use of a twice-daily socio-emotional intervention with the smartglasses. Educators completed pre-intervention and post-intervention Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) ratings at the start of the feasibility stage, and weekly during the efficacy stage. Primary outcome measures were improvements in the ABC subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Results: Students in both feasibility and efficacy stages demonstrated improvements (decreases) in irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal compared to a baseline period and control periods, respectively. Participants in the controlled efficacy stage demonstrated decreased ABC subscale scores of 90% for irritability, 41.6% for hyperactivity, and 45.6% for social withdrawal. An intervention exposure-response improvement in irritability and hyperactivity was found during the efficacy stage. Educators rated the technology as superior or vastly superior compared to other assistive technologies. Conclusion: A substantial number of school children with ASD demonstrate chronic and impairing cognitive and behavioral challenges. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain, a smartglasses-based socio-emotional aid for autism, is both feasible and efficacious in improving symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, and hyperactivity in students with autism. The improvement is demonstrated as part of a longitudinal school-based intervention. Further studies involving larger samples and incorporation of randomized controlled trial methodology are underway to further elucidate the impact of this technology.

AB Objectives: Though previous research has indicated that language brokering can be stressful, the findings are mixed, pointing to potential moderators of the association. Guided by an ecological perspective, we examined the role of individual, family, and environmental factors in Mexican American adolescents' acute cortisol responses to language brokering. Method: The study consisted of 46 Mexican American adolescents recruited around a metropolitan city in Central Texas. Participants translated a difficult medical document from English to Spanish for their parents, followed by an arithmetic task (modeled after the Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). Participants' perceptions (perceived efficacy and parental dependence), parental hostility, and discrimination experiences were assessed via self-report and were examined as moderators of adolescents' responses to the task. Results: Results revealed differential responses to the task based on individual, family, and environmental factors. High efficacy and low dependence-parental hostility-discrimination related to stress responses characterized by low baselines, steeper reactivity, and faster recovery. Low efficacy and high dependence related to greater baseline stress and a slower recovery. High levels of parental hostility related to a slower recovery. High levels of discrimination related to greater baseline stress. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the modified TSST task can elicit an acute hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response, but the nature of this response is dependent upon participants' perceptions of language brokering (parental dependence and efficacy). parental hostility, and discrimination experiences. Adolescents' individual characteristics and contextual demands remain important considerations in understanding their acute stress responses.

AB Adolescence is a critical period for the development of self-regulation, and peer interactions are thought to strongly influence regulation ability. Simple exposure to peers has been found to alter decisions about risky behaviors and increase sensitivity to rewards. The link between peer exposure and self-regulation is likely to vary as a function of the type and quality of peer interaction (e.g., rejection or acceptance). Little is known about how the nature of interactions with peers influences different dimensions of self-regulation. We examined how randomization to acceptance or rejection by online "virtual" peers influenced multiple dimensions of self-regulation in a multisite community sample of 273 adolescents aged 16-17 years. Compared to a neutral condition, exposure to peers produced increases in cold cognitive control, but decreased hot cognitive control. Relative to peer acceptance, peer rejection reduced distress tolerance and increased sensitivity to losses. These findings suggest that different dimensions of adolescent self-regulation are influenced by the nature of the peer context: basic cognitive functions are altered by mere exposure to peers, whereas more complex decision making and emotion regulation processes are influenced primarily by the quality of that exposure.

AB Forty Italian gay father families formed by surrogacy were compared with 40 Italian lesbian mother families formed by donor insemination, all with a child aged 3 to 9 years. Standardized interview, observational, and questionnaire measures of parenting quality, parent-child relationships, stigmatization, and children's adjustment were administered to parents, children, teachers, and a child psychiatrist. The only differences across family types indicated higher levels of stigmatization as reported by gay fathers. Externalizing and internalizing problems in both groups scored within the normal range. When family structure and processes were entered together as predictors of child adjustment, a hierarchical linear model analysis showed that factors associated with children's externalizing problems were the child's male gender, high stigmatization, and negative parenting; children's internalizing problems were higher in lesbian mother families and were predicted by stigmatization. Of note, neither gay fathers nor lesbian mothers tended to underestimate their children's adjustment problems relative to teachers. Finally, for children of gay fathers, comparison between teacher SDQ ratings and teacher SDQ normative data on Italian children in a similar age range showed that teachers reported children of gay fathers to show significantly fewer internalizing problems than the normative sample. No differences in children's externalizing problems emerged. A bootstrapping simulation confirmed all results, except the effect of stigmatization on child internalizing problems. Findings suggest that the practice of surrogacy by gay men has no adverse effects on child health outcomes. Implications for our theoretical understanding of child socialization and development, and law and social policy, are discussed.

AB Background: Although dysfunction of amygdala-related circuits is centrally implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), little is known about how this dysfunction differs between adult and adolescent MDD patients.
   Methods: Voxel-wise meta-analyses of abnormal amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) were conducted in adult and adolescent groups separately, followed by a quantitative meta-analytic comparison of the two groups.
   Findings: Nineteen studies that included 665 MDD patients (392 adults and 273 adolescents) and 546 controls (341 adults and 205 adolescents) were identified in the current study. Adult-specific abnormal amygdala rsFC in MDD patients compared to that in controls was located mainly within the affective network, including increased connectivity with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus and bilateral ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex and decreased connectivity with the bilateral insula and the left caudate. Adolescent MDD patients specifically demonstrated decreased amygdala rsFC within the cognitive control network encompassing the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and imbalanced amygdala rsFC within the default mode network, which was manifested as hyperconnectivity in the right precuneus and hypoconnectivity in the right inferior temporal gyrus. Additionally, direct comparison between the two groups showed that adult patients had strengthened amygdala rsFC with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus as well as the right inferior temporal gyrus and weakened amygdala rsFC with the bilateral insula compared to that in adolescent patients.
   Interpretation: Distinct impairments of amygdala-centered rsFC in adult and adolescent patients were related to different network dysfunctions in MDD. Adult-specific amygdala rsFC dysfunction within the affective network presumably reflects emotional dysregulation in MDD, whereas adolescent-specific amygdala rsFC abnormalities in networks involved in cognitive control might reflect the neural basis of affective cognition deficiency that is characteristic of adolescent MDD.

AB Binge-eating disorder (BED) is related to deleterious physical, social, and psychological outcomes among adolescents, and is more common among racial and ethnic minorities. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment for disorders of emotion dysregulation, has demonstrated efficacy in treating disordered eating patterns. While DBT interventions have demonstrated success among adults with BED, less is known about adaptation of DBT for adolescents presenting with BED and subthreshold binge-eating behaviors. This paper describes the Emotional Overeating Intervention, a 10-week DBT skills-based group intervention for adolescents exhibiting binge-eating behaviors. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist is used to describe the intervention with the intention of providing necessary details to implement the intervention in clinical practice or replicate the intervention for further study. The rationale for a condensed version of DBT, potential modifications for future implementation, and the importance of adapting the intervention in a developmentally and culturally responsive manner are discussed. This adapted treatment modality can guide future studies examining interventions for adolescents exhibiting binge-eating behaviors.

Participants were N = 462 Grade 7 and 8 Chinese adolescents (246 boys, Mage = 13.42 years, SD = 8 months) recruited from four randomly selected public schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Participants completed peer assessment measures of shyness and peer victimization, sociometric nominations of peer rejection, and self-report measures of loneliness, depression, and perceived parental psychological control. Among the results, shyness was positively associated with loneliness, depressive symptoms, and peer rejection among adolescents who perceived their parents as higher in psychological control, but no significant associations were found among adolescents who perceived lower levels of parental psychological control. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of parenting practices perpetuating adjustment problems among shy adolescents in urban China.

AB Purpose: To date, little is known about underlying psychophysiological contributions to the impact of media content and overall screen time on adolescent psychological functioning. In the present study we examine respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as a moderator of the link between specific types of media content use, overall media exposure, and the development of internalizing and aggressive symptoms in youth.
   Methods: A sample of 374 adolescents (mean age =15) reported on their media use, internalizing behavior, and aggressive behavior at time 1 (2011) and 1-year follow-up (2012). RSA reactivity was gathered during a challenging laboratory task. Path analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized three-way interaction model between media use, media content, and RSA reactivity, separately for internalizing and aggressive problems.
   Results: Significant interactions were found for aggressive, but not prosocial, media content. For aggressive content, youth exhibiting RSA withdrawal reported significantly greater internalizing and aggressive symptoms when exposed to higher amounts of screen time and aggressive content.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that profiles of heightened RSA withdrawal may place adolescents at greater risk to the negative impact of violent media, whereas prosocial media content may not significantly impact youth development of psychopathology. Implications for the role of psychophysiology in our understanding of media effects are discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

   Older ages were associated with higher DERS total, nonacceptance, goals, and impulsivity scores. When controlling for age, patients with BN and AN-BP had higher overall DERS scores than those with AN, and there were some differences among diagnostic subtypes on specific facets of ER.
   ConclusionsThese results indicate that treatments for emotion dysregulation may be applied across eating disorder diagnoses and ages, and inform how these strategies apply to different diagnostic groups.

AB Sibling relational aggression is an important but understudied dimension of sibling relationships that has potential implications for adolescents' adjustment. This study examined the longitudinal associations between being the target of sibling relational aggression and adolescent adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, risky behavior, self-worth, and romantic competence) among younger and older siblings over a three-year period in adolescence. The moderating roles of birth order, sibling gender, and sibling dyad gender constellation also were tested. Participants were 196 European American adolescent (firstborn-secondborn) sibling pairs who were 16.47 years (SD=0.80) and 13.88 years (SD=1.15) of age, respectively, at the onset of this study. Data were collected separately from each sibling during home interviews. Multilevel models revealed that being the target of sibling relational aggression was associated with all four adjustment outcomes at the between-person level, and with risky behavior and romantic competence at the within-person level. However, some of these effects were moderated by sibling dyad characteristics. Although often overlooked in the literature on adolescence, sibling relationship dynamics play a key role in youth development and adjustment.

AB Bipolar disorder (BD) is highly heritable. Thus, studies in first-degree relatives of individuals with BD could lead to the discovery of objective risk markers of BD. Abnormalities in white matter structure reported in at-risk individuals could play an important role in the pathophysiology of BD. Due to the lack of studies with other at-risk offspring, however, it remains unclear whether such abnormalities reflect BD-specific or generic risk markers for future psychopathology. Using a tract-profile approach, we examined 18 major white matter tracts in 38 offspring of BD parents, 36 offspring of comparison parents with non-BD psychopathology (depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and 41 offspring of healthy parents. Both at-risk groups showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in left-sided tracts (cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, forceps minor), and significantly greater FA in right-sided tracts (uncinate fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus), relative to offspring of healthy parents (P < 0.05). These abnormalities were present in both healthy and affected youth in at-risk groups. Only offspring (particularly healthy offspring) of BD parents showed lower FA in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus relative to healthy offspring of healthy parents (P < 0.05). We show, for the first time, important similarities, and some differences, in white matter structure between offspring of BD and offspring of non-BD parents. Findings suggest that lower left-sided and higher right-sided FA in tracts important for emotional regulation may represent markers of risk for general, rather than BD-specific, psychopathology. Lower FA in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus may protect against development of BD in offspring of BD parents.

AB Several studies have found a positive relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or anxiety. However, relatively little research has investigated factors that might moderate this association. The present study aimed to examine the moderating role of anger rumination, unjust world beliefs and perceived social support in the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms across different victim groups. A total of 1,500 participants (57.9% male, M-age = 28.9 years, SD = 8.7) were recruited using an online questionnaire. According to the results, 29.8% of participants reported being bullied online during the past year. Results also indicated that cyberbullying victims but not bully-victims with a tendency to ruminate on past anger episodes and strong unjust world beliefs are more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms. These findings point to the differences between victims and bully-victims in the mechanisms underlying the victimization-psychiatric symptoms association, and highlight the importance of emotion regulation and just world beliefs in preserving and enhancing psychological well-being in those individuals who had been bullied online.

AB Background. Previous studies find that both schizophrenia and mood disorder risk alleles contribute to adult depression and anxiety. Emotional problems (depression or anxiety) begin in childhood and show strong continuities into adult life; this suggests that symptoms are the manifestation of the same underlying liability across different ages. However, other findings suggest that there are developmental differences in the etiology of emotional problems at different ages. To our knowledge, no study has prospectively examined the impact of psychiatric risk alleles on emotional problems at different ages in the same individuals.
   Methods. Data were analyzed using regression-based analyses in a prospective, population-based UK cohort (the National Child Development Study). Schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD) polygenic risk scores (PRS) were derived from published Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association studies. Emotional problems were assessed prospectively at six time points from age 7 to 42 years.
   Results. Schizophrenia PRS were associated with emotional problems from childhood [age 7, OR 1.09 (1.03-1.15), p = 0.003] to mid-life [age 42, OR 1.10 (1.05-1.17), p < 0.001], while MDD PRS were associated with emotional problems only in adulthood [age 42, OR 1.06 (1.00-1.11), p = 0.034; age 7, OR 1.03 (0.98-1.09), p = 0.228].
   Conclusions. Our prospective investigation suggests that early (childhood) emotional problems in the general population share genetic risk with schizophrenia, while later (adult) emotional problems also share genetic risk with MDD. The results suggest that the genetic architecture of depression/anxiety is not static across development.

AB Objective: The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) is used worldwide to assess three styles (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) and seven dimensions of parenting. In this study, we adapted the short version of the PSDQ for use in Brazil and investigated its validity and reliability.
   Methods: Participants were 451 mothers of children aged 3 to 18 years, though sample size varied with analyses. The translation and adaptation of the PSDQ followed a rigorous methodological approach. Then, we investigated the content, criterion, and construct validity of the adapted instrument.
   Results: The scale content validity index (S-CVI) was considered adequate (0.97). There was evidence of internal validity, with the PSDQ dimensions showing strong correlations with their higher-order parenting styles. Confirmatory factor analysis endorsed the three-factor, second-order solution (i.e., three styles consisting of seven dimensions). The PSDQ showed convergent validity with the validated Brazilian version of the Parenting Styles Inventory (Inventario de Estilos Parentais - IEP), as well as external validity, as it was associated with several instruments measuring sociodemographic and behavioral/emotional-problem variables.
   Conclusion: The PSDQ is an effective and reliable psychometric instrument to assess childrearing strategies according to Baumrind's model of parenting styles.

AB The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) places affected individuals at an increased risk for neurodevelopmental/cognitive, behavioral and social-emotional difficulties. Poor cognitive functioning and intellectual disabilities, attention and executive functioning deficits, learning disorders, emotional dysregulation and impairments in social processing are common among individuals with 22q11.2 DS. Identifying risk and protective/resilience factors that can be detected in early life and can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes for people with 22q11.2 DS is of significant clinical relevance and might allow for early detection and intervention. Given the focus of this review, we will discuss the possible contributing factors that influence the neurodevelopmental outcome in 22q1.2 DS, the cognitive phenotype in 22q11.2 DS, the different developmental trajectories across life span, and the implications for clinical practice and management.

AB This paper seeks to extend prior research by exploring whether family structure transition is associated with an increase in early alcohol consumption and whether this association is mediated by; children's socio-emotional problems, providing information on whether the effects of the transition; differ according to the number of changes, the family's initial status, or the time of exposure. The; data have been drawn from the UK Millennium Cohort Study to explore associations framed with; a life-course approach. Our findings suggest that types of family transitions (such as distinguishing; parental exits from and parental entrances to the family) are more important than the number of; family changes during childhood. The results show that moving from a two parent household to a single-parent household directly increased the probability of being a frequent alcohol consumer among early adolescent boys, whereas the indirect effect on girls was found via socio-emotional difficulties. Our findings also show an increase in socio-emotional and behavioural difficulties in boys due to the entrance of a step-parent only if the transition occurred in the earliest childhood. Indeed, a sensitivity analysis of the time to which the children were exposed to the transition to a new family structure showed stronger effects for those who experienced a family structure change in the early life course, consistent with the cumulative disadvantage process.

AB Young people with autism spectrum disorder experience high levels of emotional problems, including anxiety and depression. Adapted cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended for such difficulties. However, no evidence suggests whether emotion awareness is important in treatment outcome for young people on the autism spectrum. This study aimed to investigate the potential differences in emotion awareness between (1) young people on the autism spectrum and typically developing youth and (2) young people on the autism spectrum with and without experience of cognitive behavioural therapy. Three groups (aged 11-20years) participated: (1) typically developing young people (n = 56); (2) young people on the autism spectrum with no experience of cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 23); and (3) young people on the autism spectrum who had attended cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 33). All participants completed the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire-30 item version. Young people on the autism spectrum differed significantly from typically developing young people on the emotional awareness measure. Young people on the autism spectrum who had attended cognitive behavioural therapy scored significantly lower on the Differentiating Emotions subscale, and significantly higher on the Attending to Others' Emotions subscale, compared to young people on the autism spectrum who had not attended cognitive behavioural therapy. This study highlights the importance of psycho-educational components of cognitive behavioural therapy when adapting for young people on the autism spectrum.

AB Purpose: To investigate the association between sleep duration, sleep initiation difficulties and psychological and somatic complaints.
   Methods: We used three cohorts of cross-sectional Swedish questionnaire data, from the Health Behaviours of School aged Children (1985/1986, 2005/2006, 2013/2014, n = > 18000, aged 11-15). Specific complaints (e.g. pain) and total complaint load were used as outcomes of sleep duration, sleep initiation difficulties and the combination of them both.
   Results: Sleeping less than recommended and sleep initiation difficulties were associated with increased odds of specific complaints and belonging to the group with the greatest complaint load. The combination of short sleep duration and sleep initiation difficulties were associated with higher odds than either sleep issue alone. No interaction effects between time and sleep variables were found regarding complaints.
   Conclusions: The findings support recent sleep duration recommendations. Further, sleep issues warrant a broad health assessment as they indicate a high likelihood of other complaints.

AB Introduction: The goal of the present study was to identify the prospective relations between weight/shape and muscularity concerns and emotional problems in adolescents.
   Methods: Self-report data of 966 German male and female adolescents were analyzed in a cross lagged panel design.
   Results: Analyses of latent means revealed significant correlations between weight/shape concern and emotional problems as well as between muscularity concern and emotional problems in both genders. Moreover, weight/shape concern predicted emotional problems prospectively, but only in girls. Regarding muscularity concern, we could not find any prospective relation with emotional problems In boys or girls from the general population.
   Conclusions: It is assumed that as appearance is highly relevant for the self-concept in girls, concerns about the look might promote emotional problems. Thus, weight/shape concern should be addressed in the prevention of emotional problems in adolescent girls, whereas further research is necessary investigating the contribution of muscularity concern in this context.

AB Objective The aim of the study was to assess whether the association between chronic family stress and physiological measures is moderated by emotion regulation strategies in an adolescent sample.
   Methods Chronic family stress was assessed via a semistructured interview and emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and suppression) via questionnaire among 261 adolescents (14.57 (1.07) years). Several metabolic (waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and inflammatory markers (basal and stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in response to bacterial challenge) as well as glucocorticoid sensitivity were assessed.
   Results There were no main effects of chronic family stress, cognitive reappraisal, or suppression on physiological measures (all p's > .10). Emotion regulation moderated the association between chronic family stress and physiological measures. As chronic family stress increased, adolescents higher in cognitive reappraisal had smaller waist-hip ratios (B = -.003, SE = .001, p = .015) and lower systolic blood pressure (B = -.303, SE = .143, p = .035), although no moderation was found with respect to inflammatory markers and glucocorticoid sensitivity (all p's > .30). In addition, as chronic family stress increased, adolescents higher in suppression showed evidence of higher stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production (B = .046, SE = .020, p = .021) and lower glucocorticoid sensitivity (B = .051, SE = .021, p = .015), although basal inflammation and metabolic measures were not moderated by suppression (all p's > .50).
   Conclusions This study suggests that the types of emotion regulation strategies used by adolescents may affect the extent to which chronic family stress affects important metabolic and immune processes.

AB Background: An increase in self-harm emergencies after bariatric surgery have been documented, but understanding of the phenomenon is missing.
   Case presentation: The following case report describes a 26-year-old woman with obesity, who initiated self-harm behaviour after bariatric surgery. The patient reported that the self-harm was a substitute for binge eating, which was anatomically impeded after bariatric surgery. Pre-surgical psychosocial assessment revealed Anorexia Nervosa in youth, which had later migrated to Binge Eating Disorder. At the time of surgery, the patient was not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Binge Eating Disorder because of a low frequency of binges. The remaining binges occurred when experiencing negative affect.
   Conclusions: Previous eating disorder pathology is an important consideration in pre-surgical assessments. For patients with affect-driven pre-surgical Binge Eating Disorder, therapeutic intervention before and after bariatric surgery could be indicated in order to secure the development of adaptive coping strategies. Furthermore, body weight as the only outcome measure for the success of surgery seems insufficient.

AB BackgroundChild maltreatment (CM) is robustly associated with youth risk for addictive behaviors, and recent findings suggest that this may be mediated through impulsive discounting of future rewards. However, research indicates that youth self-regulation (emotional and cognitive), particularly in peer contexts, is critical to consider in the study of decision making. This study aimed to examine the indirect link between CM and alcohol and other drug use problems, through delayed reward discounting (DRD), among a community sample of emerging adults. Further, this investigation aimed to examine whether this indirect link was moderated by heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological proxy for regulation of stress reactivity.
   MethodsA sample of emerging adults (N=225; M-age=21.56; SDage=2.24; 52.9% female) was assessed at 2 time points, with 1year between assessments. The sample was comprised of rural emerging adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. DRD was examined using a monetary choice task, and HRV reactivity was derived during a social stress task.
   ResultsIncreased CM experiences were significantly linked to riskier DRD. HRV reactivity amplified the indirect effect between CM and alcohol use problems via riskier DRD.
   ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that the connection between CM and alcohol use problems via impulsive decision making is modulated by acute stress response reactivity, as indexed by HRV.

AB Psychopathy is a cluster of personality traits associated with high rates of aggression. While research on psychopathic traits largely focuses on neurobiological factors implicated in aggression, other research suggests that contextual factors, such as social exclusion, also contribute to promoting aggression. Yet, the relationships among psychopathic traits, neural processing of exclusion, and aggression remain unknown. A sample of 76 adolescents and young adults completed Cyberball, a task involving conditions of social inclusion, ambiguous exclusion, and unambiguous exclusion. During Cyberball, a slow wave (SW) event-related potential (an index of elaborative processing) and self-reported anger were measured. Additionally, acts of real-world aggression were assessed. Results indicated that as psychopathic traits increased, SW during ambiguous exclusion also increased, but SW during inclusion decreased. However, the combination of smaller SW during ambiguous exclusion and higher psychopathic traits predicted heightened anger following Cyberball and more frequent real-world aggression. This response to social exclusion among individuals with elevated psychopathic traits may represent an unreflective, reactive style that exacerbates anger and aggression in certain contexts. These data suggest that neurobiological dysfunction in elaborative processing is related to psychopathic traits, and social context comprises another important influence on the aggression of individuals with elevated psychopathic traits.

AB Exposure to neighborhood violence is an important risk factor for the social and emotional development of children and youth. Previous work recognizes that violence may affect children indirectly via secondhand exposure; yet, few studies have aimed to identify and quantify these effects, especially in settings like Colombia where youth is chronically exposed to violence. To address this gap in the literature, this article implements an empirical strategy where geographically specific and time-stamped data are leveraged to identify the effect of indirect exposure to homicides on fifth grade children's social and emotional outcomes. Sample participants (N=5801) represent the fifth-grade population of boys and girls (50.7%) in two major urban areas in the country (Mage=11.01, SD=0.75). We hypothesize that the effects of exposure to neighborhood violence on children's social and emotional skills will be consistent and negative. The findings indicate a consistent negative effect of indirect exposure to homicides on children's emotional functioning (i.e., emotional regulation and empathy), as well as on the prevalence of avoidance behaviors. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, the results do not support effects on children's levels of aggressive behavior, nor on the beliefs and attitudes that justify the use of aggression in interpersonal relationships. The findings are discussed in light of predictions from social cognitive models and their implications for developmentally and trauma-informed interventions for youth.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious public health concern among adolescents. Identifying risk factors of NSSI is important to effectively prevent or reduce such behavior. Child maltreatment is one of the most widely recognized risk factors for NSSI. How child maltreatment and NSSI is related, however, is still unclear. The present study tested the temporal relationship between physical and emotional abuse and NSSI, with distress intolerance as the potential mediator. Potential gender differences on these associations were also tested. We assessed all study variables among 2259 Chinese adolescents (53.8% females; M-age=15.11 years, SD=1.57) for three times at 6-month intervals. The results showed that distress intolerance only mediated the relationship between emotional abuse and NSSI, but not between physical abuse and NSSI. In addition, this mediation effect of distress intolerance was significant only for females. The findings of this study can help researchers and practitioners understand pathways by which child maltreatment impacts adolescent NSSI. Implications for preventions and interventions of NSSI were discussed.

AB Objectives To characterize the friendship networks, peer relationships, and bullying experiences of 12-year-old children born extremely preterm (EPT: 23-27 weeks of gestation), very preterm (VPT: 28-32 weeks of gestation), and full term (FT: 38-41 weeks of gestation), and to identify child characteristics placing children at risk of peer problems.
   Study design A regional cohort of 44 EPT, 60 VPT, and 109 FT born children were followed prospectively to 12 years of age. The nature of children's close friendships, peer relations, and bullying experiences were assessed using a multimethod approach, including parent, teacher, and child report.
   Results Across all measures, children born EPT had more peer social difficulties than children born VPT and FT. They were more likely to report no close friendships (5%-14% EPT vs 0%-3% VPT/FT), dissatisfaction with their peer network (16% vs 1%-2%), and less time interacting face-to-face with friends (16%-23% vs 5%-8%). They were also 3 times more likely to be rated by their parents and teachers as experiencing problems relating to peers (P <= .001). In contrast, rates of chronic bullying (2 times/week) were similar for EPT and VPT children (12%-14% vs 4% FT). Emotional problems, inattention/hyperactivity, and motor deficits were associated with an increased risk of peer relationship problems, whereas higher body mass index, delayed pubertal development. vision problems. and inattention/hyperactivity problems were associated with frequent bullying.
   Conclusions With the exception of bullying, risks of peer social difficulties were greatest among children born EPT. Peer social relationships should be monitored as part of longer term developmental surveillance and support.

AB Studies of social anxiety in university students have become of particular importance given its disabling impact over social adjustment and psychological well-being. The present research had the objective of developing an explanatory model of this phenomenon with principles based on attachment theory and the theories of emotional regulation. We worked with a sample of 438 university students and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis. We produced an explanatory model which presented appropriate adjustment indexes (CFI=.95; GFI=.95; RMSEA=.05). In this model, the predictive role of expectations of social rejection and the difficulties in emotion regulation in the aetiology of social anxiety are clear. These factors are in turn influenced by the fear of abandonment linked to internal working models of insecure attachment of development in early childhood. Significant differences were found in favour of women in percentages of variance explained in social anxiety and expectations of social rejection.

AB The Adolescent Quality of Life-Mental Health Scale (AQOL-MHS) was designed to measure quality of life in clinical samples of Latino adolescents aged 12-18 years, but has also been used in community samples. The original measure included three factors: Emotional Regulation (ER), Self-Concept (SC) and Social Context (SoC). The goals of this study are to replicate the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), shorten the instrument and test the degree of measurement invariance across gender, age, and type of sample. Participants for the analyses (N = 354) came from two populations in the San Juan Metropolitan Area: (1) adolescents from randomly selected households, using a multi-stage probability sampling design (n = 295), and (2) adolescents receiving treatment at mental health clinics (n = 59). We first carried out a conceptual item analysis for item reduction purposes and then assessed dimensional, configural, metric and scalar invariance for each factor using the Mplus software system. The original 3-factor structure was replicated with comparable model fit in each treatment context. Metric invariance was attained for all three scales across groups. Either full or partial scalar invariance was also observed with DIF in a total of 6 items. Invariance testing supports the use of the abridged 21 item version of the AQOL-MHS to compare diverse individuals with little bias using observed scores, but for refined estimates the ideal scoring will be from a latent variable model.

AB Nationwide, there is a pressing need to develop more efficacious treatment regimens for reactively aggressive youth receiving inpatient psychiatric services. Identifying the relevant clinical characteristics of youth with reactive aggression is an important first step in this process. Past research findings and theoretical formulations have suggested that deficits in both social skills and emotional regulation abilities are significantly associated with the development of reactive aggression in children. Utilizing a highly aggressive child inpatient sample (65 males and 36 females) receiving crisis-stabilization services, we tested the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation statistically mediated the relationship between theory of mind deficits and reactive aggression. As hypothesized, results of bootstrapped mediational analyses indicated that theory of mind deficits were associated with higher levels of reactive aggression via the indirect influence of dysregulated affect. These findings suggest that intervention programs for reactively aggressive children should promote both theory of mind skills and emotion regulation abilities. Children that develop more thoughtful styles of perspective taking coupled with an enhanced ability to modulate their emotions may develop a greater ability to employ the rational conflict resolution skills that underlie peaceful social relationships.

AB Mental health problems are common in war-affected areas, but children have different levels of vulnerability. Based on ecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 2005), this study analyses how factors related to the child (cognitive capacity), their family (parental depression and parenting styles), and their school (teachers' practices and peer relations) mediate the association between traumatic stress (traumatic war experiences and stressful life-events) and child mental health (posttraumatic stress and psychological distress symptoms). The participants were 303 Palestinian children (51.2% girls) of 10-13 years (M = 10.94 +/- 0.50) and their parents from the Gaza Strip. The children filled in questionnaires during school classes and the parents did so at their homes. The results of structural equation modeling substantiated the hypothesis that parental depression, poor parenting and low-quality peer relations mediated between traumatic stress and children's mental health problems. Contrary to the hypothesis, child-related factors did not mediate that association. To conclude, parents and peers provide important age-salient social resources for children in war conditions, and psychosocial interventions should therefore enhance their beneficial functions.

AB The study examined family and teacher support as factors that can protect adolescents from internalized and externalized problems after exposure to community violence (ECV). Self-administered questionnaires were filled out by a sample of 1,832 Arab and Jewish Israeli high school students. The Arab adolescents reported significantly higher levels of community violence victimization, internalized problems, externalized problems, family support, and teacher support than the Jewish adolescents. The girls reported higher levels of internalized problems, and the boys reported higher levels of externalized problems. ECV predicted high levels of internalized and externalized problems, family support predicted low levels of internalized and externalized problems, and teacher support had no predictive role. Path analysis confirmed the significance of the relationships between ECV effects, support variables, and gender. The limitations of the study and implications of the findings for future research and for the development of family care and family intervention programs are discussed.

AB This study examined self- and group-orientations and their associations with social and psychological adjustment among children in urban and rural China. We expected that self-orientation would be more strongly associated with adjustment in urban children than in rural children whereas group-orientation would be more strongly associated with adjustment in rural children than in urban children. Data on self- and group-orientations and indexes of adjustment were collected for students in urban and rural elementary schools (N = 990, M-age = 11 years) from multiple sources including teacher ratings, self-reports, and school records. The results showed that self-orientation was positively associated with academic achievement ( = .27, t = 5.20, p < .001) and negatively associated with emotional problems (s = -.12 to -.20, ts = -2.34 to -3.93, ps = .007 to < .001) in urban children; the associations were weaker or nonsignificant in rural children (s = -.04 to .12, ts = -.83 to 2.54, ps = .405 to .011). Group-orientation was associated with social standing, academic achievement, and psychological well-being more strongly in rural children (s = -.35 to .36, ts = -7.32 to 7.63, ps = .048 to < .001) than in urban children (s = -.19 to .20, ts = -.3.75 to 3.77, ps = .432 to < .001). These results indicate different implications of self- and group-orientations for adjustment in urban and rural children in contemporary China.

AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children under 8years of age, referred to as early-onset OCD, has similar features to OCD in older children, including moderate to severe symptoms, impairment, and significant comorbidity. Family-based cognitive behavioral therapy (FB-CBT) has been found efficacious in reducing OCD symptoms and functional impairment in children ages 5-8years with OCD; however, its effectiveness on reducing comorbid psychiatric symptoms in this same population has yet to be demonstrated. This study examined the acute effects of FB-CBT vs. family-based relaxation treatment over 14 weeks on measures of secondary treatment outcomes (non-OCD) in children with early-onset OCD. Children in the FB-CBT condition showed significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment on secondary outcomes, with a decrease in overall behavioral and emotional problems, internalizing symptoms, as well as overall anxiety symptom severity. Neither condition yielded significant change in externalizing symptoms. Clinical implications of these findings are considered.

AB The prevalence of depression rises steeply during adolescence. Family processes have been identified as one of the important factors that contribute to affect (dys)regulation during adolescence. In this study, we explored the affect expressed by mothers, fathers, and adolescents during a problem-solving interaction and investigated whether the patterns of the affective interactions differed between families with depressed adolescents and families with nondepressed adolescents. A network approach was used to depict the frequencies of different affects, concurrent expressions of affect, and the temporal sequencing of affective behaviors among family members. The findings show that families of depressed adolescents express more anger than families of nondepressed adolescents during the interaction. These expressions of anger co-occur and interact across time more often in families with a depressed adolescent than in other families, creating a more self-sustaining network of angry negative affect in depressed families. Moreover, parents' angry and adolescents' dysphoric affect follow each other more often in depressed families. Taken together, these patterns reveal a particular family dynamic that may contribute to vulnerability to, or maintenance of, adolescent depressive disorders. Our findings underline the importance of studying affective family interactions to understand adolescent depression.

AB This synthesis of treatment research related to anxiety and depression in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on the scientific support for various forms of psychosocial interventions, useful adaptations to standard interventions, and engagement of candidate therapeutic mechanisms.
   There is considerable evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat co-occurring problems with anxiety, but there has been relatively little research on treatment of co-occurring depression. Multiple mechanisms of treatment effect have been proposed, but there has been little demonstration of target engagement via experimental therapeutics.
   Comorbidity between ASD and anxiety and/or mood problems is common. Although there is evidence for the use of CBT for anxiety, little work has addressed how to effectively treat depression. There is emerging support for alternative treatment approaches, such as mindfulness-based interventions. We encourage rigorous, collaborative approaches to identify and manipulate putative mechanisms of change.

AB The present study aimed to elucidate the profile of coping in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in order to discern whether the disorder is characterized by an excess of maladaptive coping skills and/or a lack of adaptive coping skills. Sixty individuals with OCD were compared with 110 individuals with depression and 1050 nonclinical controls on the Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Styles Questionnaire (MAX). Psychopathology was assessed with the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (PHQ-9). Individuals with OCD and depression displayed more maladaptive coping and avoidance as well as less adaptive coping than nonclinical controls. Importantly, adaptive coping was significantly lower in individuals with OCD than in those with depression at a medium effect size, whereas the clinical groups were indistinguishable on maladaptive coping and avoidance. Lack of adaptive coping was strongly correlated with resistance to symptoms and poor insight in OCD (Y-BOCS), even after controlling for depression. Lack of adaptive coping skills may represent a specific pathogenetic factor in OCD. Longitudinal studies need to clarify whether strengthening adaptive skills during childhood and adolescence may help to prevent the progression from subclinical to manifest OCD.

AB With a prevalence of 5.3%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common conditions among children and adolescents. Intensive behavioral therapy interventions such as therapeutic summer programs represent a multimodal treatment approach for ADHD. Several psychosocial interventions (child-based therapy, parent training, and school-centered approaches) are applied to treat disorder-specific symptoms and behavior problems typically associated with impairments in family and school functioning as well as peer interactions. Short-and long-term effects in treating ADHD and related disorders have repeatedly been shown with this type of therapy. The Summer Therapy Camp (STC) for elementary-school-aged children with ADHD distinguishes itself from existing programs in its conceptual approach, treatment method, and implementation. During the 3-week STC, behavior modification (reinforcement without response-cost) and cognitive behavioral therapy are offered to participating children while they engage in school-related and recreational activities in a summer camp setting. The emphasis of the STC is on building behaviors through rewarding appropriate behaviors and proficiencies that foster social competence. Integral parts of the STC are a social skills training that teaches strategies for learning, emotion regulation, and problem-solving plus an accompanying parent training. Monthly booster sessions following the STC are offered to transfer behavior changes achieved during the program to the home and school environments. A total of 40 families from the Rhein-Neckar region in Germany participated in the STCs in 2014 and 2015. Parents of 31 children with ADHD (7-11 years of age) filled out various symptom checklists for ADHD, conduct disorder, and related problems (CBCL/4-18, DISYPS-II FBB-ADHS, and FBB-SSV) to assess treatment outcomes before and after the STC. An additional group of 13 children from the same sample served as control group. The study reports the results of the efficacy evaluation in a pre-post design including a control group. Pre-post comparisons of the data from the parent questionnaires of the STC group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall clinical functioning as well as in key domains of impairment such as attention and social behavior. Greatest improvements were found for disruptive behavior symptoms. Similar effects could not be determined for the control group. The findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of the STC as an intensive therapy program for children aged 7-11 with ADHD. Participating children seem to have profited from the STC behavior modification system based primarily on reinforcement and from its content, particularly the social skills training that emphasizes self-regulation and peer interaction competencies. Given the small sample sizes, the results have to be interpreted with caution. However, they provide the first encouraging indications of the value of the STC in the treatment of ADHD.

AB The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) (Garnefski et al., 2001) is a 36-item instrument for measuring cognitive strategies of emotional regulation. There is a brief, 18-item version that measures the same nine strategies as the full version (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006a). The aim of this study was to develop a brief form of the CERQ, taking into account two different proposals: a 27-item and an 18-item instrument, the latter focusing solely on the assessment of the two general factors obtained in the second-order structure of the original CERQ model and identified in previous studies as adaptive strategies and less adaptive strategies. Participants in the study were 872 individuals aged 18-58 (M = 33.86, SD = 8.43). The confirmatory factor analyses yield adequate overall indices in both versions, together with satisfactory validity. In the discussion, it is argued that the 27-item version is more appropriate for the specific rating of the nine regulation strategies people employ, and we propose the 18-item version as a suitable instrument in clinical context for an overall rating of an individual's cognitive emotion regulation profile, furthermore, the criterion validity with depression and anxiety keeps similar to the larger version.

The sample consisted of a total of 1,664 participants (M = 16.12 years, SD = 1.36, range 14-19 years), selected through stratified cluster sampling. The instruments used were the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C), the Personal Wellbeing Index-School Children (PWI-SC), the ad hoc academic performance questionnaire, and the Oviedo Scale of Response Infrequency. In all, 7.7% of the adolescents showed a possible mental health risk. Emotional and behavioral difficulties were negatively correlated with emotional wellbeing and Positive Affect, and positively associated with Negative Affect. In addition, students with poorer academic performance reported greater emotional and behavioral difficulties. These results are consistent with those found in previous studies. They have clear implications, in both health and education, for improving the promotion of emotional wellbeing and the prevention of psychological problems in this population sector.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors associated with the behavioral development among 24-month-old children in rural northwestern China. A total of 657 children whose mothers had participated in a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of antenatal micronutrient supplementation in western China were followed until 24 months of age. Their mental, psychomotor, and behavioral development were assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with infant behavioral development. Six behavioral factors of infants were presented: activity, social adaptability, reactivity, endurance, concentration, and motor coordination. Further analysis demonstrated that maternal malnutrition, exposure to risk factors during pregnancy, and adverse birth outcomes negatively affected the behavioral development of children at 24 months, which is a common co-occurrence with cognitive and emotional problems. These results suggest that strategies to improve infant behavioral development should consider the maternal pregnancy status.

AB Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience sleep problems, but the comorbidity mechanism has not been sufficiently studied. This study aimed to determine the comorbidity of ADHD symptoms and sleep problems as well as the moderating effects of bedtime activities and depression/anxiety symptoms on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems.
   Methods: We recruited 934 primary students from third to fifth grade and their parents by stratified random sampling from three primary schools in Shanghai, China. This study used parent-reported versions of the ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. We used hierarchical linear regression analysis to clarify the moderating effects of bedtime activities and depression/anxiety symptoms.
   Results: We found that children with more ADHD symptoms had shorter sleep durations and more sleep problems on weekdays. Screen time before bedtime strengthened the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep-disordered breathing. Children with more screen time were more likely to have sleep onset delay, while those with less screen time had more sleep onset problems with increasing ADHD symptoms. The high bedtime eating group experienced more night waking with increasing ADHD symptoms compared with the low bedtime eating group. Anxiety/depression exacerbated total sleep problems and further interacted with ADHD symptoms to predict sleep length and sleep duration problems.
   Conclusions: Bedtime activities and emotional problems had important moderating effects on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems. These findings indicate that appropriate bedtime management and emotional management may reduce sleep problems and improve sleep duration for children with ADHD symptoms.

   ADOLESCENTS
AB Background: Patients with eating disorders (ED) often suffer from compulsive exercise behavior, which is associated with lower short-term response to treatment and poorer long-term outcome. Evidence-based interventions specifically targeting compulsive exercise behavior have been scarce so far. We developed a manualized group therapeutic approach integrating cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise therapy and exposure with response management to promote healthy exercise behavior. Our objective was to examine the feasibility and acceptance of this new approach as add-on to regular inpatient treatment in a pilot study. Additionally, we wanted to estimate preliminary effect sizes.
   Methods: Thirty-two female, adolescent and adult eating disordered inpatients were recruited. According to the 4th ed. of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), twenty-six patients met criteria for Anorexia nervosa (AN), two for Bulimia nervosa and four for eating disorder not otherwise specified. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for qualitative evaluation of feasibility and acceptance of the new intervention. Patients completed the Commitment to Exercise Scale (CES) and the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) for assessment of compulsive exercise, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 for assessment of eating disorder pathology, the Beck Depression Inventory-II and Brief Symptom Inventory for assessment of depressive and general psychopathology and the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire for assessment of emotion regulation before the beginning and at the end of the group intervention. Additionally, weight gain was monitored.
   Results: Feasibility of our approach was confirmed. All patients reported a high satisfaction with both structure and content of the group. Between pre- and post-intervention, patients showed significant reductions in compulsive exercise (effect size CES: 1.44; effect size CET total: 0.93), drive for thinness (effect size: 0.48), depressive symptoms (effect size: 0.36), general psychopathology (effect size: 0.29) and acceptance of emotions (effect size: -0.62). Patients with AN also showed significant mean weight gain during the intervention (effect size: -0.44).
   Conclusions: Results of our pilot study indicate that our integrative approach to compulsive exercise in ED patients might represent a promising new therapeutic option. Feasibility and acceptance of the intervention were confirmed. Preliminary effect sizes on most outcomes were promising. As improvements in Body-mass-index, eating disorder and general psychopathology are also to be expected by routine inpatient treatment, a large randomized trial is currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of this new intervention.

AB Background: High-income countries like Australia play a vital role in resettling refugees from around the world, half of whom are children and adolescents. Informed by an ecological framework, this study examined the post-migration adjustment of refugee children and adolescents 2-3 years after arrival to Australia. We aimed to estimate the overall rate of adjustment among young refugees and explore associations with adjustment and factors across individual, family, school, and community domains, using a large and broadly representative sample.
   Methods: Data were drawn from Wave 3 of the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of settlement among humanitarian migrants in Australia. Caregivers of refugee children aged 5-17 (N = 694 children and adolescents) were interviewed about their children's physical health and activity, school absenteeism and achievement, family structure and parenting style, and community and neighbourhood environment. Parent and child forms of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were completed by caregivers and older children to assess social and emotional adjustment.
   Results: Sound adjustment according to the SDQ was observed regularly among young refugees, with 76-94% (across gender and age) falling within normative ranges. Comparison with community data for young people showed that young refugees had comparable or higher adjustment levels than generally seen in the community. However, young refugees as a group did report greater peer difficulties. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses showed that better reported physical health and school achievement were associated with higher adjustment Furthermore, higher school absenteeism and endorsement of a hostile parenting style were associated with lower adjustment.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to report on child psychosocial outcomes from the large, representative longitudinal BNLA study. Our findings indicate sound adjustment for the majority of young refugees resettled in Australia. Further research should examine the nature of associations between variables identified in this study. Overall, treating mental health problems early remains a priority in resettlement. Initiatives to enhance parental capability, physical health, school achievement and participation could assist to improve settlement outcomes for young refugees.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the association among the risk of eating disorder (ED), psychological adjustment, empathy, attachment style and thin-ideal internalization among adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN), as compared to a healthy control (HC) group. The Questionnaire of General Data, the Eating Disorders Inventory-3 (EDI-3), the Questionnaire of Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance-3 (SATAQ-3), the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) and the Basic Empathy Scale (BES) were administered to 35 female adolescents with AN and 35 HC adolescents. Eating disorder risk was found to be highest in AN females with higher levels of general psychological maladjustment (GPMC), followed by HC females with higher thin-ideal internalization. In the AN group, attachment style and thin-ideal internalization in combination with GPMC were not indicated as significant predictors of eating disorder risk. Study data provide support to conceptualizations of EDs that emphasize the role of general psychological maladjustment in the development of EDs.

AB Introduction: The main aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in a sample of youth outpatients attending the state psychiatric hospital in Singapore and to identify the sociodemographic and psychological/clinical risk factors associated with DSH. The secondary aim of the study was to examine if different forms of DSH had distinguishing risk factors. Materials and Methods: A total of 400 outpatients at the Institute of Mental Health completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic questions, the FunctionalAssessment of Self-Mutilation, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Parental Bonding Instrument and the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations. Results: The overall prevalence of DSH in our clinical population was 58.8%. Cutting/carving (25.4%) and hitting (20.4%) were the most common forms of DSH in the past 12 months. DSH acts were performed primarily for emotion regulation purposes. The risk factors for DSH in general were younger age group, female gender, abuse history and higher depression scores. Gender and age group were the factors that were differentially associated with cutting and hitting one's self. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of DSH in the psychiatric outpatient population. The risk factors identified in this study are consistent with those of international studies which point to their stability across cultures.

AB Objective: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of self-injury among adolescents. Methods: Exploratory, transversal, descriptive study with quantitative approach. The sample consisted of 517 adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, enrolled in four state schools in the city of Divinopolis, Minas Gerais. For data collection, the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (ECA) was applied. The criteria adopted by the Statistical Manual and Diagnosis of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) were used to consider the frequency of self-injury. Results: 9.48% of the participants reported self-injury in the last year. The main reasons cited for self-injury were relieving feelings of emptiness or indifference and ceasing feelings or bad feelings. Conclusion: It is important to consider the number of adolescents practicing self-injury, its predominance among the female audience, and the main function of emotional regulation to justify this behavior..

AB Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be a predecessor of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), and medication is an effective treatment option for ADHD. This study aims to examine whether adherence to medication treatment is associated with developing ODD and CD among youths with ADHD.
   Methods: A total of 33,835 youths (4 years <= age of diagnosis <= 18 years) with ADHD (ICD-9-CM code 314.X) undergoing medication treatment for at least 90 days were selected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database during the period of January 2000 through December 2009. Patients' medical records were monitored through December 31, 2011, or until they had a diagnosis of ODD or CD. We categorized participants as compliant or noncompliant on the basis of a medication possession ratio (MPR) of 50%.
   Results: The patients with better drug adherence (MPR >= 50%) exhibited a significantly decreased probability of developing ODD (53% reduction, P < .001) or CD (58% reduction, P < .001) when compared to the patients with poor drug adherence (MPR < 50%). The results in our sensitivity analyses showed that good drug adherence consistently exerted protective effects on ODD or CD, irrespective of patients' characteristics. Moreover, the patients with the best drug adherence (MPR >= 75%) had the lowest risks of developing ODD or CD.
   Conclusion: Among patients with ADHD undergoing drug therapy, a better drug adherence is associated with a lower likelihood of their developing ODD or CD in later life.

AB Objective Neural substrates of loss of control (LOC) eating are undercharacterized. We aimed to model intermittent access to food to elicit disinhibited eating in youth undergoing neuroimaging, given evidence that restricted food access may increase subsequent food intake via enhancing reward value of food and diminishing eating-related self-control. Methods Participants were 18 preadolescents (aged 9-12 years) who were overweight/obese with recent LOC eating (OW-LOC; n = 6); overweight/obese with no history of LOC eating (OW-CON; n = 5); or non-overweight with no history of LOC eating (NW-CON; n = 7). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a simulated food restriction paradigm in which they were alternately given restricted or unrestricted access to milkshake solutions. Results There were no significant main effects of restricted versus unrestricted access to milkshake flavors. Group main effects revealed increased activation for OW-LOC relative to OW-CON in areas related to attentional processes (right middle frontal gyrus), inhibitory control/attentional shifts (right and left cuneus), and emotion regulation (left cingulate gyrus); and for OW-LOC relative to NW-CON in areas related to response inhibition (right inferior frontal gyrus). Significant block type x group interaction effects were found for the right middle frontal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, and left cuneus, but these appeared to be accounted for primarily by group. Discussion There were clear group differences in neural activity in brain regions related to self-regulation during a food restriction paradigm. Elevations in these regions among OW-LOC relative to OW-CON and NW-CON, respectively, may suggest that youth with LOC eating expended more cognitive effort to regulate ingestive behavior.

AB Guided by social information processing and affective social competence models, the focal objective of this research was to examine the relations among anxious children's cognitive distortions, social skill competence, and reluctance to express emotion. In addition, we explored whether children's attention control played any meaningful role. Using a sample of 111 anxious children (M-age=9.63, SD=0.73; 75.7% girls; 56% Hispanic/Latino), we found that cognitive distortions were negatively related to social competence. In addition, tests of moderated mediation showed that the negative association between cognitive distortions and social skill competence was indirect via reluctance to express emotion, but this only was the case for anxious children with high attention control and for distortions in the academic domain. The findings of this study may set the stage for new ways to conceptualize the role of higher attention control among anxious youth.

AB BackgroundPrevious research has focused on parenting styles and parental behaviors associated with children's anxiety. Parental beliefs about their child's anxiety have scarcely been studied, in spite of their probable influence in parents seeking help. The present study intended to fil that gap, by exploring what parents think about their children's anxiety and whether these cognitions are related or not to their use of professional help.
   MethodIn-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 48 parents (50% fathers) of children (9-12years old) with anxiety problems. Theoretical thematic analysis was performed on the transcripts.
   ResultsThree dimensions were derived from the analysis, concerning (a) the causes of child's anxiety, (b) the impact of anxiety in the child's functioning, and (c) the evolution of anxiety. Most parents perceived the child's anxiety as a permanent condition, attributing it to external and parental factors and considering that the anxiety problems have a negative impact on the child's well-being. Plus, parents who had previously sought professional help for the child's emotional problems tended to believe that anxiety could improve with child's or parents' efforts and with professional guidance, contrarily to those who had not. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.
   ConclusionThe present study highlighted important parental beliefs about their children's anxiety that might influence their attitudes and decisions (e.g., seek for professional help). Other parental cognitions should be investigated in order to understand parenting in the context of childhood anxiety.

AB Supporting Carers of Children and Adolescents with Eating Disorders in Austria (SUCCEAT) is an intervention for carers of children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa. This paper describes the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial including the process and economic evaluation. Carers are randomly allocated to one of the 2 SUCCEAT intervention formats, either 8 weekly 2-hr workshop sessions (n=48) or web-based modules (n=48), and compared with a nonrandomised control group (n=48). SUCCEAT includes the cognitive-interpersonal model, cognitive behavioural elements, and motivational interviewing. The goal is to provide support for carers to improve their own well-being and to support their children. Outcome measures include carers' distress, anxiety, depression, expressed emotions, needs, motivation to change, experiences of caregiving, and skills. Further outcome measures are the patients' eating disorder symptoms, emotional problems, behavioural problems, quality of life, motivation to change, and perceived expressed emotions. These are measured before and after the intervention, and 1-year follow-up.

AB Parents and teachers provide complimentary information in the assessment of preschoolers so it is important to understand parent-teacher agreement, especially for children with autism. Parents and teachers rated an ethnically diverse sample of preschoolers with autism (N = 257; 67% Latino) on the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (LeBuffe and Naglieri in Devereux Early Childhood Assessment: User's guide, Kaplan Press, Lewisville, 1999). Correlations between parent and teacher ratings were moderate and significant for social skills (r = 0.20-0.37) but near zero for behavioral concerns. Parents rated children as having stronger social skills and fewer behavioral concerns than teachers, unlike prior research with typically developing preschoolers. Both informants rated White/other children more positively than minority children on several subscales, although agreement was similar across groups. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB Background and objectives: Despite strong support for the role of emotional relief in deliberate self-harm (DSH), no research has examined the impact of emotional distress on the strength of the DSH-relief association. Thus, it remains unclear whether the association of DSH with emotional relief is stable across emotional contexts or context-dependent. This study aimed to examine if the implicit DSH-relief association is stronger in the context of emotional distress (relative to a neutral emotional context).
   Methods: Young adult women with (n = 60) and without (n = 60) a history of recent recurrent DSH were randomly assigned to complete a novel version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) assessing the DSH-relief association at baseline (following an initial neutral emotion induction) and again following either a neutral or negative (i.e., social rejection) emotion induction.
   Results: Consistent with hypotheses, the DSH-relief association was stronger among women with recent recurrent DSH (vs. those without DSH) at baseline. Contrary to hypotheses, however, whereas the DSH-relief association remained stable following both the neutral and negative emotion inductions among participants with DSH, it became stronger across both conditions for participants without DSH.
   Limitations: The use of a community sample of young adult women may limit generalizability to other relevant populations (e.g., clinical populations, young men, adolescents). Additionally, the negative emotion induction may not have been powerful enough to affect the strength of the learned DSH-relief association among individuals with a repeated history of DSH.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the repeated use of DSH to bring about emotional relief may engender associations of DSH with relief that are relatively insensitive to emotional context.

AB Background Behavioural problems are common among children with Down syndrome (DS). Tools to detect and evaluate maladaptive behaviours have been developed for typically developing children and have been evaluated for use among children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. However, these measures have not been evaluated for use specifically in children with DS. This psychometric evaluation is important given that some clinically observed behaviours are not addressed in currently available rating scales. The current study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a commonly used screening tool developed for typically developing children and commonly used with children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
   Methods The study investigated the psychometric properties of the CBCL among school-aged children with DS, including an assessment of the rate of detecting behaviour problems, concerns with distribution, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and convergent and discriminant validity with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form. Caregivers of 88 children with DS aged 6-18 years rated their child's behaviour with the CBCL, Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form. Teachers completed the Teacher Report Form.
   Results About one-third of children with DS were reported to exhibit behaviours of clinical concern on the total score of the CBCL. Internal consistency for CBCL sub-scales was poor to excellent, and inter-rater reliability was generally acceptable. The sub-scales of the CBCL performed best when evaluating convergent validity, with variable discriminant validity. Normative data conversions controlled for age and gender differences in this sample.
   Conclusions The study findings suggest that, among children with DS, some CBCL sub-scales generally performed in a psychometrically sound and theoretically appropriate manner in relation to other measures of behaviour. Caution is warranted when interpreting specific sub-scales (Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints and Thought Problems). The CBCL can continue to be used as a screening measure when evaluating behavioural concerns among children with DS, acknowledging poor discriminant validity and the possibility that key behaviour concerns in DS may not be captured by the CBCL screen.

AB The Dysregulation Profile (DP) has emerged as a measure of concurrent affective, behavioral and cognitive dysregulation, associated with severe psychopathology, and poor adjustment. While originally developed with the Child Behavior Checklist, more recently the DP has also been defined on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), mostly with a 5-item, but also a 15-item, SDQ-DP measure. This study evaluated the SDQ-DP by examining its factor structure. measurement invariance, and construct validity. Different SDQ-DP operationalizations were compared. In a United States longitudinal community sample (N = 768). a bifactor model consisting of a general Dysregulation factor and three specific factors of Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, and Hyperactivity-Inattention fitted best, across three different developmental periods (early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence) and across three different reporters (parents, teachers, and youth). Measurement invariance across reporter, gender, and developmental period was demonstrated. These findings indicate that the SDQ-DP, like the CBCI,DP, reflects a broad syndrome of dysregulation that exists in addition to specific syndromes of emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and hyperactivity-inattention. SDQ-DP bifactor scores were strongly related with scores on the 5- and 15-item SDQ-DP measures and similarly concurrently associated with two markers of self-regulation, ego-resiliency and effortful control, and longitudinally with antisocial behavior and disciplinary measures. As reliability, validity, and stability was weaker for the SDQ-DP 5-item measure, use of all 15 items is recommended. Advantages of using a bifactor approach are discussed as well as the potential of the SDQ-DP as an easy screening measure of children at risk for developing serious psychopathology.

AB Objective: War-traumatized refugee children and adolescents have been overlooked in research on trauma-related dissociation, and whatever research has been conducted has relied almost exclusively on questionnaires. The present study was an exploration of dissociative experiences in multitraumatized war-refugee youth. Method: In this study, we used a mixed-method approach by grouping participants according to a Western-based dissociation measure (the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale; Armstrong, Putnam, Carlson, Libero. & Smith, 1997), and conducting qualitative and quantitative analyses of their verbal descriptions of mental experiences related to dissociation in the aftermath of war and resettlement. The sample included 40 refugee youth, ages 13 to 21, 19 girls and 21 boys resettled in Sweden because of war and persecution. Results: Severe trauma-related dissociation was a problem for a considerable subgroup of the sample. Some dissociative experiences were present in all the sample; others were restricted to the most dissociative group. The correlates of severe dissociation included high frequency and severity of emotional dysregulation and intensity, negative self- and body-perception, depressive mood, and experiences of detachment. Conclusion: Clinicians are urged to be aware of and assess trauma-related dissociation in war-refugee youth, and consider not only dissociative phenomena, but also other important processes such as emotional dysregulation.

AB Objectives: The aims of the present study were to investigate latent classes of sexual victimization among young adult women based on characteristics of their victimization experiences (e.g., relationship with the perpetrator, nature of act, and frequency) and examine differences in dimensions of emotion dysregulation across these classes and among nonvictims. Method: Participants were 491 women in the age range of 18-25 years from the United States; of these, 335 participants (M = 22.0, SD = 2.22) reported at least one experience of sexual victimization during their lifetime. Latent class analysis was used to identify groups of women based on characteristics of their sexual victimization experiences. Results: A 3-class solution was found to be most parsimonious. The classes were labeled as high-severity developmental revictimization (DRV; 43.3%), low-severity child/adolescent sexual abuse (CASA; 20.3%), and lowseverity adult sexual assault (ASA; 36.4%). The DRV class reported higher rates of penetrative abuse and longer duration of abuse than the CASA class, and higher rates of injury during assault than the ASA class. Further, the DRV class reported greater difficulties in 3 dimensions of emotion regulation than the ASA class and greater deficits in emotional clarity than the CASA class. Finally, the 3 latent classes reported greater difficulties in at least 4 dimensions of emotion regulation than the nonvictimized group. Conclusions: Findings of different classes of sexual victimization suggest the multidimensionality of these experiences. Results also highlight the potential utility of interventions aimed at improving emotion regulation among women with severe childhood sexual abuse.

AB The affective involvement of parents in the socialization of their children is fundamental for the proper psychological and emotional adjustment of adolescents, although we know that it is difficult to study. In this research, the relationship between parenting style and hostility was analysed in Spanish adolescents. Five-hundred and thirty-six adolescents participated in this study (53.7% males and 46.3% females), between the ages of 12 and 18 (M = 15.76, SD = 1.43), enrolled in 4 compulsory Secondary Education centers of the Castellon province. Family socialization was evaluated through the parental styles: authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian and negligent, and hostility, through the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale Criteria assessment. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with multiple regression analysis. The results showed that hostility and compound hostility are higher in adolescents from authoritarian and authoritative families than in adolescents from indulgent families. It was also observed that the Mother's Strictness/Imposition had the greatest effect on hostility, as well as a low acceptance/involvement of the father. Regarding parental styles, it was observed that mother's deprivation, physical coercion, and mother's verbal coercion were the greatest predictors of hostility. No differences were observed depending on the gender.

AB Recent data highlight maladaptive emotion regulation strategies as a transdiagnostic risk factor. Executive functioning (EF) is also conceptualized as a transdiagnostic mechanism. Drawing these two areas together, data supports the intervening role of rumination, a form of emotion regulation, in the EF clinical symptomatology link. However, research has yet to fully examine various emotion regulation strategies as transdiagnostic mechanisms in youth. The relationship between EF components, emotion regulation strategies, and transdiagnostic negative affect was examined. Set-shifting was associated with general emotion regulation difficulties as well as rumination, worry, and thought suppression. Inhibition was only related to general emotion regulation difficulties and the brooding subtype of rumination. Finally, various forms of emotion regulation were observed to mediate the relationship between set-shifting and negative affect.

AB Background: The prevalence of short stature during adolescence in Indonesia remains high. Adolescents are very concerned about their stature. Most adolescent health problems are related to psychosocial issues. The prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents in Indonesia is 6.0%, and West Java is 9.3%. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between stature and mental problems during middle adolescence.
   Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed at three high schools in Jatinangor, West Java, Indonesia. The subjects were students, age of 16-17 years old without physical abnormalities other than short stature and weight problems. Mental problems were screened using a self-report Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Data were analyzed using the chi-square test with prevalence risk.
   Results: Of the 150 respondents, 116 subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of short stature was 55 cases (47.4%) and more predominant in females. Among the behavioral and emotional problems assessed, the emotional symptom was associated significantly with short stature; prevalence ratio 1.87 (95% CI=1.14; 3.08). There was no significant association of short stature with other attributes such as conduct, hyperactivity, peer problems, and total difficulties (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: Stature in adolescence is associated with emotional problems.

AB Introduction Severe haemophilia is a rare disease characterised by spontaneous bleeding from early childhood, which may lead to various complications, especially in joints. It is nowadays possible to avoid these complications thanks to substitutive therapies for which the issue of adherence is major. The transition from adolescence to adulthood in young people with severe haemophilia is a critical period as it is associated with a high risk of lack of adherence to healthcare, which might have serious consequences on daily activities and on quality of life.
   Methods and analysis We present the protocol for a cross-sectional, observational, multicentric study to assess the differences between adolescents and young adults with severe haemophilia in France through the transition process, especially on adherence to healthcare. This study is based on a mixed methods design, with two complementary and consecutive phases, comparing data from a group of adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with those from a group of young adults (aged 20-29 years). The quantitative phase focuses on the determinants (medical, organisational, sociodemographic and social and psychosocial and behavioural factors) of adherence to healthcare (considered as a marker of the success of transition). The qualitative phase explores participants' views in more depth to explain and refine the results from the quantitative phase. Eligible patients are contacted by the various Haemophilia Treatment Centres participating in the French national registry FranceCoag.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the French Ethics Committee and by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (number: 2016-A01034-47). Study findings will be disseminated to the scientific and medical community in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings. Results will be popularised to be communicated via the French association for people with haemophilia to participants and to the general public.

AB In recent years, empirical studies have shown that the inability to tolerate distress is associated with a wide range of negative outcomes including eating addiction, drug abuse, alcohol use, and antisocial behavior in adults. However, few studies have examined family correlates of this ability in children. Also, past literature on child emotional competencies has mainly focused on documenting the linkages between mother and child and has neglected the role of fathers.
   Children (N = 54, M age = 10.15 years, SD = 1.02; 55.6% males) and their parents participated. Parents reported on their emotion regulation strategies and children reported on their depressive symptoms. Distress tolerance (DT) was assessed using the computerized distress tolerance task, the Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress. Children who were able to complete the BIRD had lower levels of depression. Analyses examining relations among father and mother emotion regulation and children's DT showed children's DT is more closely related to their mothers' than fathers' emotion regulation styles. These findings suggest that DT is an important construct in understanding children's psychopathology, but also that maternal emotion regulation is associated with children's distress tolerance.

AB The ability to regulate emotions appropriately and effectively is important in maintaining positive social interactions and outcomes. The current study investigated the association between the habitual use of suppression and reappraisal, and involvement in bullying in high school. Other social outcomes, such as current social satisfaction and support, were also considered. Two hundred and nine first-year psychology university students (mean age 19.13 years, SD = 1.523) completed online questionnaires. Results demonstrated that suppression was associated with greater retrospective reports of victimisation during high school and lower current social satisfaction and support, even when controlling for general affect. Reappraisal was mostly found to be unrelated to bullying and social outcomes, with only one association existing between higher reappraisal use and better social satisfaction, which was no longer significant when controlling for affect. The findings extend on previous research by demonstrating a negative association between suppression and involvement in bullying.

AB In the past, ADHD was defined as a specific disease that is limited to childhood and adolescence. It has been clarified for more than a decade by epidemiological studies that in more than half of those affected, ADHD persists even in adulthood. Today, ADHD has established itself as a mental illness over the lifespan. There are well-reviewed diagnostic assessments for the different age ranges, in which ADHD occurs sometimes in different symptom constellations. Similarly, pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches increasingly differentiate.

AB In light of the proliferation of recent research into social function in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a systematic review and meta-analysis is required to synthesise data and place findings within the context of a theoretical framework. This paper reviews findings from research into social function and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adults with NF1 and integrates these findings with the Socio-Cognitive Integration Abilities Model (SOCIAL). It also critically appraises links between social outcomes, internal and external factors moderating social functioning, cognitive domains implicated in social functioning, and underlying neural pathology in NF1. A systematic literature search conducted in MedLine (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and PubMed electronic databases yielded 35 papers that met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Out of these papers, 22 papers provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. Findings from this review and meta-analysis provide evidence that children and adults with NF1 exhibit significantly higher prevalence and severity of social dysfunction and ASD symptomatology. To date, very few studies have examined social cognition in NF1 but results indicate the presence of both perceptual and higher-level impairments in this population. The results of this review also provide support for age, gender, and comorbid ADHD as moderating factors for social outcomes in NF1. Suggestions for future research are offered to further our understanding of the social phenotype in NF1 and to facilitate the development of targeted interventions.

AB Whilst it is widely recognised that attachment is a fundamental aspect of psychological wellbeing, there is little research on attachment in specific psychopathological conditions, in middle childhood and early adolescence. This study seeks to evaluate the role of attachment in patients (8-15 years) with somatic symptom disorders (SSDs) and with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs). A battery of assessments was completed: Child Attachment Interview, Separation Anxiety Test, and Kerns Security Scale. Findings on "attachment models" showed an over-representation of insecure attachment patterns with a preponderance of disorganized attachment in both clinical groups. On "perceived security," SSD participants viewed their parents as safer than DBD participants, but, regarding "separation anxiety," they did not show higher separation anxiety. Therefore, a multi-assessment approach is likely to yield a more accurate picture of attachment organization at this age, and to capture attachment processes in SSDs and DBDs.

AB Purpose: The association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with negative health outcomes is well established, and the concept of allostatic load has been proposed as a possible causal mechanism. Most studies measure conventional (household) ACE exposures without accounting for non-conventional (community) ACE exposures, which may underrepresent the adversity experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. We address this gap by calculating the prevalence of both types of ACE exposures for racial/ethnic subgroups. We also examine associations of ACE exposures and emotional regulation in school aged children and youth.
   Design and Methods: This study used data (n = 65,680) for a nationally representative sample of children ages 6 to 17 years in the National Survey of Children's Health (2011-2012). Confirmatory factor analysis, descriptive statistics and regression models were used to examine the relationships between ACEs and emotional regulation.
   Results: Community level ACE events disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Some but not all ACEs were significantly and inversely associated with the ability to emotionally regulate in children. Experiencing racism had the strongest negative effect of all ACE variables. The strength of the child-caregiver relationship was associated with increased odds of emotional regulation, independent of exposure to ACEs.
   Conclusions: The study supports the need to refine and expand ACE health screenings to fully capture the adversity faced by all children. Emotional regulation is identified as a possible intervention point.
   Practice Implications: Expansion of programs that strengthen the child-caregiver relationship and reduce ACEs in early childhood may be a key approach to increasing coping abilities in youth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In a diverse community sample of mothers (N = 108) and their preschool-aged children (M-age = 3.50 years), this study conducted person-oriented analyses of maternal emotion regulation (ER) based on a multimethod assessment incorporating physiological, observational, and self-report indicators. A model-based cluster analysis was applied to five indicators of maternal ER: maternal self-report, observed negative affect in a parent-child interaction, baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and RSA suppression across two laboratory tasks. Model-based cluster analyses revealed four maternal ER profiles, including a group of mothers with average ER functioning, characterized by socioeconomic advantage and more positive parenting behavior. A dysregulated cluster demonstrated the greatest challenges with parenting and dyadic interactions. Two clusters of intermediate dysregulation were also identified. Implications for assessment and applications to parenting interventions are discussed.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects functioning of the family, decreasing interactions and loyalty and increasing conflict between adolescents with ADHD and their families. Irritable mood and difficulties with emotional dysregulation are common in children with ADHD. The objective of the current study was to assess levels of irritability in adolescents with ADHD using self- and parent-report scales, and investigate the relationship between irritability levels and parental attitudes. A total of 47 adolescents with ADHD and 39 adolescents with typical development participated in the current study. Findings demonstrated that higher levels of parent-reported irritability were associated with decreased egalitarian attitudes in the ADHD group. Although other parental attitudes were not associated with self- and parent-reported irritability, evaluation of the relationship between parental attitudes and irritability in adolescents with ADHD, which can guide diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, is of critical importance.

AB Objective: The authors report on a pilot study of an inpatient intervention for suicidal adolescents, As Safe as Possible (ASAP), supported by a smartphone app (BRITE) to reduce suicide attempts following hospital discharge.
   Method: Across two sites, 66 adolescents hospitalized for suicidal ideation (N=26) or a recent suicide attempt (N=40) were randomly assigned to the ASAP intervention program plus treatment as usual or to treatment as usual alone. ASAP, which focuses on emotion regulation and safety planning, is a 3-hour intervention delivered on the inpatient unit. The BRITE app prompted participants to rate their level of emotional distress on a daily basis and provided personalized strategies for emotion regulation and safety planning. A blind, independent evaluator assessed suicide attempts following hospital discharge and suicidal ideation at 4,12, and 24 weeks after discharge.
   Results: The ASAP intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on suicide attempt, although findings were in the hypothesized direction for occurrence of an attempt (16% compared with 31%; chi(2)=1.86, df=1, g= -0.36) and time to an attempt (hazard ratio=0.49, 95% CI=0.16, 1.47). Past history of a suicide attempt was a significant moderator of treatment outcome, with a stronger, albeit nonsignificant, effect of the ASAP intervention among participants with a history of suicide attempt (hazard ratio= 0.23, 95% CI=0.05, 1.09). There were no treatment effects on suicidal ideation. The majority of participants (70%) used the BRITE app (median usage, 19 times). Participants reported high satisfaction with both the intervention and the app.
   Conclusions: The ASAP intervention program shows promise in reducing the incidence of postdischarge suicide attempts among adolescents hospitalized for suicidality and merits further study.

AB Recent models suggest that social skills training's inefficacy for children with ADHD may be due to target misspecification, such that their social problems reflect inconsistent performance rather than knowledge/skill gaps. No study to date, however, has disentangled social skills acquisition from performance deficits in children with ADHD. Children ages 8-12 with ADHD (n = 47) and without ADHD (n = 23) were assessed using the well-validated social behavioral analysis framework to quantify cross-informant social skills acquisition deficits, performance deficits, and strengths. Results provided support for the construct and predictive validities of this Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) alternate scoring method, including expected magnitude and valence relations with BASC-2 social skills and ADHD symptoms based on both parent and teacher report. Acquisition deficits were relatively rare and idiosyncratic for both the ADHD and Non-ADHD groups, whereas children with ADHD demonstrated cross-informant social performance deficits (d = 0.82-0.99) on several specific behaviors involving attention to peer directives, emotion regulation, and social reciprocity. Relative to themselves, children with ADHD were perceived by parents and teachers as exhibiting more social strengths than social acquisition deficits; however, they demonstrated significantly fewer social strengths than the Non-ADHD group (d = -0.71 to -0.89). These findings are consistent with recent conceptualizations suggesting that social problems in ADHD primarily reflect inconsistent performance rather than a lack of social knowledge/skills. Implications for refining social skills interventions for ADHD are discussed.

AB A burgeoning literature supports the role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning as an index of physiologic sensitivity to the environment, but extant research is limited in its focus on single branches of the ANS, childhood samples, and solely negative environmental factors. This study seeks to address these limitations by exploring whether reactivity in the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems jointly moderate the prospective contributions of both positive (maternal involvement) and negative (maternal psychological control) aspects of the family environment to developmentally relevant outcomes in adolescence (depressive symptoms and emotion regulation). At Wave 1, adolescents (n = 352, 52% female, M age = 15.27, SD = 1.04; 65% White) and their parents completed a problem-solving discussion task, during which adolescent ANS activation was continuously monitored, and reports of maternal involvement, maternal psychological control, adolescent depressive symptoms, and adolescent emotion regulation were obtained. Adolescent depressive symptoms and emotion regulation were assessed again 1 year later (Wave 2). Results indicated that PNS and SNS reactivity jointly moderated the prospective contributions of maternal involvement and maternal psychological control to depressive symptoms and emotion regulation. Specifically, adolescents who exhibited reciprocal SNS activation appeared to be most sensitive to both positive and negative parenting environments. Adolescents exhibiting coinhibition or coactivation profiles of autonomic reactivity were comparatively unreactive to parenting. This study corroborates the notion that consideration of multiple physiological systems is critical to our understanding of biological processes in the development of emotional functioning in adolescence.

AB The presence of an intellectual disability may cause a child to have significant deficits in social skills and emotion regulation abilities across development. A vital next step is to find interventions that can be delivered in the school environment and across disability categories that target socioemotional factors. The current study investigated the feasibility of delivering a school-based musical theater program to students with intellectual disability across a range of school settings. A within-group repeated-measures design was used to analyze pre- and post-video recordings of the intervention program, which were coded for six domains of socioemotional ability across all participants (n = 47). Results showed that significant gains across all domains were observed. However, these gains related to school- and individual-level student factors, such as grade level, severity of disability, and baseline social skill ability.

AB The present study examined adolescents' and mothers' temperament types and their roles in the socioemotional functioning of early adolescents. A total of 869 sixth-grade students and 668 mothers participated in the study. The students rated their temperament and socioemotional functioning and the mothers rated their own temperament. Latent profile analyses identified four temperament types among the adolescents (resilient, reserved, average, and mixed) and three types among the mothers (resilient, average, and mixed). The results showed that the adolescents with resilient or reserved temperaments reported significantly fewer conduct problems and emotional symptoms, less hyperactivity, and higher prosociality than adolescents with a mixed temperament type. The most adaptive adolescent-mother temperament matches were between a resilient or reserved adolescent and a resilient or average mother; these adolescents reported the highest levels of socioemotional functioning. Mothers with mixed or average temperaments were related to fewer conduct problems and emotional symptoms and less hyperactivity among adolescents with a mixed temperament, while mothers with a resilient temperament type were beneficial for prosocial behavior among adolescents with a mixed temperament. These findings increase understanding of the role of temperament and the interplay between adolescents' and mothers' temperaments in the development of early adolescents' socioemotional adjustment.

AB Recent studies have reported contrasting results in the socio-emotional adjustment of Italian adolescents with cochlear implants (CIs). The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between the socio-emotional adjustment of adolescents with CIs, the quality of their hospital stay, and their age at CI activation. The participants were 29 adolescents with CIs (CI group) and 29 typically developing adolescents (TD group). The Emotional Autonomy Scale, the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents, and the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale were administered to each participant. The emotional experience reported during the hospital stay was considered for each participant in the CI group. The adolescents with CIs displayed significantly higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of aversion toward aloneness than the TD group participants. Adolescents who had received the CI in preschool displayed a higher level of physical self-concept than adolescents who had received it later. The adolescents' emotional experiences at the hospital were reported to be quite complex and related to their relationships with parents. In summary, the findings point to a specific type of fragility in socio-emotional adjustmentfocused on loneliness/alonenessrather than a general one.

AB Problematic Internet use (PIU) in adolescents is associated with parental mental health. However, no study investigated mechanisms which can explain this relationship. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate parental PIU, parenting dimensions and adolescent mental health as significant mediators of the relationship between parental mental health and adolescent PIU. Two-hundred-twenty-two parents (M-age = 41.36; SD = 3.05) and adolescents (M-age = 15.91; SD = .95) participated in this cross-sectional study. Results indicated significant associations between parental mental health, namely parental social anxiety symptoms and parental depressive symptoms, parental PIU, positive parenting, adolescent emotional problems and adolescent PIU. Multiple mediation analysis indicated that parental PIU, positive parenting and adolescent emotional problems were significant mediators in the relationship between parental mental health and adolescent PIU. Implications for prevention and intervention programs for PIU involving both adolescents and their parents are discussed.

AB Research has consistently supported autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning as a predictor of aggressive behavior in youth. Several studies have further examined how the functioning of the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches of the ANS interact with environmental factors to predict behavioral outcomes. One factor that has yet to be studied in this context however, is parenting practices. Given that many interventions for externalizing behavior target parenting practices, such as increasing consistent discipline, it may be particularly important to assess whether parenting practices interact with SNS and PNS functioning in the child to influence risk for aggressive behavior. Therefore, the current study addressed this question by examining inconsistent discipline as a moderator of the relationship between baseline SNS versus PNS activity and reactive versus proactive aggression. Data were collected from a sample of fourth graders identified as at-risk for aggression (N=188). Results indicated that baseline SNS activity was positively related to proactive aggression under high levels of inconsistent discipline, but negatively related to proactive aggression under very low levels of inconsistent discipline. Baseline PNS activity was negatively associated with reactive aggression under low levels of inconsistent discipline. No main effects were found for SNS or PNS functioning and either form of aggression, emphasizing the importance of taking a biosocial approach to examining the predictors of aggressive behavior in at-risk youth. Results from this study help to better understand the circumstances under which children are most likely to exhibit reactive versus proactive aggression, better informing targeted prevention and treatment.

AB BackgroundBehavioural and emotional problems are a salient concern for parents of children with neurodisability, but little is known about the nature of such concerns in this population, nor about the distribution of concern types across ostensibly different subpopulations.
   MethodsInformation about behavioural and emotional concerns was extracted from clinical reports of developmental paediatricians (N=12) who had assessed children aged 3 to 8years (N=129) through three clinics at a major developmental and rehabilitation service centre. All concerns were captured at a granular level. A two-stage, consensus-based interdisciplinary concept-sorting technique was used to identify and group thematically related behavioural and emotional concerns into First Stage Groupings, intended to preserve detail and specificity, and a reduced number of Second Stage Clusters.
   ResultsA total of 669 discrete concerns were encountered, aggregated to 58 First Stage Concern Groupings and 28 Second Stage Concern Clusters. Findings of the salience of Groupings related to Attention, Concentration and Distractibility, and Anxiousness, Shyness, and Emotional Sensitivity reflect existing literature for children with neurodevelopmental concerns. Social Isolation/Peer Engagement, Tantrums/Outbursts/Meltdowns and Volatility/Self-regulation Difficulties, and Sensory Issues emerged as areas of significant concern and salience as well. Across clinics, three Clusters recurred among the top five observed for each clinic: Tantrums/Outbursts/Meltdowns, Inflexibility/Gets Stuck or Fixated, and Social Behaviours.
   ConclusionsThis rich descriptive dataset affords insight into the phenomenology of behaviour and emotional concerns in the daily lives of parents whose children have known or suspected neurodisability. Study findings can inform and sensitize clinicians working with this population. Usefulness is enhanced by inclusion of behavioural material that is subthreshold for a formal psychopathologic diagnosis. Certain concern types are encountered commonly across different clinical subpopulations, supporting a noncategorical view of behavioural and emotional problems as functional attributes that cross neurodisability diagnostic categories.

AB Recently, cyber-victimization has become an ever increasing concern for adolescents. Given the negative consequences of cyber-victimization, it is important to understand how adolescents learn strategies to cope (i.e., "coping socialization") with cyber-victimization. The purpose of this study is to understand common coping strategies reported by adolescents, identify from whom youth learn cyber-victimization coping strategies (coaching), and explore how coaching is associated with adolescents' self-reported use of coping. In a sample of 329 adolescents (49% male; 70% white), we found that positive coping strategies (e.g., problem solving, seeking social support) are used most frequently, and adolescents' perceptions of both parent and peer coping socialization is associated with self-reported use of coping. Interventionists can use this information to adapt interventions to include influential positive socializers.

AB In order to better understand why some children retaliate when they feel provoked and others do not, the present study identified "pacifistically-oriented" children who made negative interpretations in response to unambiguous provocations, yet did not endorse revenge goals, and compared them to "revenge-seeking" children who also made negative interpretations but did endorse revenge goals. Groups were identified based on seventh graders' (N = 367; 54.77% male; 22.89% racial/ethnic minority) responses to hypothetical situations in which a peer excluded and insulted them. Comparing these groups revealed that Pacifists endorsed relationship-maintaining goals and emotion regulation goals more highly than Revenge-Seekers. Revenge-Seekers reported more anger and endorsed beliefs about negative reciprocity and aggression being legitimate more highly than Pacifists. Additionally, Revenge-Seekers were more disrespect sensitive than were Pacifists, based on a measure of vigilance for signs of disrespect and expectations that others would disrespect them. Together these findings point to social-cognitive and emotion-related processes that may inhibit revenge-seeking in unambiguous provocation situations, even when children interpret the peer's behavior quite negatively.

AB To assess prevalence and severity of emotional dysregulation (ED) in psychiatrically referred youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD youth (N = 123) were compared to youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. The majority of psychiatrically referred youth with ASD had positive Child Behavior Checklist-ED (CBCL-ED) profile that was significantly higher than in youth with ADHD (82 vs. 53%; p < 0.001). The severe emotional dysregulation (SED) profile was significantly greater in ASD youth than ADHD (44 vs. 15%; p < 0.001). In the presence of SED profile ASD youth suffered from greater severity of autism, associated psychopathology, and psychosocial dysfunction. Greater than expected prevalence of SED in psychiatrically referred youth with ASD that identifies distinct clinical correlates associated with severe morbidity and dysfunction.

AB This study examined the relationship between the dark triad personality traits and insomnia symptoms amongst a sample of the general-population. Four hundred and seventy-five individuals completed online measures of dark triad personality traits (SD3) and insomnia severity. Symptoms of insomnia were independently related to Machiavellianism and psychopathy, but not narcissism in univariate analyses. Moreover, linear regression analysis determined that psychopathy and sex, but not Machiavellianism, significantly predicted insomnia symptoms. These outcomes contribute to the limited research examining the dark triad personality traits in relation to symptoms of insomnia. The disturbed sleep presented amongst those high in psychopathy may be due to deficits in emotion regulation which serve to accentuate maintaining factors of insomnia (i.e. negatively toned cognitive activity).

TI Peer victimization and substance use: Understanding the indirect effect

AB Objective: Peer victimization in school is common, with emerging literature suggesting that it may also increase risk for substance abuse. Yet, little is known about the underlying mechanisms within this risk pathway. The objective of this study is to use a prospective 3-wave design to examine the mediating role of depressive symptomatology on the relationship between peer victimization and substance use, as well as examine if the pathway varies based on gender.
   Method: 801 youth between 6th and 12th grade completed surveys across three years, which included measures on school peer victimization, depression symptomatology and substance use. Models tested the mediational pathway between victimization, depressive symptoms, and substance use. Models were stratified by gender.
   Results: Controlling for grade and the effect of each variable across waves, a significant indirect effect of peer victimization on substance use through depressive symptoms was found for females, with a non-significant indirect effect for males.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that female youth who are victimized by peers engage in substance use behaviors, at least in part, due to increases in depressive symptoms. Given its effect on depression, female victims may therefore benefit from coping skills training that targets emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills in order to combat increased risk for substance use behaviors as a coping response to their victimization. Further research is warranted to better understand the risk pathway for male youth who also experience peer victimization.

AB Substantial research has found that positive parent-adolescent relationship is associated with low levels of adolescent Internet addiction (IA). However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation. The present study examined a moderated mediation model that included the parent adolescent relationship (predictor variable), emotion regulation ability (mediator), stressful life events (moderator), and IA (outcome variable) simultaneously. A total of 998 (M-age = 15.15 years, SD = 1.57) Chinese adolescents completed the Parent-Adolescent Relationship Scale, Emotion Regulation Ability Scale, Adolescent Stressful Life Events Scale, and Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire. After controlling for adolescent gender, age, and family socioeconomic status, results revealed that good parent-adolescent relationship was positively associated with adolescent emotion regulation ability, which in turn was negatively associated with their IA. Moreover, stressful life events moderated the second part of the mediation process. In accordance with the reverse stress-buffering model, the relation between emotion regulation ability and adolescent IA was stronger for adolescents who experienced lower levels of stressful life events. The findings and their implications are discussed and a resilient contextual perspective proposed.

AB The neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lamotrigine in bipolar depression are still unexplored. This preliminary study compares the effects of a 12-week treatment with lamotrigine on brain volumes in adults with bipolar disorder (BD). 12 BD type II patients (age: 49.33 +/- 9.95 years, 3 males, 9 females) and 12 age and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) (HC; age: 41 +/- 8.60 years, 3 males, 9 females). BD patients were initially administered 25 mg/day of lamotrigine, which was progressively escalated to 200 mg/d. BD participants underwent brain imaging prior to and following lamotrigine treatment. A 50% reduction in depressive scores indicated "remission". Bayesian general linear models controlled for age, gender and intracranial volume were used to examine changes in relevant brain region following treatment. A posterior probability > 0.90 indicated evidence that there was an effect of diagnosis or remission on brain volumes.
   Probability distributions of interaction effects between remission and time indicated that BD responders displayed decreased amygdala, cerebellum and nucleus accumbens volumes following lamotrigine treatment. No serious adverse side effects were reported. The antidepressant effects of lamotrigine may be linked to volumetric changes in brain regions involved in mood and emotional regulation. These findings are preliminary and replication in a larger sample is warranted.

AB Recent research suggests that early difficulties with emotion regulation go along with an increased risk for developing psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders for example. Adolescent anxiety is often referred to as a gateway disorder, due to its high predictability for lifelong persistent mental health problems. It has been shown that clinically anxious adolescents exhibit attention biases toward negative stimuli, yet whether these biases can also be found in the subclinical range of subclinically anxious adolescents is currently unclear. In this study, we set out to investigate this question by combining an emotional Go-Nogo task with eye-tracking techniques to assess attention biases for emotional faces in a subclinical sample of 23 subclinically anxious adolescent girls. This combined approach allowed us to look at both, behavioral and covert attention biases. Using both traditional and Bayesian hypothesis testing, we found no evidence for a bias toward negative, threat-relevant stimuli in the behavioral level or eye-tracking data. We believe that the results can help close a gap in the current literature by showing that like low-anxious adolescents, subclinically anxious adolescents do not exhibit attention biases when viewing de-contextualized emotional stimuli in the Overlap task. Together with previous research findings in clinically anxious participants which have reported high levels of attention biases, our results seem to suggest that attention biases do no increase linearly as a function of individual anxiety level. Future research is now needed to explore the contribution of additional factors, such as depression for example.

AB Parental bonding and emotional regulation, while important to explain difficulties that may arise in child development, have mainly been studied at an individual level. The present study aims to examine alexithymia and parental bonding in families of adolescents with psychiatric disorders through different generations. The sample included a total of 102 adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders and their parents. In order to take a family level approach, a Latent Class Analysis was used to identify the latent relationships among alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), perceived parental bonding (Parental Bonding Instrument) and the presence of adolescent internalizing or externalizing psychiatric symptoms (Youth Self-Report). Families of internalizing and externalizing adolescents present different and specific patterns of emotional regulation and parenting. High levels of adolescent alexithymia, along with a neglectful parenting style perceived by the adolescent and the father as well, characterized the families of patients with internalizing symptoms. On the other hand, in the families with externalizing adolescents, it was mainly the mother to remember an affectionless control parental style. These results suggest the existence of an intergenerational transmission of specific parental bonding, which may influence the emotional regulation and therefore the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between parental psychological control (PPC) as perceived by adolescents, emotion inhibition, emotion regulation, and depression in adolescents using a structural equation model. The participants were 316 middle school students in metropolitan areas of South Korea who completed the Domain-Specific Assessment of Psychological Control (DAPC), Children's Sadness Management Scale (CSMS) and Children's Anger Management Scale (CAMS), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, structural model verification, and bootstrap analysis. The results of this study indicated that PPC had a direct effect on depression. In addition, PPC had a significant effect on the emotion inhibition of dysfunctional emotion regulation, and emotion inhibition significantly affected depression. Therefore, emotion inhibition had a mediating effect between PPC and depression. Finally, this study's implications and limitations are presented.

AB IMPORTANCE Rapid growth and elevated weight status in early childhood increase risk for later obesity, but interventions that improve growth trajectories are lacking.
   OBJECTIVE To examine effects of a responsive parenting intervention designed to promote developmentally appropriate, prompt, and contingent responses to a child's needs on weight outcomes at 3 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A single-center randomized clinical trial comparing a responsive parenting intervention designed to prevent childhood obesity vs a home safety intervention (control) among 279 primiparous mother-child dyads (responsive parenting group, 140; control group, 139) who enrolled and completed the first home visit from January 2012 through March 2014 with follow-up to age 3 years (completed by April 2017).
   INTERVENTIONS Research nurses conducted 4 home visits during infancy and annual research center visits. The responsive parenting curriculum focused on feeding, sleep, interactive play, and emotion regulation. The control curriculum focused on safety.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) z score at 3 years (z score of 0 represents the population mean; 1 and -1 represent 1 SD above and below the mean, respectively). BMI percentile at 3 years was designated previously as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of overweight (BMI >= 85th percentile and < 95th percentile) and obesity (BMI >= 95th percentile) at 3 years.
   RESULTS Among 291 mother-child dyads randomized, 279 received the first home visit and were included in the primary analysis. 232 mother-child dyads (83.2%) completed the 3-year trial. Mean age of the mothers was 28.7 years; 86% were white and 86% were privately insured. At age 3 years, children in the responsive parenting group had a lower mean BMI z score (-0.13 in the responsive parenting group vs 0.15 in the control group; absolute difference, -0.28 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.01]; P = .04). Mean BMI percentiles did not differ significantly (47th in the responsive parenting group vs 54th in the control group; reduction in mean BMI percentiles of 6.9 percentile points [95% CI, -14.5 to 0.6]; P = .07). Of 116 children in the responsive parenting group, 13 (11.2%) were overweight vs 23 (19.8%) of 116 children in the control group (absolute difference, -8.6%[95% CI, -17.9% to 0.0%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.25 to 1.06]; P = .07); 3 children (2.6%) in the responsive parenting group were obese vs 9 children (7.8%) in the control group (absolute difference, -5.2%[95% CI, -10.8% to 0.0%]; OR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.08 to 1.20]; P = .09).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among primiparous mother-child dyads, a responsive parenting intervention initiated in early infancy compared with a control intervention resulted in a modest reduction in BMI z scores at age 3 years, but no significant difference in BMI percentile. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effect of the intervention and assess its efficacy in other settings.

AB Scientific research on leisure has proven its contribution to physical and psychological well-being in adolescents, especially regarding the practice of structured leisure activities. Leisure is considered a privileged context for adolescents to develop and learn several developmental skills, such as emotion regulation (ER). Nevertheless, the relationship between leisure and ER has been under-researched in adolescents. The present cross-sectional study aims to test a conceptual model concerning the relationship of leisure attitudes and leisure satisfaction with adolescents' positive functioning and to explore the role of emotion self-regulation strategies in that relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that leisure attitudes would be a predictor of leisure satisfaction; leisure satisfaction would be a predictor of positive functioning dimensions (self-esteem; satisfaction with life; psychological well-being); and the relationship between leisure satisfaction and positive functioning dimensions would be mediated by emotion self-regulation strategies [cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES)]. The participants in this study were 654 adolescents from 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, aged between 14 and 19 years old. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. The structural equation analysis showed that leisure attitudes are a significant predictor of leisure satisfaction, and that leisure satisfaction significantly predicts all positive functioning dimensions. CR mediated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and self-esteem. These findings highlight the importance of developing positive attitudes toward leisure to increase adolescents' levels of leisure satisfaction. This study also supports the importance of leisure satisfaction for achieving adolescents' positive functioning. Future studies should continue to examine the role of emotion self-regulation strategies on leisure, especially regarding CR.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of adolescent sleep disturbances and their relation to psychosocial difficulties and health risk behaviors with the use of data from a province-wide health survey (n = 16,781).
   METHODS: Psychosocial difficulties were measured with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Additional assessments included self-reported sleep disturbances, suicidality, and health risk behaviors including current use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, physical inactivity, and compulsive use of multimedia. We used multilevel analyses to investigate the relationhips, including differences, between boys and girls, as well as the mediating role of emotional problems.
   RESULTS: Just under 20% of adolescents reported sleep disturbances in the previous month. These sleep disturbances were associated with psychosocial problems (odds ratio [OR], 6.42; P < .001), suicidality (OR, 3.90 1.14; P < .001), and all health risk behaviors (OR, 1.62-2.66; P < .001), but not with physical inactivity. We found moderation by gender for the relations between sleep and suicide attempts (OR, 0.38; P < .002) and between sleep and cannabis use (OR, 0.52; P = .002), indicating attenuated relationships in girls compared with boys. Emotional problems partially mediated the relationships between sleep disturbances and multimedia use.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study reiterates the high prevalence of sleep disturbances during adolescence. These sleep disturbances were strongly related to psychosocial problems and a wide range of health risk behaviors. Although the direction of causality cannot be inferred, this study emphasizes the need for awareness of impaired sleep in adolescents. Moreover, the gender differences in associated suicide attempts and cannabis use call for further research into tailored intervention strategies.

AB This study examined the association between peer-reported bullying-related behaviours (bully, victim, outsider and defender), age, gender, autism severity and teacher-rated emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, using a multi-informant approach. The sample comprised 120 adolescents (11% girls, M-age=15.6years, standard deviation=1.89years) attending a special school for children with autism. Results show that bullying decreased with age and was associated with behavioural problems, while victimisation was only associated with peer problems - a pattern of results comparable to studies exploring these associations in typically developing children. However, there were few associations among study variables for outsider or defender behaviours in this sample. Notably, children's autism severity did not significantly predict bullying-related behaviours.

AB Objective: Examine stress levels of parents of children with hemifacial microsomia (HFM) and the relationship of parental stress to child characteristics and cognitive coping strategies.
   Design: Prospective cross-sectional study.
   Participants and Setting: Parents with a child (age 3-19 years) with HFM (N - 31) were recruited through the Department of Orthodontics and the Craniofacial Center, Sophia-Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
   Intervention and Outcome Measures: The adapted and shortened Dutch version of the parental stress index (NOSI-K) was used to measure parental stress, and the cognitive emotion-regulation questionnaire was used to measure cognitive coping strategies. Pearson correlations and a multiple regression analysis were performed.
   Results: The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed associations between increased parental stress and learning difficulties and use of acceptance as a coping strategy. This suggests that problems other than the characteristic visual appearance of the child's face in HFM have a greater influence on parental stress.
   Conclusions: Learning difficulties of the child with HFM and parental acceptance affect stress in parents with a child with HFM the most and are important in the search for a targeted tailoring of intervention for parents with high levels of parental stress.

ID REENTRY PROGRAM; SELF-CONTROL; FAITH; CRIME; PERSPECTIVE; LOVE
AB BackgroundReligious beliefs and practices have been shown to have some association with desistance from offending, as have cognitive processes, including emotion regulation, self-control, reasoning, learning, and empathy. Religious behaviours may, however, be moderated or mediated by cognitive abilities, but few studies take this into account.
   AimThe aim of this study was to assess the role of cognitive ability in any relationship between religious beliefs and behaviours and desistance from substance use among adolescents.
   MethodData were extracted from the Pathways to Desistance Study dataset (n=1,354). Religious measures were self-rated importance of religion, helpfulness of religion in dealing with problems, and attendance at religious services. Cognitive measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Trail Making Tests. A count of numbers of mind-altering substances used constituted the main substance measure. Control variables included sex, age, and age of onset of offending.
   ResultsMixed-effects longitudinal analyses revealed that religious behaviours did constitute a significant predictor of lower substance use for young people after a criminal conviction, after controlling for changes in employment, social support, and delinquent peer association, but only among those with average or above cognitive function.
   ConclusionsThese findings may explain why there have been some discrepancies in previous studies of religion and substance misuse. They may also have important implications for the training of anyone delivering programmes to young people in prison that have faith-based elements, including community faith group leaders and volunteers.

AB Children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often show comorbid emotional and behavior problems. The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the relation between emotion control (i.e., negative emotionality, emotion awareness, and worry/rumination) and the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Boys with and without ASD (N = 157; age 9-15) were followed over a period of 1.5 years (3 waves). We found that baseline levels of worry/rumination was a specific predictor of later externalizing problems for boys with ASD. Furthermore, the developmental trajectory of worry/rumination predicted the development of internalizing and externalizing problems in both groups. Our findings suggest that worry/rumination may constitute a transdiagnostic factor underlying both internalizing and externalizing problems in boys with and without ASD.

AB This study contributes to the limited knowledge on the association between community income inequality and adolescent emotional problems, and explores whether these associations are contingent on national income inequality and personal deprivation. We obtained multilevel data from 10,223 adolescents (aged 15-16 years) nested within 82 communities in Iceland, at two time points: (a) in 2006 when income inequality was high and (b) in 2014 when income inequality had decreased. The associations are contingent on time period. Community income inequality was related to (a) an increase in anxiety in 2006 (b=0.337, p 0.05), but not in 2014, and (b) a decrease in depression in 2014 (-0.958, p 0.05), but not in 2006. In 2006, community income inequality was more harmful to adolescents in deprived households. The results support the notion that the detrimental link between income inequality and adolescents' emotional problems may be shaped by the level of income inequality in the larger societal context.

AB As humans, we have a unique capacity to reflect on our experiences, including emotions. Over time, we develop beliefs about the nature of emotions, and these beliefs are consequential, guiding how we respond to emotions and how we feel as a consequence. One fundamental belief concerns the controllability of emotions: Believing emotions are uncontrollable (entity beliefs) should reduce the likelihood of trying to control emotional experiences using effective regulation strategies like reappraisal; this, in turn, could negatively affect core indices of psychological health, including depressive symptoms. This model holds particular relevance during youth, when emotion-related beliefs first develop and stabilize and when maladaptive beliefs could contribute to emerging risk for depression. In the present investigation, a pilot diary study (N = 223, aged 21-60) demonstrated that entity beliefs were associated with using reappraisal less in everyday life, even when controlling for possible confounds (i.e., self-efficacy, pessimism, stress exposure, stress reactivity). Then, two studies examined whether entity beliefs and associated impairments in reappraisal may set youths on a maladaptive trajectory: In a cross-sectional study (N = 136, aged 14-18), youths with stronger entity beliefs experienced greater depressive symptoms, and this link was mediated by lower reappraisal. This pattern was replicated and extended in a longitudinal study (N = 227, aged 10-18), wherein youth-and parent-reported depressive symptoms were assessed 18 months after assessing beliefs. These results suggest that entity beliefs about emotion constitute a risk factor for depression that acts via reappraisal, adding to the growing literature on emotion beliefs and their consequences for self-regulation and health.

AB Researchers have demonstrated mixed associations between acculturative stress and prosocial behaviors (actions intended to benefit others) among Latino/a adolescents and emerging adults. The current study aimed to examine the relations between acculturative stress and Latino/a young adults' prosocial behaviors via familism values and emotion reappraisal. Participants were 1,527 Latino/a college students (M-age = 20.35 years, SD = 3.88; 75.2% women) from universities across the United States. The results demonstrated direct and indirect links between acculturative stress and prosocial behaviors. Specifically, acculturative stress was positively related to familism values, which in turn were positively associated with multiple forms of prosocial behaviors. Additionally, emotion reappraisal was positively associated with specific forms of prosocial behaviors. There was also evidence that familism and emotion reappraisals moderated the associations between acculturative stress and specific forms of prosocial behaviors. Discussion focuses on the interplay of culture-related and emotion-regulation processes associated with Latino/a young adults' positive social outcomes.

AB Purpose: Victimization is a common problem for many children but is exacerbated for children with a developmental language disorder (DLD). However, the severity of communication problems does not explain their victimization rates. In children without DLD, difficulties with emotional competence are a risk factor for victimization and also increase the risk of bullying. In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which the level and development of emotional competence (understanding of one's own emotions and levels of anger, sadness, and fear) contributed to the prediction of victimization and bullying in children with and without DLD, over and above the type and severity of communication problems of children with DLD.
   Method: Clinically referred youngsters (8-16 years old) with (n = 112; 48% girls, 52% boys) and without (n = 233; 58% girls, 42% boys) DLD completed self-reports 3 times over an 18-month period. Parents of children with DLD reported on their children's communication problems.
   Results: Participants with DLD reported more victimization but comparable levels of bullying behavior compared with peers without DLD. Higher levels of sadness and fear were risk factors for more victimization in both groups. Better understanding of one's own emotions had a larger effect on less victimization in children with DLD, independent of their communication problems. In addition, increased levels of anger and lower levels of understanding of one's own emotions explained more bullying in both groups.
   Conclusion: Outcomes indicate that secondary difficulties in emotional competence in children with DLD make these children more vulnerable to victimization and warrant specific support and interventions.

AB Civic developmental theory anticipates connections between normative developmental competencies and civic engagement, but little previous research has directly studied such links. The current study sought to contribute to civic development theory by examining associations between emotional and sociocognitive competencies (empathy, emotion regulation, prosocial moral reasoning, future-orientation) and civic engagement (volunteering, informal helping, political behaviors and beliefs, environmental behaviors, social responsibility values, civic skills). Data came from a geographically and racially diverse sample of 2467 youth (M (age) = 13.4, Range: 8-20 years, 56% female). The results indicated that empathy and future-orientation significantly predicted nearly all forms of civic engagement, whereas emotion regulation and prosocial moral reasoning were uniquely associated with specific forms of civic engagement. Exploratory multi-group models indicated that empathy and emotion regulation were more strongly associated with civic engagement among younger youth and prosocial moral reasoning and future-orientation were more strongly related to civic engagement among older youth. The findings help to advance developmental theory of youth civic engagement.

AB Longitudinal studies examining the role of response styles to positive affect (i.e., dampening and enhancing) for depressive symptoms have yielded inconsistent results. We examined concurrent and prospective relations of dampening and enhancing with depressive and anhedonic symptoms, and whether these relations depend on the frequency of uplifts. Early adolescents (N = 674, 51.6% girls, M (age) = 12.7 years, range 11.3-14.9) completed questionnaires three times (one-year intervals). Dampening interacted with daily uplifts predicting concurrent depressive symptoms. Dampening was unrelated to depressive and anhedonic symptoms one year later. High dampening and low enhancing predicted relative increases in anhedonia over two years. Relationships did not differ for girls and boys. Therapeutic interventions designed to promote adaptive responding to positive affect may, thus, reduce anhedonia in adolescence.

AB There is some evidence that mindful parenting, a parenting approach that involves the practice of bringing mindful awareness to the parent-child relationship, is associated with several positive psychosocial outcomes in adolescents. However, only a few studies have investigated the mechanisms that may underlie that association. This study explores whether the link between mindful parenting and adolescents' well-being is mediated by adolescents' attachment representations, self-compassion and mindfulness skills. The sample comprised 563 parent-child dyads (95.6% mothers). Adolescents (61.5% girls) had a mean age of 14.26 years (SD = 1.66, range = 12-20). Parents completed a measure of mindful parenting, and adolescents completed measures of attachment representations, self-compassion, mindfulness, and well-being. Mindful parenting was indirectly associated with adolescents' self-compassion and mindfulness through a more secure perception of the relationship with the parents, and was indirectly associated with adolescents' well-being through perceived attachment security, self-compassion and mindfulness. The path model was invariant across stages of adolescence but some relations in the model varied across gender. Self-compassion and mindfulness seem to develop within a parent-child relationship characterized by affection, self-regulation, and mindful awareness. These two resources, along with mindful parenting and positive representations of the parent-child relationship, are associated with adolescents' well-being.

AB CONTEXT: A large number of studies have shown a relationship between language disorders and problem behaviors; however, methodological differences have made it difficult to draw conclusions from this literature. OBJECTIVE: To determine the overall impact of language disorders on problem behaviors in children and adolescents between the ages of birth and 18 years and to investigate the role of informant type, age, and type of problem behavior on this relationship.
   DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, EBSCO, and ProQuest.
   STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included when a group of children with language disorders was compared with a group of typically developing children by using at least 1 measure of problem behavior.
   DATA EXTRACTION: Effect sizes were derived from all included measures of problem behaviors from each study.
   RESULTS: We included 47 articles (63 153 participants). Meta-analysis of these studies revealed a difference in ratings of problem behaviors between children with language disorders and typically developing children of moderate size (g = 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.53; P < .001). Age was entered as a moderator variable, and results showed that the difference in problem behavior ratings increases with child age (increase in g for each additional year in age = 0.06; 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.11; P = .004).
   LIMITATIONS: There was considerable heterogeneity in the measures of problem behaviors used across studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children with language disorders display greater rates of problem behaviors compared with their typically developing peers, and this difference is more pronounced in older children.

AB BackgroundLocus of control (LOC) represents individuals' beliefs about how much control they have over outcomes in their life. Previous research has found an association between external LOC and psychopathology. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by mood instability, identity disturbance and difficulties in impulse control.
   AimsThe aims of this study are to evaluate the relationship between BPD features and LOC in a non-clinical sample and to assess whether external LOC is associated with BPD features after controlling for symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   MethodsIn a cross-sectional study of 328 university students, we assessed LOC, BPD features, depression and anxiety, as well as difficulties in emotion regulation and cognitive emotion regulation as potential mediators.
   ResultsWe found an association between external LOC and BPD features after controlling for symptoms of depression, anxiety and demographic covariates. Assessing for indirect effects through potential mediators, we found that difficulties in emotion regulation, but not cognitive emotion regulation, partially mediated the relationship between external LOC and BPD features.
   ConclusionsFindings provide support for a unique association between external LOC and BPD features and suggest a role for external LOC in related emotion regulation problems. Future investigations using experimental designs should examine potential causal associations and the effect of changing LOC on emotion regulation and features of BPD.

AB During middle adolescence, elevated stress and a greater presence of psychological disorders have been documented. The research has paid little attention to the regulation of positive affective states. Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory suggests that cultivating positive emotions helps to build resources that boost well-being. The current research aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between responses to positive affect (emotion-focused positive rumination, self-focused positive rumination, and dampening) and psychological adjustment (self-esteem and life satisfaction) during middle adolescence. A longitudinal study with two waves separated by one year was conducted, assessing 977 adolescents (M = 13.81, SD = 0.79; 51.5% boys) with self-report measures. A cross-lagged panel analysis was performed by including within the same model the relationships between all of the variables in the two assessment points. The results indicated cross-lagged positive relationships of self-focused positive rumination with both self-esteem and life satisfaction, while dampening showed a negative cross-lagged relationship with self-esteem. Moreover, higher self-esteem predicted more emotion-focused positive rumination, and more dampening predicted lower life satisfaction. Thus, the use of adaptive responses to positive affect and a better psychological adjustment were found to be prospectively interrelated at the one-year follow-up during middle adolescence. The discussion argues for the need to implement programmes to promote more adaptive responses to positive affect to enhance psychological adjustment in the adolescent transition to adulthood.

AB In this study, we considered the impact of mothers' willingness to disclose about distressing events and rule transgressions on their adolescent children's willingness to disclose about similar events, as well as adolescents' ability to cope and to show concern for others. Mothers and their 12- to 14-year-old children (N=125) were asked to say how likely they would be to talk about moderately distressing concerns as well as minor rule transgressions. Adolescent positive coping skills were also assessed. Teachers (N=92) rated the adolescents' prosocial behaviors in the classroom. Adolescents' disclosure about distressing events and positive coping mediated the relation between maternal disclosure about distressing events and adolescent prosocial behavior. Further, maternal disclosure alone about both distressing events and rule transgressions was related to adolescent prosocial behavior through positive coping. These results suggest that mothers' willingness to talk about their own negative experiences can help children cope better and, ultimately, to show greater empathy and concern for others.

AB Whilst recent discussions of anorexia nervosa have recognised key aspects of the illness experience, such as control and emotion regulation, there remains a cross-disciplinary emphasis on body image concerns as central. In dialogue with clinical, psychological and social analyses, this paper draws on ethnography and qualitative interviews with individuals diagnosed with anorexia to offer an alternative perspective. Focusing on individuals' engagements with food and (not) eating suggests that material moments of starving, calorie counting, and thinking about food provide a critical lens onto what anorexia does for, as well as to, individuals living with the illness. Participants' narratives suggest that anorexia can make it possible to retreat into a numb and protective 'bubble.' The illness may thereby offer a way to be in the world that both responds to and ameliorates distress; some individuals describe the ambivalent 'safety' of living through their anorexia. As such, food practices are a modality of holding onto anorexia's valued safety. By outlining this relationship between practices of (not) eating and a desire amongst some individuals to maintain the illness, this paper contributes to discussions of treatment resistance. Intersecting with wider reflections on trauma, recovery and harm minimisation in mental health, the discussion considers how this desire might be approached ethically in both research and therapeutic practice. Individuals' narratives suggest the need to reposition attention away from anorexia itself to the distress and traumatic life events that may underlie both the illness and the desire to maintain it.

AB By definition, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires exposure to a traumatic event. Yet, the DSM diagnostic requirements for children and adolescents for PTSD may fail to capture traumatized youth with significant distress and functional impairment. Many important studies have utilized PTSD diagnosis as a mechanism for grouping individuals for comparative studies examining brain functioning, neuroendocrinology, genetics, attachment, and cognition; however, focusing only on those with the diagnosis of PTSD can miss the spectrum of symptoms and difficulties that impact children who experience trauma and subsequent impairment. Some studying child trauma have focused on examining brain and biology of those with exposure and potential impairment rather than only those with PTSD. This line of inquiry, complementary to PTSD specific studies, has aided our understanding of some of the changes in brain structure and neuroregulatory systems at different developmental periods following traumatic exposure. Application of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework proposed by NIMH to the study of child trauma exposure and subsequent impairment is an opportunity to examine domains of function and how they are impacted by trauma. Research to date has focused largely in the areas of negative valence, regulatory, and cognitive systems, however those studying complex or developmental trauma have identified an array of domains that are impacted which map onto many of the RDoC categories. This paper will review the relevant literature associated with child trauma as it relates to the RDoC domains, outline areas of needed research, and describe their implications for treatment and the advancement of the field.

AB Introduction: Discovering and promoting ways that improve adolescents' psychological fitness has been a recurrent concern in the field of health and psychology. Adolescence, as a period of transition, is highly prone to have mental health risks and unhealthy behaviour patterns. Thus, it is the right time to promote healthy practices to prevent problems of health and behaviour in adulthood. As Yoga provides practical solutions for mental health, we anticipated that exposure to it should improve psychological fitness among adolescents.
   Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of short term residential yoga intervention on psychological constructs in adolescents.
   Materials and Methods: A pre, post-yoga interventional study was carried out in a 10 day residential camp. Three independent cohorts of adolescents from India, in three batches (1, 2 and 3), with sample size of 148 (87 boys and 61 girls), 167 (122 boys and 45 girls) and 195 (121 boys and 74 girls), respectively were examined. A holistic integrated yoga module with eight hours of yoga sessions per day was given as an intervention. Emotional Intelligence (EI), emotional regulation strategies, Clinical anger and self-concept parameters were studied using psychometric scales like Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-short), Clinical Anger Scale (CAS) and Self-concept Scale respectively. Authorised scales and software were used for assessments and analyses.
   Results: Significant (p<0.05) improvements in EI, emotional regulation and anger management were observed in all the three batches. However, no significant improvement was found in self-concept in either of the cohorts. The observation of the results of assessed outcome measures in all the three batches confirms the positive effect of Yoga intervention on psychological fitness. The pattern of changes was consistent across all three batches.
   Conclusion: Residential Yoga camp improves the psychological fitness among adolescents. Even short term courses are effective and induce positive behavioural signatures.

AB Depression is associated with negative attention and attribution biases and maladaptive emotion responsivity and regulation, which adversely impact self-evaluations and interpersonal relationships. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural substrates of these impairments. We compared neural activity recruited by 126 clinically depressed and healthy adolescents (ages 11-17 years) during social exclusion (Exclusion > Inclusion) using Cyberball. Results revealed significant interaction effects within left anterior insula (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Insula hyperresponsivity was associated with peer exclusion for depressed adolescents but peer inclusion for healthy adolescents. In additional, healthy adolescents recruited greater lateral temporal activity during peer exclusion. Complementary effect size analyses within independent parcellations offered converging evidence, as well as highlighted medium-to-large effects within subgenual/ventral anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal and lateral parietal regions implicated in emotion regulation. Depressogenic neural patterns were associated with negative self-perceptions and negative information processing biases. These findings suggest a neural mechanism underlying cognitive biases in depression, as reflected by emotional hyperresponsivity and maladaptive regulation/reappraisal of negative social evaluative information. This study lends further support for salience and central executive network dysfunction underlying social threat processing, and in particular, highlights the anterior insula as a key region of disturbance in adolescent depression.

AB This paper addresses to what extent experiencing violence in the Palestinian Arab family in Israel is a predictor for elements of aggressive behavior, and to what extent is it influenced by skills of self-control, social support, religiosity and well-being as mediators of aggressive behavior. One hundred and sixty Arab adolescents (42.3% male and 57.7% female) Grades 9-12 were sampled in a convenient sampling (none random sampling method) from Palestinian Arab family in Israel.
   Significant positive correlation was found between experiencing violence in the family and aggression (r = 0,30, p < 0.01), with significant negative correlation between self-control skills and aggression (r = -0.626, p < 0.01), religiosity and aggression(r = -0.647, p < 0.01), social support and aggression (r = -0.59, p < 0.01), and no significant correlation between well-being and aggression (r = -012, p > 0.05). Social support, self-control and religiosity each alone, fully mediated the relationship between violence in the family and aggression.
   These findings constitute a theoretical contribution to knowledge gained with respect to aggression among adolescents and students. In addition, the findings could make a practical contribution through development of training programs on the use of mediating skills.

AB Purpose of review
   This review summarizes the recent literature examining nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents, with a particular focus on how primary care pediatricians (PCPs) might assess and intervene as a common first point of contact. This NSSI review is timely and relevant, given the prevalence rates among adolescents, as well as its link to suicidal behaviors.
   Recent findings
   NSSI is most prevalent among adolescents, with lifetime prevalence rates between 17 and 60%. With evidence that the most common age of onset is between 12 and 14 years, evaluating NSSI is a challenging yet necessary aspect of a comprehensive adolescent medical examination. The function of NSSI behaviors may have implications for effective treatment and should be included in assessment. The majority of research has indicated that NSSI serves an emotion regulation function, in that the behavior results in a decrease in intensity of adverse emotional states in the absence of more effective coping strategies.
   Summary
   Considering the prevalence of self-injury among adolescents, the likelihood that PCPs will encounter NSSI in their practice is quite high. Given that more than 50% of youth do not receive needed mental health services, it is critical that PCPs assess for NSSI and intervene accordingly.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-old individuals in the United States; evidence on effective treatment for adolescents who engage in suicidal and self-harm behaviors is limited.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) compared with individual and group supportive therapy (IGST) for reducing suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and overall self-harm among high-risk youths.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1, 2012, through August 31, 2014, at 4 academic medical centers. A total of 173 participants (pool of 195; 22 withdrew or were excluded) 12 to 18 years of age with a prior lifetime suicide attempt (>= 3 prior self-harm episodes, suicidal ideation, or emotional dysregulation) were studied. Adaptive randomization balanced participants across conditions within sites based on age, number of prior suicide attempts, and psychotropic medication use. Participants were followed up for 1 year.
   INTERVENTIONS Study participants were randomly assigned to DBT or IGST. Treatment duration was 6 months. Both groups had weekly individual and group psychotherapy, therapist consultation meetings, and parent contact as needed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A priori planned outcomes were suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and total self-harm assessed using the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview.
   RESULTS A total of 173 adolescents (163 [94.8%] female and 97 [56.4%] white; mean [SD] age, 14.89 [1.47] years) were studied. Significant advantages were found for DBT on all primary outcomes after treatment: suicide attempts (65 [90.3%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 51 [78.9%] of 65 receiving IGST with no suicide attempts; odds ratio [OR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.91), nonsuicidal self-injury (41 [56.9%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 26 [40.0%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-injury; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.70), and self-harm (39 [54.2%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 24 [36.9%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-harm; OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78). Rates of self-harm decreased through 1-year follow-up. The advantage of DBT decreased, with no statistically significant between-group differences from 6 to 12 months (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.12-3.36; P=.61). Treatment completion rates were higher for DBT (75.6%) than for IGST (55.2%), but pattern-mixture models indicated that this difference did not informatively affect outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this trial support the efficacy of DBT for reducing self-harm and suicide attempts in highly suicidal self-harming adolescents. On the basis of the criteria of 2 independent trials supporting efficacy, results support DBT as the first well-established, empirically supported treatment for decreasing repeated suicide attempts and self-harm in youths.

AB Second Step is a universal social-emotional learning program designed to decrease antisocial behaviors, increase prosocial behaviors, and increase knowledge about content curriculum. Given the international focus of using Second Step to improve social-emotional skills, it is especially important to provide an updated synthesis on the effect of the intervention. A single-program meta-analysis was completed in order to determine effects of participating in Second Step and to explore moderators of program effectiveness on prosocial and antisocial behavior outcomes as well as knowledge of emotions. Five moderators were explored, including (a) program saturation, (b) dependent variable source, (c) grade range, (d) metro area, and (e) geographical location. A combined total of 18,847 participants were included in the analysis of 27 studies. Results of the current study indicate that Second Step's impact on students' knowledge and attitudes of violence and violence prevention is much stronger than on increasing prosocial behavior or reducing antisocial behavior.

AB Children who witness violence are at risk for developing a range of developmental problems, including deficits in understanding and regulating. The ability to adaptively manage emotions is associated with children's mental health and their social and academic competence; however, little is known about how parents oi at-risk youth can foster the healthy development of emotion regulation. The current study aimed to identify specific parenting practices associated with adaptive emotion regulation in at-risk preschoolers. Multimethod, multi-informant data were collected from 124 caregiver-child dyads from Head Start programs. Results indicated that interparental aggression was negatively associated with caregivers' and children's emotion regulation, but there were specific caregiver behaviors that moderated the association between interparental aggression and children's emotion regulation. Specifically, care-givers' sensitivity to children's emotions during play, listening effectively to children's expression of sadness, and their own capacity for emotion regulation buffered the association between exposure to interparental aggression and children's emotion regulation. These findings provide practical insight into how parents can promote resilience in children exposed to violence by fostering healthy emotional regulation.

AB Individuals accessing treatment within the youth alcohol and other drug (AoD) sector represent a highly vulnerable population who present with complex patterns of substance use and mental health comorbidity. Current treatments often fail to address this complexity. Emotion regulation (ER) has been identd as a promising transdiagnostic treatment target for this population of young people. The current study aimed to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of an adjunct ER intervention, ERIC (Emotion Regulation and Impulse Control) in young people receiving AoD treatment at a residential rehabilitation service. A mixed methods case series design was utilized. Ten participants aged between 16-20 years old completed 4-6 sessions of ERIC as an adjunct to their existing residential treatment. Participants undertook a post intervention feedback session and completed a number of self-report measures of ER, depression and anxiety at baseline and 2 weeks after receiving ERIC. Qualitative feedback from young people following the delivery of ERIC was positive, and suggested that ERIC was a viable and useful intervention. Participants reported that the components of ERIC, which involved metaphors and experiential exercises, were particularly beneficial and memorable. Pre-post measures indicated that 60% of the young people had both reliable and clinically significant reductions in overall emotion dysregulation, while reliable and clinically significant reductions in depression and anxiety were observed in 50% and 60% of participants respectively. Results support the acceptability of ERIC for this cohort of young people with complex substance use and mental health needs. Furthermore, these findings support the viability of delivering flexible and adjunctive ER treatments to young people seeking AoD treatment.

AB Neuroscientific and psychological research posits that there are two transdiagnostic facets of anxiety: anxious arousal and anxious apprehension. Though these two facets of anxiety are distinct, they are often subsumed into one domain (e.g., trait anxiety). The primary goal of the current study was to delineate the relationship between anxious arousal and cortical thickness versus the relationship between anxious apprehension and cortical thickness in a sample of typically functioning youth. The secondary aim was to determine where in the brain cortical thickness significantly correlated with both components of anxiety. Results indicated that the right anterior insula has a stronger relationship to anxious arousal, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left anterior insula were found to correlate with both anxious arousal and apprehension. We also observed volumetric differences in the amygdala and hippocampus between anxious arousal and anxious apprehension. Whereas anxious arousal, but not apprehension, predicted left amygdala volume, anxious apprehension, but not arousal, predicted right hippocampal volume. These findings demonstrated that there are both differences and similarities in the neural regions that contribute to independent facets of anxiety. Results are discussed in terms of previous findings from the affective and developmental cognitive neurosciences.

AB We examined longitudinal associations across an 8-year time span between overcontrolling parenting during toddlerhood, self-regulation during early childhood, and social, emotional, and academic adjustment in preadolescence (N = 422). Overcontrolling parenting, emotion regulation (ER), and inhibitory control (IC) were observed in the laboratory; preadolescent adjustment was teacher-reported and child self-reported. Results from path analysis indicated that overcontrolling parenting at age 2 was associated negatively with ER and IC at age 5, which, in turn, were associated with more child-reported emotional and school problems, fewer teacher-reported social skills, and less teacher-reported academic productivity at age 10. These effects held even when controlling for prior levels of adjustment at age 5, suggesting that ER and IC in early childhood may be associated with increases and decreases in social, emotional, and academic functioning from childhood to preadolescence. Finally, indirect effects from overcontrolling parenting at age 2 to preadolescent outcomes at age 10 were significant, both through IC and ER at age 5. These results support the notion that parenting during toddlerhood is associated with child adjustment into adolescence through its relation with early developing self-regulatory skills.

AB Stress in children and adolescents is common and related to many developmental problems. However, most studies have made no distinction between temporary or chronic stress due to the lack of a suitable questionnaire. This study tested the factor structure, reliability and validity of the 17-item self-report Chronic Stress Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (CSQ-CA) in three samples, that is, 717 adolescents from the general population, 161 adolescents of parents with a severe chronic medical condition (CMC) like multiple sclerosis, and 113 adolescents with healthy parents. Results showed that a one-factor solution provided a reasonable fit overall. Reliability was good (alpha = .80 to .88). Convergent validity was supported by positive relations between total stress scores and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, experience of daily hassles, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and negative relations with quality of life, happiness, mindfulness, self-esteem, and coping skills. Adolescents from all samples, who themselves had a light CMC like asthma, showed higher chronic stress levels than those without a CMC. In line, adolescents of parents with a severe CMC reported more chronic stress than those of healthy parents, and adolescents with a chronic illness themselves and a parent with a chronic illness, showed the highest scores across the two family types. Overall, this study presents good psychometric properties of the first available measure of chronic stress in children and adolescents.

AB Meta-emotion philosophy refers to an organized set of thoughts, reactions, and feelings about one's emotions and the emotions of others (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). This study investigated the prospective relationship between family meta-emotion processes and adolescent-onset major depressive disorder (MDD). Adolescents (N=198, mean age 12.5 years) and one of their parents each completed the Meta-Emotion Interview (Katz & Gottman, 1986), and adolescents were followed-up at ages 15, 16.5, and 19 years to assess for MDD onset. In the Meta-Emotion Interviews, parents and adolescents were asked about both their own, and the others', anger and sadness. Results showed that parent-report of their own meta-emotion philosophy of sadness prospectively predicted MDD onset in adolescence, as did adolescent-report of low parental emotion coaching in relation to sadness, and adolescent self-perceived emotional competence in relation to sadness. Adolescents' perceptions of family emotional environments characterized by high levels of parental anger expression and family conflict also prospectively predicted MDD onset. These findings highlight the continued importance of family emotional processes in adolescence, and provide insight into how parents' and adolescents' perceptions of emotional processes within the family, particularly in relation to sadness, may be prospectively associated with risk for adolescent onset MDD.

AB Emotion regulation appears to play a key role in eating disorders. However, prior attempts to associate specific emotion regulation abilities with specific types of eating disorders resulted in inconsistent findings. Moreover, far less is known about emotion regulation in eating disorders during adolescence, a critical period of emotional development. The current study addresses this gap, comparing emotion regulation characteristics between adolescents with restrictive types of eating disorders and those with binge eating or purging types of eating disorders. Ninety-eight adolescents with eating disorders (49 with restrictive and 49 with binge eating/purging eating disorders) completed a set of questionnaires including the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The results revealed that binge eating/purging types of eating disorders were associated with greater difficulties in a variety of emotion regulation dimensions including impulse control, goal-directed behavior and access to effective emotion regulation strategies. Awareness and clarity of emotions were also worse in the binge eating/purging types of eating disorders, but this difference did not remain when comorbid psychopathology measures were controlled for. Moreover, the emotion regulation profile of adolescents with anorexia nervosa-binging/purging type was more similar to that of adolescents with bulimia nervosa than to that of adolescents with anorexia nervosa-restrictive type. While both restrictive and binge eating/purging eating disorders have been associated with emotion regulation difficulties, the current study shows that the presence of binge eating or purging episodes is linked with greater severity of emotion regulation deficits among adolescents with eating disorders.

AB Aim This study aimed to investigate gender differences in the association between baseline depressive symptoms and subsequent changes in obesity in a sample of urban Black youth in the USA.
   Methods The current study followed 681 Black youth (335 male and 346 female) for up to 18 years from 1994 to 2012. All youth were selected from an economically disadvantaged urban area in MI, USA. The main independent variable was baseline depressive symptoms measured in 1994. The main outcome was change in body mass index (BMI) from 1999 to 2012, calculated based on self-reported height and weight. Scio-demographics (age, number of parents in the household, and parental employment) were covariates. Gender was the focal moderator. We used linear regressions to test the predictive role of baseline depressive symptoms on change in BMI (from 1999 to 2012) in the pooled sample, and also based on gender.
   Results Among Black females, but not Black males, baseline depressive symptoms predicted the BMI change from 1999 to 2012. The association remained significant for Black females after controlling for covariates.
   Conclusion High depressive symptoms at baseline better predict BMI change over the next decade for female than male Black youth. As a result, detection and reduction of depressive symptoms may be a vital element of obesity prevention programs for Black females. Policies and programs that address determinants of psychological distress as a strategy to prevent obesity among female Black youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods may be especially useful.

AB Recent research suggests that rumination may represent both a risk factor for and consequence of depression, especially among female samples. Nevertheless, few longitudinal studies have examined a reciprocal model of rumination and depression in early adolescence, just before rates of depression diverge by gender. The present study evaluated a cross-lagged path model of rumination and depression in a sample of 408 early adolescents. Gender moderation was also examined. Support was found for a longitudinal bidirectional model of rumination and depression but only among girls. For boys, increased rumination emerged as a consequence, not as a predictor, of depression symptoms. In early adolescence, rumination may be a greater risk factor for depression among girls than boys, whereas depression may be a significant vulnerability factor for increased rumination among both boys and girls. Why rumination may be more maladaptive for girls than boys is discussed within a psychosocial and developmental framework.

AB Background: Experimental research supports delay aversion as a motivational feature of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To investigate the neurobiology of delay aversion in ADHD, this study examined whether adolescents with ADHD display an unusually strong activation in affective brain regions in response to cues predicting forthcoming delay and whether these effects are (a) delay-dose dependent and (b) statistically mediate the association between ADHD and self-reported delay aversion. Methods: Twenty-nine right-handed male adolescents with combined type ADHD and 32 typically developing controls (ages 10-18 years) performed a reaction time task in an MRI scanner. Pretarget cues indicated delay-related response consequences. One indicated that delay would follow the response irrespective of response speed (CERTAIN DELAY), a second that delay would only follow if the response was too slow (CONDITIONAL DELAY), and a third that no delay would follow the response whatever its speed (NO DELAY). Delay levels were 2, 6, or 14s. Participants also rated their own delay aversion in everyday life. Results: Individuals with ADHD rated themselves as more delay averse than controls. Significantly greater activation to CERTAIN DELAY cues relative to NO DELAY cues was found in participants with ADHD compared to controls (bilaterally) in amygdala, anterior insula, temporal pole, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Amygdala and DLPFC activation strength were strongly and delay-dose dependently correlated with delay aversion ratings, and statistically mediated the relationship between ADHD status and delay aversion. Conclusions: When presented with cues predicting impending delay, adolescents with ADHD, relative to controls, displayed a delay-related increase in activation in amygdala and DLPFC, regions known to be implicated in the processing of aversive events. Future studies should examine the specificity of these effects to delay aversion compared to aversive events in general.

AB Background: Bipolar disorder (BP) is characterized by abnormal shifts in mood between episodes of mania and severe depression, both of which have been linked with psychomotor disturbances. This study compares brain activation patterns in motor networks between euthymic youths with BP and healthy controls (HC) during the completion of a simple motor task. Methods: Thirty-five youths with BP and 35 HC (aged 10-19) completed a self-paced sequential bilateral finger-tapping task, consisting of a 4-minute scan block with alternating 20-second periods of either the tapping task (six blocks) or rest (six blocks), while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and behavioral symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A between-group whole-brain analysis compared activation pattern differences while controlling for effects of age and sex. Clusters meeting whole-brain false discovery rate (FDR) correction (qFDR < .05) were considered statistically significant. Post hoc analyses evaluating comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the BP group were also conducted. Results: Significantly decreased activation was found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in youths with BP compared to HC. Furthermore, ACC activation was negatively correlated with CBCL mood dysregulation profile scores in the BP group. No significant differences in functional activation patterns were found between youths with BP and comorbid ADHD and those with only BP. Conclusions: These findings suggest a potential common mechanism of impaired ACC modulation between emotion dysregulation and motor processing in youths with BP.

AB Although a cycle of harsh and abusive parenting has been recognized for decades, this cycle is not inevitable. Indeed, the mechanisms underlying such patterns, and the resources parents may access to disrupt this cycle, require further study. Research investigating those processes has either relied on cross-sectional designs or largely assessed mediators or moderators at one time point. The current investigation of parent-child aggression (PCA) risk utilized a longitudinal design to consider possible mediators and moderators across three time points. Mothers and fathers reported on their personal history of physical and psychological abuse during the last trimester of the mother's pregnancy; their PCA risk was assessed concurrently when their child was 6 months and when their child was 18 months. Current findings support several mediators for mothers, although fewer for fathers, prenatally, but mediation was not observed across time. Similarly, several moderators of the effect of personal history of physical and psychological aggression on PCA risk were identified prenatally but not across time. Thus, several qualities believed to account for, or mitigate, the intergenerational transmission of PCA may not be consistentunderscoring the continued need to identify factors that account for the cyclical process versus what may interrupt intergenerational transmission.

AB This study explored the correspondence and differences between school staff perceptions of preschool children's social skills and behavior problems. One hundred preschoolers were assessed by 14 pairs of teachers and classroom aides with the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales - 2(nd) Edition (PKBS-2 Portuguese version). Indexes of agreement and disagreement were calculated. Risk levels and item analyses of PKBS-2 scores according to both informants' ratings were compared. A higher level of agreement was obtained for social skills scores than for behavior problems (mean correlation of .62). No statistically significant differences between informants were obtained for the risk levels, and item analyses revealed a similar pattern of behaviors that were most and least rated by both informants. Results indicate that the classroom aides' perspective on preschool assessment represents a reliable input, which justifies that they network with teachers in addressing preschoolers' social-emotional and behavioral challenges.

AB Temperament has been associated with child anxiety in a number of studies; however, research examining possible mechanisms of effect using longitudinal designs is scarce.
   This study tested a theoretically-derived model of anxiety development spanning infancy (6 months) to early childhood (approximately 72 months) that includes temperamental reactivity (i.e., behavioral inhibition), temperamental self-regulation (i.e., effortful control), and gender.
   Data used in this study were collected in phase I and phase II from 1226 children and their caregivers by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development for their prospective, longitudinal Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Structural equation modeling procedures were used to test whether effortful control mediated the relation between behavioral inhibition and anxiety and whether such mediation varied by gender.
   Results provided support for the model, suggesting that one mechanism linking the modest association between behavioral inhibition in infancy to anxiety symptoms in early childhood is through diminished effortful control. Further, moderated mediation analyses indicated that this mechanism was apparent only for girls.
   Modulation of temperamental reactivity via effortful control may be a protective factor in the translation of early behavioral inhibition to childhood anxiety for girls.

AB Studies point to parental experiential avoidance (EA) as a potential correlate of maladaptive parenting behaviors associated with child anxiety. However, research has not examined the relationship between EA and parental accommodation of child anxiety, nor the extent to which parental negative beliefs about child anxiety help explain such a relationship. In a sample of mothers (N = 45) of anxious and non-anxious children, the present study investigated the potential link between maternal EA and accommodation of child anxiety and whether this link may be indirectly accounted for via maternal negative beliefs about child anxiety. EA was significantly and positively associated with accommodation of child anxiety, but when negative beliefs about child anxiety were incorporated into the model this direct effect was no longer significant. Findings highlight the contribution of parental emotions and cognitions to behaviors that may exacerbate child anxiety, and may inform treatment and prevention efforts with families of anxious youth.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), deliberate behavior resulting in self-inflicted damage to oneself, is common, particularly among female adolescents, and may be a form of maladaptive emotion regulation. Cognitive interference, a specific type of processing associated with inhibiting prepotent responses in favor of less automatic ones, is utilized in treatment strategies to shift patients' thoughts and behaviors away from maladaptive responses and replace them with more adaptive ones. We examined cognitive interference processing using the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) in females with NSSI behavior (n = 15) and healthy control females (n = 15). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected concurrently. Results revealed similar between-group performance on the MSIT; however, women with NSSI behavior exhibited altered patterns of neural activation during the MSIT. Specifically, the NSSI group demonstrated increased cingulate cortex (CC) and decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation compared to the control group. Further, within the NSSI group, DLPFC activation inversely correlated with emotional reactivity and self-reported impulsivity, suggesting that decreased DLPFC activation is associated with poorer emotional control and increased impulsivity. Taken together, these results indicate that women with NSSI behavior utilize different cortical areas during cognitive interference processing, which may have broader implications regarding the treatment efficacy of cognitive-based therapies.

AB Background and aims: Discrepancy between ideal self-guide and actual self-concept evoke dejection-related feeling, and often individuals with internet gaming disorder (IGD) use games as the tool to escape those negative emotions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of self-discrepancy based on actual and ideal self-images and elucidate the neural correlates underlying the distorted self in individuals with IGD.
   Methods: Nineteen male individuals with IGD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging where they decided on whether they agreed with the adjectives describing their actual or ideal self on a four-point Likert Scale. Two-sample t-test on the self-discrepancy contrast was conducted for neuroimaging analysis and correlation analysis was performed between the behavioral data and regional activities.
   Results: The IGD group evaluated both their ideal self and actual self more negatively than the HC group. Actual self-concept was associated with satisfaction with psychological needs as opposed to ideal self-guide. Brain activity in the inferior parietal lobule was significantly decreased in individuals with IGD relative to HCs in the self-discrepancy contrast. In addition, neural activity during evaluating actual self-concept showed a significant group difference.
   Conclusion: These results provide novel evidence for distorted self-concept of people with IGD. Individuals with IGD had a negative ideal and actual self-image. Neurobiologically, dysfunction in the inferior parietal lobule associated with emotional regulation and negative self-evaluation was found in IGD. Considering the characteristics of IGD that often develop in adolescence, this self-concept problem should be noted and applied with appropriate therapy.

AB Background: The transition from childhood into adolescence can be considered as a critical developmental period. Moreover, adolescence is associated with a decreased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and an increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies increasing the risk of emotional problems. Targeting emotion regulation is therefore seen as an innovative prevention approach. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Boost camp, an innovative school-based prevention program targeting ER, on adolescents' emotion regulation skills and emotional wellbeing. Also secondary outcomes and possible moderators will be included.
   Methods: The aim is to reach 300 adolescents (16 class groups, 6 schools) in their first year of high school. A clustered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with two conditions, intervention (n = 150) and control (n = 150), will be set up. Adolescents in the intervention condition will receive 14 lessons over the course of 2 days, followed by Booster sessions, and will be compared with adolescents in a non-intervention control group. The outcomes will be measured by self-report questionnaires at baseline, immediately after Boost camp, and at three and 6 months follow-up.
   Discussion: Data-collection is planned to be completed in May 2018. Data-analyses will be finished the end of 2018. The presented paper describes the Boost camp program and the clustered RCT design to evaluate its effectiveness. It is expected that Boost camp will have beneficial effects. If found effective, Boost camp will have the potential to increase adolescent's ER and well-being, and reduce the risk to become adults in need.

AB Functional connectivities of the amygdala support emotional and cognitive processing. Life-span development of resting-state functional connectivities (rsFC) of the amygdala may underlie age-related differences in emotion regulatory mechanisms. To date, age-related changes in amygdala rsFC have been reported through adolescence but not as thoroughly for adulthood. This study investigated age-related differences in amygdala rsFC in 132 young and middle-aged adults (19-55 years). Data processing followed published routines. Overall, amygdala showed positive rsFC with the temporal, sensorimotor and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), insula and lentiform nucleus, and negative rsFC with visual, frontoparietal, and posterior cingulate cortex and caudate head. Amygdala rsFC with the cerebellum was positively correlated with age, and rsFCs with the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and somatomotor cortex were negatively correlated with age, at voxel p < 0.001 in combination with cluster p < 0.05 FWE. These age-dependent changes in connectivity appeared to manifest to a greater extent in men than in women, although the sex difference was only evident for the cerebellum in a slope test of age regressions (p = 0.0053). Previous studies showed amygdala interaction with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and vmPFC during emotion regulation. In region of interest analysis, amygdala rsFC with the ACC and vmPFC did not show age-related changes. These findings suggest that intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala evolved from young to middle adulthood in selective brain regions, and may inform future studies of age-related emotion regulation and maladaptive development of the amygdala circuits as an etiological marker of emotional disorders.

AB Connectivity between limbic/subcortical and prefrontal-cortical brain regions develops considerably across childhood, but less is known about the heritability of these networks at this age. We tested the heritability of limbic/subcortical-cortical and limbic/subcortical-subcortical functional brain connectivity in 7-to 9-year-old twins (N = 220), focusing on two key limbic/subcortical structures: the ventral striatum and the amygdala, given their combined influence on changing incentivised behavior during childhood and adolescence. Whole brain analyses with ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala as seeds in genetically independent groups showed replicable functional connectivity patterns. The behavioral genetic analyses revealed that in general VS and amygdala connectivity showed distinct influences of genetics and environment. VS-prefrontal cortex connections were best described by genetic and unique environmental factors (the latter including measurement error), whereas amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity was mainly explained by environmental influences. Similarities were also found: connectivity between both the VS and amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) showed influences of shared environment, while connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) showed heritability. These findings may inform future interventions that target behavioral control and emotion regulation, by taking into account genetic dispositions as well as shared and unique environmental factors such as child rearing.

AB Background: Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk for behavioral, emotional, and cognitive problems. They often have reduced exercise capacity and participate less in sports, which is associated with a lower quality of life. Starting school may present more challenges for children with CHD and their families than for families with healthy children. Moreover, parents of children with CHD are at risk for psychosocial problems. Therefore, a family-centered psychosocial intervention for children with CHD when starting school is needed. Until now, the 'Congenital Heart Disease Intervention Program (CHIP)-School' is the only evidence-based intervention in this field. However, CHIP-School targeted parents only and resulted in non-significant, though positive, effects as to child psychosocial wellbeing. Hence, we expanded CHIP by adding a specific child module and including siblings, creating the CHIP-Family intervention. The CHIP-Family study aims to (1) test the effects of CHIP-Family on parental mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of CHD-children and to (2) identify baseline psychosocial and medical predictors for the effectiveness of CHIP-Family.
   Methods: We will conduct a single-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of CHIP-Family with care as usual (no psychosocial intervention). Children with CHD (4-7 years old) who are starting or attending kindergarten or primary school (first or second year) at the time of first assessment and their families are eligible. CHIP-Family consists of a separate one-day workshop for parents and children. The child workshop consists of psychological exercises based on the evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy Fun FRIENDS protocol and sports exercises. The parent workshop focuses on problem prevention therapy, psychoeducation, general parenting skills, skills specific to parenting a child with CHD, and medical issues. Approximately 4 weeks after the workshop, parents receive an individual follow-up session. The baseline (T1) and follow-up assessment (T2 = 6 months after T1) consist of online questionnaires filled out by the child, parents, and teacher (T2 only). Primary outcome measures are the CBCL for children and the SCL-90-R for parents.
   Discussion: This trial aims to test the effects of an early family-centered psychosocial intervention to meet the compelling need of young children with CHD and their families to prevent (further) problems. If CHIP-Family proves to be effective, it should be structurally implemented in standard care.

AB The study of social anxiety in college students has gained particular importance if we consider its role in their social adjustment and psychological well-being. Despite this, there are no assessment tools that are specifically aimed at this population, which face events that can potentially generate anxiety on a daily basis. The Social Anxiety Test for University students (SAT-U) is presented herein with evidence of validity and reliability. Sixty-eight (68) preliminary items were designed taking into account the current literature, previous scales and consultation with experts. By using a non-probabilistic sampling, exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses were performed in a sample of Argentinian college students. A final scale was obtained with 27 items distributed in four factors (CFI = .95, TLI = .95 RMSEA = .063 and WRMR = 1.19). Regarding the internal consistency of the scale, Cronbach's alpha coefficients and the coefficient of composite reliability were good and excellent for each factor. The dimensions coincide with factors seen in studies with other similar scales, and with conceptual and theoretical postulates about social anxiety.

AB In recent decades the number of publications on social-emotional training programs has increased, achieving consideration as protective factors that facilitate the adaptation of the individual to their context and allow better coping with different life situations, as well as of stressful situations. The objective of the present study was to perform a systematic review of social-emotional training programs in children and adolescents in order to select the most appropriate ones. The search process was carried out in the following databases: PsycInfo, MedLine, ERIC, Red de Revistas Cientificas de America Latina y el Caribe, Scielo, PUBMED, with key words in English and Spanish and certain inclusion criteria. The results showed that of the 19 articles that were selected because they met the criteria, 17 training programs were identified, most of them carried out in Spain during the 2011-2015 period. The objectives of these training programs were to a greater extent, adapted to emotional intelligence, followed to a lesser extent by mixed training. The techniques used in these programs were identified, together with the duration of the interventions, the mode of application, the administrators and the recipients. Finally, of the total studies analyzed, most evidenced the effectiveness of training for some of the variables analyzed. The evidence presented may be useful for researchers and professionals in the area of health and education who work with children and adolescents.

AB Objective: To examine childhood gender nonconformity (GNC) and psychological well-being in a community-based sample using measures that bridge clinical and nonclinical literature.
   Method: Caregivers reported on the GNC (Gender Identity Questionnaire for Children [GIQC]) and behavioral and emotional problems (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) of their children aged 6 to 12 years (N = 1719, 48.8% boys). The GIQC was compared to the commonly used single-item proxy, CBCL Item 110 ("wishes to be of the opposite sex").
   Results: Using the GIQC, 2.3% of boys and 2.8% of girls showed GNC levels comparable to those of children referred clinically for gender dysphoria (GD). Item 110 was endorsed for 1.7% of boys and 1.8% of girls. These measures corresponded, but Item 110 endorsement was biased toward more extreme GNC. Among boys, increased GNC on the GIQC, but not Item 110, corresponded with increased clinical-range CBCL problems. Among girls, Item 110 endorsement was associated with increased clinical-range Externalizing problems, whereas the GIQC indicated that intermediate gender expression was associated with fewer externalizing problems. Overall, rates of clinical-range CBCL problems among GNC children were consistent with those reported for GD-referred children.
   Conclusion: The scope of mental health risk among community children who exhibit GNC is likely considerably greater than previously recognized. A substantial minority of community children show GNC and mental health risk levels comparable to those seen among GD-referred children. Also, compared to the GIQC, a more comprehensive GNC measure, CBCL Item 110 is likely useful only for detecting extreme manifestations of GNC, which may affect associations with mental health.

AB Objective: The study was performed to reveal experiences of adolescents and their families in the short-term after scoliosis surgery.
   Methods: This study had a qualitative descriptive design, and data were collected from adolescents with scoliosis surgery (n=17) and their family members (n=9) at in-depth interviews. Obtained data were analysed with content analysis.
   Results: Five main themes emerged: physical complaints, unfamiliar environment (operating room and intensive care unit), emotional changes, wanting their parents to stay with them and worries about future. Both the adolescents and their families reported that the adolescents experienced not only physical and emotional problems but also worries about their future after surgery.
   Conclusion: Nurses should meet the adolescents and their families and allow them to express their feelings before surgery. Informing them before surgery is important in terms of relieving their anxiety and enhancing their adaptation. Creating an appropriate environment in recovery rooms and intensive care units where the adolescents can frequently see their parents may help them have better psychology. In addition, education programs that will be offered at discharge should be designed and interactive methods should be used to allow them to share their thoughts about their future.

AB Introduction: Internet addiction is prevalent among adolescents and is associated with various negative outcomes. Relatively few studies examined the role of emotion dysregulation and social support on Internet addiction in this population. The present examined the association between emotion dysregulation, social support, and Internet addiction among junior secondary school students in Hong Kong. The mediating role of emotion dysregulation and Internet use on the relationship between social support and Internet addiction and the gender difference in such association were also tested.
   Method: A total of 862 junior secondary school students (grade 7 to 8) from 4 schools completed a cross-sectional survey.
   Results: 10.9% scored above the cut-off for Internet addiction based on the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that social support was negatively related to emotion dysregulation and Internet usage, which in turn, were positively related to Internet addiction. Results from multi group analysis by gender showed that the relationship between social support and emotion dysregulation, Internet usage, and Internet addiction, and those between emotion dysregulation and Internet addiction and between Internet usage and Internet addiction were stronger among female participants.
   Conclusion: Emotion dysregulation is a potential risk factor while social support is a potential protective factor for Internet addiction. The role of social support on emotion dysregulation and Internet addiction were stronger among female students. Gender-sensitive interventions on Internet Addiction for adolescents are warranted, such interventions should increase social support and improve emotion regulation.

AB Background: Turkey is the leading refugee-hosting country in the world. However, there are few studies which investigate mental wellbeing of refugee children in Turkey. Objective: The paper aims to examine the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems and associated risk factors among Syrian refugee minors in Turkey. Methods: The research involved 85 students from 2th to 8th grades. We investigated emotional and behavioural problems with parent-reported Arabic form of Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Socio-demographical findings and children's war-related experiences were also examined. Results: The study sample consisted of 49 (63.6%) girls, and 28 (36.4%) boys (total 77) from age 7 to 17. Average time after resettlement was 29.8 +/- 11.2 (5 to 50 months) months. 66 (85.7%) children reported to had lost at least one familiar person due to the war. The mean experienced war-related traumatic events were calculated as 2.92 +/- 1.86. Total difficulty scores of 30 (39.0%) children were above the cut off values. The rates of children whose SDQ problem scores exceeded the cut-off values were as high as 45.5% (35) for Emotional problems, 64.9% (50) for Peer, 27.3% (21) for conduct and 19.5% (15) for Hyperactivity problems. Discussion: Results indicate high prevalence rates of severe traumatic experiences and possible psychiatric disorders among child survivors of Syrian war which in its seventh year now.

AB The current study examined the potential mediating roles of harsh fathering and harsh mothering in the association between negative parental attribution and emotional dysregulation in Chinese adolescents and explored the moderating role of child gender on this indirect association. 864 students (367 girls, mean age = 13.55 years) with their parents were recruited as participants from two middle schools in Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. The results demonstrated that both harsh fathering and harsh mothering could partially mediate the association between negative maternal attribution and child emotional dysregulation, whereas only harsh fathering could partially mediate the association between negative paternal attribution and child emotional dysregulation. Moreover, we found the moderating role of child gender only for the association between harsh fathering and child emotional dysregulation, in that harsh fathering could be associated with higher levels of emotional dysregulation in girls. These results shed light on efforts to prevent harsh parenting and child emotional dysregulation.

AB Although social media offer adolescents new possibilities for emotion regulation, little is known about how adolescents use different platforms to this end. This study adds to the emotion regulation literature and affordances-of-technologies perspective by describing whether and how adolescents use different social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, 9Gag, and blogs) for emotion sharing and how technical, social, and contextual factors influence these practices. In-depth interviews with 22 adolescents aged 14 to 18 show that adolescents share emotions on multiple of these platforms. Although the different platforms have similar affordances, their social norms clearly differ and influence adolescents' online behavior. Facebook statuses, Instagram, and Snapchat are mostly used for sharing positive emotions, if emotions are shared at all. Twitter and Messenger, on the other hand, are also used for sharing negative emotions, albeit for different reasons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Healthy parenting may be protective against the development of emotional psychopathology, particularly for children reared in stressful environments. Little is known, however, about the brain and behavioral mechanisms underlying this association, particularly during childhood and adolescence, when emotional disorders frequently emerge. Here, we demonstrate that psychological control, a parenting strategy known to limit socioemotional development in children, is associated with altered brain and behavioral responses to emotional conflict in 27 at-risk (urban, lower income) youth, ages 9-16. In particular, youth reporting higher parental psychological control demonstrated lower activity in the left anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotion conflict processing, and submitted faster but less accurate behavioral responsespossibly reflecting an avoidant pattern. Effects were not replicated for parental care, and did not generalize to an analogous nonemotional conflict task. We also find evidence that behavioral responses to emotional conflict bridge the previously reported link between parental overcontrol and anxiety in children. Effects of psychological control may reflect a parenting style that limits opportunities to practice self-regulation when faced with emotionally charged situations. Results support the notion that parenting strategies that facilitate appropriate amounts of socioemotional competence and autonomy in children may be protective against social and emotional difficulties.

AB A growing body of literature is associating excessive and addictive use of digital media with physical, psychological, social and neurological adverse consequences. Research is focusing more on mobile devices use, and studies suggest that duration, content, after-dark-use, media type and the number of devices are key components determining screen time effects. Physical health effects: excessive screen time is associated with poor sleep and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, low HDL cholesterol, poor stress regulation (high sympathetic arousal and cortisol dysregulation), and Insulin Resistance. Other physical health consequences include impaired vision and reduced bone density. Psychological effects: internalizing and externalizing behavior is related to poor sleep. Depressive symptoms and suicidal are associated to screen time induced poor sleep, digital device night use, and mobile phone dependency. ADHD-related behavior was linked to sleep problems, overall screen time, and violent and fast-paced content which activates dopamine and the reward pathways. Early and prolonged exposure to violent content is also linked to risk for antisocial behavior and decreased prosocial behavior. Psychoneurological effects: addictive screen time use decreases social coping and involves craving behavior which resembles substance dependence behavior. Brain structural changes related to cognitive control and emotional regulation are associated with digital media addictive behavior. A case study of a treatment of an ADHD diagnosed 9-year-old boy suggests screen time induced ADHD-related behavior could be inaccurately diagnosed as ADHD. Screen time reduction is effective in decreasing ADHD-related behavior. Conclusions: Components crucial for psychophysiological resilience are none-wandering mind (typical of ADHD-related behavior), good social coping and attachment, and good physical health. Excessive digital media use by children and adolescents appears as a major factor which may hamper the formation of sound psychophysiological resilience.

AB Adolescents seeking professional help with their gender identity development often present with psychological difficulties. Existing literature on psychological functioning of gender diverse young people is limited and mostly bound to national chart reviews. This study examined the prevalence of psychological functioning and peer relationship problems in adolescents across four European specialist gender services (The Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and Switzerland), using the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Differences in psychological functioning and peer relationships were found in gender diverse adolescents across Europe. Overall, emotional and behavioural problems and peer relationship problems were most prevalent in adolescents from the UK, followed by Switzerland and Belgium. The least behavioural and emotional problems and peer relationship problems were reported by adolescents from The Netherlands. Across the four clinics, a similar pattern of gender differences was found. Birth-assigned girls showed more behavioural problems and externalising problems in the clinical range, as reported by their parents. According to self-report, internalising problems in the clinical range were more prevalent in adolescent birth-assigned boys. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the difference in clinical presentations in gender diverse adolescents and to investigate what contextual factors that may contribute to this.

AB The large number of adolescent refugees around the world constitutes a great challenge for societies. However, current models of acculturation have been developed for migrants, but not specifically for adolescent refugees. Crucial factors to describe adolescent refugee acculturation, such as intentions to return to their homeland, especially with respect to adolescent refugees with temporary residency and experiences of potentially traumatic events, are missing. Hence, the Multidimensional Intercultural Training Acculturation (MITA) model is introduced. The model proposes that two major concerns for adolescent refugees, which are socio-cultural adjustment and mental health, are predicted by intercultural and social-emotional competence, intentions to return to their homeland, and experiences of traumatic events. Moreover, the effects of three modes of acculturation are also proposed in the model. It is expected that these variables mediate the effects of intercultural competence, social emotional competence, intentions to return to the homeland, and experiences of traumatic events on socio-cultural adjustment as well as mental health. Finally, it is also expected that in-group social support and out-group social support moderate the direct connection between the experiences of traumatic events and mental health.

AB Best Interests of the Child (BIC) assessments provide migration authorities with behavioral information about which interests of the child could be taken into account before a decision is made on the request for a residence permit. This study provides insight into the quality and outcomes of BIC assessments with 16 unaccompanied children (15-18 years) and 11 accompanied children (4-16 years) who have recently arrived in the Netherlands and requested asylum (N = 27). The results suggest that BIC assessments provide relevant information that enables assessors to determine the best interests of recently arrived refugee children. The inter -rater reliability of the BIC-Questionnaire, an instrument that evaluates the child -rearing environment and that is one of the components of the BIC assessment, was fairly good. The children in the sample had experienced a high number of stressful life events and a majority reported trauma related stress symptoms or other emotional problems. The quality of the child -rearing environment in the country of origin had protected their development insufficiently in the past and would not protect their development sufficiently in the future. The results show that in many cases forced return to the country of origin can put children's development at risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cyber victimization has consistently been associated with internalizing difficulties in adolescents. However, the underlying psychological mechanisms linking this relationship have not been adequately examined. The present study aimed to investigate the mediational roles of coping self-efficacy and emotion dysregulation in the relationships between cyber victimization with depression and social anxiety. Participants were 459 students (199 girls) from independent middle-class schools in grades 8 (M (age) = 13 years 9 months) and 10 (M (age) = 15 years 7 months). They completed a self-report questionnaire about cyberbullying participation, internalizing symptoms, coping self-efficacy, and emotion dysregulation. Structural equation modeling revealed that most domains of coping self-efficacy and emotion dysregulation partially mediated the relationship between cyber victimization and depression, and fully mediated the relationship between cyber victimization and social anxiety. The results highlight the importance of targeting these mediating factors in intervention programs to reduce the negative impact of cyber victimization on adolescents.

AB Social perspective-taking (SPT), the social-cognitive skill of inferring, considering, and evaluating others' perspectives, is critical in allowing students to engage not only with others in social interactions, but also with many academic materials and activities. However, due to complex conceptualizations of SPT, as well as challenges to its measurement, little research has examined the role of SPT in student learning. Using a new measure, the Assessment of Social Perspective-taking Performance (ASPP), this article presents evidence that SPT can be conceptualized as a set of measurable developmental performative skills relevant to classroom leaming in early adolescence: articulation of actors' beliefs/intentions and positioning of actors in their social contexts. Examination of its psychometric properties provides evidence that ASPP can precisely assess students' SPT performance across varying levels of those skills. Lastly, we find positive associations of SPT with academic engagement and standardized test scores.

AB Background: Irritability is one of the most common reasons for referral to child and adolescent mental health services and is the main characteristic of the new diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). However, the recognition and management of irritability presents a major challenge in clinical practice and may be partly responsible for the dramatic increase in antipsychotic prescribing in recent years. Methods: In this review, we provide up-to-date information on the definition and mechanisms underlying irritability, and its assessment in clinical practice. We aim to discuss the latest research on DMDD, and the presence of severe irritability in the context of other disorders, as well as to recommend a treatment algorithm. Results: Severe irritability is associated with aberrant reward processing and bias toward threatening stimuli. Several measures are available to easily assess irritability. The recent diagnosis of DMDD captures children whose main problem is severe irritability and differ from those with bipolar disorder in longitudinal outcomes, family history, and behavioral and neural correlates. Treatment of irritability might depend on the context it appears. Indirect evidence suggests that parent management training (PMT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the most supported psychological treatments for irritability. Conclusions: Irritability, recognized as a mood problem rather than a purely behavioral manifestation, is a common condition for young people. Practitioners should not ignore irritability as it is associated with substantial morbidity and impairment. Although there are no trials with irritability as main outcome, clinicians can apply several existing pharmacological and psychological interventions for its treatment. Also, new promising approaches relying on pathophysiological findings, such as exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and interpretation bias training (IBT), are being currently investigated.

AB Objective: Little is known about the extent to which previous weeks' stressful events spill over and influence adolescents' abilities to derive insight from treatment sessions. Even less is known about factors that moderate clients' vulnerabilities to these spillover effects. The current study examined the spillover of negative interpersonal events to postsession insight and the role of difficulties in emotion regulation in this spillover effect. Method: Participants were 129 adolescents with moderate to severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (M-age = 14.96, 83% female, 56% African American/Black) participating in a comparative efficacy trial of Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) and Family-Enhanced Nondirective Supportive Therapy (FE-NST). A within-subject mediation model tested presession negative affect as a mediator of spillover of past week's events on postsession insight. We then examined baseline difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) as a between-subjects moderator of the mediation model. Results: Negative affect partially mediated (44%) the spillover of the past week's negative events on adolescents' ratings of postsession insight (p = .03, 95% confidence interval, CI [-.09., -.002]). Baseline DERS increased adolescents' vulnerabilities to spillover effects (p = .01, 95% CI [-.28, -.03]). Negative interpersonal events from the past week influence presession negative affect and spill over to adolescents' abilities to gain insight from their treatment sessions. Adolescents who began treatment with greater DERS were particularly vulnerable to these spillover effects. Findings indicate the need for therapists to adapt sessions to individual differences in depressed and suicidal adolescents' exposure to negative interpersonal events preceding treatment and in their vulnerabilities to spillover and emotion dysregulation.

AB Relatively little is known about the degree to which subcomponents of self-regulation change during early to middle adolescence. This study considered familial predictors (maternal/paternal regulatory support, antagonistic parenting, and parent-child closeness) of rank-order change in behavioral, emotional and cognitive regulation and perseverance over one year. N = 452 adolescents ages 11-16 years and their parents completed questionnaires and parent-child discussion tasks (48.7% male; 69.6% white). Results indicated minimal direct effects of parenting, though maternal and paternal parenting and parent-child closeness exerted small effects that were moderated by prior levels of cognitive regulation and perseverance. Parents may contribute to the development of complex regulatory capacities that mature after foundational emotional and behavioral regulation competencies.

AB Linehan (1993) theorized that the experience of invalidating parenting interacts with emotional vulnerability in the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Parental psychological control is a type of invalidating parenting, defined as manipulation by parents of their offspring's psychological and emotional expression and experience (Barber, 1996). In a normative sample of adolescent females, adolescent-reported maternal psychological control was related to maternal borderline symptoms (Zalewski et al., 2014). The current study expanded on these findings to sample mothers with a diagnosis of BPD (n = 28) and normative comparisons (n = 28) with male and female adolescents aged 14-18. We assessed maternal and adolescent self-reported borderline features (affective instability, negative relationships, identity disturbance, and self-harm) and coded maternal psychological control from filmed problem-solving interactions. Controlling for current major depressive disorder and family income, mothers with BPD used more total psychological control with their adolescents in comparison with normative mothers. Further, maternal psychological control was positively associated with all mothers' borderline features and with adolescent affective instability. Finally, we found a significant indirect effect for maternal affective instability between maternal total psychological control and adolescent affective instability. We discuss adolescents' risk of developing BPD themselves and prevention and treatment implications.

AB Music as an effective self-regulative tool for emotions and behavioural adaptation for adolescents might enhance emotion-related skills when applied as a therapeutic school intervention. This study investigated Rap & Sing Music Therapy in a school-based programme, to support self-regulative abilities for well-being. One-hundred-and-ninety adolescents in grade 8 of a public school in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to an experimental group involving Rap & Sing Music Therapy or a control group. Both interventions were applied to six classes once a week during four months. Measurements at baseline and again after four months provided outcome data of adolescents' psychological well-being, self-description, self-esteem and emotion regulation. Significant differences between groups on the SDQ teacher test indicated a stabilized Rap & Sing Music Therapy group, as opposed to increased problems in the control group (p = .001; (2)(p) = .132). Total problem scores of all tests indicated significant improvements in the Rap & Sing Music Therapy group. The RCT results imply overall benefits of Rap & Sing Music Therapy in a school setting. There were improved effects on all measures - as they are in line with school interventions of motivational engagement in behavioural, emotional and social themes - a promising result.

AB Little is known about the prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa. Research consistently determined violence and maltreatment to be important risk factors. In this study, we examined the prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents in Tanzania, as well as the association with exposure to violence and maltreatment.
   We administered a set of questionnaires (e.g., strength and difficulties questionnaire; conflict tactic scale) to a nationally representative sample of 700 Tanzanian secondary school children (52% girls; age 14.92 years, SD = 1.02) and 333 parents or primary caregivers (53% females; age 43.47 years, SD = 9.02).
   41% of the students reported an elevated level of mental health problems (emotional problems 40%, peer problems 63%, conduct problems 45%, hyperactivity 17%) in the past 6 months. Concordantly, 31% of parents reported observing an elevated level of mental health problems in their children (emotional problems 37%, peer problems 54%, conduct problems 35%, hyperactivity 17%). After controlling for other risk factors, we found significant associations between physical violence by parents and adolescent's mental health problems reported by students (beta = 0.15) and their parents (beta = 0.33).
   Our findings suggest a high prevalence of mental health problems using screening tools among secondary school students in Tanzania as well as an association between physical violence by parents and adolescents' mental health problems. Our findings emphasize the need to inform the population at large about the potentially adverse consequences associated with violence against children and adolescents.

AB Adolescence is accompanied by increased vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. The hippocampus is important for regulating emotional state through its ventral compartment and spatial cognition through its dorsal compartment. Previous animal studies have examined hippocampal development at stages before, after or at single time points during adolescence. However, only one study has investigated morphological changes at multiple time points during adolescence, and no study has yet compared developmental changes of dorsal versus ventral hippocampi. We analyzed the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of rats to determine the developmental trajectory of Golgi-stained hippocampal CA1 neurons by sampling at five time points, ranging from postnatal day (P) 35 (puberty) to 55 (end of adolescence). We show that the dorsal hippocampus undergoes transient dendritic retractions in stratum radiatum (SR), while the ventral hippocampus undergoes transient dendritic growths in SR. During adulthood, stress and hormonal fluctuations have been shown to alter the physiology and morphology of hippocampal neurons, but studies of the impact of these factors upon adolescent hippocampi are scarce. In addition, we show that female-female pair housing from P 36-44 significantly increases branching in the dorsal SR and reduces branching in the ventral SR. Taken together with data on spine density, these results indicate that pyramidal cells in the dorsal and ventral CA1 of female adolescents are remodeled differently following single housing. Social housing during adolescence elicits pathway-specific changes in the hippocampus that may underlie behavioral benefits, including stability of emotion regulation and superior cognition.

AB Common genetic influences offer a partial explanation for comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders(1-3). However, the genetics underlying co-development-the cross-domain co-occurrence of patterns of change over time-of psychiatric symptoms during childhood and adolescence has not been well explored. Here, we show genetic influence on joint symptom trajectories of parent-reported conduct and emotional problems (overall N = 15,082) across development (4-16 years) using both twin-and genome-wide polygenic score analyses (genotyped N = 2,610). Specifically, we found seven joint symptom trajectories, including two characterized by jointly stable and jointly increasing symptoms of conduct and emotional problems, respectively (7.3% of the sample, collectively). Twin modelling analyses revealed substantial genetic influence on trajectories (heritability estimates range of 0.41-0.78). Furthermore, individuals' risk of being classified in the most symptomatic trajectory classes was significantly predicted by polygenic scores for years-of-education-associated alleles and depressive symptoms-associated alleles. Complementary analyses of child self-reported symptoms across late childhood and early adolescence yielded broadly similar results. Taken together, our results indicate that genetic factors are involved in the co-development of conduct and emotional problems across childhood and adolescence, and that individuals with co-developing symptoms across multiple domains may represent a clinical subgroup characterized by increased levels of genetic risk.

AB This study aimed to explore whether the relationships between affect and overeating, observed previously in individualistic cultures, could be generalized to a collectivistic culture where the emotional display rules differ. Focusing on Thai population, the study specifically investigated: (1) whether dietary disinhibition would mediate the relationships between affect and overeating behavior, and (2) whether emotion regulation would moderate this relationship. To this end, 298 participants (aged 18-24 years) were recruited from universities in the Bangkok metropolitan region. All participants were asked to complete pen-and-paper measures of affect, emotion regulation, dietary disinhibition, and overeating behaviors. Using a mediated-moderation analysis, results showed that only negative, but not positive, affect had a direct effect on overeating behavior (beta = .25, t(295) = 5.20, p < .001). This relationship was mediated by participants' dietary disinhibition (R-2 = .36, beta = 82.85, t(295) = 5.20, p < .001) . Finally, emotion regulation moderated the relationships between negative affect (beta = -.10, t(292) = -2.35, p = .02), dietary disinhibition, and overeating behavior (beta= .12, t(292) = 2.49, p = .01). The findings suggest that even in collectivistic cultures, the ability to regulate emotions still serves as a protective factor against excessive food intake These findings demonstrate the importance of an individual's emotion, emotion regulation, and cognitive pattern that could influence eating behavior. Consequently, the findings have implications for the development of obesity interventions in related cultural settings.

AB Objectives: So far hardly any instruments are available for the German-speaking countries, covering family relations from the perspective of young people reliably. Moreover, the relationship between family relations from the perspective of young people and behavioral problems has been rarely investigated. Method: Based on the Family Relations Test, which has been developed originally for children, the Family Relations Test for Children and Adolescents was developed in order to assess the family relations from the perspective of adolescents (94 items, 44 % newly developed). A clinical sample (n = 152) and a fi eld sample (n = 132) was tested with this instrument and additionally behavioural problems of the adolescents were rated by the parents and the adolescents. Results: The two-factor solution of the principal component analysis resulted in a clear distinction between two factors describing positive and negative family relations. The internal consistencies (Cronbach's Alpha) of the scales describing positive and negative relations are between.91 and.93. On these total scores young people from the clinic sample describe overall stronger negative relations in their families compared to young people in the fi eld sample. Within the clinic sample moderate correlations between the extent of mental problems of young people rated by themselves and their parents could be found. Conclusions: Positive and negative relationships of young people to the individual family members and to all members of the family as a whole can be assessed reliably and factorially valid. As expected, signifi cant correlations between negative family relations and mental problems could be found. The adolescent version of the Family Relations Test for Children and Adolescents proves to be a useful tool, to assess family relationships from the perspective of young people and thus to identify possible factors maintaining mental disorders of young people.

AB The current study evaluated a model of youth academic self-concept which incorporates practical executive functioning behaviors and academic achievement. Though greater academic achievement has been linked to both positive self-concept and better executive functioning, these constructs have not been examined simultaneously. It was hypothesized that academic achievement would mediate the association between problems with executive functioning and academic self-concept such that youth with more problems with executive functioning would have lower academic achievement and, in turn, lower academic self-concept. Clinical data was analyzed from a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of youth (n = 122) who underwent neuropsychological evaluation. Problems with executive functioning were assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Academic achievement was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement or Wechsler Individual Achievement Test. Academic self-concept was assessed using the youth-report version of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children. Surprisingly, findings indicate that academic achievement is not significantly associated with problems with executive functioning or academic self-concept. However, greater problems with executive functioning are associated with decreased academic self-concept. The overall model included several covariates and accounted for 10% of the variance in academic self-concept. Findings suggest that executive skills may be essential for aligning academic achievement with classroom performance. Though various child characteristic covariates were included, the model accounted for a small amount of variance suggesting that future studies should examine contributing contextual factors.

AB Introduction. Despite the extensive literature, the gender differences in eating disorders (ED) have been poorly investigated. Most of the studies, in fact, have been conducted so far on female samples, emphasizing the misleading belief that such disorders are of exclusive relevance of women. Aim. The review aim at highlighting as this preconception is still widespread among the male patients and the clinicians and as it represents an impediment to a correct diagnosis and a proper treatment planning. Method. Included studies were selected in the scientific literature published between January 2007 and December 2017 through the main databases, combining the words: "males", "eating disorder", "anorexia nervosa", "bulimia nervosa", "binge eating disorder". Results. Fifty-four studies have been selected in accordance with the followed methodological criteria. Discussion. Only recently, the attention of researchers have been also focused on male population: many differences between genders have emerged in prevalence, onset, phenomenology, diagnosis, comorbidity and outcomes of ED. The studies on risk factors have also pointed out significant differences between males and females, especially in relation to the different weight exerted by psychological variables involved in the aetiology of eating disorders. Conclusions. Compared with a little knowledge of ED in the male population, it is important to widespread the comprehension taking into account the gender perspective. The attention must be paid particularly to critical developmental periods, such as puberty and adolescence, where early detection and prevention of these disorders is of greatest importance, inside a conceptual framework which considers the mutual influence between biological and psychological vulnerability, and sociocultural factors.

AB Suicide, self-injury, and predisposing vulnerabilities aggregate in families. Those at greatest risk often show deficits in two biologically-mediated domains: behavioral control and emotion regulation. This pilot study explored electroencephalographic and cardiovascular indices of self-regulation among typical and suicidal adolescents (n=30/group) and biological family members (mothers, fathers, and siblings). We measured event-related potentials during a flanker task designed to evoke impulsive responding and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at rest and during social rejection. Multilevel models indicate control families' RSA was unaffected by social rejection (slope=0.136, p=.097, d=0.09), whereas clinical families demonstrated RSA withdrawal (slope=-0.191, p=.036, d=-0.13). Clinical families displayed weaker positive voltage (P-e) deflections following behavioral errors relative to controls (coefficient=-2.723, p=.017, d=-0.45), indicating risk for compromised cognitive control. Thus, families with suicidal adolescents showed autonomic and central nervous system differences in biological markers associated with suicide risk.

AB Interview, self-report, peer report, and observational data were used to examine parent and peer relationship qualities as predictors of relative changes in attachment security in a community sample of adolescents followed from ages 14 to 24. Early maternal supportive behavior predicted relative increases in attachment security from adolescence to adulthood, whereas psychological control and interparental hostile conflict predicted relative decreases. Peer predictors of relative increases in security included collaborative and autonomous behaviors and lack of hostile interactions, with peer predictions growing stronger for relationships assessed at later ages. Overall, models accounted for sufficient variance as to suggest that attachment security across this period is well explained by a combination of stability plus theoretically predicted change linked to social relationship qualities.

AB Distinguishing between equity and equality is essential when making social and moral decisions, yet the related neurodevelopmental processes are unknown. Evaluations of contextually based third-party distributions incorporating recipient need and resource importance were examined in children and adolescents (N=82; 8-16years). Spatiotemporal neurodynamic responses show distinct developmental profiles to viewing such distributions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) differentially predicted real-life behaviors based on age, where older children's (8-10years) evaluations were related to a fairly rapid, automatic ERP component (early posterior negativity), whereas adolescent and preadolescent (11-16years) evaluations, first-person allocations, and prosocial behaviors were predicted by later, cognitively controlled ERP components (P3 and late positive potential). Together, these results reveal age-related changes regarding the neural responses that correspond to distributive justice decisions.

AB BackgroundDevelopmental language disorder (DLD) is common in children, but little is known about its association with quality of life (QoL) in middle childhood. QoL is a complex construct, aligning with an individual's sense of well-being and is related to functional limitations associated with DLD. Biopsychosocial models of disability account for both the extent and functional limitations of the impairment; however, the DLD literature rarely reports on both aspects. Studies are required that detail QoL in children with and without DLD.
   AimsTo investigate the association between DLD, identified at 4 years and persisting at 7 years, and QoL over 4, 7 and 9 years; to compare QoL for children whose DLD was mild to moderate and severe at 7 years; and to investigate how variables known to impact on language development (e.g., maternal vocabulary), as well as social-emotional behaviours at 4 and 7 years contribute to QoL at 9 years.
   Methods & ProceduresThe analyses included 872 children who participated in the 4-, 7- and 9-year data collection of the Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS). We compared the parent-reported QoL profiles at 4, 7 and 9 years for children with and without DLD, and those with mild to moderate and severe DLD using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). We conducted regression analyses to estimate how child, family and environmental factors predicted QoL at 9 years, including social-emotional behaviours measured using the Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at 4 and 7 years.
   Outcome & ResultsChildren with DLD (n = 70) had lower parent-reported QoL at 9 years than typically developing children (n = 802), with mean scores of 74.9 and 83.9 respectively. There was no evidence of differences in QoL between those with severe (n = 14) or mild to moderate (n = 56) DLD. In contrast to their peers, children with DLD had a profile of declining QoL between 4 and 9 years. For all children, language skills at 7 years predicted QoL at 9 years. For children with DLD, emotional symptoms and peer problems at 4 years plus SDQ Total Difficulties at 7 years were predictive of lower QoL at 9 years.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsChildren with DLD had a lower QoL than their typical peers at 9 years and, contrary to previous studies, differences in QoL were not observed with DLD severity. Co-occurring social-emotional problems appear to play an important role in contributing to the lower QoL experienced by children with DLD. Consideration of associated functional limitations is required to support the communication and social development of all young children with DLD.

AB Research on indulgent parenting and its relation to college students is both limited and inconsistent. Further, all the studies have used a variable-centered approach. To fill the gap in the current literature, the aims of this study were to explore profiles of parental indulgence and their associations with college students' emotional and behavioral problems. The sample in this study consisted of college students from two universities. Participants were asked to take an online survey about their perceptions of their parents' indulgent parenting practice and their own well-being. Results from latent profile analyses suggested distinct profiles of parental indulgence for mothers and fathers. Further, these profiles demonstrated differential associations with college students' anxiety and depressive symptoms, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol use. Implications were also noted.

AB Psychotic like experiences (PLE's) are common in the general population, particularly during adolescence, which has generated interest in how PLE's emerge, and the extent to which they reflect either risk for, or resilience to, psychosis. The "attachment-developmental-cognitive" (ADC) model is one effort to model the effect of risk factors on PLEs. The ADC model proposes attachment insecurity as an early environmental insult that can contribute to altered neurodevelopment, increasing the likelihood of PLE's and psychosis. In particular, early-life attachment disruptions may negatively impact numerous aspects of executive function (EF), including behavioral inhibition and emotion regulation. Yet despite the relationship of disrupted attachment to EF impairments, no studies have examined how these factors may combine to contribute to PLE's in adolescents. Here, we examined the relative contributions of daily-life EF and attachment difficulties (avoidance and anxiety) to PLEs in typically developing youth (N=52; ages 10-21). We found that EF deficits and high attachment insecurity both accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in PLE's, and interacted to predict PLE manifestation. Specifically, positive PLEs were predicted by greater trouble monitoring behavioral impact, less difficulty completing tasks, greater difficulty regulating emotional reactions, greater difficulty controlling impulses and higher attachment anxiety. Negative PLEs were predicted by greater difficulty in alternating attention, transitioning across situations, and regulating emotional reactions as well as higher attachment anxiety. These results are consistent with the ADC model, providing evidence that early-life attachment disruptions may impact behavioral regulation and emotional control, which together may contribute to PLEs.

AB We investigated treatment effects on parenting self-efficacy and parent cognitive errors, and whether these parent cognitions are related to short-and long-term outcomes in parenting behaviors in psychosocial treatment for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I). In a randomized controlled trial across two sites (University of California, San Francisco, and University of California, Berkeley), 199 children between the ages of 7 and 11 were randomized to the Child Life and Attention Skills (CLAS; n = 74) program, parent-focused treatment (PFT; n = 74), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 51). Parents reported on self-efficacy, cognitive errors, positive parenting, and negative parenting prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and in the next school year at follow-up. Compared to TAU, CLAS and PFT had higher posttreatment parenting self-efficacy, and CLAS alone had lower posttreatment parent cognitive errors. At follow-up, only CLAS had improved parent cognitive errors compared to TAU. No other between-group differences were found in parenting self-efficacy or cognitive errors. Improved parenting self-efficacy was associated with improved posttreatment negative parenting outcomes for PFT and CLAS, and improved parent cognitive errors were also related to improvements in positive and negative posttreatment parenting outcomes for CLAS. Posttreatment parenting self efficacy mediated follow-up negative parenting outcomes for CLAS and posttreatment parent cognitive errors mediated improved follow-up positive and negative parenting outcomes for CLAS. PFT and CLAS led to enhanced parenting self efficacy, and CLAS appears especially robust in improving parent cognitive errors both in the short and long term. Pathways provide support for the possibility of parent cognitions as mediators of treatment effects on parenting; clinical focus on such cognitions may be useful.

AB Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suffer from poor emotion regulation that might arise from problems in the distribution of attentional resources when confronted with emotional distractors. Previous studies investigating the neurocognitive basis of these problems remain inconclusive. Moreover, most of these studies did not exclude participants with comorbidity, particularly of conduct or oppositional defiant disorder. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in fronto-limbic activation in ADHD adolescents specifically during negative distractors in an emotional attention task. For this purpose, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess 25 boys with noncomorbid ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) boys while they performed an emotional attention task with positive, negative, and neutral emotional distractors. Boys with ADHD had increased activation relative to TD boys specifically during the negative valenced stimuli in an emotional processing network comprising left anterior insula reaching into the inferior frontal gyrus. The findings suggest altered salience processing in ADHD of negative valenced emotional stimuli that may lead to higher distractibility in ADHD specifically when faced with negative emotional distractors.

AB Emotional functioning plays a crucial role in the social development of children and adolescents. We examined the extent to which emotion control was related to the quality of friendships in pre-adolescents with and without hearing loss. We tested 350 pre-adolescents (75 deaf/hard of hearing in mainstream education (DHHm), 48 deaf/hard of hearing in special education (DHHs), and 227 hearing) through self-report. Outcomes confirmed a positive association between emotion control and positive friendships for all groups, with one notable exception: more approach strategies for emotion regulation were associated with more negative friendship features in the DHHs group. In addition, the DHHm group demonstrated high levels of emotion control, while their levels of positive friendship features were still lower compared to the hearing group.

AB BackgroundDisordered eating frequently co-occurs in young people seeking treatment for mental health and substance use difficulties. High levels of psychological distress and a lack of emotional clarity (LEC) are two constructs that have received recent attention as important constructs underlying this harmful behaviour; however how they interact to precipitate and maintain disordered eating still remains unclear. This study sought to address this gap by examining whether psychological distress moderates the relationship between LEC and disordered eating in a sample of young people with complex emotional and behavioural difficulties.
   MethodsParticipants were young people (N = 306, M = 20.8 years) accessing youth specific alcohol and other drugs and/or primary mental health services in Australia who completed an online questionnaire which examined their level of emotional clarity, degree of distress, and engagement in disordered eating behaviours.
   ResultsModeration analysis was employed to examine if psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression) significantly moderates the relationship between LEC and disordered eating. A small, significant interactive effect of high levels of depressive symptoms on the relationship between LEC and disordered eating was found. Whereas, anxious affect did not significantly interact with LEC to predict disordered eating.
   ConclusionsYoung people who struggle to identify and articulate their emotions are more likely to engage in disordered eating in the presence of high distress relating to depressive symptomatology. Addressing LEC through increasing emotional literacy, while treating depressive symptomatology, are key intervention strategies that may assist young people with complex emotional and behavioural difficulties manage disordered eating.

AB BackgroundAttachment insecurity is associated with poor mental health across the life span, and increasing evidence suggests that emotion regulation difficulties are implicated in these associations. To date, research has focused largely on adult attachment in the context of romantic relationships; however, close friendships are well-established predictors of mental health and well-being, and little is known about the influence of attachment in the context of close friendships on mental health, and the potential role of emotion regulation. The present research examined whether attachment to friends was associated with mental health and interpersonal functioning, and whether emotion regulation mediated these associations.
   MethodA sample of 243 adults (Mage = 20.91 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing attachment to friends, emotion regulation, mental health, and interpersonal functioning.
   ResultsEmotion dysregulation mediated the association between attachment anxiety and depression, anxiety, stress, and interpersonal distress. There were also direct effects of attachment anxiety on symptoms of anxiety and interpersonal distress. Emotion dysregulation did not mediate the association between attachment avoidance and psychosocial outcomes, though attachment avoidance directly predicted depression and interpersonal distress.
   ConclusionsThis research highlights that emotion dysregulation may be one mechanism underlying the association between anxious attachment to friends and poor psychosocial functioning. Clinical interventions may therefore benefit from assessing attachment in the context of friendships, and targeting emotion dysregulation for those high in attachment anxiety.

AB This study examined physiological linkage (specifically, linkage in respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) between parents and youth (aged 11-17) across conflict and fun activity discussion tasks. We also examined whether observed, momentary negative affect or parental depressive symptoms, would moderate patterns of RSA linkage across the interaction tasks. RSA linkage was assessed using a multilevel actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Participants were 59 mother-adolescent dyads, including mothers with or without clinically significant depressive symptoms. Both mothers and teens evidenced stable RSA over time (actor effect), although the stability of maternal RSA was moderated by maternal depression, with maternal depressive symptoms related to slower RSA return to baseline. There was a significant partner influence on youth RSA, with maternal RSA positively related to subsequent youth RSA. However, this effect was moderated by maternal depression and maternal negative affect (NA), with low maternal depression/low maternal NA related to dyadic synchrony, whereas high depression or high NA led to attenuation of this relationship. Results demonstrate the importance of understanding the dynamic and complex nature of family interactions in the context of depression.

AB Although studies have shown links between minority stress and mental health (e.g., Meyer, 2003), there is little research explaining this association. Research has suggested that adequate coping skills might protect youth from the negative impact of stress (Compas et al., 2017). Thus, we aimed to examine: 1) whether associations between minority stress and depressive symptoms occurred through mechanisms of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and 2) whether these associations were dependent on level of problem-solving coping (moderated mediation). Using an online survey of 267 sexual minority youth from the Netherlands (16-22 years; 28.8% male), the results show an indirect relationship of sexual orientation victimization and internalized homophobia with depressive symptoms occurring through perceived burdensomeness; for both males and females. Problem-solving coping skills did not significantly moderate the aforementioned indirect relationships. These results have implications for prevention and intervention work that currently focuses on social isolation rather than perceived burdensomeness.

AB The present study examined the role of sleep in daily affective stress recovery processes in adolescents. Eighty-nine American adolescents recorded their emotions and stress through daily surveys and sleep with Fitbit devices for two weeks. Results show that objectively measured sleep (sleep onset latency and sleep debt) moderated negative affective responses to previous-day stress, such that stress-related negative affect spillover effects became more pronounced as amount of sleep decreased. Total sleep time and sleep debt moderated cross-day positive affect "bounce-back" effects. With more sleep, morning positive affect on days following high stress tended to bounce back to the levels that were common following low stress days. Conversely, if sleep was short following high stress days, positive affect remained low the next morning. No evidence for subjective sleep quality as a moderator of spillover/bounce-back effects was found. This research suggests that sleep quantity could relate to overnight affective stress recovery.

AB The significant mental health needs of young people in out-of-home care has been well-documented. However, there is little empirical evidence on the timing or development of these difficulties, once these young people have been removed from the maltreatment-environment. Such information may provide useful clinical insight in to how problems develop and persist and whether intervention timings may allow for the prevention of later mental health problems. The current service-data study explored the emotional and behavioural symptom trajectories of 207 young people under the long-term care of a local authority in the South West of England, over their first five years in the care system. Data were extracted from the yearly carer-completed strengths and difficulties questionnaire-providing an index of emotional problems, peer problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity. Trajectories were analysed using growth mixture modelling. For most domains the largest trajectories were chronic symptom profiles, where young people were rated in the abnormal range from their first year in care and remained in this range across the full five years. These young people had significantly more placement moves than their peers on resilient trajectories. There was some evidence that later age of removal was associated with more chronic internalising problems. Overall, findings demonstrate the significant mental health needs of young people in care and particularly highlight that, in many cases, the removal from the adverse environment is simply not enough to expect a young person in care to be resilient to their earlier experiences.

AB Mothers with a substance use disorder (SUD) are at risk for maladaptive parenting practices, and have heightened likelihood of having experienced childhood adversity themselves. In addition, parental reflective functioning (PRF), a capacity underlying sensitive caregiving, is often low in mothers with SUD. This study examines the relationship between PRF and aversive (emotional, physical, sexual abuse and neglect) and adaptive (safety and competence) experiences, in different developmental phases (early childhood, latency, and adolescence) in mothers with a SUD. A sample of 43 mothers with small children were interviewed with the Parental Developmental Interview to assess PRF, and they completed the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire regarding aversive and adaptive experiences. In addition, we used the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10 to control for mental health status and a battery of neuropsychological tests to control for executive functions. Results indicated that adaptive experiences in early childhood were positively related to PRF, and that experience of emotional abuse was negatively related to PRF. When separating the group of mothers in two sub-groups based on PRF level, results showed that mothers with negative to low PRF had significantly more experiences of adversities in early childhood and latency, and significantly less adaptive experiences in early childhood, latency and adolescence, compared to mothers with moderate to high PRF. In addition, mothers with adequate to high PRF reported experiencing significantly more types of adaptive experiences, and significantly less adversities compared to mothers with negative to low PRF. Results are discussed in relation to developmental trauma, resilience, epistemic trust and mistrust.

AB The current study the relationship between eating disorders (EDs) and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in adult inpatients. In particular, the present study investigated one potential mechanism, body dissatisfaction (BD), which may contribute to increased risk for suicide in adult ED patients. A sample of 432 psychiatric inpatients ranging from 18 to 65 years of age participated in the current study. Findings indicated that patients who have higher levels of BD also had higher levels of passive and active suicidal ideation and previous suicide attempts. Higher levels of BD were also related to increased suicidal ideation after controlling for depression and emotion dysregulation. Although additional risk factors for suicide should be investigated in adults with EDs, this study provides evidence regarding the relationship between BD and risk for suicide ideation and attempt.

AB Introduction: More than one third of patients with eating disorders report NSSI. Moreover, negative attitudes and feelings toward the body, body dissatisfaction, and body image disturbances have been linked to NSSI in community and clinical samples. However, there is a lack of studies exploring NSSI frequency and functions and the specific relationship between multidimensional body image dimensions and NSSI in eating disorder patients.
   Objectives: First, we explored the frequency, types, and functions of NSSI in a sample of 226 Spanish female participants with eating disorders (ED). Second, we explored differences in NSSI and body image depending on the ED restrictive-purgative subtype; and third, we explored differences in body dissatisfaction, body image orientation, and body investment in eating disorder patients without NSS1 (n = 144), with NSSI in their lifetime (n = 19), and (b) with NSSI in the previous year (n = 63).
   Results: Of the overall sample, 37.1% (n = 89) had a history of self-injury during their lifetime, and 27.1% (n = 65) had self-injured in the previous year. Among the types of ongoing NSSI, the most frequent were banging (64.6%) and cutting (56.9%). Restrictive vs purgative patients differed on NSSI lifetime, Appearance Evaluation, Body Areas Satisfaction, Body Protection and Feelings and Attitudes toward the Body. Moreover, significant differences were found on Appearance Evaluation, Body Areas Satisfaction, Positive Feelings and Attitudes towards the Body, Body Protection, and Comfort with physical contact, between participants without a history of self-injury and both NSSI groups.
   Discussion: Body dissatisfaction and body investment have been found to be variables related to NSSI. Thus, the present study highlights the importance of working on body image in ED patients to reduce the frequency of NSSI. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Elucidating personal factors that may protect against the adverse psychological outcomes of cyberbullying victimisation might help guide more effective screening and school intervention. No studies have yet examined the role of emotional intelligence (EI) and gender in adolescent victims of cyberbullying and how these dimensions might interact in explaining cybervictimisation experiences. The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between EI and cybervictimisation, and the interactive link involving EI skills and gender as predictors of cyberbullying victimisation in a sample of 1,645 Spanish adolescents (50.6% female), aged between 12 and 18 years. Regarding the prevalence of cybervictimisation, our results indicated that over 83.95% of the sample were considered non-cybervictims, while 16.05% experienced occasional or severe cybervictimisation. Additionally, findings indicated that deficits in EI and its dimensions were positively associated with cybervictimisation in both genders, but were stronger in females. Besides, a significant emotion regulation x gender association was found in explaining cyber-victimisation experiences. While no interaction was found for males, for females the deficits of emotion regulation were significantly associated with greater victimisation. Our findings provide empirical support for theoretical work connecting EI skills, gender and cybervictimisation, suggesting emotion regulation skills might be considered as valuable resources, as well as their inclusion in new gender-tailored cybervictimisation prevention programmes.

AB Childhood obesity is multi factorial health condition, so the simple evaluation of body fat will not be sufficed to manage the global epidemic of childhood obesity. Literature consistently provides evidence for physical health risks associated with childhood obesity; however in recent times, mental health of the obese children has also gained attention of the researchers as well as clinicians. Obese children experience number of psycho-social problems that significantly affect their quality of life and wellbeing. Co-morbid psychosocial and emotional problems of obesity generally act as causal or maintaining factors of obesity and thus significantly affect the treatment outcome. Therefore it becomes imperative for the clinicians/pediatricians to broaden their clinical assessment and include screening of important psychosocial factors within the clinical examination of childhood obesity. This article provides an evidence based comprehensive overview about the psychological factors and psychiatric factors (depression, anxiety, eating disorder, stress, body shape concerns, low self esteem) associated with childhood obesity that can further be utilized in the evaluation and management of this epidemic. The article also elaborates the role of current evidence based psychological approaches such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for management of obesity in children and adolescents. CBT techniques combined with lifestyle intervention and involving parents have been recommended by literature repetitively. However, there are a number of environmental, familial and personal barriers that hinder the whole process of weight loss in children. The article also discusses potential strategies to overcome those barriers.

AB Research continues to highlight factors associated with developmental immaturity, including persistent delinquency. This article examines whether aspects of developmental immaturity, psychosocial maturity, and emotion regulation are responsive to therapeutic intervention. Fifty-seven female youth in secure residential juvenile justice facilities participated in a randomized controlled trial of the Juvenile Justice Anger Management (JJAM) Treatment for Girls, an intervention that targets skills relevant to psychosocial maturity, including problem-solving, coping, and emotion regulation. Participants in JJAM showed increases in temperance, providing evidence that intervention might stimulate psychosocial development. Implications for treatment, evaluation, and measurement of psychosocial maturity are discussed.

AB Objective: Children with deficits in emotional regulation operationalized by scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Attention Problems, Aggressive Behavior, and Anxious-Depressed subscales are more likely than others to manifest adverse outcomes. However, the transmission of this profile has not been well studied. The main aim of this study was to investigate the familiality of this profile. Method: Participants were youth probands with bipolar I (BP-I) disorder (N = 140), ADHD (N = 83), and controls (N = 117) and their siblings. Based on the CBCL emotional dysregulation profile, we classified children with severe emotional dysregulation (aggregate cut-off score 210) and emotional dysregulation (aggregate cut-off score 180 and <210). Results: Emotional dysregulation profile scores correlated positively between probands and siblings. Conclusion: Youth with emotional dysregulation are at increased risk to have siblings with similar deficits, suggesting that emotional dysregulation runs in families.

AB Research linking child maltreatment and dating violence in adolescence and emerging adulthood has proliferated in the past two decades; however, the precise mechanisms by which these experiences are related remain elusive. A trauma-informed perspective suggests four particularly promising mediators: maladaptive attachment, emotion regulation difficulties, emotional distress, and hostility. The current article characterizes the status of the empirical literature examining these four mediators using a study space analysis and a narrative review of existing research. An extensive literature search identified 42 papers (44 studies) that met the following criteria: (1) at least one measure of child maltreatment (emotional, physical, sexual, neglect, or exposure to intimate partner violence); (2) a measure of one of the four mediator variables; (3) a measure of dating violence perpetration or victimization; and (4) a sample of adolescents or young adults. The study space analysis suggested several important observations about the research on this topic, including a dearth of studies examining hostility as a mediator and little research using prospective designs or clinical samples. There are also limitations with the conceptualization and measurement of dating violence, child maltreatment, and some of the mediator variables. In addition, few studies examined more than one mediator variable in the same study. The narrative review suggested that maladaptive attachment (specifically insecure attachment styles), emotion regulation difficulties (specifically regulation of the emotion of anger), and emotional distress construed broadly represent promising mediators of the association between child maltreatment and dating violence, but conclusions about mediation must remain tentative given the state of the literature. The discussion offers recommendations for improved theoretical and empirical rigor to advance future research on mechanisms linking child maltreatment and dating violence.

AB It is important to gain more insight into specific subgroups of homeless young adults (HYA) to enable the development of tailored interventions that adequately meet their diverse needs and to improve their quality of life. Within a heterogeneous sample of HYA, we investigated whether subgroups are distinguishable based on risk- and protective factors for quality of life. In addition, differences between subgroups were examined regarding the socio-demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. A total of 393 HYA using shelter facilities in the Netherlands were approached to participate, between December 2011 and March 2013. Structured face-to-face interviews were administered approximately 2weeks after shelter admission by trained research assistants. A latent class analysis was conducted to empirically distinguish 251 HYA in subgroups based on common risk factors (former abuse, victimisation, psychological symptoms and substance use) and protective factors (resilience, family and social support and perceived health status). Additional analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used to compare subgroups on socio-demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. The latent class analysis yielded four highly interpretable subgroups: the at-risk subgroup, the high-risk and least protected subgroup, the low-risk subgroup and the higher functioning and protected subgroup. Subgroups of HYA with lower scores in risk factors showed higher scores in protective factors, the adaptive cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. Our findings confirm the need for targeted and tailored interventions for specific subgroups of HYA. Social workers need to be attentive to the pattern of risk- and protective factors in each individual to determine which risk factors are prominent and need to be targeted and which protective factors need to be enhanced to improve the quality of life of HYA.

AB We compared long-term growth patterns in teachers' and mothers' ratings of Overt Aggression, Covert Aggression, Oppositional Defiance, Impulsivity/inattention, and Emotion Dysregulation across developmental periods spanning kindergarten through grade 8 (ages 5 to 13 years). We also determined whether salient background characteristics and measures of child temperament and parenting risk differentially predicted growth in discrete categories of child externalizing symptoms across development. Participants were 549 kindergarten-age children (51% male; 83% European American; 17% African American) whose problem behaviors were rated by teachers and parents each successive year of development through 8th grade. Latent growth curve analyses were performed for each component scale, contrasting with an overall index of externalizing, in a piecewise fashion encompassing two periods of development: K-1and grades 1-8. Our findings showed that there were meaningful differences and similarities between informants in their levels of concern about specific forms of externalizing problems, patterns of change in problem behavior reports across development, and in the extent to which their ratings of specific problems were associated with distal and proximal covariates. Thus, these data provided novel information about issues that have received scant empirical attention and have important implications for understanding the development and prevention of children's long-term externalizing problems.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with disruptionsin reward sensitivity and regulatory processes. However, it is unclear whether thesedisruptions are better explained by comorbid disruptive behavior disorder (DBD)symptomology. This study sought to examine this question using multiple levels ofanalysis (i.e., behavior, autonomic reactivity). One hundred seventeen children (aged 6 to 12 years; 72.6% male; 69 with ADHD) completed theBalloon-Analogue Risk Task (BART) to assess external reward sensitivity behaviorally.Sympathetic-based internal reward sensitivity and parasympathetic-based regulationwere indexed via cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia(RSA), respectively. Children with ADHD exhibited reduced internal reward sensitivity (i.e.,lengthened PEP; F(1,112)=4.01, p=0.047) compared to healthy controls and werecharacterized by greater parasympathetic-based dysregulation (i.e., reduced RSAaugmentation F(1,112)=10.12, p=0.002). However, follow-up analyses indicated theADHD effect was better accounted for by comorbid DBD diagnoses; that is, childrenwith ADHD and comorbid ODD were characterized by reduced internal rewardsensitivity (i.e., lengthened PEP; t=2.47, p=0.046) and by parasympathetic-baseddysregulation (i.e., reduced RSA augmentation; t=3.51, p=0.002) in response to rewardwhen compared to typically developing youth. Furthermore, children with ADHD and comorbid CD exhibited greater behaviorally-based external reward sensitivity (i.e.,more total pops; F(3,110)= 5.96, p=0d ODD (t=3.56, p=0.003). Results suggest that disruptions in sensitivity to reward may be betterac.001) compared to children with ADHD only (t=3.87, p=0.001) and children with ADHD ancounted for, in part, by comorbid DBD.Key Words: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autonomic nervous system,disruptive behavior disorders, reward sensitivityPowered.

AB Childhood adverse experiences have been consistently documented to engender persistent changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to chronic stress. However, there has been very little research examining whether this effect can be elicited among children when using a standardized laboratory stress test, or whether such effects are found in non-Western youth. In the current study, 80 10-year-old Chinese children (45% girls, 4-5th grades) were selected from 970 students based on the experience of being bullied, resulting in a sample of 59 victims (physical, verbal, and relational/social), and a group of 21 nonbullied children with distributions of age and gender that were comparable. We examined the association between bullying victimization and cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) at six time points using repeated-measures analyses of variance. The results showed that the TSST was a valid protocol among Chinese children for testing the functioning of HPA axis, based on two indicators: cortisol increase in response to stressor, and cortisol decrease after stressor removal. Based on the TSST, both cortisol reactivity and total cortisol concentration over the course of TSST were higher in bullied children relative to nonbullied children. Moreover, there were no differences in cortisol levels between victimization sub-types. Our study extended prior findings, by showing that cortisol dysregulation in response to stress may be related to bullying victimization.

AB Objective: This cluster randomized trial (CRT) evaluated the efficacy of the Classroom Social, Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support (SCERTS) Intervention (CSI) compared with usual school-based education with autism training modules (ATM). Method: Sixty schools with 197 students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 129 classrooms were randomly assigned to CSI or ATM. Mean student age was 6.79 years (SD 1.05) and 81.2% were male. CSI teachers were trained on the model and provided coaching throughout the school year to assist with implementation. A CRT, with students nested within general and special education classrooms nested within schools, was used to evaluate student outcomes. Results: The CSI group showed significantly better outcomes than the ATM group on observed measures of classroom active engagement with respect to social interaction. The CSI group also had significantly better outcomes on measures of adaptive communication, social skills, and executive functioning with Cohen's d effect sizes ranging from 0.31 to 0.45. Conclusion: These findings support the preliminary efficacy of CSI, a classroom-based, teacher-implemented intervention for improving active engagement, adaptive communication, social skills, executive functioning, and problem behavior within a heterogeneous sample of students with ASD. This makes a significant contribution to the literature by demonstrating efficacy of a classroom-based teacher-implemented intervention with a heterogeneous group of students with ASD using both observed and reported measures.

SO INTERDISCIPLINARIA

DT Article
DE Stability; Victims; Aggressors; Emotional and behavioral problems;
   Adolescents
AB Bullying is an important risk factor for mental health of children and adolescents. Bullying is a subset of aggressive behavior, generally defined as an act intended to inflict injury or discomfort upon another student. There is considerable evidence for emotional problems (such as, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem) among children and young people who experience bullying or peer victimization, and between bullying and behavioral problems (aggression, antisocial behavior, and substance use), but cross-sectional studies cannot explore the direction of the relationship. Besides, longitudinal studies are crucial to explore stability of being victim and being aggressor. There are no many studies that has attempted to do this. In Latin American countries, such as Argentina, longitudinal studies are very scarce in this respect. Exploring the direction of the link between victimization and emotional problems is vital to identify targets of victimization in adolescents and reducing cost of victimization. So, the purpose of this research was examining stability of victims and aggressor in three-time points and determine the direction of the relationship between emotional problems (depression and anxiety) and victimization, on one hand, and between behavioral problems (antisocial behavior and aggression), on the other hand. To this end, data were obtained from a sample of 485 students from two secondary schools attending first course, second and third in Parana, Entre Rios. A 58% was female and 42% was males; M-age = 13.6. They were examined in May (Time 1, T1), August (Time 2, T2), and November (Time 3, T3). To measure victimization, they completed Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (tapping verbal, physical, relational, and cybervictimization and these kind of bullying), Kovacs Child Depression Inventory for depression, Rosenberg Psychosomatic Symptom Scale for anxiety, and aggressive behavior and antisocial behavior from Achebanch and Rescorla ASEBA (2001), and some socio demographic questions. Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured. Date was set up with Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22 and AMOS 16 to set up structural equation modeling (SEM). Results suggested that 15%, 16%, and 18% were victims in Tl , T2, and T3. As regarding being aggressor, the percentages were 9%, 10%, and 9%. With respect to stability of victim status in each of the three times, a 39% was victim in the three times; as regarding aggressor status, a 57% was aggressor in the three times. An autoregressive cross-lagged with index of victimization, scores on depression and anxiety in T1, T2, and T3 indicated an adequate model fit: CFI= .99, TLI= .96 and RMSEA= .08. Victimization at T1 predicted victimization at T2 and T3. Regarding the links between victimization and emotional problems, this relationship was reciprocal with respect to depression: victimization predicted depression at T2 and T3 and depression predicted victimization in both times, as well. The links between victimization and anxiety was non-significant. Reciprocal links between depression and anxiety were found. With respect to bullying, antisocial behavioral and aggression model, results indicated a good model fit: CFI= .99, TLI= .96, and RMSEA= .06. Findings suggested reciprocal links between bullying and aggression. Links between bullying and antisocial behavioral were non-significant. These results suggested stability in victim status and aggressor status, but also change in only a period of six month.
   Besides, results showed that the link between victimization and depression was reciprocal: depression was an antecedent but a consequence of victimization, as well; the same happened for bullying and aggression. So, these results are in line with a vast literature suggesting reciprocal effects. In the discussion, we provided further explanation of the results, considering domination theory among others. Finally, limitations and suggestion for carrying out future studies are provided.

AB The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the development of aggression in boys and girls by testing a model combining insights from both evolutionary theory and developmental psychology. A sample of 744 children (348 girls) between six and 13 years old was recruited in schools with high deprivation indices. Half of the sample (N=372; 40.1% girls) had received special educational services for behavioral and/or socio-emotional problems. Two trajectories for overt aggression and two trajectories for indirect aggression were identified and binomial logistic regressions were used to identify environmental predictors and sex-specific patterns of these trajectories. Results indicated that peer rejection predicted overt aggression and indirect aggression and that extraversion and male sex predicted overt aggression. The results also showed that interaction between parental practices and some child temperament traits predicted overt aggression (coercion and lack of supervision associated with extraversion or low effortful control) or indirect aggression (coercion and neglect associated with negative affect or low effortful control), and the absence of a father figure predicted high indirect aggression in girls.

AB The social risk factors for physical and relational peer victimization were examined within a mixed-gender sample of children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants were 124 children (ages 8-12 years; 48% boys), with 47% exhibiting sub-clinical or clinical elevations in ADHD symptoms. ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptom counts were assessed based on parent- and teacher-reports; parents rated children's social problems and teachers rated children's use of physical and relational aggression and experiences of physical and relational victimization. A multiple mediator model was used to test whether there were indirect effects of ADHD or ODD symptoms on physical and relational victimization through social problems, physical aggression, or relational aggression. At the bivariate level, ADHD and ODD symptoms were both significantly associated with higher rates of physical and relational victimization. In the mediational model, there were significant indirect effects of ADHD symptoms on relational victimization via social problems, of ODD on relational victimization via relational aggression, and of ODD symptoms on physical victimization via physical aggression. Results suggest that there are distinct risk factors implicated in the physical and relational victimization of youth with ADHD and that the co-occurrence of ODD symptoms is important to assess. Clinical implications for addressing victimization in children with ADHD are discussed.

When it comes to diabetes, findings suggest that distress might play a key role in the acquisition and maintenance of health habits associated with diabetic management. This report describes two studies examining the roles of emotional abilities in diabetic management from two different conceptual points of view using two culturally different samples. In study 1, we examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and HbA1c levels in a sample of eighty-five patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) in Israel. In study 2, we examined the relationship between specific emotional regulation strategies and HbA1c in sixty-seven adolescents with DM1, while examining the mediating role of distress in this association. The results showed a negative association between emotional intelligence and HbA1c levels, even after controlling for potential intervening factors. We found that the relationship between difficulties in emotion regulation and HbA1c seemed to be mediated by diabetes-related distress. These findings may aid in the design of psychological models for future research as well as interventions aimed at improving emotional abilities in people with DM1.

AB Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in cognitive and emotional self-control. Optical technique acquisitions, such as near infrared spectro-scopy (NIRS), seem to be very promising during developmental ages, as they are non-invasive techniques and less influenced by body movements than other neuroimaging methods. Recently, these new techniques are being widely used to measure neural correlates underlying neuropsychological deficits in children with ADHD.
   Methods: In a short series of articles, we will review the results of functional NIRS (fNIRS) studies in children with ADHD. The present brief review will focus on the results of the fNIRS studies that investigate cortical activity during neuropsychological and/or emotional tasks.
   Results: According to the reviewed studies, children and adolescents with ADHD show peculiar cortical activation both during neurological and emotional tasks, and the majority of the reviewed studies revealed lower prefrontal cortex activation in patients compared to typically developmental controls.
   Limitations: a consistent interpretation of these results is limited by the substantial methodological heterogeneity including patients' medication status and washout period, explored cerebral regions, neuropsychological tasks, number of channels and sampling temporal resolutions.
   Conclusions: fNIRS seems to be a promising tool for investigating neural substrates of emotional dysregulation and executive function deficits in individuals with ADHD during developmental ages.

AB Little is known about the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and trait creativity (TC), and the brain structural bases which involves. This study investigated the neuroanatomical basis of the association between EI and TC which measured by the Schutte self-report EI scale and the Williams creativity aptitude test. First, the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was used to explore the brain structures which is closely related to EI in a large young sample (n = 213). The results showed that EI was positively correlated with the regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is regarded as a key region of emotional processing. More importantly, further mediation analysis revealed that rGMV in the right OFC partially mediated the association between EI and TC, which showed the OFC volume could account for the relationship between EI and TC. These findings confirmed the close relationship between EI and TC, and highlighted that the brain volumetric variation in the OFC associated with the top-down processing of emotion regulation, which may play a critical role in the promotion of TC. Together, these findings contributed to sharpening the understanding of the complex relationship between EI and TC from the perspective of brain structural basis.

AB Humans have an innate set of emotions recognised universally. However, emotion recognition also depends on socio-cultural rules. Although adults recognise vocal emotions universally, they identify emotions more accurately in their native language. We examined developmental trajectories of universal vocal emotion recognition in children. Eighty native English speakers completed a vocal emotion recognition task in their native language (English) and foreign languages (Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic) expressing anger, happiness, sadness, fear, and neutrality. Emotion recognition was compared across 8-to-10, 11-to-13-year-olds, and adults. Measures of behavioural and emotional problems were also taken. Results showed that although emotion recognition was above chance for all languages, native English speaking children were more accurate in recognising vocal emotions in their native language. There was a larger improvement in recognising vocal emotion from the native language during adolescence. Vocal anger recognition did not improve with age for the nonn-ative languages. This is the first study to demonstrate universality of vocal emotion recognition in children whilst supporting an "in-group advantage" for more accurate recognition in the native language. Findings highlight the role of experience in emotion recognition, have implications for child development in modern multicultural societies and address important theoretical questions about the nature of emotions.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviors are self-injurious behaviors inflicted without intending death. Literature has shown the relationship between stressful life events (SLE) and NSSI behaviors. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Dysregulation Profile (SDQ-DP) is defined as an index of self-regulatory problems, related to higher risk for suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents. In this study the relationship between SDQ-DP and NSSI behaviors, mediated by SLE in a clinical sample of children and adolescents is analyzed. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 239 subjects (aged from 11 to 17) to test the mediation model. SDQ-DP significantly correlates with NSSI behaviors (Wald = 6.5477, p = .0105); SDQ-DP significantly correlates with SLE (T = 5.7229, p < .001); SLE significantly correlates NSSI behaviors, and the relation remains significant whilst controlling for SDQ-DP (Wald = 4.1715, p = .041); the relation between SDQ-DP and NSSI behaviors stops being significant whilst controlling for the potential mediator (SLE) (Wald = 2.9951, p = .0835). Study of indirect effect supports the mediation model (.0585 CT [.0016, 1266]) Findings are compatible with the complete mediation scenario. These results point out the importance of self-regulatory problems in coping strategies with regards to SLE and the development of NSSI behaviors.

AB Women are particularly vulnerable to anxiety and depressive disorders. This greater vulnerability has been partly attributed to post-pubertal sex hormone fluctuations, estradiol and progesterone, as well as gender-specific tendencies to engage in maladaptive forms of emotion regulation, particularly rumination. To date, no research has investigated whether sex hormones are associated with emotion regulation in women. In the present study, 61 women participated in a sad mood induction task, involving the viewing of an emotive film. Negative affect was assessed immediately and following recovery, along with self-reported use of rumination, reappraisal, and suppression. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone were assessed through a blood sample taken at the end of the experiment. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between serum hormones and self-reported emotional regulation strategy use, and between serum hormones and the impact of these strategies on negative affect. Estradiol levels positively predicted rumination, but not suppression or reappraisal use. Moreover, estradiol and progesterone interacted with emotion regulation strategies to predict negative affect following the sad mood induction. Reappraisal was associated with greater negative affect only in women with high estradiol, and in women with high progesterone. Conversely, rumination was associated with greater negative affect only in women with low estradiol. Together, these results suggest that sex hormone concentration may be an endogenous contextual factor that is associated with the selection and consequences of emotion regulation strategies in women.

AB This study sought to examine age-related differences in the influences of social (neutral, emotional faces) and non-social/non-emotional (shapes) distractor stimuli in children, adolescents, and adults. To assess the degree to which distractor, or task-irrelevant, stimuli of varying social and emotional salience interfere with cognitive performance, children (N = 12; 8-12y), adolescents (N = 17; 13-17y), and adults (N = 17; 18-52y) completed the Emotional Identification and Dynamic Faces (EIDF) task. This task included three types of dynamically-changing distractors: (1) neutral-social (neutral face changing into another face); (2) emotional-social (face changing from 0% emotional to 100% emotional); and (3) non-social/non-emotional (shapes changing from small to large) to index the influence of task-irrelevant social and emotional information on cognition. Results yielded no age-related differences in accuracy but showed an age-related linear reduction in correct reaction times across distractor conditions. An age-related effect in interference was observed, such that children and adults showed slower response times on correct trials with socially-salient distractors; whereas adolescents exhibited faster responses on trials with distractors that included faces rather than shapes. A secondary study goal was to explore individual differences in cognitive interference. Results suggested that regardless of age, low trait anxiety and high effortful control were associated with interference to angry faces. Implications for developmental differences in affective processing, notably the importance of considering the contexts in which purportedly irrelevant social and emotional informationmight impair, vs. improve cognitive control, are discussed.

AB Two experiments addressed the issue of age-related differences and emotion-specific patterns in emotion regulation during adolescence. Experiment 1 examined emotion-specific patterns in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction strategies in 14-year-old adolescents (N = 50). Adolescents were instructed to answer spontaneously or to downregulate their responses by using either distraction or cognitive reappraisal strategies before viewing negative pictures and were asked to rate their emotional state after picture presentation. Results showed that reappraisal effectiveness was modulated by emotional content but distraction was not. Reappraisal was more effective than distraction at regulating fear or anxiety (threat-related pictures) but was similar to distraction regarding other emotions. Using the same paradigm, Experiment 2 examined in 12-year-old (N = 56), 13-year-old (N = 49) and 15-year-old adolescents (N = 54) the age-related differences a) in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction when implemented and b) in the everyday use of regulation strategies using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Results revealed that regulation effectiveness was equivalent for both strategies in 12-year-olds, whereas a large improvement in reappraisal effectiveness was observed in 13- and 15-year-olds. No age differences were observed in the reported use of reappraisal, but older adolescents less frequently reported using distraction and more frequently reported using the rumination strategy. Taken together, these experiments provide new findings regarding the use and the effectiveness of cognitive regulation strategies during adolescence in terms of age differences and emotion specificity.

AB This study explored the effects of the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) on child survivors of the earthquakes that struck Umbria, a region of central Italy, on August 24th and on October 26th 2016. Three hundred and thirty-two children from the town of Norcia and nearby severely disrupted villages received 3 cycles of EMDR-IGTP. The Emotion Thermometers (ET-5) and the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) were administered before (T0) and about 1 week after the conclusion of the third cycle (T3) of EMDR-IGTP. At T3, older children showed a reduction of distress and anger, whereas younger children reported an increase on these domains; moreover, older children reported a greater reduction of anxiety than younger ones. A greater reduction of distress, anxiety, and need for help was evidenced in females, whereas a greater improvement in depressive symptoms was evidenced in males. The effects of the EMDR-IGTP treatment on post-traumatic symptoms were particularly evident in older children, compared to younger ones, and marginally greater in females than in males; moreover, a greater improvement was found in children who had received a timelier intervention, than in those who received delayed treatment. These results provide further evidence for the utility of EMDR-IGTP in dealing with the extensive need for mental health services in mass disaster contexts. Also, these data highlight the importance of providing EMDR-IGTP in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, to contribute significantly in restoring adaptive psychological functioning in children, especially in older ones.

AB There has been increasing interest in the identification of factors that promote resilience to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in high-risk youth. The present review summarizes and critiques the current literature on protective factors that promote resilience to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in those children and adolescents who are at high risk for these outcomes. In contrast to earlier work on this topic, which primarily focused on internal, psychological protective factors, the current review articulates an ecological model of resilience in youth that spans multiple domains, including the individual, parents, family, friends, peers, school, community, and culture. This model encompasses individual assets such as problem-solving ability and emotion regulation as well as ecological resources such as parent-child relationship quality, family functioning, peer acceptance, supportive school climate, and engagement in meaningful activities and interests. The present review suggests that future research on resilience to suicidality in youth may benefit from taking a multi-dimensional approach that is grounded in current theories on suicidal thoughts and behavior. The results also suggest that suicide prevention and intervention programs for youth may benefit from a domain-spanning approach that helps teens to enhance their connection to friends, family, and community while teaching them vital internal coping skills.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often present with prominent emotion dysregulation that requires treatment but can be difficult to measure. The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) was created using methods developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) to capture observable indicators of poor emotion regulation. Caregivers of 1,755 youth with ASD completed 66 candidate EDI items, and the final 30 items were selected based on classical test theory and item response theory (IRT) analyses. The analyses identified two factors: (a) Reactivity, characterized by intense, rapidly escalating, sustained, and poorly regulated negative emotional reactions, and (b) Dysphoria, characterized by anhedonia, sadness, and nervousness. The final items did not show differential item functioning (DIF) based on gender, age, intellectual ability, or verbal ability. Because the final items were calibrated using IRT, even a small number of items offers high precision, minimizing respondent burden. IRT co-calibration of the EDI with related measures demonstrated its superiority in assessing the severity of emotion dysregulation with as few as seven items. Validity of the EDI was supported by expert review, its association with related constructs (e.g., anxiety and depression symptoms, aggression), higher scores in psychiatric inpatients with ASD compared to a community ASD sample, and demonstration of test-retest stability and sensitivity to change. In sum, the EDI provides an efficient and sensitive method to measure emotion dysregulation for clinical assessment, monitoring, and research in youth with ASD of any level of cognitive or verbal ability.

   Lay SummaryThis paper describes a new measure of poor emotional control called the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI). Caregivers of 1,755 youth with ASD completed candidate items, and advanced statistical techniques were applied to identify the best final items. The EDI is unique because it captures common emotional problems in ASD and is appropriate for both nonverbal and verbal youth. It is an efficient and sensitive measure for use in clinical assessments, monitoring, and research with youth with ASD.

AB Purpose: Children and youth in out-of-home care have high rates of behavioral health need, and states are increasingly adopting screening protocols to identify and intervene with these youth. This study presents longitudinal analyses of the case flow of youth aged 3-17 in Washington State's foster care system, tracking rates of screening, scoring above or below clinical criteria cutoff scores, and service receipt. This study describes what variables are associated with these three decision points.
   Results: Eighty-nine percent of eligible youth were screened for behavioral health need soon after entry in to out of-home care; most of those who were not screened were already receiving behavioral health services. Sixty-one percent scored above criteria on at least one screening measure by at least one respondent. Sixty percent of those who scored above criteria and 33% of those who scored below criteria received at least one behavioral health service within 4 months of entry to care. After controlling for all variables, screening above criteria was related to age, race/ethnicity, county rurality, abuse type, reason for out-of-home placement, past behavioral health service receipt, and type of past diagnosis. Service receipt for those scoring above criteria was related to age, race/ethnicity, county rurality, abuse type, and type of prior behavioral health diagnosis.
   Conclusions: The role of screening in child welfare is dynamic and influenced by multiple factors. In the current study, youth screening above criteria was related to increased rates of service receipt. However, many children with behavioral health service needs did not receive services. The relatively high rates of youth scoring below criteria but receiving services may indicate a need for ongoing systematic screening in order to identify emergent needs, or additional screening measures at intake. States considering or employing the use of screening tools should weigh a variety of approaches to screening, assessment, and referral to services in order to ensure maximal benefit.

AB Purpose of Review To explore the sequence and interaction of infancy and early childhood risk factors, particularly relating to disturbances in the social environment, and how the consequences of such exposures can promote weight gain and obesity.
   Recent Findings This review will argue that socioeconomic adversity is a key upstream catalyst that sets the stage for critical midstream risk factors such as family strain and dysfunction, offspring insecurity, stress, emotional turmoil, low self-esteem, and poor mental health. These midstream risk factors, particularly stress and emotional turmoil, create a more or less perfect foil for calorie-dense junk food self-medication and subtle addiction, to alleviate uncomfortable psychological and emotional states.
   Summary Disturbances in the social environment during infancy and early childhood appear to play a critical role in weight gain and obesity, through such mechanisms as insecurity, stress, and emotional turmoil, eventually leading to junk food self-medication and subtle addiction.

AB This paper aims to synthesize research relating to youth responses to school shootings between 2014 and 2017. The main questions it addresses are how such events impact young people psychologically, and what risk or protective factors may contribute to different trajectories of recovery?
   Recent research suggests that most young people exposed to school shootings demonstrate resilience, exhibiting no long-term dysfunction. However, a minority will experience severe and chronic symptoms. The likelihood of experiencing clinically significant reactions is influenced by pre-trauma functioning as well as peri-traumatic and post-traumatic factors. These include proximity to the trauma, peri-traumatic dissociation, post-traumatic emotional regulation difficulties, social support, and flexibility of coping styles.
   Research that separates the distinguishing features of young people with differing recovery styles is vital to tailor intervention. But methodological and design issues associated with such research necessitates caution in drawing conclusions. Variation in definitions and measures and the self-report nature of many of the studies are potential sources of bias. Greater uniformity across designs would enhance confidence and allow for improved evidence-based intervention.

AB Background: Very preterm (VPT) birth refers to an early stressful event putting children at heightened risk for emotional difficulties. However, there is an important individual variability, leaving unexplained why some VPT children do not develop emotional difficulties, while others develop such difficulties in the early years or later in life.
   Aim: In this study, we examined whether perinatal stress is a risk factor explaining heterogeneities in emotional problems in VPT children.
   Methods: Thirty-six VPT children and 22 full-term born (FT) children participated in an 11 year-long study. Risk for perinatal stress was assessed at birth with the Perinatal Risk Inventory. Mothers reported children's emotional difficulties at 18 months of child age on the Symptom Checklist and at 11 years on the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Results indicated significant differences in emotional scores at 11 years not only between VPT and FT children but also between the low and high perinatal stress groups. More importantly, emotional scores at 18 months influenced variability in internalizing scores at 11 years only in VPT children with high perinatal stress.
   Conclusion: Although prematurity affects the emotional abilities of preadolescents, the link between emotional skills in early and later childhood is moderated by the severity of perinatal stress. In particular, VPT children who are born with more complications, and as such experience a more stressful perinatal environment, are more likely to show emotional difficulties at preadolescence.

AB Parents are the main socialization agents in the development of emotion regulation (ER). In this study, we evaluated adolescents' and their respective parents' perspectives about their use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) in daily life. In addition, we evaluated the within-family associations between adolescents' and their parents' use of strategies. We controlled for adolescents' gender and age and the perceived quality of their relationships with their parents (mothers and fathers). The sample consisted of 33 12- to 18-year-old adolescent-father-mother triads, totaling 99 participants. Parents and adolescents reported their use of ER strategies in response to eight random prompts throughout the day, by means of the experience sampling method for 1 week. Participants provided 4082 reports on their momentary experiences. The data were analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the repeated daily assessments. The significant association between parents' and adolescents' use of ER strategies was specific to mother-adolescent dyads. The significant association between adolescents' and their mothers' ER strategies varied as a function of the adolescents' age and the quality of their relationship with their mothers according to adolescents' reports, but not as a function of adolescent gender. These findings suggest that mothers have a role in their adolescents' emotion regulation in a developmental period characterized by autonomy from parental guidance.

AB How Latino youth cope with stressors may have implications for their adjustment. We examined how a temperamental characteristic (effortful control) and a contextual factor (economic hardship) were associated with Latino youth's coping. Individual differences in effortful control, a core facet of self-regulation, may contribute to coping as effortful control is consistently linked to adaptive behaviors during adolescence. We examined relations of effortful control and economic hardship to active coping in a sample of Mexican-origin youth (N = 674) across three time points (fifth to ninth grades). Although economic hardship negatively predicted coping and effortful control, effortful control positively predicted coping (controlling for prior levels). Findings support a resilience perspective by suggesting that effortful control may contribute to coping and thus counteract the negative effects of economic hardship.

AB We report on two longitudinal studies, where we examined how stability and change in attachment to parents and peers from the first to last year of college were associated with changes in theoretically relevant outcomes. As expected, students with consistently secure parental and peer attachment evidenced the best academic, social, and emotional functioning overall. Participants with stable secure parental attachment reported significant increases in their academic and emotional functioning and their social competencies; on the other hand, students with consistently low parental attachment showed a decline in their emotional functioning. Participants with stable secure peer attachment also reported lower overall levels of depression and loneliness, better social competence, and more favorable attitudes about help-seeking. Finally, students who transitioned from lower to higher parental attachment showed significant declines in loneliness; those transitioning from low to high peer attachment evidenced a significant increase in social functioning. We discuss implications for how college-based programming might serve to forestall declines in parental/peer attachment and/or facilitate skill building among students who identify with a more insecure style at college entry.

AB The overall purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of parents' coping strategies on the relationship between parents' emotional intelligence and sideline verbal behaviors during their children's soccer games. Participants were 232 parents (120 mothers and 110 fathers) of youth soccer players age 9-13 years. Observations in situ were carried out at 30 soccer games during a soccer tournament. At the end of the game, parents were approached and asked to complete the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Brief COPE scale. Structural-equation-modeling analyses revealed that adaptive and maladaptive coping mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and parents' praise/encouragement, and negative and derogatory comments during the game. In addition, game result moderated the relationships between emotional intelligence, coping strategies, and parent behaviors. Emotional regulation and adaptive coping may promote desirable parent sideline behaviors and reduce undesirable behaviors.

We provide a rationale for including neuroscience in social work practice and research, and we offer an overview of brain basics and neuroimaging technologies used in research. Select neuroscience findings related to cognition and emotion that pertain to the identification, prediction, and treatment of physical and mental health of young people in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence are discussed. Finally, we review potential benefits and limitations in the integration of neuroscience and social work, and we identify future directions for neuroscience and social work scholarship aimed at promoting healthy youth development.

AB This study investigated the association between maternal affective expression during laboratory-based interaction tasks and adolescents' experience of positive affect (PA) in natural settings. Participants were 80 healthy adolescents and their mothers. Durations of maternal positive (PA) and negative affective (NA) expressions were observed during a conflict resolution task and a positive event planning interaction task. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures were employed to assess adolescents' momentary and peak experience of PA in daily life. Results indicated that maternal NA, but not maternal PA, was related to adolescents' EMA-reported PA. Adolescents whose mothers expressed more NA experienced less PA in daily environments. Results suggest that adolescents' exposure to maternal negative affective behavior is associated with adolescents' subjective daily well-being.

   DEPRESSION
AB Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait that reflects a tendency to experience heightened negative affect and susceptibility to stress. Negative emotionality has been associated with fronto-limbic brain structures and connecting fibre tracts. The major fibre tracts connecting the frontal and limbic brain regions are the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. We previously found that healthy adults with higher neuroticism scores had decreased left relative to right fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cingulum. Both cingulum and uncinate fasciculus FA increases throughout childhood and into early adulthood. Since adolescence is associated with an increased incidence of anxiety and mood disorders, for which neuroticism is a known risk factor, the question arises whether the association between neuroticism and fronto-limbic white matter microstructure asymmetry is already present in children and adolescents or whether such relationship emerges during this age period. To address this question, we assessed 72 typically-developing 10-to-15 year-olds with diffusion-weighted imaging on a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner. Neuroticism was assessed with the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. FA and parallel and perpendicular diffusivity measures were extracted for cingulum, uncinate fasciculus as well as the white matter underlying the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Higher neuroticism scores were associated with decreased left relative to right cingulum FA in boys, while in girls, higher neuroticism scores were associated with increased left relative to right cingulum and ventromedial prefrontal white matter FA, indicating that there are sex differences in the neural correlates of neuroticism. Our findings suggest that the link between neuroticism and frontal-limbic white matter microstructure asymmetry likely predates early adolescence. Future studies need to elucidate the significance of the observed sex differences in the neural correlates of neuroticism.

Participants' primary caregivers completed questionnaires assessing their child's coping and depressive symptoms. Results Verbal comprehension was significantly positively associated with secondary control coping (cognitive reappraisal, acceptance, distraction), and both working memory and secondary control coping were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. In partial support of the primary study hypothesis, verbal comprehension had an indirect association with depressive symptoms through secondary control coping, whereas working memory had a direct association with depressive symptoms. Conclusions The results provide new evidence for the associations between cognitive function and coping, and the association of both of these processes with depressive symptoms in children with SCD. Findings provide potential implications for clinical practice, including interventions to improve children's cognitive functioning to attenuate depressive symptoms.

AB Study Objectives: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used self-report questionnaire that assesses general sleep quality. This study aimed to validate the single-factor scoring structure and related psychometric properties in the English language version of the PSQI in community-based adolescents.
   Methods: Participants were 889 (352 males, 39.6%) students (age M = 15.71 +/- 1.57; 12.08-18.92 years) recruited from 14 Australian secondary schools. Participants completed the PSQI, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of PSQI component scores were performed on two independent random half-samples (i.e. cross-validation approach). The internal consistency of PSQI components and convergent validity of the PSQI global score with CES-D and SCAS total scores were also assessed.
   Results: EFA yielded a single-factor model. CFA of the single-factor model in a separate sample yielded acceptable model fit to the data after important relationships were modeled. Namely, modification indices suggested improved model fit by correlating residual scores of PSQI components of sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and sleep efficiency and sleep latency. Internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73). The PSQI global score had moderate-to-large positive correlations with CES-D (r = 0.58) and SCAS (r = 0.45) total scores, demonstrating good convergent validity with emotional problems as predicted.
   Conclusions: The findings validate the single-factor scoring structure of the PSQI in an adolescent sample and highlight important covariation between poor sleep duration, efficiency, and latency in this age group. Further validation studies are required to determine an appropriate PSQI clinical cut-off score for adolescents.

AB Background: Executive functions are higher cognitive control functions, which are essential to physical and psychological well-being, academic performance, and healthy social relationships. Executive functions can be trained, albeit without broad transfer, to this date. Broad transfer entails the translation of improved cognitive functions to daily life (behaviors). The intervention Train your Mind was designed to train executive functions among elementary school children aged 9 to 11 years, and obtain broad transfer in terms of enhanced physical activity, healthy eating, and socioemotional regulation.
   Objective: This paper aims to describe the cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the Train your Mind intervention.
   Methods: Train your Mind was integrated into the existing school curriculum for 8 months (25 weeks excluding holidays). The effectiveness of the intervention was tested in a cluster randomized trial comprising 13 schools, 34 groups (school classes), and 800 children, using a battery of 6 computer tasks at pre-and postmeasurement. Each of the 3 core executive functions was measured by 2 tasks (Flanker and Go/No-Go; N-Back and Running Span; Attention Switching Task and Dots/Triangles). Moreover, we administered questionnaires that measure emotion-regulation, cognitive errors, physical activity, dietary habits, and the psycho-social determinants of diet and physical activity. Body mass index was also measured. Multilevel analyses will account for clustering at the school and group levels, and randomization took place at the school level.
   Results: Results are currently being analyzed.
   Conclusions: The main purpose of this study is to test Train your Mind's effectiveness in enhancing executive functions. Second, we investigate whether increased executive functions lead to improved physical activity and healthy eating. If found effective, executive function training could easily be integrated into school curricula everywhere, and as such, boost health, academic performance, and emotion-regulation of elementary school children, in a cost-effective manner.

AB AimCardiovascular disease and mental illness commonly co-occur in later life, but it is unknown how early these associations arise. We aimed to determine the extent to which: (i) childhood mental health is associated with functional and structural cardiovascular risk phenotypes and adiposity in late childhood/adolescence, and (ii) associations between mental health and cardiovascular phenotypes may be explained by differential body mass index.
   MethodsThis cross-sectional study drew on three longitudinal community-based cohort studies (two enriched for overweight/obesity) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, with harmonized follow-up in 2014. Mental health exposures included emotional and behavioural problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) and psychosocial health and general well-being (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)), which were assessed by self- and parent-proxy report. Cardiovascular risk phenotypes and adiposity measures included mean arterial pressure, pulse wave velocity, carotid artery intima-media thickness, retinal arterioleto-venule ratio, waist circumference, % body fat, and BMI z-score. We used multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex and neighbourhood disadvantage, to examine associations.
   ResultsOf the 364 participants (mean age 14.7, standard deviation 2.0, years), 30% were overweight and 16% obese. All adiposity indicators were positively associated with higher behavioural/emotional problems and poorer psychosocial health and negatively associated with better ratings of positive general well-being, as reported by parents and children (all P 0.03). However, there was little evidence that cardiovascular functional or structural phenotypes varied by mental health.
   ConclusionsBy late childhood/adolescence, mental health is strongly associated with adiposity but not with cardiovascular structure or function. This suggests that the known relationship between these constructs may not develop until early or mid-adulthood.

AB In this article, we explore how young women in Sweden negotiate their gendered subject positions in relation to psychiatric diagnoses, particularly Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the meanings of their own violent acts. The data consists of transcripts of face-to-face interviews with young women who have experienced using aggressive and violent acts. Given that the analysis is informed by ideas developed in discursive psychology, we identified the centrality of the concepts of responsibility and self-management. In this study responsibility is connected to gendered notions of passivity and activity. What we call the ordinary girl is neither too active nor too passive, and the extraordinary girl is either too active or too passive in the managing of herself. Similar to those of a troublesome past, the narratives of ADHD enable the understanding of an intelligible violent self, and therefore make female externalized violence what we describe as narrative-able.

AB Individuals with social interaction anxiety, a facet of social anxiety disorder, withdraw from or avoid social encounters and generally avoid risks. However, a subset engages in health risk sexual behavior (HRSB). Because sensation seeking, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity predict engagement in HRSB among adolescents and young adults, the present study hypothesized that latent classes of social interaction anxiety and these personality traits would differentially predict likelihood of engagement in HRSB. Finite mixture modeling was used to discern four classes: two low social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by facets of emotion dysregulation, positive urgency, and negative urgency (Low SIAS High Urgency and Low SIAS Low Urgency) and two high social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive urgency, negative urgency, risk seeking, and facets of emotion dysregulation (High SIAS High Urgency and High SIAS Low Urgency). HRSB were entered into the model as auxiliary distal outcomes. Of importance to this study were findings that the High SIAS High Urgency class was more likely to engage in most identified HRSB than the High SIAS Low Urgency class. This study extends previous findings on the heterogeneity of social interaction anxiety by identifying the effects of social interaction anxiety and personality on engagement in HRSB.

AB This article presents an overview of current knowledge regarding the aetiology of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). It begins with a brief synopsis of early research and theory, and discusses how changing conceptualisations of BPD have impacted on our aetiological knowledge. Contemporary theories are described and presented within a developmental psychopathology framework. Deficient co-regulation and social communication in infancy are purported to underpin emotional dysregulation and social cognition deficits across development. These mechanisms are further potentiated by maladaptive social experiences in a series of positive feedback loops. Prospective research provides preliminary evidence for the reciprocal (or mediating) effects of maladaptive experiences and childhood dysregulation. Moving forward, cohort studies may incorporate neurobiological assessments to examine the biological systems underpinning phenotypic (e.g., impulsivity, disturbed relatedness) covariation.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an effective treatment for an increasing number of mental disorders. Its increased application to a range of disorders has been prompted by the recognition that DBT targets emotion dysregulation, which is a transdiagnostic feature underlying several forms of psychopathology. More recently, DBT has been used to target additional clinically relevant domains that are outside diagnostically bound categories, such as improving parenting quality as a means of preventing psychopathology in children of parents with psychopathology. As the ability to regulate emotions is critical to parenting, this paper uses the connection between DBT, emotion regulation, and parenting as an illustration of how focusing on mechanistic features by which DBT is effective aids in strategically identifying areas by which DBT may be a highly useful treatment option.

AB Mindfulness training has been used to improve emotional wellbeing in early adolescents. However, little is known about treatment outcome moderators, or individual differences that may differentially impact responses to treatment. The current study focused on gender as a potential moderator for affective outcomes in response to school-based mindfulness training. Sixth grade students (N = 100) were randomly assigned to either the six weeks of mindfulness meditation or the active control group as part of a history class curriculum. Participants in the mindfulness meditation group completed short mindfulness meditation sessions four to five times per week, in addition to didactic instruction (Asian history). The control group received matched experiential activity in addition to didactic instruction (African history) from the same teacher with no meditation component. Self-reported measures of emotional wellbeing/affect, mindfulness, and self-compassion were obtained at pre and post intervention. Meditators reported greater improvement in emotional wellbeing compared to those in the control group. Importantly, gender differences were detected, such that female meditators reported greater increases in positive affect compared to females in the control group, whereas male meditators and control males displayed equivalent gains. Uniquely among females but not males, increases in self-reported self compassion were associated with improvements in affect. These findings support the efficacy of school-based mindfulness interventions, and interventions tailored to accommodate distinct developmental needs of female and male adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: With this study, we examined the efficacy of a health intervention program that was focused on emotion regulation (ER) skills in reducing sexual risk behaviors among early adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms.
   METHODS: Seventh grade adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms participated in a 6-week, after-school sexual risk prevention trial in which a counterbalanced, within-school design comparing an ER focused program to a time- and attention-matched comparison group was used. Adolescents completed a computer-based survey regarding their sexual behavior at 6-month intervals for 2.5 years.
   RESULTS: Adolescents who received ER skills training exhibited a delay in the transition to vaginal sex over 30 months compared with those in the comparison condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [0.42 to 0.89]). They also reported fewer instances of condomless sex over the follow-up period (adjusted rate ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval [0.14 to 0.90]). Among those who were sexually active, those in the ER condition reported fewer instances of vaginal or anal sex (adjusted rate ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [0.32 to 0.99]).
   CONCLUSIONS: An intervention used to teach ER skills for the context of health decision-making resulted in lower risk among young adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms by delaying the onset of vaginal sex as well as reducing penetrative acts without a condom. Incorporating emotion education into health education may have important health implications for this age group.

AB The Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI) is a comprehensive self-report measure of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). In an effort to build on past research and further validate the OSI, this study presents a confirmatory factor analysis of the OSI's subscales measuring the functions and addictive features of NSSI using a university sample. Participants were 316 university students aged 17-25 years (84.8% female) who had engaged in NSSI at least once in their lifetime. Consistent with past research, results confirmed the four-factor structure of the Functions items (Internal Emotion Regulation, Social Influence, External Emotion Regulation, Sensation Seeking), as well as the single-factor structure of Addictive Features items. Correlations calculated between the obtained factors and indicators of NSSI severity revealed that higher endorsement of NSSI's Internal Emotion Regulation functions, External Emotion Regulation functions, and Addictive Features were associated with more frequent lifetime NSSI, recent (past 6 months) NSSI, and greater distress regarding NSSI urges; greater endorsement of NSSI's Sensation Seeking functions was also linked with more frequent lifetime NSSI. Results provide further support for the OSI's psychometric properties in a university sample, and offer additional evidence for links between specific NSSI functions and addictive features and more severe manifestations of the behavior.

AB The present study examines cricketers' perceptions of emotional interactions between competitors. Semistructured interviews with 12 male professional cricketers explored experiences (i.e., emotions, cognitions, behaviors) relating to incidents during competition where they or an opponent attempted to evoke an emotional reaction (e.g., sledging). Cricketers described their use of sledging as aggressive actions and verbal interactions with the aim of disrupting concentration and altering the emotional states of opponents. They described experiencing a variety of emotions (e.g., anxiety, anger) in response to opponents' attempts at interpersonal emotion regulation; linguistic analyses indicated that both positive than negative emotions were experienced. A range of strategies in response to competitors' deliberate attempts at interpersonal emotion regulation were outlined. The present study extends previous research investigating interpersonal emotion regulation within teams by indicating that professional cricketers are aware of the impact of cognitions and emotions on performance and attempt to negatively influence these factors in competitors.

AB Prior studies have found that parents' perceptions of control over their lives and their social support may both be important for parenting behaviors. Yet, few studies have examined their unique and interacting influence on parenting behaviors during early adolescence. This longitudinal study of rural parents in two-parent families (N = 636) investigated (a) whether perceived control and social support when their youth were in sixth grade were independently or interactively associated with changes in parenting behaviors (discipline, standard setting) and parent-child warmth and hostility 6 months later and (b) if these linkages differed by parent gender. We also investigated the interactive links between perceived control, social support, and parenting. Specifically, we tested if parents' perceived control moderated the linkages between social support and parenting and if these linkages differed by parent gender. Greater perceived control predicted more increases in parents' consistent discipline and standard setting, whereas greater social support predicted increases in parent-child warmth and decreases in parent-child hostility. Parental perceived control moderated the effect of social support on parental warmth: For mothers only, social support was significantly linked to parent-child warmth only when mothers had low (but not high) perceived self-control. The discussion focuses on reasons why perceived control and social support may have associations with different aspects of parenting and why these might differ for mothers and fathers.

AB Individual and group-based psychotherapeutic interventions increasingly incorporate mindfulness-based principles and practices. These practices include a versatile set of skills such as labeling and attending to present-moment experiences, acting with awareness, and avoiding automatic reactivity. A primary motivation for integrating mindfulness into these therapies is compelling evidence that it enhances emotion regulation. Research also demonstrates that family relationships have a profound influence on emotion regulation capacities, which are central to family functioning and prosocial behavior more broadly. Despite this evidence, no framework exists to describe how mindfulness might integrate into family therapy. This paper describes the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions, highlighting how and why informal mindfulness practices might enhance emotion regulation when integrated with family therapy. We provide a clinical framework for integrating mindfulness into family therapy, particularly as it applies to families with adolescents. A brief case example details sample methods showing how incorporating mindfulness practices into family therapy may enhance treatment outcomes. A range of assessment modalities from biological to behavioral demonstrates the breadth with which the benefits of a family-based mindfulness intervention might be evaluated.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare results of patients', parents', and caregivers' (nursing staff and educators) (self-)assessments of quality of life, treatment outcomes, and satisfaction with inpatient treatment in a child and adolescent psychiatric hospital. In addition, the investigation included a comparison between admission and discharge of the three investigated groups.
   The study considered adolescents at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hinterbruehl, along with their parents and caregivers. Following questionnaires at admission and discharge were used: the Youth Self-Report (YSR) or Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18), Inventory for Assessing Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (ILK), and Questionnaires of the Evaluation of Treatment (FBB).
   Adolescents (58 patients, aged 14-18 years, standard deviationaEuro<overline>= 1.06) with different psychiatric diagnoses consecutively admitted for a diagnostic or therapeutic stay were included. The quality of life score was significantly different between patients' and parents' rating at discharge. The results of the treatment satisfaction revealed no significant correlations between patients', parents', and caregivers' ratings. A reduction in the psychopathology between admission and discharge was measured in all groups of raters. In addition, an increase in quality of life between admission and discharge was observed in patients, parents, and caregivers. Treatment satisfaction was moderate in all groups of raters.
   The views of patients' treatment measured by patients themselves, parents, and caregivers during a psychiatric ward stay are different and more or less unrelated. This indicates that each group applies different criteria when assessing treatment satisfaction.

AB The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.

AB Background: There is a significant link between insecure attachment and the development of psychopathology in adolescence. We investigated the relationship between adolescent attachment styles and the development of emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents in Kenya. We also examined the modifying influence of socioeconomic- status (SES).
   Method: One hundred and thirty-seven adolescents who were attending two schools participated in the study. One school (low SES school) catered for children from predominantly low-income households, while the second school (middle SES school) catered for children from predominantly middle-income households. The data were collected using three instruments: researcher designed questionnaire to obtain socio-demographic information, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) that is designed to assess symptoms of disorder, and the Vulnerable Attachment Scale Questionnaire (VASQ) that is designed to measure attachment style.
   Results: Adolescents from the low SES school had higher vulnerable attachment scores than those from the middle SES school (t(135) = -2.5, P = 0.02). Male students had higher vulnerable attachment scores than females (P = 0.03). Adolescents who had experienced adversity in childhood had higher vulnerable attachment scores than those who had not (P < 0.00). Results from Pearson's correlation showed moderate to strong positive correlations between attachment insecurity and emotional and behavioral problems with participants who had higher emotional symptoms (r = 0.47, P < 0.01), conduct problem score (r = 0.33, P < 0.01), hyperactivity (r = 0.26, P < 0.01) and total difficulty scores (r = 0.47, P < 0.01), experiencing significantly higher levels of attachment insecurity than those with lower scores.
   Conclusions and recommendations: This study supports the notion that attachment insecurity increases the adolescents' susceptibility to develop psychological problems.

   SYMPTOMS
AB Background: Psychosocial problems negatively affect school performance, social skills and mental development. In recent years, researchers have investigated the relationship between physical activity and psychological health. With this large school-based study, we examined whether physically inactive adolescents and slightly active adolescents experience more psychosocial problems compared with active adolescents. Methods: This study is based on the Dutch National Youth Health Monitor. This monitor uses a, school-based, cross-sectional questionnaire conducted among 96 617 adolescents in 2015. To examine the association between physical exercise and psychosocial problems, multi-level linear regression was carried out. Results: The weighted average Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score of active adolescents was lower than that of inactive adolescents. Adolescents who are inactive had 12% (beta = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.10-1.14; P < 0.001) more psychosocial problems compared with active adolescents. Further, inactive adolescents had a higher score on the subscales emotional problems (beta = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.17-1.22; P < 0.001) and problems with peers (beta = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.14-1.19; P < 0.001). There was no statistical significant difference in total score of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire between active and slightly active adolescents. Conclusion: Physically active adolescents have fewer psychosocial problems compared with physically inactive adolescents. Not only is this association significant, but there is an indication that it is also of clinical relevance.

AB BackgroundAnxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with each other, with anxiety often temporally preceding the development of depression. Although increasingly research has begun to investigate the role of sleep problems in depression, no study has examined insomnia as a mediator in the longitudinal relationship between anxiety and subsequent depression.
   MethodsThe current study utilizes data from Waves I, II, and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative prospective study conducted over a 14-year period (n=20,745, 50.5% female, M age at Wave I=16.20). Participants completed portions of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at Waves I and IV to assess depressive symptoms, a six-item anxiety measure at Wave I, and three items assessing insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep duration at Wave II.
   ResultsStructural equation modeling indicated that insomnia and unrestful sleep significantly mediated the relationship between anxiety and subsequent depression. The relationship between anxiety and depression was not significantly mediated by sleep duration.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest that anxiety may increase risk for the development of later depression through insomnia.

AB We examined the associations among parental emotion socialization, and children's emotion regulation and attachment to parents. In particular, we examined the moderating role of parental emotion socialization in the relationship between children's emotion regulation and attachment to parents. Participants were 78 Turkish children (49 boys) aged from 60 to 77 months and their parents. Parents reported on the socialization strategies they used for their children's emotions and on their children's emotion regulation, and we assessed children's attachment to parents via the Doll Story Completion Task. Results revealed that parents' minimization reaction to children's emotions moderated the association between children's emotion regulation and attachment to parents. When parents' response was punitive, children with poor emotion regulation displayed stronger attachment to parents than children with robust emotion regulation did. In addition, girls had a more secure attachment to parents than boys did. Our results highlight the importance of children's emotion regulation and parental emotion socialization for children's secure early attachment to parents.

AB A substantial literature suggests that abnormal cortisol reactivity may be a vulnerability for deleterious mental health outcomes, including ADHD. ADHD has been linked with difficulty in emotion regulation and increased risk of experiencing stressors, both of which may be related to psychobiological abnormalities (e.g., abnormal cortisol reactivity). Research has been mixed regarding the association between cortisol reactivity and ADHD. Therefore, the present meta-analytic review (k = 12) sought to quantify this association and review the relevant methodological issues and theoretical implications of this area of research. Overall, no effect was found between cortisol reactivity and ADHD (r = 0), although significant heterogeneity in the analyses suggested that there might be moderators of this association, if one does exist. Results highlight the importance of addressing limitations of the current literature on cortisol reactivity and ADHD and exploring additional indices of emotion regulation that may be associated with ADHD. Implications for future research efforts are discussed.

AB ObjectiveThe ability to regulate overeating has been recognised as integral to healthy weight management and an alternative approach to dieting in addressing excess weight, yet it has received limited examination. Accordingly, our aim was to identify demographic and psychological correlates of overeating regulation in a sample of university students, to facilitate greater understanding of this self-regulatory capacity. Variables of interest included emotion regulation, mindfulness, eating pathology, age, and gender.
   MethodSelf-report measures were completed by 312 Australian university students (68% female; M-age = 22 years).
   ResultsExploratory factor analyses indicated three overeating regulation subscales: (1) general overeating regulation (general ability to resist overeating); (2) discomfort overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating when experiencing physical pain or negative emotions); and (3) leisure overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating in leisure contexts and/or in the presence of high calorie foods). Overeating regulation was not associated with age; though young men reported better general overeating regulation capacity than young women. Individuals reporting greater ability to regulate overeating (across all three subscales) reported better emotion regulation and mindfulness, and less eating pathology. Multiple regression analyses showed that the emotion regulation subscales of goal-directedness, emotional awareness, and impulse control, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with awareness and non-reactivity to inner experience were unique correlates of the overeating regulation subscales.
   ConclusionsThis study offers greater understanding about the different facets of overeating regulation, and highlights the relevance of emotion regulation and mindfulness in this adaptive eating practise.

AB Measures to identify infancy mental health problems are essential to guide interventions and reduce the risk of developmental psychopathology in early years. We investigated a new service-setting-based measure the Copenhagen Infant Mental Health Screening (CIMHS) within the general child health surveillance by community health nurses (CHN). The study population of 2973 infants was assessed by CIMHS at age 9-10 months. A subsample of 416 children was examined at age 1A 1/2 years, using parent interviews including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 1A 1/2 -5), Check List of Autism and Toddlers (CHAT), Infant-Toddler Symptom Checklist (ITSCL), and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID) and observations of behavior, communication, and interaction. Child mental disorders were diagnosed according to ICD-10 and parent-child relationship disorders according to DC:0-3R. Statistical analyses included logistic regression analyses adjusted and weighted to adjust for sampling and bias. CIMHS problems of sleep, feeding and eating, emotions, attention, communication, and language were associated with an up to fivefold increased risk of child mental disorders across the diagnostic spectrum of ICD-10 diagnoses. Homo-type continuity was seen in problems of sleep and feeding and eating being associated with a threefold increased risk of disorders within the same area, OR 3.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.4) and OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.7-4.2), respectively. The sensitivity at high CIMHS problem scores was 32% and specificity 86%. In summary, CIMHS identify a broad range of infants' mental health problems that are amenable to guide intervention within the general child health surveillance.

AB Worldwide, approximately one in eight children or adolescents suffers from a mental disorder. The present study was designed to determine the self-reported prevalence of mental health problems in children aged 6-11 years across eight European countries including Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. Data were drawn from 6245 children participating in the School Children Mental Health in Europe (SCHME) study and a large cross-sectional survey in France. Self-reported child mental health was assessed using the Dominique Interactive (DI). Overall, 22.0% of children were identified per their own evaluation as having at least one mental disorder, ranging from 16.4% in the Netherlands to 27.9% in Bulgaria. The prevalence of internalizing disorders was 18.4% across countries and ranged from 11.8% in the Netherlands to 24.3% in Turkey. The prevalence of externalizing disorders was lower with an average of 7.8%, ranging from 3.5% in Turkey to 10.5% in Bulgaria. Combining samples across European countries, 1 in 5 children reported internalizing problems and 1 in 12 children externalizing problems. The net completion rates of 4.1-74.3% preclude conclusions about national differences in prevalence rates.

AB The gene-environment interaction research field in psychiatry has traditionally been dominated by the diathesis-stress framework, where certain genotypes are assumed to confer increased risk for adverse outcomes in a stressful environment. In later years, theories of differential susceptibility, or biological sensitivity, suggest that candidate genes that interact with environmental events do not exclusively confer a risk for behavioural or psychiatric disorders but rather seem to alter the sensitivity to both positive and negative environmental influences. The present study investigates the susceptibility properties of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) in relation to depressive symptoms and delinquency in two separate adolescent community samples: n = 1457, collected in 2006; and n = 191, collected in 2001. Two-, three-, and four-way interactions between the 5HTTLPR, positive and negative family environment, and sex were found in relation to both depressive symptoms and delinquency. However, the susceptibility properties of the 5HTTLPR were distinctly less pronounced in relation to depressive symptoms. If the assumption that the 5HTTLPR induces differential susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences is correct, the previous failures to measure and control for positive environmental factors might be a possible explanation for former inconsistent findings within the research field.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) becomes increasingly important across adolescent development, and promotes psychological flexibility, resilience and well-being in youth. Positive education programs (PEPs) combine academic training with positive psychology interventions (PPIs) to increase well-being and reduce mental ill-health. Despite considerable overlap between PPIs and ER models, the role and relevance of ER to PEPs remains unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the relationship of ER to PEPs targeting adolescents. First, to evaluate the relationship of ER to domains of well-being targeted by school-based PPIs. Second, to examine whether school-based PPIs can improve adolescents' ER capacity. Third, to evaluate the role of ER in well-being outcomes of PEPs. Results support the relevance of ER to domains of well-being outlined by the revised PERMA model, including positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and health. ER can influence the degree to which students benefit from PEP participation. It remains to be determined whether ER capacity is improved as a result of exposure to positive education programs. Findings are limited by the small and heterogeneous group of interventions examined, and the use of inconsistent ER measures. Further research of the role of ER in positive education may contribute to greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness and further promote the psychological well-being of adolescents.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at greater risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those without ADHD. Increased risk is at least partially attributable to a subset of children with ADHD and comorbid depression or disruptive behavior disorders; however, the early predictors and mechanisms driving increased risk are not well understood. Here, we investigate the contributions of two candidate mechanisms for increased suicidal ideation in children with ADHD: executive function and negative affect. 623 clinically well-characterized, community-recruited children classified by research criteria as ADHD (n = 388) or typically-developing controls (n = 253) participated. Parent-report on the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire provided a measure of negative affectivity. Children completed laboratory tasks to measure response inhibition and working memory. Suicidal ideation was evaluated by parent report during a semi-structured interview and child responses on the Children's Depression Inventory. Compared to typically developing controls, children with ADHD had higher rates of suicidal ideation, more negative affect, slower stop signal reaction times, and weaker working memory. Statistical path-model analyses confirmed the hypothesis that weaker working memory in ADHD statistically mediated increased negative affect. Weaker working memory also mediated and increased suicidal ideation in these cross sectional data. Findings were not attributable to comorbid disruptive behavioral disorders. Poor response inhibition did not reliably mediate negative affect or suicidal ideation. Impairment in working memory is an important early risk factor for suicidal ideation in children with ADHD, and may help in identifying children for prevention and early intervention efforts.

AB Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor, involved in the maintenance of a variety of emotional problems. Recently, the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire - Child version (PTQ-C) was developed as a content-independent measure of RNT in children and adolescents. The current study investigated the reliability and predictive validity of the PTQ-C and examined temperament as a developmental predictor of RNT. For this end, 701 early adolescents completed measures of RNT, depressive symptoms, stressors, and temperament, both at baseline and after three months. First, the factor structure of the PTQ-C was investigated by comparing a one-factor model and a three-factor higher-order model using confirmatory factor analyses. Both models showed good fit to the data, but the more parsimonious one-factor model was retained. Internal consistency, as measured by cronbach's alpha and (hierarchical) omega, was found to be excellent for the total scale. Second, associations with depressive symptom levels were examined. RNT predicted both concurrent and prospective symptom levels, even when taking into account baseline depressive symptoms. RNT was further shown to act as a moderator strengthening the link between stress and levels of depressive symptoms, both concurrently and prospectively. Finally, associations with temperament were explored by investigating the mediating role of RNT in the association between temperament dimensions and depressive symptoms. One indirect effect was found, with low effortful control predicting increases in depressive symptoms through heightened levels of RNT. The current study supports the PTQ-C as a useful and psychometrically sound measure of dysfunctional RNT that may facilitate research on emotional problems in child and adolescent samples.

AB The study's goals were twofold: (a) to examine the effectiveness of narrating an angry experience, compared with relying on distraction or mere reexposure to the experience, for anger reduction across childhood and adolescence, and (b) to identify the features of narratives that are associated with more and less anger reduction for younger and older youths and for boys and girls. Participants were 241 youths (117 boys) between the ages of 8 and 17. When compared with mere reexposure, narration was effective at reducing youth's anger both concurrently and in lasting ways; though narration was less effective than distraction at concurrently reducing anger, its effect was longer lasting. Contrary to expectation, there were no overall age differences in the relative effectiveness of narration for anger reduction; however, the analyses of the quality of youth's narratives and of the relations between various narrative features and reductions in anger indicated that narration works to reduce distress among youth via processes that are distinct from those postulated for adults. Altogether, this study's findings lend strong support to the potential of narration for helping youth across a broad age range manage anger experiences in ways that can reduce distress.

AB Objective: The present study utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the effects of emotional impulsivity on overall functional impairment and functional impairment variability (FIV) of children with and without ADHD. Method: Parents of 74 children, 8- to 12-year-olds (42 with ADHD, 32 without ADHD), completed EMA assessment protocol ratings of their child's mood (3 times daily) and functional impairment (1 time daily) over the course of 28 days. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses supported the interaction of ADHD diagnostic status and greater EMA-derived emotional impulsivity in the estimation of total functional impairment (Total FI) and FIV. Thus, greater emotional impulsivity was found to be related to greater Total FI and FIV among children with ADHD but not among children without ADHD. Conclusion: This study suggests that children with ADHD and greater emotional impulsivity demonstrate greater overall levels of functional impairment, with the severity of their impairment varying significantly over time.

AB Background: Mental health problems and sleep disturbance are prevalent in adolescents. Intrafamily conflict has been found to be associated with mental health problems and sleep disturbance in adolescents. This study examined the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the effect of intrafamily conflict on mental health problems.
   Method: Participants were 11,831 adolescent students who participated in the baseline survey of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and reported demographics, behavioral and emotional problems, and sleep disturbance. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediating effects of sleep disturbance on the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems, including internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 15 years (SD = 1.46) and 50.9% were males. After controlling for family demographic factors, adolescent age and sex, intrafamily conflict had significant effects on mental health problems (standardized regression coefficient = 0.28, SE = 0.009, p < 0.001) and sleep disturbance (standardized regression coefficient = 0.15, SE = 0.010, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance significantly mediated the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems (standardized indirect effect = 0.05, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbance had significant mediating effects on the relationship between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. The findings suggested that family-centered programs should include sleep disturbance intervention for preventing adolescent mental health problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explored the measurement model of the adolescent version of the Centrality of Event Scale and its invariance across community (n = 1,079; 42.8% male), referred for foster care (n = 205; 58.0% male), and detained (n = 206 male) adolescent participants. Results indicated a three-factor measurement model, including all three functions that memories of significant life events may have, as a good fit to our data, particularly for male participants. This measurement model was invariant across boys taken from those different samples but not across gender. As for the short version of the instrument, a one-factor solution was the best fit to our data. It was invariant across boys taken from those different samples and across gender. Boys and girls expressed similar experiences, whereas community male adolescents reported the lowest impact of a meaningful event, in comparison with referred and with detained boys. These findings provide evidence on the validity of the scale for use with diverse adolescent samples, which may contribute for a better understanding of the impact that significant life events may have on the development of gender-specific and group-specific vulnerabilities.

AB Cigarette craving contributes substantially to the maintenance of tobacco use disorder. Behavioral strategies to regulate craving may facilitate smoking cessation but remain underexplored. We adapted an emotion-regulation strategy, using proximal/distal self-positioning, to the context of cigarette craving to examine craving regulation in 42, daily smokers (18-25 years old). After overnight abstinence from smoking, before and after smoking their first cigarette of the day, participants viewed videos of natural scenes presenting young adults who were either smoking cigarettes ("smoke") or not ("non-smoke"). Before each video, participants were instructed to imagine themselves either immersed in the scene ("close") or distanced from it ("far"). They rated their craving after each video. Task-based fMRI data are presented for a subsample of participants (N = 21). We found main effects of smoking, instruction, and video type on craving-lower ratings after smoking than before, following the "far" vs. "close" instructions, and when viewing non-smoke vs. smoke videos. Before smoking, "smoke" vs. "non-smoke" videos elicited activation in, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, lateral parietal cortex, mid-occipital cortex, ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, and midbrain. Smoking reduced activation in anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporal poles. Activation was reduced in the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex after the "far" vs. the "close" instruction, suggesting less engagement with the stimuli during distancing. The results indicate that proximal/distal regulation strategies impact cue-elicited craving, potentially via downregulation of the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, and that smoking during abstinence may increase cognitive control capacity during craving regulation.

AB Purpose The aim was to investigate social competence and behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents born with CDH.
   Methods All children born with CDH, treated in Stockholm 1990-2009, were invited to participate. After written consent, the Child Behavior Checklist or Adult Self-Report questionnaires were sent to participants. Of the 145 long-term survivors, 51% returned a completed questionnaire. Both the syndrome and competence scales were used and open-ended questions were analyzed with manifest content analysis.
   Results All parents of children aged 1.5-5 years and 90% of parents of children aged 6-18 years reported a normal range on the syndrome scale. Five parents indicated internalizing, but none externalizing behavior. All young adults achieved a normal score on the syndrome scale. Eighty-five percent had normal school achievement, 79% had normal social scores and 40% had normal activity levels. Significantly fewer boys (23%) were in the normal activity range compared with 67% of girls.
   Conclusion The vast majority of all parents of children born with CDH scored no behavioral or emotional problems, furthermore, they reported normal social and school competence. However, the activity levels seemed to be reduced in children born with CDH.

AB In typically-developing (TD) individuals, effective emotion regulation strategies have been associated with positive outcomes in various areas, including social functioning. Although impaired social functioning is a core criterion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the role of emotion regulation ability in ASD has been largely ignored. This study investigated the association between emotion regulation and ASD symptomatology, with a specific emphasis on social impairment. We used parent-report questionnaires to assess the regulatory strategies and symptom severity of 145 youth with ASD. Results showed that: (1) more effective emotion regulation, defined by greater use of reappraisal, predicted less severe ASD symptomatology, and (2) greater use of reappraisal predicted less severe social impairment. Suppression was not predictive of general symptomatology or social functioning.

AB Impulsivity is thought to be a contributing factor in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), yet the research is limited and inconsistent. In particular, little is known about how impulsivity is associated with response latency between initial urge and later self-injury, emotion regulation processes, or severity of NSSI. In this study, we tested group differences between participants with and without a history of NSSI on a questionnaire measure of impulsivity. In addition, we tested hypothesized correlations between impulsivity and relevant variables within the NSSI sample using questionnaires and self-reported response latency between urge and injury. Participants included 159 undergraduate students, 84 with an NSSI history and 75 without an NSSI history. Results indicated greater impulsivity on facets of Urgency and (lack of) Perseverance for the NSSI group. Within the NSSI sample, facets of impulsivity were associated with difficulties in emotion regulation and NSSI severity, but not response latency. In addition, response latency, a possible behavioral marker of impulsivity, was not associated with emotion regulation processes or NSSI frequency. These results suggest that higher scores on self-report measures of impulsivity, but not behavioral response latency measures, are associated with emotion regulation processes in individuals who self-injure.

AB This study investigates the momentary association between urban greenspace, captured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery, and psychological stress, captured using Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA), in the activity spaces of a sample of primarily African American adolescents residing in Richmond, Virginia. We employ generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the effect of exposure to urban greenspace on stress and test for moderation by sex, emotional dysregulation, season, neighborhood disadvantage, and whether the observation occurs at home or elsewhere. Results indicate that urban greenspace is associated with lower stress when subjects are away from home, which we speculate is due to the properties of stress reduction and attention restoration associated with exposure to natural areas, and to the primacy of other family dynamics mechanisms of stress within the home. Subjects may also seek out urban greenspaces at times of lower stress or explicitly for purposes of stress reduction. The greenspace-stress association away from home did not differ by sex, emotional dysregulation, neighborhood disadvantage, or season, the latter of which suggests that the observed greenspace-stress relationship is associated with being in a natural environment rather than strictly exposure to abundant green vegetation. Given the association of urban greenspace with lower stress found here and in other studies, future research should address the mediated pathways between greenspace, stress, and stress-related negative health outcomes for different population subgroups as a means toward understanding and addressing health disparities.

AB Emotional intelligence (EI) has been proposed as a protective factor for dating violence perpetration (DVP) based on the findings of a few cross-sectional studies. Given the lack of previous longitudinal research, this study aimed at studying the protective role of EI components against DVP one year later considering gender effects. The sample consisted of 542 adolescents (52.2% females) with a mean age of 16.36 years (SD = 0.86) at baseline. Participants completed measures of EI (attention, clarity, and repair) at T1 and DVP at T1 and T2. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses showed that the strongest predictor of DVP was previous level of aggression. EI moderated the maintenance of DVP over time. Specifically, those adolescents with a higher competence of clarity showed a lower perpetuation of DVP. The other two components of EI (attention and repair) displayed a gender-specific effect. In particular, a lower perpetuation of DVP was found for girls with higher scores on emotional attention, and for boys with higher scores on emotional repair. Since adolescents' EI predicts DVP, preventive interventions should address the improvement of attention, clarity, and repair of their emotions, considering El gender specificities.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds in the United States, with 5% to 8% attempting suicide each year. Suicide risk rises significantly during early adolescence and is higher in rural and underserved communities. School-based universal prevention programs offer a promising way of reducing suicide by providing strategies for emotion regulation and encouraging help-seeking behaviors and youth-adult connectedness. However, such programs frequently run into difficulties in trying to engage a broad range of students. Text messaging is a dominant medium of communication among youths, and studies show both efficacy and uptake in text messaging interventions aimed at adolescents. Text-based interventions may, thus, offer a means for school-based universal prevention programs to engage adolescents who would otherwise be difficult to reach.
   Objective: We field tested Text4Strength, an automated, interactive text messaging intervention that seeks to reach a broad range of early adolescents in rural communities. Text4Strength extends Sources of Strength, a peer-led school suicide prevention program, by encouraging emotion regulation, help-seeking behaviors, and youth-adult connectedness in adolescents. The study tested the appeal and feasibility of Text4Strength and its potential to extend universal school-based suicide prevention.
   Methods: We field tested Text4Strength with 42 ninth-grade students. Over 9 weeks, students received 28 interactive message sequences across 9 categories (Sources of Strength introduction, positive friend, mentors, family support, healthy activities, generosity, spirituality, medical access, and emotion regulation strategies). The message sequences included games, requests for advice, questions about students' own experiences, and peer testimonial videos. We measured baseline mental health characteristics, frequency of replies, completion of sequences and video viewing, appeal to students, and their perception of having benefited from the program.
   Results: Of the 42 participating students, 38 (91%) responded to at least one sequence and 22 (52%) responded to more than a third of the sequences. The proportion of students who completed multistep sequences they had started ranged from 35% (6/17) to 100% (3/3 to 28/28), with responses dropping off when more than 4 replies were needed. With the exception of spirituality and generosity, each of the content areas generated at least a moderate number of student replies from both boys and girls. Students with higher and lower levels of risk and distress interacted with the sequences at similar rates. Contrary to expectations, few students watched videos. Students viewed the intervention as useful-even those who rarely responded to messages. More than 70% found the texts useful (3 items, n range 29-34) and 90% (36) agreed the program should be repeated.
   Conclusions: Text4Strength offers a potentially engaging way to extend school-based interventions that promote protective factors for suicide. Text4Strength is ready to be revised, based on findings and student feedback from this field test, and rigorously tested for efficacy.

AB Objectives: Prior studies have shown that youth with bipolar disorder demonstrate neurofunctional changes in key prefrontal and subcortical brain regions implicated in emotional regulation following treatment with pharmacological agents. We recently reported a large response rate (>60%) to quetiapine (QUET) for treating depressive symptoms in adolescents with bipolar depression. This study investigates the neurofunctional effects of QUET using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Thirty-three unmedicated subjects, 10-17 years of age, with a current depressive episode (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R] > 40) associated with bipolar I or II disorder were recruited in a two-site randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial of QUET monotherapy for treatment of bipolar depression in adolescents. Twenty-three of these participants (nine male) underwent an MRI scan at baseline, then were randomized to QUET or PBO, followed for 8 weeks, and at the end of their study participation underwent another MRI scan. During the fMRI scan, subjects viewed negative and neutral pictures and rated the valence of each picture. Results: Sixteen subjects had usable data at both time points: 10 subjects randomized to QUET, and 6 randomized to PBO. For QUET subjects, lower baseline activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p<0.005) and higher baseline activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (p=0.0024) predicted greater improvement in CDRS-R scores from baseline to follow-up. When QUET and PBO groups were combined (n=16), region-of-interest activation did not significantly predict change in CDRS-R. Conclusions: Baseline activation patterns in dorsal and ventral portions of the prefrontal cortex that are critical for the regulation of emotion-predicted response, but only within the QUET group. Thus, specific medications may be more effective in the context of specific prefrontal activation patterns in youth with bipolar depression. Larger studies of these youth would help to clarify the effects of QUET on brain activation.

AB Adolescence is a fundamental transition phase, marked by physical, social, cognitive and emotional changes. At this stage in development two contrasting phenomena take place: brain changes cause a sensitivity to emotional aspects (Dahl, 2004); while also control processes register as well impressive improvements (e.g., Hooper et al., 2004; Best and Miller, 2010). The study is aimed to investigate the relationship between a core cognitive feature such as working memory (WM) (Diamond, 2013) and complex abilities such as emotion regulation (ER) and behavioral self-reported outcomes using a structural equation model approach. A sample of 227 typically developed adolescents between 14 and19 years of age (148 females; mean age in months 202.8, SD 18.57) participated in this study. The following tasks and self-reports were administered in a 45-min test session at school: Symmetry Span task (Kane et al., 2004). Reading Span task (Daneman and Carpenter, 1980), Mr. Cucumber (Case, 1985); Youth Self-Report (YSR, 11-18 years, Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001); Difficulties ER Scale (DERS, Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Italian version by Giromini et al., 2012). Results showed that difficulties in ER correlated with WM: high levels of ER difficulties are associated with low WM efficiency while no significant contributions of these predictors was observed on externalizing or internalizing symptoms. This study showed a significant relationship between self-reported difficulties in ER and WM, while no significant contribution of the considered predictors was showed on the outcomes, adding knowledge about how behavioral and emotional self-reported outcomes may relate to these processes.

AB Background: Evidence-based parenting programmes are recommended for the treatment of child mental health difficulties. Families with complex psychosocial needs show poorer retention and outcomes when participating in standard parenting programmes. The Helping Families Programme (HFP) is a 16-week community-based parenting intervention designed to meet the needs of these families, including families with parental personality disorder. This study aimed to explore the help seeking and participatory experiences of parents with a diagnosis of personality disorder. It further aimed to examine the acceptability of referral and intervention processes for the HFP from the perspectives of (i) clinicians referring into the programme; and (ii) referred parents.
   Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents recruited to receive HFP (n = 5) as part of a research case series and the referring NHS child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) clinicians (n = 5). Transcripts were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis.
   Results: Four themes were identified for parents: (i) the experience of parenthood, (ii) being a parent affected by personality disorder, (iii) experience of the intervention, and (iv) qualities of helping. Three themes emerged for clinicians: (i) challenges of addressing parental need, (ii) experience of engaging parents with personality disorders and (iii) limited involvement during HFP. Comparison of parent and clinician themes led to the identification of two key interlinked themes: (i) concerns prior to receiving the intervention, and (ii) the challenges of working together without a mutual understanding.
   Conclusions: This pilot study identifies potentially significant challenges of working with parents affected by personality disorder and engaging them in HFP and other similar interventions. Results have important wider clinical implications by highlighting potential barriers to engagement and participation and providing insights on how these barriers might be overcome. Findings have been used to inform the referral and intervention processes of a pilot RCT and further intervention development.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to examine the necessity of early intervention for students with potential bulimia by investigating how the eating attitudes of college students change and examining the relation between bulimic symptoms and depressive symptoms or the ability to cope with stress.
   Methods: The study participants were students who entered Hiroshima University in 2014. This study was conducted at two time points: Time-1 in 2014 and Time-2 in 2017. The Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Bulimic Inventory Test, Edinburgh (BITE), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) were administered at Times 1 and 2, and the responses were compared between the time points. Next, we compared the BDI-II scores of the BITE improved and worsened groups. In addition, we divided the participants into a clinical group, subthreshold group, and healthy group based on the BITE score at Time-1to compared their depressive symptoms and the ability to cope with stress.
   Results: Significantly higher BITE and BDI-II scores were recorded for both males and females at Time-2 than at Time-1. The BDI-II score at Time-1 was significantly higher in the BITE worsened group than in the BITE improved group. The BDI-II scores at Time-1 were significantly higher for both males and females in the subthreshold group than in the healthy group. Furthermore, significantly higher CISS-T and CISS-E scores were recorded at Time-1 for females in the subthreshold group than for females in the healthy group.
   Conclusions: Based on these results, intervention for students the subthreshold group is important, and the key to intervention may be to address not only eating behaviors but also depressive symptoms and stress coping.

AB Studies have shown that children frequently experiencing poor parent-child interaction are prone to video gaming-related problems, but it is unclear which specific aspects of such an interaction play a predictive role in the problems. To extend previous research that relies primarily on the self-report method to assess parent-child interaction, we conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study. In a laboratory setting, three major aspects of interaction (i.e., affectivity, cohesiveness, and parental behavior) were observed in 241 parent-child dyads (Children: 43 percent female, age range=8-15, M-age=12.09, SDage=1.41; Parents: 78 percent female, age range=27-63, M-age=44.44, SDage=6.09). In addition, both parent and children participants completed questionnaires that measured children's symptoms of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and exposure to violent video games at baseline (Time 1) and 12 months later (Time 2). The results revealed that at Time 1, positive affectivity and cohesiveness were inversely associated with child-report symptoms of IGD. Also, Time 1 coerciveness (i.e., control dimension of parental behavior) was positively associated with Time 1 child-report exposure to violent video games and Time 2 child-report symptoms of IGD, respectively. Apart from main effects, the results also showed that Time 1 negative affectivity moderated the protective effects of Time 1 positive affectivity on Time 1 parent-report and Time 2 child-report exposure to violent video games, respectively. Overall, this study identifies various key aspects of parent-child interaction that may serve as concurrent or temporal predictors of video gaming-related issues.

AB Likeability represents one of the aspects of social status in a peer group and refers to the extent to which one is accepted, preferred by others, and perceived as a likeable companion. Previous research has demonstrated that likeability is partly determined by dispositional factors. One body of research shows that variance in likeability across individuals can be traced to personality traits, mainly extraversion and agreeableness. Another expanding body of research demonstrates that success in achieving peer acceptance is determined, in some part, by the emotional competencies (ECs) of an individual. In an attempt to combine these two approaches and to clarify some inconsistencies in the results concerning the personality-likeability relationships, this study was designed to examine the interactive effect of adolescents' personality traits (i.e., extraversion and agreeableness) and ECs on peer-rated likeability in adolescence. A sample of 230 adolescents (47% female) from two comprehensive secondary schools in Poland completed measures of personality traits and ECs, as well as a sociometric assessment of likeability in their classrooms. The results demonstrated that interpersonal EC acts as a moderator in the relationship between extraversion and peer-rated likeability. Specifically, extraversion predicted greater likeability among adolescents with high interpersonal EC but not among adolescents with low interpersonal EC. The study yielded new insights into the determinants of likeability, as it demonstrates that adolescents need to be both extrovert and possess high interpersonal EC in order to be judged highly likeable by their peers. It also bears practical implications for the improvement of adolescents' position and acceptance within their peer group. The results suggest that encouraging "rejected" adolescents to reach out to others in an extrovert fashion is necessary but insufficient to increase their likeability. Improving their interpersonal EC is also necessary. The observation that higher levels of interpersonal EC helps adolescents to achieve higher acceptance in their peer group suggests the need to implement school training programs aimed at improving the core ECs (identification, understanding, expression, regulation and use of emotions).

AB Background: Many studies have reported the comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in children. However, the underlying relationship between PTSD and depression remains unclear.
   Objective: This study examines the relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms in children who survived the Wenchuan earthquake in China.
   Methods: In total, 301 children were assessed at fourmonths and then followed up at 29, 40 and 52months after the disaster. The ages of the children ranged from 9.6-14.6years old, and the sample included 157 males and 144 females. The children were assessed by using the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD reaction index for DSM-IV for PTSD symptoms and the Children's Depression Inventory for depressive symptoms.
   Results: Comorbid PTSD and depressive symptoms were prevalent in 4.0, 3.3, 3.7 and 5.1% of the participants at times 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The cross-lagged analysis indicated that PTSD symptoms at time 1 predicted depressive symptoms at time 2; depressive symptoms at time 1 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 2; depressive symptoms at time 2 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 3; and depressive symptoms at time 3 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 4. The findings also showed that being female, poor parental relationships and trauma exposure were risk factors for PTSD or depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the causal relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms changes over time; the effects of PTSD symptoms tend to decrease, while those of depressive symptoms tend to increase. Two stages of the relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms were observed, namely, that PTSD and depressive symptoms first influenced each other and then that depressive symptoms predicted PTSD. The results of our study also suggest that females with poor parental relationships and a high degree of trauma exposure are more likely to require intervention.

AB Background: Previous studies have shown that parental attachment is associated with low severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and low academic burnout in individuals who have experienced traumatic events.
   Objective: The present study investigated the ways in which parental attachment is related to PTSD symptoms and academic burnout in Chinese traumatized adolescents by considering the role of dispositional mindfulness.
   Method: A total of 443 Chinese adolescents who had experienced a severe tornado one year prior to this study completed measures of parental attachment, dispositional mindfulness, PTSD and academic burnout.
   Results: The results showed that our model fitted the data well [chi(2)/df = 2.968, CFI = 0.971, TLI = 0.955, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.067 (0.052-0.082)] and revealed that dispositional mindfulness partially mediates the relationship between parental attachment, PTSD severity and academic burnout.
   Conclusions: The findings suggested that dispositional mindfulness and parental attachment may be two critical resources in dealing with traumatization and academic burnout.

AB Emotional eating is an attempt to avoid, control, or cope with negative emotions through eating a large amount of calorie dense sweet and/or high fat foods. Several factors, including various attentional mechanisms, negative affect, and stress, impact emotional eating behavior. For example, attentional narrowing on negative events may increase attentional stickiness and thereby prevent the processing of more peripheral events, such as eating behavior. This study contributes to the extant literature by examining the neural correlates underlying the attentional conflict between processing negative events and regulating behavior within a task that emulates how negative life experiences might contribute to unrestrained eating behavior. We explore this question within a normative sample that varies in their self-reported anxiety symptoms. Dense-array EEG was collected while participants played the attentional blink game-a task in which excessive attentional resource allocated to one event (e.g., negative picture) interferes with the adequate attentional processing of a second event that requires action. To assess the attentional conflict, we measured N2 activation, an event-related potentials (ERPs; averaged EEG) associated with conflict processing. Results revealed that N2 activation moderates the association between anxiety and emotional-eating behavior. Thus, increased anxiety combined with more negative N2 activation can contribute to emotional-eating behavior. These results are discussed in the context of ineffective conflict processing contributing to poor emotion regulation.

AB Despite increasing research and clinical interest in delivering psychosocial interventions for children affected by war, little research has been conducted on the underlying mechanisms of change associated with these interventions. This review aimed to identify these processes in order to inform existing interventions and highlight research gaps. A systematic review of reviews was conducted drawing from academic databases (PubMed, PILOTS, Cochrane Library for Systematic Reviews) and field resources (e.g. Medecins Sans Frontieres and the Psychosocial Centre of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies), with extracted data analysed using Thematic Content Analysis. Thirteen reviews of psychosocial or psychological interventions for children and adolescents (<25 years old) affected by war, armed conflict or political violence were identified, covering over 30 countries worldwide. Qualitative analysis identified 16 mechanisms of change, one of which was an adverse mechanism. Themes included protection from harm, play, community and family capacity building, strengthening relationships with caregivers, improved emotional regulation, therapeutic rapport, trauma processing, and cognitive restructuring; with the adverse mechanism relating to the pathologising of normal reactions. However, only 4 mechanisms were supported by strong empirical evidence, with only moderate or poor quality evidence supporting the other mechanisms. The poor quality of supporting evidence limits what can be inferred from this review's findings, but serves to highlight clinically informed mechanisms of change for existing and widely used non-specialist interventions in the field, which urgently need rigorous scientific testing to inform their continued practice.

AB Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is a potential mental disorder currently included in the third section of the latest (fifth) edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition that requires additional research to be included in the main manual. Although research efforts in the area have increased, there is a continuing debate about the respective criteria to use as well as the status of the condition as mental health concern. Rather than using diagnostic criteria which are based on subjective symptom experience, the National Institute of Mental Health advocates the use of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) which may support classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures because mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. Consequently, IGD should be classified on its underlying neurobiology, as well as its subjective symptom experience. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the neurobiological correlates involved in IGD based on the current literature base. Altogether, 853 studies on the neurobiological correlates were identified on ProQuest (in the following scholarly databases: ProQuest Psychology Journals, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, and ERIC) and on MEDLINE, with the application of the exclusion criteria resulting in reviewing a total of 27 studies, using fMRI, rsfMRI, VBM, PET, and EEG methods. The results indicate there are significant neurobiological differences between healthy controls and individuals with IGD. The included studies suggest that compared to healthy controls, gaming addicts have poorer response-inhibition and emotion regulation, impaired prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning and cognitive control, poorer working memory and decision-making capabilities, decreased visual and auditory functioning, and a deficiency in their neuronal reward system, similar to those found in individuals with substance-related addictions. This suggests both substance-related addictions and behavioral addictions share common predisposing factors and may be part of an addiction syndrome. Future research should focus on replicating the reported findings in different cultural contexts, in support of a neurobiological basis of classifying IGD and related disorders.

AB The current study aims to examine the multiple mediations of emotion regulation strategies in the relationship between positive and negative affect and depressive symptoms in adolescents. Participants included 290 students attending middle schools in a mid-size city in Southeastern Anatolian region. Among students, 137 were females (47.2%) and 153 (52.8%) were males. Participants' ages ranged between 9 and 15 with a mean of 12.12, SD = 1.53. Research data were collected through Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Adolescents, Emotion Regulation Scale for Adolescents, and Depression Scale for Children. Data analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, an approach based on Ordinary Least Squares Regression, and Bootstrap method. Research findings indicated that the mediation of external dysfunctional emotion regulation, internal dysfunctional emotion regulation, and external functional emotion regulation in the relationships between positive emotions and depressive symptoms was statistically significant. However, the mediation of internal functional emotion regulation was not found to be statistically significant. In the relationship between negative emotions and depressive symptoms, the mediation of internal dysfunctional emotion regulation and external functional emotion regulation was found to be statistically significant. In addition, the mediation of internal functional emotion regulation and external dysfunctional emotion regulation was not found statistically significant. Research findings were discussed based on the relevant literature and some suggestions for researchers were put forward.

AB Following the theoretical propositions of the Emotion Regulation model of attachment, the current study investigated whether attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance might play a differential contributing role in the development of bulimic symptoms, through assumed differences in adopting specific maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in a sample of adolescents. Developmentally appropriate self-report questionnaires were administered to a community sample of 397 adolescents (Mean age: 14.02; 62.7% female) and this at 2 time points with a 1-year time lag. Results provided longitudinal evidence for the Emotion Regulation model of attachment in confirming the differential contributing role of the attachment dimensions on the development of bulimic symptoms in a sample of adolescents. More specifically, attachment anxiety seemed to be related to bulimic symptoms through rumination, while attachment avoidance through emotional control. These results may have clinical implications for assessment and treatment of bulimic symptoms in adolescents.

AB A growing body of research has shown that adolescent girls in the context of affluence face a series of unique pressures that may increase social-emotional problems. Little research, however, has examined associations between perceived stress and psychosomatic complaints among privileged youth. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between stress, psychosomatic complaints, and parental criticism in a sample of preadolescent and adolescent girls (n = 218) from selective, private schools. Using OLS regression analyses, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were evident between perceived stress and psychosomatic complaints, with increases in stress associated with increases in psychosomatic problems. Parental criticism was also examined as a predictor of girls' psychosomatic complaints and stress levels. Results indicated that parental criticism was significantly and positively associated with psychosomatic problems in cross-sectional models and that perceived stress levels mediated this association. Additional analyses demonstrated that the relationship between psychosomatic complaints and stress may be bidirectional. Taken together, results from this exploratory study suggest that girls in the context of affluence may also experience psychosomatic complaints, in addition to social-emotional problems.

AB Background Children and adolescents, who account for most of the world's refugees, have an increased prevalence of psychological disorders. The mental health of refugee children is often associated with the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their caregivers. Despite the potential for refugee caregivers' PTSD to affect child mental health, little evidence exists concerning the underlying mechanisms of this association. This study tested the effect of refugee caregivers' previous trauma and levels of ongoing stressors on current PTSD, and in turn how this influences parenting behaviour and consequent child psychological health.
   Methods This cohort study recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia study, a population-based prospective cohort study of refugees admitted to 11 sites in Australia between October, 2013, and February, 2014. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and the principal or secondary applicant (ie, the refugee applicant within a migrating family unit) for a humanitarian visa awarded between May, 2013, and December, 2013. Primary caregiver PTSD and postmigration difficulties were assessed at Wave 1 (in 2013), and caregiver PTSD was reassessed at Wave 2 (in 2014). At Wave 3, between October, 2015, and February, 2016, primary caregivers repeated measures of trauma history, postmigration difficulties, probable PTSD, and harsh and warm parenting style, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for their child. We used path analysis to investigate temporal patterns in PTSD, trauma history, postmigration stressors, parenting style, and children's psychological difficulties.
   Findings The current data comprised 411 primary caregivers who provided responses in relation to at least one child (660 children). 394 primary caregivers with 639 children had data on independent variables and were included in the final model. Path analyses revealed that caregivers' trauma history and postmigration difficulties were associated with greater subsequent PTSD, which in turn was associated with greater harsh parenting and in turn, higher levels of child conduct problems (ss=0.049, p=0.0214), hyperactivity (ss=0.044, p=0.0241), emotional symptoms (ss=0.041, p=0.0218), and peer problems (ss=0.007, p=0.047). There was also a direct path from primary caregiver PTSD to children's emotional problems (ss=0.144, p=0.0001).
   Interpretation PTSD in refugees is associated with harsh parenting styles, leading to adverse effects on their children's mental health. Programmes to enhance refugee children's mental health should account for PTSD in parents and caregivers, and the parenting behaviours that these children are exposed to.

AB High dietary acid load may have detrimental effects on mental health during childhood and adolescence. We examined cross-sectional and prospective associations of dietary acid load and mental health problems in a population-based sample, using data from the German birth cohort studies GINIplus (German Infant Nutritional Intervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development) and LISA (Influences of lifestyle-related factors on the immune system and the development of allergies in childhood). These studies included detailed assessments of dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), mental health outcomes measured through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and covariates. Using logistic regression, cross-sectional associations between dietary acid load measured as potential renal acid load (PRAL) and SDQ subscales were assessed at age 10 years (N = 2350) and 15 years (N = 2061). Prospective associations were assessed, considering PRAL at 10 years as exposure and SDQ subscales at 15 years as outcome (N = 1685). Results indicate that children with a diet higher in PRAL have more emotional problems (OR = 1.33 (95% CI = 1.15; 1.54); p < 0.001), and show hyperactivity more often (1.22 (1.04; 1.43); p = 0.014) at 10 years. No significant associations were present either cross-sectionally at age 15 years, nor prospectively. Results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses. These findings reveal first evidence for potential relationships between PRAL and mental health in childhood, although we cannot exclude reverse causality, i.e., that dietary behavior and PRAL are influenced by mental status. Future studies should address confirmation and identify biological mechanisms.

AB Multiple sources of burden for youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) impact key outcomes including quality of life, self-management, and glycemic control. Professional diabetes organizations recommend diabetes care providers screen for psychosocial and behavioral challenges and implement strategies to support youth with T1D. The purpose of this article is to review the literature and recommend practical strategies medical providers can use for screening and behavioral support for youth with diabetes and their families. As part of their routine medical care, diabetes care providers are well-positioned to identify and intervene to address emotional distress related to the burdens of living with diabetes. In collaboration with multidisciplinary team members, including psychologists and mental health professionals, medical providers may be able to successfully implement brief behavioral strategies for screening and providing emotional support.

AB Although the literature indicates that eating disorders (EDs) are associated with emotional problems and difficulties, there is scant research on the role of trait emotional intelligence (EI) in general preadolescent and adolescent populations. For these reasons, the main aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between trait EI, body dissatisfaction, bulimic symptoms and drive for thinness in preadolescents (N = 382) and adolescents (N = 380). Participants completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire -Adolescent Short Form, the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 and were weighed and measured to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Trait EI significantly predicted body dissatisfaction and ED symptoms in both samples, even after controlling for the effects of BMI. Indeed, in preadolescent and adolescent girls and in preadolescent boys, trait EI predicted bulimic symptoms over and above body dissatisfaction. Results suggest that perceptions and beliefs about emotional abilities may have an important role in ED symptoms in preadolescents and adolescents.

AB Conceptualization and assessment of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has evolved substantially in recent years. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, NSSI and its related variables have traditionally been assessed retrospectively, leading to less precise studies of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance, cessation, or aggravation of this behavior. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) enables real-time collection of patient states, which can be very useful in the study of the mechanisms implied in this behavior. This systematic review aims to elucidate the current status of EMA use in NSSI investigation. An exhaustive search in PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted up to September 2017. All papers included were focused on the study of NSSI using EMA. Studies with methodological diversity were included, which were afterwards organized according to main topic of studies. There were no ineligibility criteria based on age or diagnosis. Twenty-three papers were studied, the majority of which are short-term studies focused on the study of affect dynamics and the emotion-regulation function of NSSI. Implications of these results and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB Adolescents are notorious for engaging in risky, reward-motivated behavior, and this behavior occurs most often in response to social reward, typically in the form of peer contexts involving intense positive affect. A combination of greater neural and behavioral sensitivity to peer positive affect may characterize adolescents who are especially likely to engage in risky behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we examined 50 adolescents' reciprocal positive affect and neural response to a personally relevant, ecologically valid pleasant stimulus: positive affect expressed by their best friend during a conversation about past and future rewarding mutual experiences. Participants were typically developing community adolescents (age 14-18 years, 48.6% female), and risky behavior was defined as a factor including domains such as substance use, sexual behavior and suicidality. Adolescents who engaged in more real-life risk-taking behavior exhibited either a combination of high reciprocal positive affect behavior and high response in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex-a region associated with impulsive sensation-seeking-or the opposite combination. Behavioral and neural sensitivity to peer influence could combine to contribute to pathways from peer influence to risky behavior, with implications for healthy development.

   DRUG-USE; RISK; ADOLESCENTS; SCALE; INTERVENTION; IMPULSIVITY
AB BACKGROUND: Engagement in sexual activity is common among adolescents and can be considered part of adolescent development, but it carries potential life-changing consequences.
   METHODS: This study examined if clinical and cognitive differences existed between adolescents who engaged in voluntary sexual behavior before age 15, between ages 15 to 18, and after age 18. All participants were part of a larger study examining impulsive behavior in young adults. Participants were assessed on measures including demographics, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and clinical scales and cognitive tasks assessing impulsivity, obsessive-compulsive traits, emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.
   RESULTS: Those who engaged in voluntary sexual activity before age 15 were more likely to have increased depression and anxiety symptoms, to score higher on the Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for Pathologic Gambling, and to make poorer decisions on the Cambridge Gambling Task.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the decision to engage in sexual activity at a young age is not an act of thinking before acting or impatience, but rather a decision to engage in sensation-seeking behavior. This finding carries implications for interventions targeting healthy sexual activity in adolescents.

AB Objective: Sexual abuse experienced in childhood and adolescence is associated with severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties. The current study examined the relationships among these factors in a sample of adolescents with sexual abuse-related PTSD. It was hypothesized that (a) self-perceived emotion regulation difficulties would predict severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and that (b) depressive symptoms would mediate the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD. Method: Ninety treatment-seeking female adolescents with a history of sexual abuse were evaluated using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview and completed the Negative Mood Regulation Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory as part of a baseline evaluation. Results: Greater emotion regulation difficulties were associated with greater severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms. In addition, the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD severity was mediated by depressive symptoms. However, the reverse was also true: the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms was mediated by PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Mediation analyses showed that emotion regulation difficulties were associated with both PTSD and depressive symptoms rather than fitting a unidirectional model. These findings are consistent with and extend previous research and highlight the importance of emotion regulation in adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

AB A cross-sectional study examining relationships between perceived family Expressed Emotion and shame, emotional involvement, depression, anxiety, stress and non-suicidal self-injury, in 264 community and online adults (21.6% male). We compared self-injurers with non-self-injurers, and current with past self-injurers. Self-injurers experienced more family Expressed Emotion (EE) than non-injurers (t(254) = -3.24, p = 0.001), linear contrasts explaining 6% of between-groups variability (F(2, 254) = 7.36, p = 0.001, (2) = 0.06). Differences in EE between current and past self-injurers were not significant. Overall shame accounted for 33% of between-groups variance (F(2, 252) = 61.99, p < 0.001, (2) = 0.33), with linear contrasts indicating self-injurers experienced higher levels compared to non-injurers (t(252) = -8.23, p < 0.001). Current self-injurers reported higher overall shame than past self-injurers (t(252) = 6.78, p < 0.001). In further logistic regression, emotional involvement and overall shame were the only significant predictors of self-injury status. With every one-unit increase in emotional involvement, odds of currently engaging in self-injury decreased by a factor of 0.860. Conversely, a one-unit increase in overall shame was associated with an increase in the odds of being a current self-injurer by a factor of 1.05. The findings have important treatment implications for engaging key family members in intervention and prevention efforts.

AB Objective: To explore long-term psychiatric outcomes in individuals with a history of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) or orthopedic injury (OI).
   Setting: Hospital emergency department, medical admission records and outpatient settings.
   Participants: There were 95 males (M = 22.78 years, SD = 3.44 years) and 74 females (M = 22.27 years, SD = 3.09 years), 65 with mild TBI (M = 23.25 years, SD = 3.58 years), 61 with moderate-severe TBI (M = 22.34 years, SD = 2.79 years), and 43 with OI (M = 21.81 years, SD = 3.36 years).
   Design: Longitudinal, between-subjects, cross-sectional design using retrospective and current data.
   Main Measures: Semistructured interview to obtain psychiatric diagnoses and background information, and medical records for identification of TBI.
   Results: Group with moderate-severe TBI presented with significantly higher rates of any anxiety disorder ((2)(2) = 6.81, P = .03) and comorbid anxiety disorder ((2)(2) = 6.12, P < .05). Group with overall TBI presented with significantly higher rates of any anxiety disorder ((2)(1) = 5.36, P = .02), panic attacks ((2)(1) = 4.43, P = .04), specific phobias ((2)(1) = 4.17, P = .04), and depression ((2)(1) = 3.98, P < .05). Prediction analysis revealed a statistically significant model ((2)(7) = 41.84, P < .001) explaining 23% to 37% of the variance in having any anxiety disorder, with significant predictors being group (TBI) and gender (female).
   Conclusions: Children who have sustained a TBI may be vulnerable to persistent anxiety, panic attacks, specific phobias, and depression, even 13 years after the injury event.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescents is highly complex and heterogeneous. Within the disorder, research has suggested the existence of at least two subgroups: one with predominantly internalizing psychopathology features and one with predominantly externalizing psychopathology features. One process that may differentiate these groups is executive functioning (EF), given that poor EF is linked to externalizing psychopathology. Against this background, the current study used a multi-informant approach to examine whether adolescent patients with predominantly externalizing BPD presentations experience greater deficits in EF than adolescent patients with predominantly internalizing presentations. The sample included inpatient adolescents ages 12-17 (M=15.26; SD=1.51). Analyses revealed that multiple EF domains distinguished the BPD subgroups. More specifically, adolescents with externalizing presentations exhibited greater difficulties in broad domains related to global executive functioning, metacognition and behavioural regulation and specific domains related to inhibitory control, working memory, planning/organizing, monitoring and organization of materials. While this study is the first to examine EF and adolescent BPD in the context of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, alternative approaches to examining this question are discussed.

AB Background: Justice involved youth exposed to multiple forms of victimization (i.e., poly-victimization) may be at risk for long term substance use problems and difficulty in self-regulation, placing them at higher risk of long-term problematic behaviors. This study empirically identifies victimization classifications in a sample of justice involved youth and how longterm binge drinking is related to victimization experiences. We further sought to understand how self-regulatory abilities such as impulse control and emotion regulation effect emergent profiles and binge drinking trajectories.
   Methods: Based on a sample of 1354 justice involved youth from 15 to 25 years old, classes of victimization were extracted. Emergent classes were examined in relationship to their binge drinking trajectories using latent growth models. Finally, self-regulation was examined as a predictor of binge drinking trajectories across emergent classes.
   Results: The analyses indicated three classes of victimization: poly-victimized, indirectly victimized, and lowly victimized. Latent growth models revealed that the poly-victimized class had significantly steeper growth in binge drinking as compared to the indirect and low victimized patterns. Impulse and emotional regulation both significantly decelerated binge drinking only for the indirect victimization group.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the need to focus on poly-victimization in understanding binge drinking trajectories as well as the role impulse control and emotional regulation play among justice involved youth. Findings are discussed through the lens of adolescent development, coping strategies, and early traumatic experiences.

TI Identifying the essential competencies for resource parents to promote

AB The number of teens entering foster care and those subsequently aging out, has been steadily increasing in recent years. The majority of these teens experience placement instability while in care and do not secure permanency before entering young adulthood. These adolescents often have complex needs due to trauma histories, and as a result, many of these youth struggle with unemployment, homelessness, and incarceration, and they experience chronic physical and mental health challenges as young adults. There has been limited training available to prepare resource parents to care for adolescents who have experienced chronic trauma. The current study is the first phase of a national training and development initiative to maximize placement stability and permanency of traumatized teens placed in out-of-home care. The purpose of the current study is to identify the core competencies that are deemed essential for resource parents to be successful, and then prioritize the competencies that should be included in the training.
   Utilizing the Delphi method, the current study generated a comprehensive list of competencies through multiple types of data collection procedures (e.g., interviews, surveys) and sources (e.g., parents, older youth, professionals, and literature and curricula reviews). Subsequently, the competencies were prioritized for inclusion in a national training by administering two rounds of a survey to an expert panel who ranked their importance. The inclusion of the competencies in the training was based on two criteria: competencies with a minimum mean score of at least 4, and those which 75% of the panelists rated at 4 or higher. Of the 215 non duplicative competencies generated in Round One, the panelists reached consensus for inclusion of 61 in training development. Many of them focused on trauma-informed parenting, building a trusting relationship with youth, helping youth maintain a connection with their biological family and other past supportive relationships, emotional regulation skills for the parent and youth, and how to adapt to meet the youths' unique needs.

AB This study investigated psychophysiological and subjective emotional responses to an affective startle modulation paradigm in first-presentation borderline personality disorder (BPD). Twenty BPD and 20 healthy control participants, aged 15-24 years, viewed a set of standardized pictures with pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant valence, and were instructed to either "maintain" or "suppress" their emotional response to the stimuli. Despite showing markedly higher levels of baseline distress on self-report questionnaires, BPD participants had significantly lower skin conductance responses and showed an absence of the fear potentiated startle response during early picture processing. Both groups showed similar startle responses later in picture processing, and when instructed to "maintain" or "suppress" their emotions. BPD participants were hypo-responsive to aversive stimuli during early processing, and did not react with more intense emotional responses to affective stimuli or show a diminished ability to regulate their responses. These results might be consistent with the finding that hypersensitivity of emotional response in BPD is specific to stimuli with themes of particular relevance to this disorder, such as rejection and abandonment.

AB The development self-regulation has been called a primary task of childhood. One system of self-regulation, self-monitoring, is indexed at the level of neural activity as early as preschool as the error-related negativity (ERN). However, how context elicits developmental changes in neural processes of self-monitoring like the ERN is not well understood. Here, socioeconomic status (SES) and parenting were tested as environmental influences on ERN development between ages 3 and 4 (N=119). Results showed the expected increases in ERN between ages 3 and 4 only when both maternal sensitivity and SES were high. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the early environment in order to understand the development of a neural process supporting self-regulation in young children.

AB The present study used cross-lagged panel analyses to test longitudinal associations among emotion regulation, prefrontal cortex (PFC) function, and depression severity in adolescent girls. The ventromedial and dorsomedial PFC (vmPFC and dmPFC) were regions of interest given their roles in depression pathophysiology, self-referential processing, and emotion regulation. At ages 16 and 17, seventy-eight girls completed a neuroimaging scan to assess changes in vmPFC and dmPFC activation to sad faces, and measures of depressive symptom severity and emotion regulation. The 1-year cross-lagged effects of dmPFC activity at age 16 on expressive suppression at age 17 and depressive symptomatology at age 17 were significant, demonstrating a predictive relation between dmPFC activity and both suppression and depressive severity.

AB What strategies help ethnic minority adolescents to cope with racism? The present study addressed this question by testing the role of ethnic identity, social support, and anger expression and suppression as moderators of the discrimination-adjustment link among 269 Mexican-origin adolescents (M-age=14.1years), 12-17years old from the Midwestern U.S. Results from multilevel moderation analyses indicated that ethnic identity, social support, and anger suppression, respectively, significantly attenuated the relations between discrimination and adjustment problems, whereas outward anger expression exacerbated these relations. Moderation effects differed according to the level of analysis. By identifying effective coping strategies in the discrimination-adjustment link at specific levels of analysis, the present findings can guide future intervention efforts for Latino youth.

AB We review recent evidence on the psychological effects of climate change on children, covering both direct and indirect impacts, and discuss children's psychological adaptation to climate change.
   Both the direct and flow-on effects of climate change place children at risk of mental health consequences including PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias, sleep disorders, attachment disorders, and substance abuse. These in turn can lead to problems with emotion regulation, cognition, learning, behavior, language development, and academic performance. Together, these create predispositions to adverse adult mental health outcomes. Children also exhibit high levels of concern over climate change. Meaning-focused coping promotes well-being and environmental engagement.
   Both direct and indirect climate change impacts affect children's psychological well-being. Children in the developing world will suffer the worst impacts. Mental health professionals have important roles in helping mitigate climate change, and researching and implementing approaches to helping children cope with its impacts.

AB In the present article, we propose that impulsive behavior may be a response to certain needs or goals that people have in the moment and could therefore be strategic. We review briefly the dominant approaches and findings in the impulsivity literature. We then examine different behaviors that are typically considered impulsive such as delay discounting, risky sexual behavior, risk taking in the context of emotion dysregulation, and adolescent risk behavior and present evidence suggesting that they follow the general principles of goal pursuit. Specifically, they are (a) enacted when perceived as relevant to the individual's motivation; (b) less likely when alternative means to fulfill these goals are available; and (c) supported rather than reduced by sufficient executive control, a hallmark of goal pursuit. We do not argue that there is no impulsive behavior. Rather, we suggest that such behavior may represent individuals' attempts to fulfill current motivations or needs. This approach emphasizes the functionality and dynamism of the behavior, it provides a framework to explain the inconsistencies in the literature, it helps us to move away from pathologizing or moralizing the behavior, and it provides insights about potential strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of acting impulsively.

AB IMPORTANCE Adolescence is a neurodevelopmental period during which experience-dependent plasticity in brain circuitry may confer vulnerability to depression as well as resilience to disorder. Little is known, however, about the neural mechanisms that underlie resilience during this critical period of brain development.
   OBJECTIVE To examine neural functional connectivity correlates of resilience in adolescent females at high and low familial risk for depression who did and did not develop the disorder.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal study was conducted at Stanford University from October 1, 2003, to January 31, 2017. Sixty-five female adolescents participated in the study: 20 at high risk in whom depression did not develop (resilient), 20 at high risk in whom depression developed (converted), and 25 at low risk with no history of psychopathology (control).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We compared functional connectivity between resilient and converted, and between resilient and control, adolescent females using voxelwise 2-sided t tests to examine neural markers of resilience to depression as the main outcomes of interest. Specifically, we assessed differences in connectivity of the limbic (amygdala seed), salience (anterior insula seed), and executive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seed) networks, implicated in emotion regulation. We also examined the association between functional connectivity and life events.
   RESULTS Of the 65 participants (mean [SD] age, 18.9 [2.5] years), adolescent females in the resilient group had greater connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (z score = 0.23; P < .001) and between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontotemporal regions (z score = 0.24; P < .001) than did converted adolescent females. In adolescent females in the resilient group only, strength of amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex connectivity was correlated with positive life events (r(18) = 0.48; P = .03). Resilient adolescent females had greater connectivity within frontal (z score = 0.07; P < .001) and limbic (z score = 0.21; P < .001) networks than did control individuals. Both high-risk groups had greater salience network connectivity: the converted group had greater intranetwork connectivity than did the resilient (z score = 0.13; P < .001) and control (z score = 0.10; P < .001) groups, and the adolescent females in the resilient group had greater salience network connectivity with the superior frontal gyrus than did the converted (z score = 0.24; P < .001) adolescent females.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Resilient adolescent females have compensatory functional connectivity patterns in emotion regulatory networks that correlate with positive life events, suggesting that experience-dependent plasticity within these networks may confer resilience to depression. Further studies are warranted concerning connectivity-associated targets for promoting resilience in high-risk individuals.

AB Children and their caregivers often disagree when reporting on child behavioural and emotional difficulties. But how does parent-child discordance relate to outcomes, particularly among children undergoing trauma therapy? This study examined parent-child discordance in relation to children's trauma symptoms and therapy outcomes. Participants included 96 trauma-exposed children and their caregivers, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Discordance was calculated using absolute difference scores between child- and parent- reported psychological symptoms. Parent-child discordance, calculated at pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at a six-month follow-up, predicted the severity of children's posttraumatic stress, dissociation, and internalizing and externalizing difficulties at each respective time-point. Pre-therapy discordance predicted improvements in externalizing behaviours after therapy and at follow-up. Improvements in discordance predicted improvements in trauma-specific symptoms over the course of treatment and at follow-up. The findings underscore how changes in parent-child discordance are related to child trauma symptoms and treatment response. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders featuring early impairments in social domain, with autonomic nervous system (ANS) unbalance possibly representing a useful marker for such disturbances. Impairments in joint attention (JA) are one of the earliest markers of social deficits in ASD. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using wearable technologies for characterizing the ANS response in ASD toddlers during the presentation of JA stimuli.
   Methods: Twenty ASD toddlers and 20 age- and gender-matched typically developed (TD) children were recorded at baseline and during a JA task through an unobtrusive chest strap for electrocardiography (ECG). Specific algorithms for feature extraction, including Heart Rate (HR), Standard Deviation of the Normal-to-Normal Intervals (SDNN), Coefficient of Variation (CV), pNN10 as well as low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF), were applied to the ECG signal and a statistical comparison between the two groups was performed.
   Results: As regards the single phases, SDNN (p = 0.04) and CV (p = 0.021) were increased in ASD at baseline together with increased LF absolute power (p = 0.034). Moreover, CV remained higher in ASD during the task (p = 0.03). Considering the phase and group interaction, LF increased from baseline to task in TD group (p = 0.04) while it decreased in the ASD group (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate the feasibility of characterizing the ANS response in ASD toddlers through a minimally obtrusive tool. Our analysis showed an increased SDNN and CV in toddlers with ASD particularly at baseline compared to TD and lower LF during the task. These findings could suggest the possibility of using the proposed approach for evaluating physiological correlates of JA response in young children with ASD.

AB Background: Studies have begun to identify psychosocial factors associated with depressive symptoms in youth with IBD. However, despite considerable speculation in the literature regarding the role of perceived stigma in both social and emotional adjustment outcomes, youth appraisals of stigma have yet to receive empirical attention. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the indirect effect of perceived illness stigma on depressive symptoms through its impact on social belongingness.
   Methods: Eighty youth (M-age = 14.96) with IBD completed measures of illness stigma, thwarted belongingness, and depressive symptoms during a scheduled clinic visit. Pediatric gastroenterologists provided estimates of disease activity. Analyses examined the direct and indirect effects of illness stigma on perceived thwarted belongingness and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Bootstrapped regression results revealed significant illness stigma -> depressive symptoms (beta = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.108 to 0.526), illness stigma -> thwarted belongingness (beta = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.061 to 0.739), and thwarted belongingness -> depressive symptoms (beta = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.143 to 0.474) direct paths. Mediation analyses revealed a significant illness stigma -> thwarted belongingness -> depressive symptoms indirect path (beta = 0.14, 95% CI, 0.034 to 0.310), suggesting increased appraisals of illness stigma impede youths' perceptions of social belongingness, which in turn, contribute to elevated depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Youth perceptions of illness stigma negatively impact social belongingness and depressive symptoms in youth with IBD. Further, decreased perceptions of social belongingness may be one potential route through which stigma influences emotional adjustment outcomes. Results support clinical observations regarding the relevance of illness stigma and social functioning as targets of intervention for improving emotional adjustment in youth with IBD.
