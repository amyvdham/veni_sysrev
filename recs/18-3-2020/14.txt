AB Purpose:  The changing expectations, therapies and outcomes for young people with cystic fibrosis (CF) necessitate a re-evaluation of the impact of this chronic illness on adolescent development.  The aim of this study was to assess the psychological well-being and adjustment of contemporary adolescents with CF.
   Methods:  Forty-nine adolescents with CF (24 males, 25 females) aged 14-18 years were enrolled from the Royal Children's Hospital CF Clinic, Melbourne, Australia.  The Offer Self-Image Questionnaire was administered to participating subjects whose growth and pubertal developmental and pulmonary function was assessed.
   Results:  The mean (SD) FEV1% was 82 (21), and mean (SD) National Institute of Health clinical score was 81 (12).  There were no significant differences between males and females in pulmonary function or clinical scores, but growth and pubertal development were delayed in both sexes.  Females, but not males, with CF were less well-adjusted than their healthy peers.  Two-way analysis of variance was performed and showed significant sex differences in sub-scales of the Offer questionnaire numbers I, II, III, VI, VIII, IX, as well as in the total score.  Age was significant only for scales II and VIII, and only scale II displayed an interaction between sex and age.
   Conclusions:  This study suggests that adjustment and self-esteem are less than ideal in young people with CF, especially females.

AB This article examined stability and change in late adolescent attachment relations and the interrelationship among attachment, separation-individuation, and college adjustment variables. Two studies are reported In the first cross-sectional study, freshman and upperclassmen college students completed self-report measures of attachment, separation, and adjustment. In the second study, students completed measures of attachment in their freshman year and 2 years later as juniors. In junior year, students also completed several measures of separation and adjustment to college. The results of both studies suggested stability in attachment to parents, over time, for both men and women. Security of attachment proved to be inversely related to independence from parents in cross-sectional and prospective/longitudinal analyses. Security of attachment to parents was positively and pervasively associated with a variety of concurrent indexes of college student adjustment. Secure attachment assessed in freshman year also was positively associated with academic and emotional adjustment in junior year, although the longitudinal results were not as pervasive as the cross-sectional findings, The results supported the importance of current and past perceptions of attachment for understanding late adolescent development and adjustment.

AB This study examines those aspects of disease that chronically ill children find stressful and the coping strategies they report using a manage these stressors. In particular, we examined whether a state or trait conceptualization of coping was most applicable to this population. Method: A total of 177 children with varying chronic illnesses were asked to complete a coping checklist in response to a self-generated illness-related problem and an everyday problem. Results: Analyses of coping strategy stability revealed gender but not age effects. Some coping strategies were used equally across varying illness-related stressors, but others, e.g, distraction, blaming others, and emotional regulation, varied by type of stressor. Moderately consistent patterns were found across illness-related and non-illness-related situations for the same individual. Conclusions: The results suggest that coping strategies used by chronically ill children have some stability but do vary across situations. Clinicians might benefit from routine screening of coping in chronically ill children.

AB Objective:  To illuminate the development of psychopathology by tracing 6-year predictive paths to outcomes assessed in terms of empirically based syndromes.  Method:  A national sample assessed at ages 4 through 12 years via parent reports was reassessed 3 and 6 years later via parent, teacher, and self-reports.  Results:  For syndromes having the clearest DSM counterparts, cross-informant predictive paths revealed similar traitlike patterns for Aggressive Behavior in both sexes; Delinquent Behavior was less traitlike, with greater sex differences in predictive paths; the Attention Problems syndrome was developmentally stable, but, surprisingly, it was associated with more diverse difficulties among girls than boys; conversely, Anxious/Depressed was associated with more diverse difficulties among boys than girls.  Conclusions:  Quantification of problems via empirically based syndromes can detect important sex, age, and developmental variations that may be masked by uniform diagnostic cutoff points for both sexes and diverse ages.  This may be especially true for diagnostic cutoff points derived mainly from clinical cases of one sex, such as depression for girls versus attention and conduct disorders for boys.

AB Behavior problems prevalent in schools were examined for a Canadian and a Welsh sample of students, aged 6 to 11, who were referred by their teachers. Their scores from the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (Teacher's Report Form) were compared. Similarities were found in the severity and frequency of acting-out or undercontrolled behaviors, while significant differences were seen in inhibited or overcontrolled behaviors. Canadian teachers observed more overcontrolled behaviors among their students who were referred for assistance. Implications regarding cross-national differences in the nature of behavior problems observed in classrooms, their effect on school performance, and teacher expectations are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study compared AIDS knowledge and attitudes in public high school students (N = 167), incarcerated delinquents (N = 166), and emotionally disturbed (SED) adolescents (N = 151). The response measure was a 50-item Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) questionnaire that was previously used by Bell et al., in their 1991 study of learning disabled adolescents. Although AIDS knowledge was moderately high in all three groups, widespread misunderstandings about disease transmission and awareness of high-risk groups and practices were noted Knowledge scores were significantly higher in the public school sample than in the SED adolescents; moreover they tended to be slightly higher (p < .10) than the delinquent group as well. Teenagers with the severest emotional problems were by far the least informed Age and race were also predictive of AIDS knowledge. Other results showed that delinquents were more permissive in their attitudes about sex more inclined to disdain safe sex practices, and more likely to feel threatened by high-risk groups as well as powerless to protect themselves against AIDS. Generally speaking, the findings extend the work of other investigators on the needs for AIDS education in adolescents. The need is especially urgent in delinquent and emotionally disturbed youth who may require a more comprehensive intervention because of their greater knowledge deficits, propensity for high-risk practices, and tendency to deny or underestimate their own vulnerability.

AB In this article, recent developments in the assessment and diagnosis of child psychopathology are discussed with an emphasis on standardized methodologies that provide data that can be scored on empirically derived groupings of problems that tend to co-occur. Assessment methodologies are highlighted that especially take account of the Following three basic characteristics of child psychopathology: (1) the quantitative nature of child psychopathology; (2) the role of developmental differences in the occurrence of problem behaviors, and (3) the need for multiple informants. Cross-cultural research is needed to test the applicability of assessment procedures across different settings as well as the generalizability of taxonomic constructs. Assessments of children in different cultures con be compared or pooled to arrive at a multicultural knowledge base which may be much stronger than knowledge based on only one culture. It is essential to avoid assuming that data From any single source reveal the significance of particular problems. Instead, comprehensive assessment of psychopathology requires coordination of multisource data using a multiaxial assessment approach.

AB In open-ended interviews, parents of 254 siblings of children with cancer evaluated the pre- and postdiagnosis adjustment of their children. One-fourth of the siblings were asymptomatic both before and after the diagnosis. Behavior and emotional problems were the most frequently reported problems arising after the diagnosis. Before the diagnosis, less than 12 percent of the siblings had either behavioral or affective symptoms, whereas 26 percent had such symptoms after the diagnosis. Type of maladjustment was unrelated to sex, birth order, or severity of the patient's illness. On the positive side, parents also reported favorable changes because of the illness in siblings' maturity, supportiveness, and independence. These positive effects were more likely to occur among adolescent and first-born siblings and when the patient's prognosis was poorer.

AB In recent years, more and more intensive treatment protocols have been initiated with the goal of improving long-term survival of pediatric cancer patients. Empirical evaluation of the psychological and social adjustment of the cohort of children with newly diagnosed cancer being treated with these modem regimens is essential to enhance quality of life. Inconsistencies in the literature on the ''average'' adjustment of children with cancer can be attributed to a number of methodological differences across studies. Assessment of physically healthy children's adjustment based on independently derived information from the children, parents, and teachers has consistently shown a lack of congruence among these three sources. This discordance or lack of agreement among reports of child adjustment was termed ''cross-informant variance'' for the purposes of the present investigation. Cross-informant variance among child, parent, and teacher report measures has not been systematically investigated for pediatric cancer patients. Consistent with the general empirical literature on children, the results of the study generally demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (rs ranged from .10 to .50) across the three measures, indicating the need for cross-informant assessment to determine the quality of life of pediatric cancer patients more adequately.

AB Research on the origins of conduct problems such as disruptive, aggressive, and delinquent behaviour has focused mainly on deficits and risk factors. Protective factors have received more attention only recently in the context of resilience research. In the present study cross-sectional and longitudinal (2-year interval) comparisons were made of two groups of 14- to 17-year-olds from residential homes. Both groups have grown up under accumulated stressful life events and circumstances (multi-problem milieu). One group (N = 66) has so far shown no serious behavioral and emotional problems (Resilients); the other (N = 80) has developed manifest disorders, particularly in the externalising syndrome. Potential protective factors (intelligence, temperament, self-related cognitions, coping styles, experience with reference persons, social support, social climate, etc.) were recorded with tests, questionnaires, and interviews. Protective factors functioned additively, subtypes could not be differentiated. Findings from the longitudinal survey showed somewhat lower effects in personal resources and were only partially consistent with the cross-sectional comparison. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed, and it is suggested that the construct of resiliency in multi-problem milieus requires a dynamic, development- and context-related interpretation.

AB Background. Changes in the diagnosis of endocrine-based growth disorders and the advent of biosynthetic growth hormone have altered the long-standing policy of treating only those individuals with ''classic'' growth hormone deficiency. One justification for treating short children is to improve their psychosocial adaptation. The present investigation assessed the positive and negative behavioral adaptation, self-perceptions of domain-specific competencies, and global self-worth of a large, diagnostically heterogeneous sample of children and adolescents referred to pediatric endocrinologists for a growth evaluation.
   Methods. All patients seen in a pediatric endocrine clinic (180 boys and 78 girls; 4 to 18 years) with a height at the fifth percentile or lower were included. Parents of all participating children completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Patients 8 years and older completed the Self-Perception Profile and those 11 years and older, in addition, completed the Youth Self Report. Short-stature (SS) subjects were compared with normative and psychiatric samples.
   Results. The SS boys were described by parents as being significantly less socially competent and showing more behavioral and emotional problems than a normative sample selected for mental health. However, they were significantly more socially competent and showed fewer psychopathologic symptoms than a psychiatric referred sample of comparable age. The SS boys described themselves as less socially active but did not report more behavior disturbance than the normative sample. The SS boys' self-perceptions of domain-specific competencies and global self-worth were comparable to a normative comparison group with the exception that older subjects (13 years or older) described their athletic abilities more positively and their work competence more negatively. The SS girls were, with few exceptions, indistinguishable from the normal comparison groups on both parent- and self-report measures of social competency and behavior disturbance. Younger SS girls (ages 8 to 12 years) described their athletic competence and behavioral conduct more positively than the comparison group on the self-esteem questionnaire. Patient height deficit was unrelated to scores on the three questionnaires. Finally, no statistically significant differences in psychosocial functioning were detected between children with ''normal-variant'' SS and those with pathologic growth disorders.
   Conclusions. Short-stature girls show more adaptive psychosocial functioning than SS boys. In either sex, SS does not appear to be associated with clinically significant psychosocial morbidity. Severity of the height deficit does not correlate with the level of behavioral adaptation. These observations challenge the justification of providing growth hormone therapy for all short children to improve their psychosocial functioning.

AB Since the 1950's effective control of conception has allowed modem men and women to differentiate procreational from recreational sexual exchange. What is considered highly erotic has differed widely through time and in various cultures. In the U.S. the female breast has come to mean far more than nurturing an infant. Sexuality symbolizes youth, attractiveness, desirability and as such is used for effective commercial marketing. The reality of cancer remains to be dealt with in health care at a physical level but more is needed to assist the emotional adjustment of affected women and their partners. Brief sex therapy for sex symptoms is outlined.

AB The background and rationale of a recently started project of the Amsterdam Institute for Addiction Research are outlined. This project is aimed at the psychological mechanisms underlying an enhanced risk of(later) addiction in children of alcoholics and the relationship with childhood psychopathology. A dual pathway mechanism is proposed, in which the type of alcoholism of the parent plays a major role. The child of a multigenerational primary alcoholic parent may suffer from an inherited mild dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, expressed in neuropsychological and personality characteristics similar to those of the alcoholic parent. These are impulsive, aggressive and reward-seeking behaviour, response perseveration and, in some children, related psychopathology such as conduct disorders. For a child of a secondary alcoholic parent, another mechanism is proposed. In these children, stress and social learning may lead to negative affectivity and repressive coping style, with emotional problems at a later age, and the risk of falling into the ''circle of secondary alcoholism''. In both pathways, alcohol-related expectancies are suggested to constitute a ''final common pathway'' between different risk factors and later alcohol abuse. Specific expectancies might be related to different pathways and to gender differences in later drinking patterns.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; DEPRESSION; BOYS
AB Despite the fact that boys greatly outnumber girls in receiving services under the category Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED), the possibility of bias against girls with SED has received relatively little attention. Data on three groups of adolescent students were analysed: (a) students served as SED by the public schools (ED Sch, n = 53) (b) students identified by the schools as SED bur served as inpatients at a private psychiatric hospital (ED Psy, n = 24) and (c) students not identified as SED by the public schools but who received services at a private psychiatric hospital (NI Psy n = 40). Girls were a small proportion of the ED Sch and ED Psy groups, but the majority of the NI Psy group. These preliminary data indicate that some girls with serious emotional problems are not identified by the public schools yet are being served by private psychiatric hospitals. Possible reasons for this potentially inequitable allocation of school special education resources are suggested. Consideration and further study of the gender issues and identification and services to students with SED are discussed.

AB Peer social status, friendships, and adjustment were measured for 326 school-aged children (M age = 8 years, 8 months).  Although status and friendship were related, they were not redundant.  Some rejected and neglected children had friends; and some popular and average children did not have friends.  Both peer social status and friendship were found to contribute uniquely to children's socio-emotional adjustment, academic competence, and self-concept.  These results argue for the functional importance of both types of peer relationships for school-aged children.

AB A significant proportion of children with anorectal malformations have long term problems with faecal continence. The psychological consequences of this chronic disability was assessed in 160 children and adolescents.
   The prevalence of clinically significant emotional problems among the sample overall, as assessed by a diagnostic psychiatric interview (19%), parental assessment (27%), and child self report depressive scale (24%) was higher than expected relative to normative populations. With the exception of the young girls (6-11 years), the incontinent children and adolescents were not judged to be less well adjusted than those with good bowel control.
   Treatment for anorectal malformations appears to be associated with an increased risk for behavioural and social problems, but this was not related to the level of continence. Parental factors and gender were significantly associated with outcome. These children and families would benefit from psychological evaluation and support especially during early childhood.

AB Predictors of the attitudinal measure of orientation toward help-seeking for emotional problems have been shown to include demographic, network, and personality variables. This research determined whether these same variables predict the behavioral outcome measure of help-seeking, both in general and from professional services in particular. Help-seeking in response to emotional problems was studied in a sample of Australian adolescents. General help-seeking was predicted by more symptoms of psychological distress, being female, availability of social support, knowing someone who had sought professional help, and the personality characteristics of high private self-consciousness and willingness to disclose mental health. When only those with evident emotional distress were considered, only gender and willingness to disclose remained significant predictors. These same variables did not account for those who sought professional help rather than relying upon their informal network. Level of psychological distress was the only significant predictor of professional consultation. Psychological symptoms and gender were shown to be more relevant predictors of the behavioral measure of help-seeking than network or personality characteristics.

AB Background - The psychosocial functioning of adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis still living in the parental home was investigated. With its proven genetic aetiology cystic fibrosis is an ideal model with which to assess the impact of a chronic and life threatening disorder on family and individual psychological and social functioning.
   Methods - Twenty nine patients with cystic fibrosis and their families were compared with those of 27 patients with anorexia nervosa and 31 well controls. Assessments were made using self reporting, interview, and observational methods.
   Results - Most patients with cystic fibrosis were in robust psychological health and only differed from their healthy peers in that they were much less likely to be in employment. Mothers of patients with cystic fibrosis or anorexia nervosa were more likely than the mothers of the well group to be emotionally distressed, although this was not so for fathers. Young people in both illness groups were more likely to have parents with high levels of expressed emotion. Most families of patients with cystic fibrosis had good problem solving abilities.
   Conclusions - In spite of the burden of illness in cystic fibrosis psychological functioning in many respects matches that of well young people.

AB Child Behaviour Checklist scores for 7-, 12-, and 15-year-olds from a two-stage cluster sample of Melbourne schoolchildren were compared with U.S. 1991 norms and with children from Sydney. This study was prompted by a previous finding that Sydney parents rated children substantially higher on behaviour problems compared with U.S. norms. Response rates in Melbourne parents varied from 30-60% for the different age groups with 7-year-olds having the highest response rate. The Melbourne 7-year-olds' mean problem scores were not significantly different from the U.S. norms. The 12- and 15-year-olds' scores were slightly lower than U.S. norms. No significant differences were found for the total competence score except for the 7-year-old boys, who scored lower than the U.S. norms. In contrast, both the Melbourne and U.S. samples scored significantly lower than Sydney on the problem scores and the younger Sydney children scored significantly higher than Melbourne 7-year-olds on the competence score. Due to the modest response rates, especially for the older children, the low scores need to be interpreted with caution and should not be interpreted as Australian normative data. The differences between Melbourne and Sydney scores could not be fully explained, however, by differences in sample selection or SES distribution. Despite the restrictions of this study, these results suggest.there is additional support for the view that the U.S. normative data may be appropriate for use with Australian children.

AB Neuropsychological and psychosocial assessment of 58 Victorian and South Australian school-aged children who sustained a closed head injury was carried out immediately postinjury and at 6 months follow-up. For those children whose head injury was defined as mild (length of coma less than 1 hour) outcome on all variables was good at both time points. Children with moderate to severe injury (length of coma greater than 1 hour) had lower WISC-R IQ scores at both time points and were particularly poor on reading and spelling measures. There was no improvement over time on the academic measures. Family and parental functioning was in the normative range and, although some children showed a clinical level of behaviour problems, there was no consistency in their clinical status over time nor across parent and teacher informants. Our results suggest that there are no particular concerns for the long-term outcome of mildly head-injured children but that cognitive and school learning problems for moderate to severely head-injured children puts them at continuing risk.

The questionnaires, Parent's Checklist (PCL) and Teacher's Checklist (TCL) were then used to screen a group of 93 children attending one Deaf School and three Hearing Impaired Units (HIU). Psychiatric assessments were conducted with a highly structured diagnostic interview, the Child Assessment Schedule (CAS). The interview with signing deaf children was conducted with a sign language interpreter. The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in the whole group was 50.3%, 42.4% in the group attending the Deaf School and 60.9% for the group attending the HIUs. An aetiological model of psychiatric disorder in this group is proposed.

AB About half of all children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have significant problems with their peer relationships. These social difficulties appear to be related to a high rate of intrusive behavior, deficits in conversation and reciprocity, social-cognitive biases, and poor emotional regulation. Social skills interventions have been advocated to teach children and adolescents how to interact more successfully with their peers. To date, few studies have systematically evaluated social skills interventions for children with ADHD. However, studies with children and adolescents who are disruptive have pointed to serious limitations in the generalization of treatment effects to the natural environment and questionable changes in peer relationships as a result of these treatments. These limitations and potentially useful adjunctive and alternative treatment strategies are discussed, including careful attention to setting events, the strategic use of peers, and the impact of medications on peer interactions.

AB Tested the role of self-esteem as a mediator of relationships between socio-environmental experiences and emotional/behavioral problems using a sample of 215 young adolescents (Grades 7-9). Socioenvironmental experiences were assessed using self-report questionnaire measures of social support and major and minor stressful events. Self-esteem was assessed using a self-report questionnaire, an interview, and a parent-report questionnaire. Emotional/behavioral problems were assessed using self-report, parent-report and teacher-report questionnaires. Utilizing structural equation modeling, the data were used to test a model in which self-esteem mediated the relationship between socioenvironmental experiences and emotional/behavioral problems. The hypothesized model provided a reasonably good fit to the data (normed fit index = .90). However, an alternative model which also allowed for direct effects of socioenvironmental experiences on emotional/behavioral problems produced a significant improvement in model fit. In this model, socio-environmental experiences had significant effects on emotional problems via both direct effects and indirect effects that indicated a mediating role of self-esteem. Only direct effects of socioenvironmental experiences were evident for behavioral problems.

AB The application of structural equation modeling to twin data is used to assess the impact of genetic and environmental factors on children's behavioral and emotional functioning. The models are applied to the maternal ratings of behavior of a subsample of 515 monozygotic and 749 dizygotic juvenile twin pairs, ages 8 through 16, obtained through mailed questionnaires as part of the Medical College of Virginia Adolescent Behavioral Development Twin Project. The importance of genetic, shared, and specific environmental factors for explaining variation is reported for both externalizing and internalizing behaviors, as well as significant differences in the causes of variation in externalizing behaviors among young boys and girls. The usefulness of applying structural equation models to data on monozygotic and dizygotic twins and the potential implications for addressing clinically relevant questions regarding the causes of psychopathology are discussed.

The children were aged between 7 and 17 years, with hearing losses ranging from mild to profound, and were attending either an integrated (n=55), unit(n=37), or segregated educational setting (n=8). The aim of this study was to obtain the children's perceptions of their academic achievement, use of support services, and friendship patterns and to investigate the relationship between these perceptions and selected student characteristics. Eighty-three percent of children perceived their overall academic progress to be ''average'' or ''above average'' as compared to their class peers. Nearly all children received audiological support and over one-third were supported by speech therapists and integration aides. Interpreters and notetakers were used by students in two of the seven unit settings. Nearly two-thirds of the children reported that most of their friends had normal hearing.

ID DSM-III DISORDERS; LARGE SAMPLE; FAMILY-SIZE; CHILDREN; DELINQUENTS
AB Recent studies have suggested an association between birth order and psychopathology. However, the association remains unclear due to a lack of consideration of the confounding effects of family size. At age seven years the family size and birth order of children from a large cohort of New Zealand children were examined in relation to parental help seeking for behavioural and emotional problems, and the development of DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980) disorder in pre-adolescence and adolescence. Neither the child's gender, birth order nor family size were associated with parental help seeking or the prevalence of DSM-III disorder in pre-adolescence at age 11. In adolescence at age 15, however, significantly more girls, first-borns and children from small families had DSM-III disorder, but the interactions between these factors were not significant. In particular, these associations were found with internalizing disorders. The appropriateness of further studies of birth order in relation to psychopathology is discussed.

AB The risk of adjustment problems increases when a child has a serious life-threatening illness. This article estimates the frequency of adjustment problems across multiple domains for children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Parents provided information on the social, emotional, academic, and family adjustment of 327 children with SCA who were being treated at a comprehensive sickle cell clinic serving a predominantly poor and urban population. More than 25 percent of these children had emotional adjustment problems in the form of internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression. In addition, at least one child in five had problems related to social functioning and academic performance. These impairments were related significantly to the frequency of serious pain episodes but not to absolute family income. No significant differences in the data were found based on family income. The data also showed that the disruptive effects of the illness were related to gender and age.

AB Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of aggression, depression, and other mood disorders. Low levels of serotonin in the central nervous system have been associated with a variety of problems including depression, aggression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, eating disorders, and panic disorders. Fluoxetine has been shown to be effective for many of these problems in the general population and in the developmentally disabled population. Males and females who are affected with the FMR-1 mutation commonly exhibit behavioral and emotional problems. Previous reports have shown that depression, anxiety, and schizoid features are common in the heterozygotes, and aggression is seen in approximately 30% of the affected males. This study surveys the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment in all fragile X patients known in our clinic who have taken fluoxetine. Eighteen females with the FMR-1 mutation were treated with fluoxetine with an overall response rate of 83%. Ten out of 14 (71%) patients who had depression were helped. All patients who had problems with mood lability, panic attacks, and outburst behavior were improved. Three out of 4 patients (75%) with obsessive-compulsive symptoms were helped along with 5 out of 6 (83%) with anxiety. Persistent side effects were seen in 44%, and the most common were weight gain and weight loss. Seventeen males with fragile X syndrome were treated with fluoxetine for physical and/or verbal aggression. Overall, 12 out of 17 male patients (70.5%) were improved by fluoxetine treatment. Eleven were very much improved, and 1 was somewhat improved. In addition to aggression, the following symptoms in males also responded to treatment: mood lability (9 of 13, 69%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (3 of 5, 60%), hyperactivity (5 of 6, 83%), depression (5 of 6, 83%), self-abuse (6 of 8, 75%), and anxiety (2 of 4, 50%). Persistent side effects were seen in 29.4%, and they included nausea. This survey suggests that fluoxetine is an effective and relatively safe medication for the treatment of depression and mood lability in heterozygotes and of aggression in males with fragile X syndrome. Further studies including controlled treatment trials of fluoxetine in fragile X syndrome are warranted.

TI ART-THERAPY IN THE REHABILITATION OF ADOLESCENTS WITH SPINAL-CORD
   INJURIES - A CASE-STUDY
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ART THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
AB This case study highlights the usefulness of art as a therapeutic modality in the rehabilitation of adolescents with quadriplegia. It often is difficult to engage adolescents in verbal psychotherapy. Art therapy is shown to be an effective alternative means of self-expression that serves as a catalyst for adjustment. Drawings and clinical material from the therapy of a 13-year-old girl with quadriplegia resulting from spinal cord injury are presented. Themes of disturbed body image, isolation, and concern over control are evident in her work. The significance of these otherwise unexpressed inner conflicts is discussed in the context of her overall progress in rehabilitation.
   Adolescents with quadriplegia present unique emotional problems during rehabilitation. They frequently exhibit denial (Geller and Greydanus, 1979; Gordon, 1987), which makes traditional forms of psychotherapy difficult. Furthermore, they may project anger over the disability onto the staff of the rehabilitation facility, preventing the formation of a therapeutic alliance. In addition to the general adjustment difficulties experienced by people with spinal cord injuries, adolescents often have developmentally congruent concerns regarding autonomy, control, and body image which may be difficult for them to articulate.
   Art therapy is based on the concept that defense mechanisms commonly used in speech are not readily transferable to drawings (Labarca, 1979). Some clients are able to express their inner conflicts through art; thus the therapy provides a forum in which emotions can be revealed. Art therapy has been used successfully in health care settings to treat adolescents, including oncology patients (O'Neill, 1989; Walker, 1989) and anorectic patients (Wolf, Willmuth, Gazda, & Watkins, 1985). However, there has been no documented study of its use with adolescents who have spinal cord injuries.
   In this case study, a brief introduction to the patient will be followed by a discussion of her artwork, a series of drawings rendered in individual psychotherapy sessions over a period of several months during an inpatient rehabilitation stay.

AB Objective. To evaluate the relationship of geographic mobility to children's emotional/behavioral adjustment and school functioning.
   Design. Analysis of data from the 1988 National Health Interview Survey of Child Health in which multistage probability sampling was used to obtain data for nationally representative estimates of health and demographic characteristics of US children.
   Participants. 10 362 US school-age children and their families. Measurements. The 1988 National Health Interview Survey of Child Health includes data on health and demographic characteristics, emotional/behavioral variables, school functioning, and geographic mobility for 10 362 US school-age children. This study examined the relationship of children's geographic mobility to children's reported emotional problems, use of psychological help, scores on a Behavior Problem Index, repeating a grade in school, and being suspended or expelled from school.
   Results. Twenty-four percent of children have never moved, 35% of children have moved once or twice, and 39% of children aged 6 to 17 years have moved three or more times in their lifetime. Using multiple logistic regression to control for important demographic variables, children who moved three or more times were 2.3 times more likely to have had emotional/behavioral problems, 2.2 times more likely to have received psychological help, 1.7 times more likely to have repeated a grade, and 1.9 times more likely to have been suspended or expelled from school compared with children who had never moved. Multiple regression was also used to analyze the impact of mobility in relation to scores on the Behavior Problem Index. Children who moved three or more times were 1.6 times more likely to be in the top tenth percentile of scores on the Behavior Problem Index compared with children who had never moved.
   Conclusions. Children who move three or more times are at increased risk for emotional/behavioral and school problems. Thus, pediatricians, other health professionals, and educators should be alert to the potential educational and psychological problems among children from highly mobile families.

AB The current study was a long-term follow-up (approx. 14 yr following treatment) of 26 late adolescents/young adults (17 yr and older) who had participated in parent training with their mothers when they were young (2-7 yr old) noncompliant children. Parent training, consisting of teaching mothers to use attends and rewards for appropriate behavior, clear commands and time-out, had reduced deviant behavior and increased compliance immediately following treatment. At this follow-up, these individuals were compared to a matched community sample on various measures of delinquency, emotional adjustment, academic progress and relationship with parents. No differences emerged between the two groups on any of the measures, suggesting that noncompliant children who participated in parent training during their early years are functioning as well as nonclinic individuals as they move into adulthood.

AB This study examined the relation between mothers' attachment strategies and emotion regulation in a sample of 42 families with two high-school-aged siblings.  Maternal attachment strategies were assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), an interview about mothers' own childhood attachment relationships.  Mothers with Preoccupied AAI strategies had difficulty regulating emotion during conversations with their older teenagers.  These mothers were more anxious and intrusive, and their teenagers had difficulty discussing their goals and plans for the future.  Mothers with Secure AAI strategies perceived their daughters as more ego-resilient or capable of modulating emotion in situationally appropriate ways.  These findings suggest that mothers' attachment strategies have important implications for how they perceive and respond to their children in an emotionally challenging situation during late adolescence.

AB Resilient adolescents are notable for their social competence, which enables them to form and maintain close relationships. The evidence is that adolescents' social competence is derived from their experience of close relationships within their family. On the basis of structured interviews, adolescents' working models of attachments can be categorized into secure, dismissive, or pre-occupied. These attachment styles are associated with very divergent beliefs about the self and others, with differing patterns of emotion regulation and with differing risk profiles for maladjustment. Parenting styles and family relationships appear to have considerable influence on attachment behaviour. Further evidence for the importance of the family comes from research on ego development. Family level behavioural patterns have been discerned from family research interviews which are associated with stagnation or advancement in ego development during adolescence. Though the results suggest causal connections, the direction of effects is far from clear. Longitudinal research underpins the importance of childhood temperament as a contributing factor to the quality of the family environment that the child and then adolescent experiences.

AB We explored three broad issues in the article. First, do gifted and nongifted children differ in their self-concepts? Second, what are the effects on the self-concept of labeling the child as gifted? Third, are there any effects on self-concept of placing a child in special programs for the gifted? The review begins with a discussion of theoretical and methodological issues associated with the self-concept and giftedness constructs. This is followed by a meta-analysis of studies bearing on the three issues. Two types of studies are reviewed: (a) cases. where gifted and average students are compared in terms of the self-concept and (b) studies in which gifted children are exposed to differential programming and the effects on self-concept explored. The studies indicated generally higher academic self-concepts for gifted students, but otherwise the results of the investigations were highly variable. The article concludes with a discussion of research and practical implications.

AB Epidemiology, the study of patterns of disease distribution in time and space, can help to improve mental health services for children and adolescents by increasing understanding of the causes, development, and course of psychiatric disorders. For the purpose of service delivery, epidemiologic research on child psychopathology can provide information on need for services, availability of services, and effectiveness of services. For both scientific and planning purposes, epidemiologic research can inform us about (1) the developmental course of psychiatric disorders during childhood and adolescence, (2) the effect of psychiatric disorder on the course of normal childhood development, and (3) the effect of childhood development on the developmental course of psychiatric disorder. Information about prevalence and incidence is useful for planning primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention and treatment services. The same information is scientifically useful to the extent that it helps to answer questions about causation, course, and outcome. However, one aim of this paper is to show that epidemiology is about a great deal more than rates of disorder.

AB Objective: To determine the cross-cultural applicability of self-reports of adolescents' problems and competencies. Method: Youth Self-Reports (YSRs) were completed by 803 American and 803 Dutch nonreferred adolescents matched by gender, age, and socioeconomic status Results: Comparisons revealed that American adolescents reported many more problems than did Dutch adolescents. This finding contrasts sharply with the American/Dutch similarities in parents' and teachers' reports of children's problem behaviors. Competence scores also were much higher for the American than the Dutch sample. Conclusions: Cutpoints for discriminating the normal and the clinical range of YSR scores need to be adjusted to local norms for the Dutch sample. Cultural factors may be responsible for the cross-national differences.

Teachers' ratings of children's constructive coping and attentional control were positively related to boys' social skills and peer status, whereas negative affect was negatively related. Acting out (vs. avoidant) coping and emotional intensity were negatively related to girls' and boys' social skills and boys' peer status. In addition, mothers' reports of boys' coping by seeking social support and low emotional intensity were associated with boys' positive social functioning, whereas avoidant coping was positively related to girls' rated social skills. The results are discussed in relation to research on emotion regulation and coping with emotion in interpersonal contexts.

DT Article
ID PERCEPTIONS; CHILDREN; PARENTS
AB Previous research has indicated that homeless children exhibit high rates of behavioral and emotional problems and come from families characterised by conflict and rejection. Further, some evidence exists to show that family variables may relate to adolescent distress differently for homeless males and females. In this study, 117 homeless adolescents were compared to a sample of non-homeless youths on the self reported incidence of personal and family problems. The homeless children reported the highest incidence of all behavioral and emotional problems, parental marital discord, overprotection, and the lowest levels of parental care and acceptance. Sex effects were not evident in reported levels of personal or family problems. However, substantially more variance in the adolescents level of behavioral and emotional disturbance was predictable from family measures for females than males. Overall, the results point to the importance of incorporating family distress models in the understanding and remediation of adolescent homelessness.

AB This study sought to evaluate the existence and implications of familial aggregation of emotional and behavioral problems of childhood in a general population sample. Method: The children included in the study were chosen with the use of a sampling technique that identified households in which there were two or more children aged 4-16 years living at home at the time of the survey. Ratings on checklists of emotional and behavioral problems were obtained from Parents, teachers of children in elementary school, and the children themselves if they were adolescents aged 12-16. Children were classified as having problems if their scores on scales of conduct, attention deficit, or emotional problems were in the top 1 0% of the distribution of scores from any informant. Results: There was evidence for familial aggregation of these problems, particularly conduct and emotional problems. However, this was largely derived from the parents' reports of symptoms, not the teachers' or adolescents' reports. The degree of familial aggregation varied according to certain sibship characteristics and patterns of comorbidity. Conclusions: Familial aggregation of emotional and behavioral problems does exist in a community population and is not simply an artifact of clinic attendance.

AB The maintenance of high social competence despite stress was examined in a 6-month prospective study of 138 inner-city ninth-grade students. The purpose was to provide a replication and extension of findings derived from previous cross-sectional research involving a comparable sample of children. Specifically, goals were to examine the extent to which high-stress children with superior functioning on one or more aspects of school-based social competence could evade significant difficulties in (a) other spheres of competence at school and (b) emotional adjustment. Measurements of stress were based on uncontrollable negative life events. Competence was assessed via behavioral indices including school grades, teacher ratings, and peer ratings, and emotional distress was measured via self-reports. Results indicated that high-stress children who showed impressive behavioral competence were highly vulnerable to emotional distress over time. Furthermore, almost 85% of the high-stress children who seemed resilient based on at least one domain of social competence at Time 1 had significant difficulties in one or more domains examined when assessed at both Time 1 and Time 2. Findings are discussed in terms of conceptual and empirical issues in resilience research.

AB To ascertain pediatrician's expectations of child psychiatric consultants at our facility, a self-report questionnaire was sent to the 135 members of the Department of Pediatrics, The University of Florida Health Science Center, in 1991. The 73 respondents (54%) reported high rates of emotional problems and adverse family situations in their patients, and a majority said they used psychiatric consultation sometimes or often. Adolescents were the patient group most frequently referred, and behavioral problems were the most frequent reasons for consultation requests. Pediatricians most valued a timely response and accessibility from consultants. These results are discussed with reference to the further development of a consultation-liaison service within a child and adolescent psychiatry training program.

AB We studied adolescents' behavioral and emotional problems in the United States and in Thailand, a Buddhist country in which, reportedly, aggression is discouraged and self-control. emotional restraint, and social inhibition are encouraged. Standardized parent reports on 118 problems revealed 45 Thai-US. differences. Thai adolescents were reported to show more overcontrolled problems (e.g., shyness, compulsivity, inhibition of talking, fearfulness, and constipation) than American adolescents (p <.0001). The two groups did not differ reliably in total undercontrolled problems, but Americans showed higher levels of direct, overt, and interpersonally aggressive undercontrol (e.g., fighting and bullying), whereas Thais showed more indirect and subtle undercontrol that was not interpersonally aggressive (e.g., sulking and sullenness). The findings suggest that different cultures may be linked to different styles of adolescent problem behavior.

Empirical research is discussed within 7 topic areas: aggressive and violent behavior, nonviolent criminal behavior, substance abuse, self-injurious and suicidal behavior, emotional problems, interpersonal problems, and academic and vocational difficulties. The studies reviewed involve primarily adult populations, although pertinent findings from literature on children and adolescents are briefly summarized. Some variables that affect the relation between physical abuse and long-term consequences are examined. These moderator variables include maltreatment characteristics, individual factors, family factors, and environmental factors. The article ends with suggestions for future research on long-term consequences and variables that may affect these outcomes.

AB Despite waning enthusiasm for labelling theories in the development of psychopathology, it has been claimed that contact with professional agencies in childhood can be associated with increased levels of later problem behaviour. In this study, help-seeking by parents for children with behaviour problems was examined using a birth cohort followed longitudinally to age 15 years. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that agency contact increased the risk of later mental health disorder, either in childhood or adolescence. Rather, the results suggested that help-seeking was associated with a reduction in both the risk of DSM-III disorder and problem behaviour scores, up to five years after agency contact.

This article reviews the critical role of social support in helping children adjust to their illness and treatment. Social skills training for newly diagnosed children is presented as an important intervention strategy for increasing positive social interactions and overall psychosocial adjustment. A randomized, clinical research trial currently in progress that will evaluate the impact of social skills training on newly diagnosed children 5-13 years of age is delineated. The potentially positive impact of social skills training on the prevention of emotional problems and increased biologic survival are discussed.

AB Behavioural/emotional problems were assessed at least nine years after surgical correction for congenital heart disease (ConHD) in childhood. Parents of 144 10-15-year-old ConHD-children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and 179, 11-17-year-old, ConHD-adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR). On the CBCL and YSR ConHD-children and adolescents obtained significantly higher problem scores than same-aged peers from normative reference groups. No significant differences were found between problem scores for different cardiac diagnostic groups. A negative correlation was found between CBCL total problem sores and IQ-scores of ConHD-children; for YSR total problem scores no such relationship was found.

AB Paediatricians are often asked to assess children with emotional and behavioural problems and are faced with the dilemma that reports about the children's behaviour obtained from the children, and from their parents and teachers, may differ. This study compares the number of childhood emotional and behavioural problems reported by children living in the community, with the number of problems reported by their parents and teachers. When describing both internalizing and externalizing problems, the children consistently reported that they had more problems than were reported by either their parents or teachers. This pattern was particularly evident with reports from older female children who reported many more internalizing problems than were reported by their parents and teachers. Possible reasons for the differences between reports from children and the other informants are discussed.

AB This prospective study was designed to assess growth response, side effects, other possible long-term effects, and final adult height in boys treated with the oral androgen, fluoxymesterone. From 1973 to 1984, eighty-two short boys (71 with constitutional delay of growth and puberty [CDGP] and 11 with genetic short stature [GSS]) were treated with daily oral doses of 2.5 mg of fluoxymesterone from 6 to 60 months. Final height assessment was made from 1989 to 1991. A group of 34 untreated boys (26 with CDGP and 8 with GSS) were also followed to assess the accuracy of the Greulich-Pyle and Bayley-Pinneau (GP-BP) and sexual maturity index height prediction methods. During treatment, each patient had a 1.7- to 2.5-fold increase in linear growth velocity. Accelerated velocity (over baseline) continued as long as the bone age was less than 14 years. No adverse androgenic effects (or undue acceleration of puberty) were observed. Final height exceeded pretreatment predictions for CDGP + GSS by 6.1 +/- 3.5 (SD) cm (GP-BP) and 5.4 +/- 3.2 cm (sexual maturity index). It is concluded that a daily oral dose of 2.5 mg of fluoxymesterone can be used to accelerate linear growth in boys with CDGP and GSS when needed to alleviate emotional problems secondary to slow growth and short stature without fear of compromising final adult height.

ID CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; VALIDITY; RATINGS
AB Investigated agreement between mothers, fathers, teachers, and children on equivalent forms of a standardized measure of behavioral and emotional problems. Ninety-eight children, age 13 years, completed the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991d). Their mothers and fathers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991b), and their teachers completed the Teacher Report Form (Achenbach, 1991c). Children generally reported the most problems and teachers the least. Agreement was highest between mothers and fathers on internalizing and externalizing problems, and lowest for rater pairs involving teachers on internalizing problems. Analyses of a multitrait-multimethod matrix for ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems indicated good convergent validity, large rater effects, and weaker discriminant validity. Conditional probabilities for agreement on deviant and nondeviant scores indicated that ratings by no informant could substitute for those of any other rater. Teacher ratings of externalizing problems were the best predictor of referral for mental health services.

AB Objective: To investigate predictors of adolescent outcome in a large sample of hyperactive children. Method: 123 hyperactive children were followed prospectively over an 8-year period. Multiple linear and logistical regression equations were used to relate childhood predictor variables to adolescent academic, psychiatric, social, and emotional adjustment. Results: Adolescent academic skills were related to childhood cognitive and academic competence while school conduct was predicted by other variables including early family stress. Duration of mental health treatment received often was negatively related to outcome, apparently serving as a marker variable for severity of disturbance in the child. Childhood impulsivity-hyperactivity and paternal antisocial acts were associated with later oppositional-defiant behaviors. Only child defiance and not hyperactivity predicted later arrests, however. Emotional problems in adolescence were predicted by more special education enrollment. Adolescent social competence was associated with parental personal competence, whereas maternal mental health status at outcome was related to variables unassociated with child adjustment. Conclusions: Various outcome domains had different sets of predictors; no single predictor cut across all domains. Although a limited amount of variance in outcome was explained, findings suggest that promoting family and parental competence as well as assessing and treating defiance and aggression very early may improve outcome.

AB We present a control theory analysis of adolescents' attachment strategies in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). In Study 1, Q-sort prototypes for secure/anxious and deactivating/hyperactivating strategies were used to differentiate between Main and Goldwyn's AAI classifications. In Study 2, we examined how AAI strategies were associated with emotion regulation during mother-teen problem solving. 4 aspects of mother-teen problem solving (dysfunctional anger, support/validation, avoidance of problem solving, and maternal dominance) were used to predict teens' AAI strategies. Teens with secure strategies engaged in problem-solving discussions characterized by less dysfunctional anger and less avoidance of problem solving. In addition, attachment security showed a curvilinear relation with maternal dominance, indicating that secure teens maintained balanced assertiveness with their mothers. Teens with deactivating strategies engaged in problem-solving interactions characterized by higher levels of maternal dominance and dysfunctional anger. The contribution of attachment strategies to teens' autonomy and to transformations in mother-teen relationships is discussed.

AB Twenty-six adolescents, aged 13-18 years, with severe congenital heart disease were matched for sex, age and living area with 26 adolescents with repaired atrial septal defect and regarded as physically fit. These two groups were compared according to somatic condition, psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and chronic family difficulties. A higher rate of psychiatric problems in the complex group, an association between psychosocial functioning and physical capacity, as well as an association between psychosocial functioning and chronic family difficulties were observed. These findings suggest that physical capacity is of crucial importance for mental health and functioning of adolescents with congenital heart disease. The association with chronic family difficulties also suggests that a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach is necessary in the treatment and rehabilitation of these patients.

DE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS; TREATMENT; MBD/DAMP/ADHD
AB This paper presents and discusses the most common emotional and social problems relating to minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) in childhood and adolescence, as well as traditional and new approaches to treatment. The emotional problems are described as either reactions to primary symptoms - that is, perceptual, cognitive, language, or motor dysfunctions causing obstacles and frustrations in learning and mastery of social, academic, and recreational activities - or reactions mainly caused by the interactive conflicts that may develop as a result of a combination of even slight developmental dysfunctions and lack of understanding and support by the social environment. Some of the most common emotional problems described are aggression, lack of self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and anti-social behaviour. The psychosocial development of these children will be influenced by the extent to which information and understanding are given by the social environment and access to professional treatment and support is given. The importance of early detection of dysfunctions and intervention is stressed, as is the need for development of a proper service for youth and adults with MBD problems. New methods in prevention and early treatment of psychosocial problems, with focus on early child-caregiver interactions, seem to be very promising and deserve further investigation in relation to children with MBD problems.

AB This article discusses key issues and assumptions which underlie the use of behavior rating scales for assessing children's emotional problems. Three arguments are advanced supporting the use of structured informant reports in social-emotional assessment: (a) informant reports initiate intervention efforts by mental health professionals in general; (b) reliable instruments reduce competing explanations for what is observed; and (c) differences across informants have implications for the design of treatment. Recent revisions to the Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher's Report Form, and Youth Self-Report are evaluated in light of the issues discussed.

AB An epidemiological sample of 936 Dutch children originally aged 4-11 years was assessed at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) on all four occasions. Stability coefficients computed for eight CBCL syndromes, Internalizing and Externalizing dimensions, and total problems revealed considerable long-term stability. There was no significant difference in the 6-year stability of internalizing vs. externalizing scores. This finding was at odds with reports of considerably lower stability of internalizing behavior, and was consistent with findings suggesting that the stability of internalizing problems should not be underestimated. The magnitude and specificity of the long-term stability of internalizing and externalizing scores lends support to the validity of these behavioral dimensions as tapped by the CBCL. No significant sex or age differences in the stability of problem behaviors were found.

TI PAROXYSMAL SNEEZING IN CHILDREN - 2 NEW CASES
SO JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Paroxysmal sneezing is an uncommon condition primarily affecting adolescents. Most of the reported cases were thought to be psychogenic, and only two were felt to be due to nasal sensitivity. This paper reports two adolescents with paroxysmal sneezing, neither of whom had apparent psychologic or emotional problems. In one child the sneezing continued during sleep. The other child was successfully treated with topical nasal anesthesia. Both children were felt to have nasal sensitivity as the etiology of their paroxysmal sneezing. The evaluation of the patient with paroxysmal sneezing requires a thorough history and physical examination. One must not assume that every case of paroxysmal sneezing is of psychogenic origin. Topical nasal anesthesia should be tried for control of intractable paroxysmal sneezing.

AB Prevalence and course of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence. Results of a prospective longitudinal epidemiological study from age 8 to 18. In a prospective longitudinal epidemiological study with assessments at age 8, 13 and 18 the prevalence rate for psychiatric disorders remained constant at about 16%. The sex ratio for severe disorders was male dominated even in adolescence, which was a consequence of the high rate of unsocialized disturbances of conduct in boys. Persistence of psychiatric disorders between age 13 and 18 was about 50%, as had previously been the case between age 8 and 13. One child in four suffered from a psychiatric disorder for at least 10 years. In childhood, conduct disorders had a very poor prognosis and emotional disorders a very good one. In adolescence, the course of disorders depended on an interaction between diagnosis and gender. Boys with unsocialized disturbances and girls with emotional problems had a poor prognosis.

AB There is an increase in suicidal behaviour in the western world providing a major challenge to health care providers. There is an increase in the number of suicides among elderly people in Europe. The problem of suicides among elderly people is in itself a social problem, not solely a medical one. The general practitioner may be the only source of social contact for the elderly. Elderly individuals often present their problems to doctors as somatic complaints, these complaints must not be taken at face value but understood as expressions of psychosocial and social distress. The rise in suicide rates among young people is also alarming. The warning signs of escalating distress in adolescents are known and a treatment programme coordinating medical initiatives, such that recidivism of suicidal behaviour in adolescents is reduced, is necessary. The general practitioner is urged to sense when the problem presented by the individual stems from a source which is predominantly social, and to suggest an appropriate solution which may entail a family intervention. The general practitioner is in the front line of treatment and he or she may be better advised to treat both the social situation and the individual person in cases of attempted suicide. Medical initiatives must incorporate aspects of social medicine whereby community solutions are found for the management of individual distress. Social disruption, isolation, conflict and neglect are the doors to the house of despair. While medicine must respond to those who enter that house, it is the social level at which we must be the architects of change. People will die. It is what we contribute to the quality of their living which is of importance.

AB Patterns in mother-child interaction from infancy to age 12 were investigated in a prospective, longitudinal study of 44 English-speaking mothers and their preterm children. Maternal responsiveness was assessed by home observations during infancy and the Family Interaction Q-Sort at age 12, derived from 2 structured laboratory situations requiring cooperation of mother and child. A cluster of maternal behaviors of critical control toward the toddler was assessed at age 2 years. Children of mothers who were consistently more responsive during both infancy and early adolescence, as well as children whose mothers became more responsive by age 12, achieved higher IQ and arithmetic scores, had more positive self-esteem, and their teachers reported fewer behavioral and emotional problems than children of mothers who were consistently less responsive both during infancy and at age 12. Continuity in parenting behaviors was related to control and criticism beginning in the toddler period and not to degree of responsiveness to the infant.

AB Quantitative and categorical indices of psychopathology are reported for a nationally representative longitudinal sample assessed via eight empirically derived cross-informant syndromes, internalizing, externalizing, and total problems. Results showed medium to large stabilities for parents' ratings during a 3-year interval on all comparable scales.  Predictive correlations between time 1 parents' ratings and time 2 teacher and self-ratings were weaker than parent-to-parent correlations. Classification of children as deviant showed weaker predictive relations than did quantitative scores. Odds ratios showed that children classified as deviant by parents' time 1 ratings were much more likely to be deviant at time 2 on corresponding parent, teacher, and self-ratings than were children initially classified as nondeviant.

AB According to a previous study, 8% of all children in Dalby primary care district were chronically ill. he impact of the illness on the children's well-being was investigated using parental questionnaires. No difference in socio-demographic variables was found between responders (70%) and non-responders. The study comprised 98 index and 168 control children. Comfort and well-being in school and pre-school were lower among the index than among the control children and lower among the index children in normal compared with special schools. According to the parents many teachers had insufficient knowledge of disorders/handicaps. Children with a physical disability more often had special remedial education compared with healthy children. The chronically ill children were bullied more often, had fewer contacts with peers and more emotional problems than the control group. Improved knowledge of chronic childhood disorders/disabilities and recognition of the psychosocial consequences at school/pre-school and in the child health services is advocated.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives. Antisocial and criminal behavior are increasing among US youth, especially among females. Thus, questions arise concerning whether youthful female deviant behavior eventually will have negative behavioral and emotional consequences for the later children of these women.
   Methods. Associations between the severity of early female antisocial behavior (including both drug-related and non-drug-related offenses) and the later behavioral and emotional health of the children of these women were examined among 1425 mother-child pairs of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
   Results. Multiple linear regression procedures indicated a significant positive relationship between the severity of the mothers' early non-drug-related offenses and the later severity of the children's scores on the Antisocial, Hyperactive, Anxious/Depressed, Headstrong, Peer Conflict/Social Withdrawal, Immature Dependency, and Total Problem subscales of the Behavior Problem Index.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated an association between the antisocial behavior of female youth and the later behavioral and emotional problems of the children of these women. Future research needs to determine the mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of these types of problems so that effective preventive and therapeutic public health practices may be designed and implemented.

AB Children with chronic physical handicaps have been found to be at risk for psychological and social adjustment problems.  Accurately identifying in a timely manner those physically handicapped children who are functioning at clinically significant levels of maladjustment may aid in preventing further psychosocial morbidity.  The parents of 111 children and adolescents with congenital/acquired limb deficiencies completed the Child Behavior Checklist as a screening instrument to facilitate the identification of behavioral and emotional problems and social incompetence.  Based on normalized T scores, the children manifested significantly greater behavioral and emotional problems and lower social competence than the normative community sample.  Twenty-three percent of the children were reported to function in the clinically significant maladjustment range for behavioral and emotional problems; 14% were reported in the social maladjustment range.  Correlations between parent report and child, adolescent, and teacher reports of adjustment ranged from r values of .23 to .41.  The findings are discussed in terms of the "new hidden morbidity" in pediatric practice.

AB Neuropsychological and socio-emotional factors associated with specific-arithmetic disability were investigated in an unselected sample of New Zealand children. Subjects were 17 specific-arithmetic disabled, 27 specific-reading disabled, 63 generally disabled, and 50 nondisabled 13 year olds. Evidence was sought for an association between specific-arithmetic disability and the neuropsychological and socio-emotional correlates of Nonverbal Learning Disability syndrome (NLD). NLD is characterized by a pattern of nonverbal and verbal neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses, and appears to place individuals at greater risk for internalizing psychopathology, than other learning disabilities. Only specific-arithmetic disabled subjects were found to show a neuropsychological profile reminiscent of NLD. Evidence of poor socio-emotional adjustment was found across all three learning-disabled groups, and was greatest among generally disabled subjects. We found that the specific-arithmetic-disabled subjects exhibited the greatest degree of overlap between internalizing psychopathology and a NLD neuropsychological profile. The results are interpreted as providing some support for the idea that specific-arithmetic-disabled individuals may be at greater risk for the NLD syndrome than either generally disabled or specific-reading-disabled individuals.

AB School results and socio-emotional adjustment were followed in 1 236 second generation immigrants and 13 881 Swedish boys and girls. All belonged to the Metropolitan Project, a longitudinal study of a Stockholm cohort born 1953. Intellectual capacity was measured by marks in grade 6 and 9 and by intelligence tests of the spatial, logical and verbal factor. Social adjustment was assessed by sociometric tests and delinquency according to official records. As regards school results, no differences in performance were obtained between the Swedish and immigrant group. The main differences between the groups were on the socio-emotional level. Generally, immigrants were more isolated and showed a higher rate of delinquency. Both groups showed a regular pattern between popularity and crime: The greater the popularity the lower the crime rate. Best predictors of future crime were sociometric questions about situations demanding personal involvement.  The importance of social interaction between groups was stressed due to its beneficial effects on verbal ability and various prejudices.

AB Current neofunctionalist views of emotion underscore the biologically adaptive and psychologically constructive contributions of emotion to organized behavior, but little is known of the development of the emotional regulatory processes by which this is fostered. Emotional regulation refers to the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions. This review provides a developmental outline of emotional regulation and its relation to emotional development throughout the life-span. The biological foundations of emotional self-regulation and individual differences in regulatory tendencies are summarized. Extrinsic influences on the early regulation of a child's emotion and their long-term significance are then discussed, including a parent's direct intervention strategies, selective reinforcement and modeling processes, affective induction, and the caregiver's ecological control of opportunity for heightened emotion and its management. Intrinsic contributors to the growth of emotional self-regulatory capacities include the emergence of language and cognitive skills, the child's growing emotional and self-understanding (and cognized strategies of emotional self-control), and the emergence of a "theory of personal emotion" in adolescence.

AB Adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were compared with a control group on a comprehensive assessment battery.  More ADHD teenagers had oppositional defiant disorder (68%) and conduct disorder (39%) and were rated as more impaired in social competence, behavioral and emotional adjustment, and school performance by parents and teachers than control teens.  The ADHD youths, however, rated themselves as better adjusted than did their parents and teachers, differing only from controls in depressive symptoms and antisocial acts.  Poorer performances in verbal learning and vigilance and greater ADHD behaviors during a math task also distinguished the ADHD from control teenagers.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between information on children's problem behavior obtained by different methods (rating scales and clinical interviews) and from different sources (adolescent, parents and teacher). From a sample of 132 14-year-old international adoptees and their parents, information was obtained via the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Youth Self-Report and the Teacher's Report Form, the Child Assessment Schedule, and the Graham and Rutter Parent Interview. Agreement between the CBCL and the clinical judgment of the severity of psychopathology was substantial. Assessment procedures providing data on the adolescents' functioning derived from different sources revealed less agreement than those derived from the same informant. Agreement was higher for externalizing than for internalizing behaviors. Data from different sources made unique contributions to clinicians' judgments of the severity of psychopathology.

AB Follow-up studies of children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder show that they continue to have problems with restlessness, over-activity, impulsive behaviour and inattention, often resulting in serious academic, social and emotional problems in adolescence.  Outcome in adulthood generally falls into three groups:  fairly normal outcome, persistent attentional, social, emotional and impulse problems, and serious psychiatric and/or social pathology.  Factors affecting outcome include characteristics related to the child (for example, health, temperament, IQ) and characteristics of the family (for example, socioeconomic status, emtional and psychological aspects of the family, family composition and structure, and the larger social and physical environment.

AB The focus of this investigation was to 1) identify those adolescents experiencing distress; 2) examine the formal and informal helping agents that adolescents seek out for help for emotional problems; and 3) describe adolescents' perceptions of the helpfulness of selected helping agents.  Adolescents (N = 497) from three high schools in a large metropolitan area in the Midwest, representing a broad socioeconomic spectrum, were administered instruments related to self-image, delinquency, symptomatology, and help seeking.  The prevalence rate of disturbance was 22.3%.  Results show that disturbed adolescents sought help from alcohol/drug abuse centers, teenage drop-in centers, and mental health professionals more frequently than nondisturbed adolescents.  In additional, both groups frequently sought help from parents and friends and perceived this help as beneficial.  Implications of these findings for the development of adolescent mental health services are discussed.

AB A retrospective cross sectional study of the prevalence of emotional problems among 502 learning disabled children seen in a specialized learning centre was conducted. Learning disabled children, diagnosed by an experienced clinician, were tested for emotional disturbances using the Child Behavior Checklist. The prevalence of behaviour problems among these children was 43%. This was much higher than the ten percent expected when this measure is used in a general population. There was no greater frequency of behaviour problems in children by teachers than in those referred by parents. Results of logistic regression analyses reveal that children who were adolescents, from non intact families, or from lower social class backgrounds had an increased odds of having behaviour problems. The implications of these findings are examined, especially in light of possible methodological problems including selection bias, which may account for the association between emotional problems and learning disabilities found in other studies.

TI CHANGES IN PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT AFTER RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION
SO ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
LA English
DT Article
ID KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION; CHILDREN; FAILURE; HEMODIALYSIS; FAMILIES
AB The psychological aspects of transplantation were studied in 29 children and adolescents with functioning renal transplants.  Most parents rated their child's physical health as considerably improved after transplantation.  They also noted improvements in the child's behaviour and in the quality of family life.  When compared with a sample of children being treated by hospital haemodialysis, children who had received transplants had more favourable parental views of behavioural and emotional adjustment, better parental psychiatric adjustment, and indications of superior child rated mood, self concept, and social functioning.  Children who had received transplants did, however, show an increase in minor behavioural symptoms compared with healthy controls, and most parents required continuing psychological and social support as well as attention to physical aspects of the child's condition.
   Kidney transplantation is associated with improved psychosocial behaviour in children, but there is a continuing need for support for parents in dealing with minor psychological problems after the transplant.

AB A 14-year-old boy presented with severe academic difficulties, emotional disturbance, borderline mental retardation, tall stature, delayed sexual development, small testes, and gynecomastia.  Chromosomal analysis revealed an additional X chromosome compatible with the diagnosis of 47, XXY Klinefelter Syndrome.  This case retrospectively follows the progression of learning and behavioral problems occurring in the primary grades prior to the diagnosis of Klinefelter Syndrome and reports the effects of psychiatric treatment, modified educational placement, testosterone supplementation, and corrective surgery in adolescence.  The early identification of Klinefelter Syndrome is vital to the XXY male in that many of the developmental, behavioral and emotional problems associated with an additional X chromosome are amenable to treatment.

AB Psychiatric symptomatology was compared in 61 cystic fibrosis patients, ages 8 to 15 years, and 36 cystic fibrosis patients, ages 16 to 40 years.  When the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology was compared in the two groups, a developmental pattern emerged:  Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more frequent in the older group, while symptoms associated with eating disorders were more frequent in the younger group.  Although duration of illness was longer and severity of illness was greater in the older group, these factors were largely unrelated to psychiatric symptomatology in either group.  It is hypothesized that younger patients may express psychological distress through less direct means than older patients.

SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Students with severe emotional disturbance (SED) present one of the most challenging populations for school psychologists. To provide effective service delivery to this population, school psychologists need to be expert in effective interventions for children with SED. In addition, the types of challenging behaviors presented by students with SED are equally problematic for teachers when they occur in regular classrooms among students without SED. Unfortunately, many school psychologists enter the profession with only limited hands-on or actual teaching experience with this population leading to potential credibility problems as teacher consultants. Likewise, school psychologists often spend much time in their training program emphasizing assessment over the delivery of direct interventions for academic and social/emotional problems of children and youth, The purpose of the described project is to train school psychology students at the preservice level in intervention techniques especially applicable to children and youth with SED.
