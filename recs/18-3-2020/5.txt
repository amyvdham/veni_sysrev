AB Cyber victimization is a contemporary problem facing youth and adolescents (Diamanduros, Downs, & Jenkins, 2008; Kowalski & Limber, 2007). It is imperative for researchers and school personnel to understand the associations between cyber victimization and student social-emotional outcomes. This article explores (a) gender differences in rates of cyber victimization, (b) overlap between traditional and cyber victimization, (c) differences in social-emotional outcomes across victimization classes, and (d) associations among cyber victimization and social-emotional risk, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems while controlling for traditional victimization among 1,152 high school students. Boys reported significantly higher rates of cyber victimization than did girls. Ten percent of students reported experiencing low levels of both cyber and traditional victimization (low dual), 3% of students reported experiencing moderate levels of both cyber and traditional victimization (moderate dual), and 1% of students reported high levels of both types of victimization (high dual). Three percent of students reported experiencing traditional victimization but not cyber victimization (traditional). There were significant differences in social and emotional problems among youth involved in victimization in various groups (i.e., uninvolved, traditional, low dual, moderate dual, and high dual). Lastly, cyber victimization significantly predicted variance in social-emotional risk and internalizing problems above and beyond that predicted by traditional victimization.

AB Growing up in a White family does not necessarily protect internationally adopted Korean Americans raised in White families from the pernicious effects of discrimination. Emotion regulation strategies may buffer the effects of discrimination on psychological adjustment, yet little research has been conducted on these links. To fill this gap, we examined the relationship between emotion regulation, discrimination and psychological adjustment in a sample of adopted Korean American adolescents (N = 115). Using both parent and adopted child reports across 2 waves of data (7 years apart), we addressed 2 questions. First, what are the different emotion regulation profiles and how do they correspond to psychological adjustment? Second, controlling for adjustment in childhood, do these emotion regulation profiles moderate the association between discrimination and psychological adjustment? We found 3 distinct profiles using cluster analysis: high reappraisal/low suppression (HR/LS), high reappraisal/moderate suppression (HR/MS), and moderate reappraisal/moderate suppression (MR/MS). The HR/LS profile showed the best adjustment, whereas the MR/MS profile reported the most adjustment problems. However, emotion regulation profiles did not moderate the association between perceived discrimination and psychological adjustment.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study was to summarize current scientific knowledge relating to the occurrence of mood disorders among children with visual impairments. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of articles published between January1998 and July 2016, inclusive. A total of 17 publications met the inclusion criteria, of which 15 reported studies with a cross-sectional design. The 17 publications represent 13 countries. Results: The majority of the studies suggested that children and young adults with visual impairments had more emotional problems than did their sighted peers. In addition, girls with visual impairments more often experienced serious symptoms of depression and anxiety than did boys with visual impairments, a finding that was in line with results for the general population. Two studies with a longitudinal design suggested that emotional problems among children and young adults with visual impairments might lessen over time. Discussion: Due to the different research purposes, study designs, definitions of visual impairment, participants' age ranges, cultures, countries, small sample sizes, measurements, and analyses of mental health, the overall results of the reviewed studies were inconsistent. To give children the best opportunities for good mental health, there is a need for more knowledge and for further longitudinal and randomized studies of high quality. Implications for practitioners: Social support, friendship, and independence in mobility seem to be important for enhancing the mental health of all children. Children with earlier onset and more severe visual impairments may be less likely to experience a reduction in their mental health problems over time.

AB Youth with an extra X chromosome (47, XXY & 47, XXX) display higher levels of schizotypal symptoms and social anxiety as compared to typically developing youth. It is likely that the extra X chromosome group is at-risk for clinical levels of schizotypy and social anxiety. Hence, this study investigated how schizotypal and social anxiety symptoms are related and mechanisms that may explain their association in a group of 38 children and adolescents with an extra X chromosome and a comparison group of 109 typically developing peers (8-19 years). Three cognitive coping strategies were investigated as potential mediators, rumination, catastrophizing, and other-blame. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between schizotypal symptoms and social anxiety was mediated by catastrophizing coping in the extra X chromosome group but not in the comparison group. The results suggest that youth with an extra X chromosome with schizotypal symptoms could benefit from an intervention to weaken the tendency to catastrophize life events as a way of reducing the likelihood of social anxiety symptoms.

AB This work aims to analyze the impact of childhood and adolescent sexual abuse on variables related to mental health and to identify the characteristics of the victims. To achieve this objective, microdata of the National School Health Survey 2015 was used, applying the methodology of Propensity Score Matching. The results show that the abused youth has a unique behavioral, familiar and socioeconomic profile and that they are more likely to use alcohol and drugs, be victim of bullying, to be in age-grade lag, to be employed and not to intend to continue studying. From a familiar point of view, they have low parental monitoring and lower probability of living with their mother. Estimates show that teenage sexual abuse can increase the youth's chance of reporting a constant feeling of loneliness by 13.3 percent, a 7.5 percent higher chance of having few or none friends, and a 9.5 percent higher chance of reporting frequent insomnia. Significant differences in effects on men and women were also observed, with impacts on loneliness feelings and insomnia greater for the first group and greater on the number of friends for the second.

AB Empathy plays a key role in maintaining close relationships and promoting prosocial conflict resolution. However, research has not addressed the potential emotional cost of adolescents' high empathy, particularly when relationships are characterized by more frequent conflict. The present 6-year longitudinal study (N = 467) investigated whether conflict with parents predicted emotion dysregulation more strongly for high-empathy adolescents than for lower-empathy adolescents. Emotion dysregulation was operationalized at both the experiential level, using mood diary data collected for 3 weeks each year, and at the dispositional level, using annual self-report measures. In line with predictions, we found that more frequent adolescent-parent conflict predicted greater day-to-day mood variability and dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation for high-empathy adolescents, but not for average-and low-empathy adolescents. Mood variability and difficulties in emotion regulation, in turn, also predicted increased conflict with parents. These links were not moderated by empathy. Moreover, our research allowed for a novel investigation of the interplay between experiential and dispositional emotion dysregulation. Day-to-day mood variability predicted increasing dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation over time, which suggests that experiential dysregulation becomes consolidated into dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that, for high-empathy adolescents, conflict was a driver of this dysregulation consolidation process. Finally, emotion dysregulation played a role in overtime conflict maintenance for high-empathy adolescents. This suggests that, through emotion dysregulation, high empathy may paradoxically also contribute to maintaining negative adolescent-parent interactions. Our research indicates that high empathy comes at a cost when adolescent-parent relationships are characterized by greater negativity.

AB In previous studies, older as compared with younger individuals were more strongly motivated to regulate their momentary affect toward pleasant and calm states. Whether these motivational differences are also reflected in regulatory behavior and whether this behavior is efficient in terms of affect change, however, is unclear. To address these issues, we conducted 3 studies with samples ranging in age from adolescence to old adulthood. In Study 1, we developed a novel and age-fair music browsing paradigm for music of diverse musical styles, dates of origin, and affective characteristics. The time spent listening to self-selected music with varying levels of valence and arousal served as an indicator of affect-regulatory preferences in 2 different affectively relevant situations, namely after mood induction in Study 2 and before an upcoming discussion with a stranger in Study 3. As predicted, we found a higher preference for music with positive valence and low arousal in older as compared with younger individuals in both studies. Additionally, the efficacy of music listening as an affect-regulatory strategy was supported because individuals' current affect significantly changed from before to after music listening (Studies 2 and 3), whereas that was not the case in an active control group listening to neutral nonmusical sounds (Study 3). These results extend previous research on affect regulation by demonstrating the utility of the music browsing paradigm as a behavioral indicator of affect-regulatory preferences in individuals from various age groups. They also provide evidence for age differences in, and affect-regulatory effects of, music-choice behavior.

AB Unwarranted friendship jealousy can create friendship and broader peer difficulties for adolescents. This study expands earlier research-on the role of self-esteem in friendship jealousy by considering emotion regulation skill and parental use of psychological control as intersecting factors. 72 young adolescents completed questionnaires on themselves, their friendships, and their family experiences. As predicted, poor self-esteem related to friendship jealousy but only when adolescents were poorly-equipped to deal with strong emotions. Adolescents from homes with psychologically-controlling mothers were also prone to jealousy, evidently because psychological control and broader warmth in the relationship compromised offspring's self-esteem. One consequence of psychological control for offspring may be friendship difficulties related to insecurity over a partner's commitment and exaggeration of the risk posed by rivals.

AB Imaging connectomics based on graph theory has become an effective and unique methodological framework for studying functional connectivity patterns of the developing and aging brain. Normal brain development is characterized by continuous and significant network evolution through infancy, childhood, and adolescence, following specific maturational patterns. Normal aging is related to some resting state brain networks disruption, which are associated with certain cognitive decline. It is a big challenge to design an integral metric to track connectome evolution patterns across the lifespan, which is to understand the principles of network organization in the human brain. In this study, we first defined a brain network eigen-entropy (NEE) based on the energy probability (EP) of each brain node. Next, we used the NEE to characterize the lifespan orderness trajectory of the whole-brain functional connectivity of 173 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. The results revealed that during the lifespan, the whole-brain NEE exhibited a significant non-linear decrease and that the EP distribution shifted from concentration to wide dispersion, implying orderness enhancement of functional connectome over age. Furthermore, brain regions with significant EP changes from the flourishing (7-20 years) to the youth period (23-38 years) were mainly located in the right prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, and were involved in emotion regulation and executive function in coordination with the action of the sensory system, implying that self-awareness and voluntary control performance significantly changed during neurodevelopment. However, the changes from the youth period to middle age (40-59 years) were located in the mesial temporal lobe and caudate, which are associated with long-term memory, implying that the memory of the human brain begins to decline with age during this period. Overall, the findings suggested that the human connectome shifted from a relatively anatomical driven state to an orderly organized state with lower entropy.

AB Children in all cultures readily engage in artistic activities, yet the arts (dance, drama, drawing, and music) have traditionally been marginal topics in the discipline of developmental science. We argue that developmental psychologists cannot afford to ignore such naturalistic activities that involve so many basic phenomenaattention, engagement, motivation, emotion regulation, understanding of others, and so on. Despite historical issues with research methodologies and overdrawn conclusions, a current wave of methodologically rigorous studies shows the depth of arts learning, as well as how arts engagement can be harnessed for transfer to other skills. Here, we present 21 exemplary research case studies, covering an age range of 18months to 17years old and discuss how the arts are no more difficult to study than other real-world developmental phenomena and deserve a thorough examination.

AB Background: Geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) combines ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with global positioning systems (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS). This study evaluates the spatial accuracy of GEMA location data and bias due to subject and environmental data characteristics.
   Methods: Using data for 72 subjects enrolled in a study of urban adolescent substance use, we compared the GPS-based location of EMA responses in which the subject indicated they were at home to the geocoded home address. We calculated the percentage of EMA locations within a sixteenth, eighth, quarter, and half miles from the home, and the percentage within the same tract and block group as the home. We investigated if the accuracy measures were associated with subject demographics, substance use, and emotional dysregulation, as well as environmental characteristics of the home neighborhood.
   Results: Half of all subjects had more than 88% of their EMA locations within a half mile, 72% within a quarter mile, 55% within an eighth mile, 50% within a sixteenth of a mile, 83% in the correct tract, and 71% in the correct block group. There were no significant associations with subject or environmental characteristics.
   Conclusions: Results support the use of GEMA for analyzing subjects' exposures to urban environments. Researchers should be aware of the issue of spatial accuracy inherent in GEMA, and interpret results accordingly. Understanding spatial accuracy is particularly relevant for the development of 'ecological momentary interventions' (EMI), which may depend on accurate location information, though issues of privacy protection remain a concern.

AB Purpose Previous research on time trends of young people's mental health in Britain has produced conflicting findings: evidence for deterioration in mental health during the late 20th century followed by stability and slight improvement during the early 21st century is contrasted with evidence showing continued deterioration. The present study adds to the evidence base by assessing time trends in means, variances, and both low and high psychological distress scores covering a similar period.
   Methods GHQ-12 (Likert scale) was regressed on time (adjusting for age) using a sample of young people aged 16-24 between 1991 and 2008 from the British Household Panel Study. Change in variance was assessed using Levene's homogeneity of variance test across 9-year intervals. Polarisation was assessed by a comparison of the prevalence of scores >= 1 standard deviation and >= 1.5 standard deviations above and below the pooled mean.
   Results There was a small but significant increase in mean GHQ-12 among young women (b 0.048; 95% CI 0.016, 0.080) only. Variance increased significantly (p < 0.05) across 9-year intervals in seven out of nine comparisons for women and in six out of nine comparisons for men. There were significant increases in low (OR: 1.19; 95% CI 1.05, 1.35), high (OR: 1.27; 95% CI 1.13, 1.42), and very high scores (OR: 1.42; 95% CI 1.23, 1.64) for young women, and increases in low (OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.21, 1.59) and very low (OR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.21, 1.92) scores for young men.
   Conclusions The evidence suggests a polarisation of the psychological distress of young women in Britain between 1991 and 2008.

AB Adolescence is hypothesized to be a critical period for the maturation of self-regulatory capacities, including those that depend on interoceptive sensitivity, but the neural basis of interoceptive regulation in adolescence is unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology to study interoceptive regulation in healthy adolescent females. Participants regulated their gut activities in response to a virtual roller coaster by deep breathing aided by visually monitoring their online electrogastrogram (EGG) activity through a virtual thermometer (i.e. gut biofeedback), or without biofeedback. Analyses focused on the insula, given its putative role in interoception. The bilateral posterior insula showed increased activation in the nobiofeedback compared to biofeedback condition, suggesting that the participants relied more on interoceptive input when exteroceptive feedback was unavailable. The bilateral dorsal anterior insula showed activation linearly associated with age during both induction and regulation, and its activation during regulation correlated positively with change of EGG in the tachygastria frequency band from induction to regulation. Induction-related activation in the bilateral ventral anterior insula was nonlinearly associated with age and peaked at mid-adolescence. These results implicate different developmental trajectories of distinct sub-regions of the insula in interoceptive processes, with implications for competing neurobiological theories of female adolescent development.

AB The WHO Child and Adolescent Mental Health Atlas, published in 2005, reported that child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Europe differed substantially in their architecture and functioning. We assessed the characteristics of national CAMHS across the European Union (EU), including legal aspects of adolescent care. Using an online mapping survey aimed at expert(s) in each country, we obtained data for all 28 countries in the EU. The characteristics and activities of CAMHS (ie, availability of services, inpatient beds, and clinicians and organisations, and delivery of specific CAMHS services and treatments) varied considerably between countries, as did funding sources and user access. Neurodevelopmental disorders were the most frequent diagnostic group (up to 81%) for people seen at CAMHS (data available from only 13 [46%] countries). 20 (70%) countries reported having an official national child and adolescent mental health policy, covering young people until their official age of transition to adulthood. The heterogeneity in resource allocation did not seem to match epidemiological burden. Substantial improvements in the planning, monitoring, and delivery of mental health services for children and adolescents are needed.

AB Although bullying victimization has been linked to a number of behavioral and emotional problems among adolescents, few studies have investigate the mechanism through which bullying victimization affect non-suicidal self-injury. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of bullying victimization on non-suicidal self-injury and the mediating effect of depressive symptoms on the relationship between bullying victimization and non-suicidal self-injury among adolescents. Data for this study came from the interRAl Child and Youth Mental Health dataset. A total of 1650 adolescents aged 12-18 years (M = 14.56; SD = 1.79; 54.2% males) were analyzed. Binary logistic and Poisson regression models were conducted to identify the mediating effect of depressive symptoms on the relationship between bullying victimization and non-suicidal self-injury. Of the 1650 adolescents studied, 611 representing 37% engaged in non-suicidal self-injury and 26.7% were victims of bullying. The effect of bullying victimization on non-suicidal self-injury was partially mediated by depressive symptoms after adjusting for the effect of demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, social support, and mental health diagnoses. The contribution of bullying victimization and depression to non-suicidal self injury adds to the case for the development of trauma-focused interventions in reducing the risk of non-suicidal self-injury among adolescents.

AB This study examined a university-community partnership, focusing on mental health promotion within an after-school music program. We pursued two goals: (a) supporting staff around student engagement and behavior management; (b) integrating social-emotional activities into the curriculum. We assessed youth's mental health needs and examined feasibility of social-emotional activities delivered. One-hundred sixty-two youth participated in activities, while a subset of youth (n = 61) and their parents provided information on mental health need. Rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were high, and youth reported high satisfaction with the activities. Results suggest promise of this model for mental health promotion for urban youth.

AB Children vary in their sensitivity to parenting practices, which may influence their competence and development of psychological symptoms. Three theoretical frameworks that address youth's sensitivity to parenting and potential outcomes include the diathesis stress model, differential susceptibility hypothesis, and the vantage sensitivity hypothesis. The purpose of the present review is to examine the relations among child genetic, endophenotypic, and phenotypic attributes with parenting, and links to social and emotional adjustment and symptoms from infancy to young adulthood (18 years of age) that support the diathesis-stress model, differential susceptibility hypothesis, or vantage sensitivity hypothesis. We also examined whether (a) the assessment method (e.g., questionnaires, observations) and (b) developmental period (e.g., early childhood, adolescence) during which variables were assessed influenced support for the theoretical perspectives considered. Support was found for each framework but differed across studies. This inconsistent support may be because some child-specific features act as vulnerabilities, whereas others operate as plasticity factors; the parenting dimension under consideration may influence the adjustment of youth differently; or sex differences in child-specific features may differentially predict youth social and emotional competence or symptom development. Other potential explanations involve issues related to informants and contextual variations in children's behaviors, different analytic approaches, the assessment method, and developmental period of assessment.

AB Although it is well documented that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with reduced life satisfaction, the mechanisms that might explain this co-occurrence are unclear. We examined the correlation of ADHD symptoms with life satisfaction and whether this association is mediated by (lacking) social support and depressive symptoms. Self-reported ADHD symptoms, life satisfaction, social support, and depressive symptoms were assessed in a representative, predominantly adult sample from the general population (14-91 years, N = 2517). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms correlated negatively with life satisfaction (r = -0.41, p < 0.01), even after demographic factors (gender, age, income) and common risk factors (not being in a relationship, being unemployed) were controlled for (r = -0.39, p< 0.01). Social support mediated up to 23% and depressive symptoms up to 44% in the association between ADHD symptoms and life satisfaction. Counteracting problems with social relationships and treating depressive symptoms may help to increase life satisfaction in adults with ADHD symptoms.

AB In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.

AB This report details an 18-month longitudinal study designed to investigate the influence of autistic traits' on internet gaming addiction (IGA) in children. A total of 420 Chinese children (220 boys, Mean age = 9.74 +/- 0.45) participated in the research. Autistic traits were measured in the 4th grade and emotion regulation, school connectedness and IGA measured in both the 4th and 5th grades. After controlling for age, sex, and sensation seeking, results showed that autistic traits were related to decreased emotion regulation, which in turn was related to lower school connectedness, which was related to increased IGA. The results suggest that improving emotion regulation and school connectedness could reduce the risk of IGA. As a result, these findings may inform intervention and prevention programs targeting children with IGA, especially among those with high levels of autistic traits.

AB The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has meant a radical change in a variety of disciplines, including Clinical and Health Psychology. During childhood and adolescence, interaction with the ICTs is common and regular, and it is also facilitated because they are digital natives who are naturally identified with the technological advances. The last decade has seen a clear revolution regarding the use of different technologies for the application of psychological treatments and the promotion of health, so as to facilitate and improve the learning of a variety of emotional competences and healthy behaviors in those populations that are in a continuous process of development and change. Cognitive-behavioral orientation and evidence-based psychological treatments have been successfully transferred to the ICTs and there are many studies that support this. The present article addresses a review of the main ICT-based devices for the treatment of different psychological disorders during childhood and adolescence, as well as in other important areas of health at these ages. The implications that these devices may have are being analyzed, as well as the possible potential challenges to optimize these resources. For these reasons new research lines relevant to this topic are to be opened and explored.

AB Introduction. Non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSI) are a worldwide health problem that affects principally young people, and can impact negatively the mental and physical health of those that self-injure. Objective. To examine the frequency of NSSI in 564 undergraduate students (132 male, 432 female) from Mexico City and the association of NSSI with depressive symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, self-efficacy, and emotion regulation. Method. A convenience sample of 564 undergraduate students (aged 17-26 years) from eight universities in the Mexico City metropolitan area completed a survey in their classrooms. Results. Of the total sample, 30.9% had experimented at some point in their lifetime with NSSI on one to four occasions, while 26.9% had recurrent NSSI (i.e., five or more occasions). Nearly eleven percent self-injured in the prior 12 months. The NSSI most often reported among those who self-injured was cutting oneself (48.0%). Recurrent self-injurers reported higher levels of depression and impulsivity, and less self-efficacy than those who had experimented with such behaviors or without any lifetime NSSI. While 54.4% perceived the need for professional help, only 18.1% sought professional services. Discussion and conclusion. NSSI is a hidden problem in the college population in Mexico City which needs to be addressed by university administrators and mental health professionals. Depressive symptomatology, impulsivity, and self-efficacy are factors that should be considered when developing preventive intervention strategies.

AB Background: Many youth experience persistent irritability and recurrent temper outbursts, conceptualized by DSM-5 as Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). Sleep deprivation impairs emotion regulation which could increase rates of DMDD symptoms, especially in those with preexisting regulatory impairments, as seen with ADHD. However, there has been little examination of the relationship between chronic sleep problems and DMDD symptoms.
   Methods: Associations between DMDD symptoms and sleep parameters in children were assessed using parent-report and objective measures of sleep in a general population sample (N = 665) and an ADHD sample (N = 784). Irritability, temper outbursts, sleep problems and other psychological problems were assessed with the Pediatric Behavior Scale. The general population study also completed overnight polysomnography (PSG).
   Results: DMDD symptoms were reported in 9.2% of the community sample and 31.4% of the ADHD sample. In both samples, children with DMDD symptoms had significantly higher parent-reported sleep problems than children without DMDD symptoms. Children with sleep problems had significantly higher DMDD scores than children without sleep problems. However, DMDD symptoms were most strongly associated with oppositional behavior. Sleep problems were not a significant contributor. Hyperactivity-impulsivity was most strongly associated with sleep problems, and DMDD was not a significant contributor. Children with and without DMDD symptoms did not differ significantly on any PSG parameter.
   Conclusions: Associations between parent-reported sleep problems and DMDD symptoms were due to their shared relationship with other behavioral problems. Therefore, chronic sleep problems do not appear to be a primary source of DMDD symptoms in children with or without ADHD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aggression jeopardizes positive development in children and predicts social and academic maladjustment in school. The present study determined the relationships among anger dysregulation (a marker of emotion regulation), cortisol activity (a biomarker of stress), and peer-nominated aggression in typically developing children in their everyday classroom setting (N=151, Mean age=10.86, SD=.74). Salivary cortisol was collected at 09:15, 11:45, and 14:45hr across 4 consecutive days. Children provided self-reports of anger regulation; peers reported proactive and reactive aggressive behaviors. Hierarchical linear regression analyses, followed by a bootstrapping analysis identified basal afternoon cortisol as a significant mediator between anger regulation and peer-reported aggression. More dysregulated anger significantly predicted lower afternoon cortisol, which in turn predicted increased peer-reported aggression. These results align with previous research on links among hypocortisolism, emotional regulation, and behavior, and suggest a possible meditational pathway between emotion and behavior regulation via decreased afternoon cortisol levels.

AB Purpose Gender dysphoria (GD) is associated with clinically significant distress and impairment in social, scholastic, and other important areas of functioning, especially when early onset is reported. The aim of the present study is to assess the psychopathological features associated with GD in adolescence, comparing a group of gender dysphoric adolescents (GDs) with a group of non-referred adolescents (NRs), in terms of body uneasiness, suicide risk, psychological functioning, and intensity of GD.
   Methods A sample of 46 adolescents with GD and 46 age-matched NRs was evaluated (mean +/- SD age = 16.00 +/- 1.49 and 16.59 +/- 1.11 respectively, p > 0.05). Subjects were asked to complete the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) to explore body uneasiness, the Youth Self Report (YSR) to measure psychological functioning, the Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale (MAST) for suicide risk, and the Gender Identity/Gender Dysphoria Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults (GIDYQ-AA) for GD assessment.
   Results Adolescents with GD reported significantly higher levels of body uneasiness (BUT-GSI, F = 380.13, p < 0.0001), as well as a worse psychological functioning (YSR, F = 13.06 and p < 0.0001 for "total problem scale" and F = 12.53, p = 0.001 for "internalizing" scale) as compared to NRs. When YSR subscales were considered, GDs showed significantly higher scores in the "withdrawal/depression", "anxiety/depression", and "social problems" (all p < 0.0001). In addition, GDs showed significantly higher levels in the "attraction to death" and "repulsion by life" scales and lower scores in the "attraction to life" scale (all p < 0.0001). Finally, GIDYQ-AA score was significantly lower (meaning a higher level of gender dysphoria symptoms) in GDs vs. NRs (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions GD adolescents reported significantly higher body dissatisfaction and suicidal risk compared to NRs. In addition, results confirmed a significant impairment in social psychological functioning in adolescents with GD.

AB This study examined the impact of autonomic self-regulation, affective experience, and effortful control on externalizing behavior in preadolescents (n = 360) deemed at-risk for aggression. Autonomic self-regulation was assessed using measurements of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and skin conductance levels as markers for parasympathetic and sympathetic functioning. Affective experience and effortful control constructs were derived using scales from the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling indicated that sympathetic and parasympathetic functioning predicted externalizing behavior even when accounting for the influence of temperament traits. These significant associations were small in magnitude. As expected, higher parasympathetic and lower sympathetic reactivity predicted greater externalizing behavior. Effortful control and affective experience also independently predicted problem behavior when accounting for autonomic functioning and each other's influence as evidenced by small to medium significant associations. Lower levels of these constructs predicted higher problem behavior. Implications for the prevention and treatment of externalizing behavior are discussed.

AB This study examined whether physiological and behavioral indicators of emotion dysregulation assessed over the course of multisystemic therapy (MST) were related to treatment response. Participants were 180 ethnically diverse adolescents (n = 120 males), ranging in age from 12 to 17 years. Treatment response was assessed through therapist report and official arrest records. Changes in cortisol reactivity and changes in scores on a Behavioral Dysregulation subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist were used as indicators of emotion dysregulation. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses examined whether a less favorable treatment response was associated with cortisol reactivity measures collected (a) early in treatment and (b) over the course of treatment as well as with behavioral reports of emotion dysregulation reported (c) early in treatment and (d) over the course of treatment. Sex was explored as a moderator of these associations. Results indicated that both cortisol and behavioral indices of emotion dysregulation early in treatment and over the course of therapy predicted treatment responsiveness. This relationship was moderated by sex: Girls were more likely to evidence a pattern of increasing emotion regulation prior to successful therapy response. The results lend further support to the notion of incorporating emotion regulation techniques into treatment protocols for delinquent behavior.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems among children and adolescents can lead to numerous negative outcomes without intervention. From a prevention standpoint, screening for behavioral and emotional risk is an important step toward identifying such problems before the point of diagnosis or referral. The present study conducted a k-means cluster analysis to determine the subtypes of risk captured by one such screening instrument, the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS). The final solution produced four clusters: Well-Adapted, Internalizing/Adjustment Problems, Mild Externalizing Problems, and General Problems-Severe; these results were similar to those found with the full Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), suggesting that the BESS assesses similar constructs. Predictive validity evidence suggested that cluster membership was associated with standard achievement scores and in-school disciplinary incidents.

AB Depression is common among adolescents, affecting greater than 12% of youth in a given year. Studies have shown aberrant amygdala connectivity in depressed adolescents, compared with controls; however, no studies have examined whether these abnormalities precede and heighten risk for depressive symptom expression. This study used resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) magnetic resonance imaging to examine neurobiological markers of escalating depression symptoms in adolescents (ages 12-16 years; free from psychopathology at baseline). Of a large sample of adolescents, 18 showed >= 1 S.D. increase in depression scale t-scores over time ("escalators"; time to escalation ranging from 6 to 54 months in follow up) and were matched and compared to 19 youth showing stable CDI scores over time ("controls"). Whole-brain analyses on baseline RSFC data using an amygdala seed region-of-interest (ROI) showed that controls had greater RSFC, relative to escalators, between the right amygdala and left inferior frontal and supramarginal gyrus and right mid-cingulate cortex. Additionally, relative to escalators, control youth had less RSFC between the left amygdala and cerebellum. Findings suggest a possible neurobiological marker of increasing depressive symptoms during adolescence, characterized in part by reduced fronto-limbic connectivity, suggesting a premorbid deficiency in top-down emotional regulation.

AB Background
   Evidence has accumulated for the association between low vitamin D serum concentrations and mental health disorders in both children and adults. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a population-based sample of children and adolescents to detect associations between 25(OH)-vitamin D serum [25(OH) D] concentrations and scores of the five Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) subscales and the total difficulties score in different age groups (age >= 3-<12 years and >= 12-<18 years).
   Methods
   9068 participants of the population-based, nation-wide German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KIGGS) with information on mental health status assessed by the SDQ and 25(OH) D levels were included in the analysis. For statistical analysis we used linear regression models stratified by gender based on different adjustment sets. For the younger subsample the analysis was additionally adjusted for the frequency of playing outside. We compared the associations based on parent-and self-ratings of the SDQ for children and adolescents aged >= 12-< 18 years.
   Results
   We found inverse associations between 25(OH) D concentrations and the subscales emotional problems, peer relationship problems and the total difficulties score in both genders after adjustment for potential confounders. The strongest associations were observed in the older subsample for parent-ratings in boys and self-ratings in girls. In the younger subsample the associations were less strong and no longer evident after adjustment for potential confounders such as migration background, socioeconomic status and frequency of playing outside.
   Conclusion
   Based on the large-scale cross-sectional study in a German population-based sample of children and adolescents we detected inverse associations between 25( OH) D concentrations and both parent-and self-rated SDQ scores of the total difficulties scale and different subscales with the strongest association in the subsample aged >= 12-<18 years for both genders. Migration background and socioeconomic status were detected as relevant confounders. Further studies-particularly in countries with comparatively low mean 25(OH) D concentrations-in childhood and adolescence are warranted. Longitudinal studies are also necessary to infer direction of effects. Finally, RCTs in children and adolescents are required to determine whether Vitamin D is beneficial for mental health.

AB Background. Although there is substantial evidence for the role of emotion regulation in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, knowledge about what contributes to emotion dysregulation is sparse. Attachment style is related to emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms, but these variables have rarely been examined together. Examining emotion dysregulation within the context of anxiety disorders through an attachment theory framework will lead to a better understanding of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. In the present study we combined theoretically and empirically derived knowledge to examine the mediating role of emotion regulation between attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and anxiety symptoms.
   Methods: A total of 147 individuals were assessed with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and statistical mediation analyses were conducted.
   Results: Our results indicate that the significant association between anxiety and attachment anxiety was mediated by emotion dysregulation, whereas attachment avoidance was not significantly related to anxiety when covarying for attachment anxiety. The primary limitation of our study is that data is cross-sectional and so causation cannot be inferred. Secondly, all measures used in this study were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is not insecure attachment in general that is important in anxiety disorders, but that attachment anxiety is specifically relevant. Thus, clinical interventions for anxiety disorders may improve by targeting attachment related difficulties.

AB The study aimed to explore the relationship among negative academic emotions (e.g., anxiety, shame, anger, boredom, hopelessness, disappointment, and hatred), psychological well-being (including life vitality, health concern, altruism commitment, self-value, friendly relationship, and personal development), and cognitive reappraisal in rural-to-urban migrant adolescents in China. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relationship between psychological well-being and negative academic emotions is moderated by cognitive reappraisal. A total of 311 migrant adolescents aged 14-20 years were selected, including 132 boys and 179 girls. Results of a regression analysis showed that cognitive reappraisal (positive) and negative academic emotions were significant predictors of psychological well-being. The interaction effect between cognitive reappraisal and negative academic emotion was also a significant predictor of psychological well-being. In the simple slope analysis the group with a below average cognitive reappraisal score the negative academic emotions were associated with lower psychological well-being, whereas in the group with above average cognitive reappraisal the effect of negative academic emotions on psychological well-being was not significant. However, for those with a cognitive reappraisal score of 1 standard deviation above the average, the effect of negative academic emotions on psychological well-being was not significant. These results suggest that cognitive reappraisal was a significant moderator in the relationship between negative academic emotion and psychological well-being.

AB Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a Brief Intervention (BI) and Treatment As Usual (TAU) in a sample of children and adolescents seeking mental health treatment from a Child and Youth Mental Health Service (CYMHS). 131 comprised up to six sessions of psychological therapy from trainee psychologists, and TAU involves case management incorporating assessment and psychological treatment (e.g., individual, parent, family therapy), plus linkage to other services.
   Method:A matched subjects design was used to evaluate the BI (n = 79) and TAU (n = 79) treatment conditions. Participants were matched according to age, gender, and baseline symptom scores on the Health of the Nations Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), which was completed at pre- and posttreatment. The HoNOSCA is a clinician-rated measure of symptoms experienced in the previous two weeks.
   Results: BI and TAU both significantly reduced mental health symptoms, with no significant difference between treatments overall, on Externalising or Emotional problems subscales, or on the percentage of most problematic items for participants.
   Conclusions: B1 was as effective as TAU in reducing mental health symptoms in some children and adolescents. B1 however is briefer, and could form part of a Stepped Care model for CYMHS. Further research is required to establish the most effective elements of BI in reducing mental health symptoms.

The present research was conducted with a group of 218 students (male = 101) aged from 11 to 19 years (M = 14.43, DS = 2.60). The results emphasize that (a) self-esteem is positively associated only with security of attachment to the mother, (b) ego-resiliency is positively associated with security of attachment both to mother and peers, and (c) boys seem to have higher levels of self-esteem and ego-resiliency than girls.

AB Background/Aim: The majority of cancers affect the elderly, but 22.4% of all cases occur in the ages of 21-55. This age range represents common childbearing and child-rearing years, which imply that many of these patients have minor children. Approximately 2.85 million children under 18 live with a parent affected by cancer. Materials and Methods: The Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched to identify literature on impact of parental cancer on children and potential interventions to support parents and children. Results: We reviewed impact of parental cancer on daily routine, role changes, emotional problems and social functioning of children. We also discuss interventions that may be useful for parents and children. Conclusion: It is essential that we learn more about the impact of parental cancer on children and ways to support the families using evidence-based interventions.

AB Based on insights from the psychology of religion, positive psychology, personality psychology, and theology, a theoretical model relating the virtue of patience to religion and spirituality is proposed. Patience is conceptualized as a hybrid personality construct related to effective emotion regulation strategies coupled with transcendent narrative identity. An initial empirical test of the model is conducted in a sample of ethnically diverse adolescents (N = 406) who are primarily Christian or nonreligious. Religiousness and spirituality are predictors of the virtue of patience, which then predicts use of the emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal; all these variables are then tested as direct and indirect predictors of regulated behavior and well-being. Overall, results support our theoretical model that spirituality and religion predict higher patience, which facilitates the employment of adaptive emotion regulation strategies that predict better life outcomes. Implications and future research questions stemming from the theoretical model are discussed.

AB Background Observational rating instruments are an important supplement to explore the need for interventions in the framework of an adequate treatment in detention centers. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a newly developed observational instrument for juvenile detainees (BEO-GF-J).
   Method The BEO-GF-J was applied in a sample of 126 juvenile prison inmates (mean age = 16.83 years, standard deviation = 1.11 years). A factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the 18 items in the BEO-GF-J. The association of the BEO-GF-J with interview-based internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, with later recidivistic criminal offences (official data) and with interventions during detention were examined.
   Results Depressive and anxious behavior was observed most frequently in the juveniles (38-39%). Threatening and impulsive behavior (15-33%) and suicidality (4-9%) were less frequently observed. The factor analysis showed evidence for two significant factors of the BEO-GF-J, which represent aggression (BEO-A) and emotional problems (BEO-E). The interrater reliability and the internal consistency were found to be satisfactory. The total score and the emotional problem scale indicated the presence of internalizing disorders and suicidality. The BEO-GF-J did not predict later criminal behavior, but was found to be related to interventions during incarceration.
   Conclusion The BEO-GF-J is a promising screening tool to identify adolescents who need further assessment and psychiatric interventions.

AB Environmental contributions are thought to play a primary role in the familial aggregation of anxiety, but parenting influences remain poorly understood. We examined dynamic relations between maternal anxiety, maternal emotion regulation (ER) during child distress, maternal accommodation of child distress, and child anxiety. Mothers (N = 45) of youth ages 3-8 years (M = 4.8) participated in an experimental task during which they listened to a standardized audio recording of a child in anxious distress pleading for parental intervention. Measures of maternal and child anxiety, mothers' affective states, mothers' ER strategies during the child distress, and maternal accommodation of child anxiety were collected. Mothers' resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity during the recording was also acquired. Higher maternal negative affect and greater maternal ER switching (i.e., using multiple ER strategies in a short time without positive regulatory results) during child distress were associated with child anxiety. Sequential mediation modeling showed that maternal anxiety predicted ineffective maternal ER during child distress exposure, which in turn predicted greater maternal accommodation, which in turn predicted higher child anxiety. Findings support the mediating roles of maternal ER and accommodation in linking maternal and child anxiety, and suggest that ineffective maternal ER and subsequent attempts to accommodate child distress may act as mechanisms underlying the familial aggregation of anxiety.

AB Objective To assess the mechanisms accounting for the transfer of risk from one generation to the next, especially as they relate to maternal adverse childhood experiences and infant physical and emotional health outcomes.
   Study design Participants were 501 community mother-infant dyads recruited shortly after the birth and followed up at 18 months. Mothers retrospectively reported on their adverse childhood experiences. The main outcome measures were parent-reported infant physical health and emotional problems. Potential mechanisms of intergenerational transmission included cumulative biomedical risk (eg, prenatal and perinatal complications) and postnatal psychosocial risk (eg, maternal depression, single parenthood, marital conflict).
   Results Four or more adverse childhood experiences were related to a 2-and 5-fold increased risk of experiencing any biomedical or psychosocial risk, respectively. There was a linear association between number of adverse childhood experiences and extent of biomedical and psychosocial risk. Path analysis revealed that the association between maternal adverse childhood experiences and infant physical health operated specifically through cumulative biomedical risk, while the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and infant emotional health operated specifically through cumulative psychosocial risk. This pattern was not explained by maternal childhood disadvantage or current neighborhood poverty.
   Conclusions Maternal adverse childhood experiences confer vulnerability to prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal psychosocial health. The association between adverse childhood experiences and offspring physical and emotional health operates through discrete intermediary mechanisms.

AB Objective: Previous studies have already found a positive association between attachment and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in children and adolescents. However, to our knowledge, no experimental studies have examined whether changes in negative and/or positive affect moderate the association between attachment anxiety and body dissatisfaction in children.
   Method: A controlled laboratory setting was used to investigate whether changes in state negative and/or positive affect moderate the association between attachment anxiety and body satisfaction in a sample of 81 children (Mage = 11.74). The changes in state affect were caused by the exposure to a performance-related stressor using the Trier Social Stress Test for Children.
   Results: Children with high levels of attachment anxiety reported a decrease in body satisfaction, but only if the TSST-C led to a decrease in their positive affect.
   Discussion: Early detection and intervention programs may benefit from addressing insecure attachment and maladaptive emotion regulation in children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is growing concern that rising rates of electronic media use might be harmful. However, the extent to which different types of electronic media use might be associated with emotional and behavioral problems is unclear. In this study we examined associations between emotional and behavioral problems and electronic media use during late childhood, in a large community sample.
   METHODS: Participants were 876 8- to 9-year-old children taking part in the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study in Australia. Parents reported on their child's emotional and behavioral problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and on their child's duration of electronic media use (in hours: television, video games, general computer use).
   RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses were conducted with adjustments for age, socioeconomic status, and body mass index z score, separately for male and female participants. Boys who played more video games had significantly greater odds of scoring borderline/abnormal on conduct (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.12) and emotional problems (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11) for each additional hour of weekly use. This equates to 2.58-fold greater odds for a boy who plays on average 2 hours per day per week. Television viewing was associated with greater odds of hyperactivity/inattention in boys (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07). There were no significant relationships for girls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the increasing rates of electronic media use in children, these results might have important implications for child mental health. Future interventions might be more effective if they are targeted at specific types of electronic media use.

AB Background: Adolescence is characterized by increasing prevalence of depressive symptomatology, along with significant structural brain development. While much research has examined focal abnormalities in gray matter structure underlying depression, we employed a structural coupling approach to examine whether longitudinal associations between amygdala and cortical development (referred to as maturational coupling) was related to concurrent changes in depressive symptomatology during adolescence.
   Method: 166 participants underwent up to three MRI scans (367 scans) between 11 and 20 years of age. Depressive symptoms were measured at three coinciding time points using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Linear mixed models were employed to identify whether change in amygdala volume was related to development of cortical thickness, and if maturational coupling of these regions was related to changes in depressive symptomatology.
   Results: Positive maturational coupling was identified between the right amygdala and (predominantly anterior) prefrontal cortex, as well as parts of the temporal cortices. Greater positive coupling of these regions was associated with reductions in depressive symptoms over time.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight significant associations between cortico-amygdalar maturational coupling and the emergence of depressive symptoms during adolescence, suggesting that synchronous development of these regions might support more adaptive affect regulation and functioning.

AB Objective A cancer diagnosis during pregnancy may be considered as an emotional challenge for pregnant women and their partners. We aimed to identify women and partners at risk for high levels of distress based on their coping profile.
   Methods Sixty-one pregnant women diagnosed with cancer and their partners filled out the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) and the newly constructed Cancer and Pregnancy Questionnaire (CPQ). K-means cluster analysis was performed on the CERQ scales. Scores on the CPQ were compared between the women and their partners and between the CERQ-clusters.
   Results Comparison of women and partners on the CPQ did not reveal significant differences on distress about the child's health, the cancer disease, and the pregnancy or on information satisfaction (P = .16, P = .44, P = .50, and P=.47, respectively). However, women were more inclined to maintain the pregnancy than their partners (P = .011). Three clusters were retrieved based on the CERQ scales, characterized by positive coping, internalizing coping, and blaming. Women and partners using internalizing strategies had significantly higher scores on concerns about the child's health (P = .039), the disease and treatment (P < .001), and the pregnancy and delivery (P = .009) compared with positive and blaming strategies. No cluster differences were found for information satisfaction (P = .71) and tendency to maintain the pregnancy (P = .35).
   Conclusion Women and partners using internalizing coping strategies deal with the highest levels of distress and may benefit from additional psychosocial support.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in behavioral and emotional problems in high-functioning girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder. The results obtained by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder were compared with those of typically developing girls and boys. Correlations between parents' and adolescents' ratings were also analyzed. Participants were 35 girls and 35 boys with autism spectrum disorder, aged 11-18years, matched for chronological age and full-scale IQ. The control group consisted of 24 typically developing girls and 24 boys of the same age and IQ. The parents of adolescent participants were also included in the study. The measures used were the Child Behavior Checklist (4-18) completed by parents and Youth Self-Report (11-18) completed by adolescents. The adolescents with autism spectrum disorder presented higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems than the control group, according to both the parents' reports and the adolescents' self-reports. No sex differences were found in that respect. More differences between the assessments of adolescents and their parents occurred in the control group, and the effect size was larger.

AB Dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important predictor of psychopathology. Although many clinical programs focus on emotion regulation skills, the successful application of these programs in children and adolescents requires knowledge on the normative use of emotion regulation strategies over age. To this end, the current cross-sectional study examined changes in emotion regulation throughout childhood and adolescence. The use of seven adaptive and five maladaptive emotion regulation strategies was measured with the FEEL-KJ in a representative sample (N = 1397) of Dutch children and adolescents between 8 and 18 years old. Overall, the results indicated reduced use of adaptive strategies and increased use of maladaptive strategies in participants between 12 and 15 years old compared with younger or older participants. The findings of the current study indicate that adolescence is characterized by a maladaptive shift in emotion regulation. Given that the continued use of dysfunctional emotion regulation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, these results highlight the importance of prevention and treatment programs focused on emotion regulation to shield vulnerable adolescents against mental illness.

AB Purpose: To inform efforts to reduce costly service utilization, the present study examined longitudinal trajectories of mental health-related outpatient and residential service use among at-risk youth with a history of early externalizing problems.
   Methods: A cohort of 809 children in the Fast Track Project, a multisite longitudinal study of children at risk for conduct disorder, were followed prospectively from kindergarten through 12th grade. They resided in high-risk areas with high rates of poverty, crime, and violence. Their outpatient and residential service use was assessed annually between sixth and 12th grades through parent report. Growth mixture modeling was applied to model individual differences in trajectories of service use during this period. Teacher, parent, and observer-reported childhood predictors of those trajectories were also examined.
   Results: Most youths had minimal service use during preadolescence into adolescence. However, approximately 31% had moderate probability of using outpatient counseling services, and approximately 8% had elevated probability of seeing a family doctor for mental health needs. For residential services, approximately 6% had moderate to high probability of service use that peaked during transition to high school, whereas close to 5% had service use that dramatically increased during high school. Childhood predictors of these trajectories included earlier externalizing, internalizing, and emotion regulation problems.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to use person-centered analytic methods to examine longitudinal trajectories in mental health-related service use among at-risk adolescents. Timely treatment for severe externalizing problems, comorbid internalizing problems, and emotion dysregulation during childhood may be crucial for preventing chronic service use.

AB The present study examined whether children with elevated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms display a unique pattern of emotion dysregulation as indexed by both parent report and physiological reactivity during experiences of failure. A sample of 61 children (9 to 13 years; M = 11.62, SD = 1.29; 48 % male) with and without clinical elevations in ADHD symptoms participated. Parent and teacher report of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms and parent report of internalizing problems were collected. Parents also provided ratings of children's emotional negativity/lability and emotion regulation. Children's physiological reactivity, based on changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance level (SCL), were assessed while they completed a manipulated social rejection task and impossible puzzle task. Regression analyses indicated that ADHD symptoms were associated with higher parent-rated emotional negativity/lability and with blunted RSA withdrawal in response to social rejection; these effects were not accounted for by co-occurring ODD symptoms or internalizing problems. ODD symptoms also were uniquely associated with parent ratings of poor emotion regulation. Internalizing problems were uniquely associated with emotional negativity/lability, poor emotion regulation, and increased SCL activity in response to social rejection. Results suggest that there may be a pattern of emotion dysregulation that is specific to ADHD symptomatology. The importance of contextual factors when examining physiological reactivity to stress in youth with ADHD is discussed.

AB The strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) is a frequently used tool for universal screening of pre-schoolers' behavioural and emotional problems. However, evidence for its concurrent validity is equivocal and has not been tested in a MAori population. We aimed to evaluate the concurrent validity of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) in MAori pre-schoolers (tamariki), aged 4 and 5. We carried out a prospective study of 225 tamariki (46% female) for whom a recent SDQ was available from the New Zealand Ministry of Health's Before School Check database. A trained nurse carried out a standardised wellbeing and behavioural assessment for these children. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values were calculated, using optimal total difficulty scale threshold values published for the SDQ (parent version SDQ-P; teacher version SDQ-T). Primary outcome: an assessment-based child referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or to a Paediatric outpatient service. Secondary outcomes: assessment-based parental referral to a parenting programme and combined referral. The optimal thresholds for child referral were low for the SDQ-P (13) and SDQ-T (7). Child referral SDQ-P: sensitivity 62%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 0.35, negative predictive value 0.94. Child referral SDQ-T: sensitivity 77%, specificity 78%, positive predictive value 0.31, negative predictive value 0.96. The findings demonstrate optimal threshold values for referral for MAori on the SDQ-P and SDQ-T are much lower when compared to published thresholds (17 vs. 16). Sensitivity values were also low. A surveillance approach for the assessment of psychosocial problems is recommended for pre-schoolers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chronic physical health conditions are highly prevalent in youth, frequently persisting into adulthood and contributing to the current and future health care burden in the United States. Our study evaluated associations of chronic physical health conditions with depressive and physiological anxiety symptoms in a community sample of youth and examined how those associations changed from early to midadolescence.
   METHODS: In this longitudinal study of 5147 youth, students and their caregivers were interviewed when youth were in grades 5 (mean age = 11), 7 (mean age = 13), and 10 (mean age = 16). Caregivers reported family sociodemographics, youth race/ethnicity, and youth chronic physical health history at baseline. Youth reported their depressive symptoms at each time point and their physiological anxiety symptoms at grades 7 and 10.
   RESULTS: At age 11, 28.5% had experienced a chronic physical health condition. Having any chronic physical health condition was related to elevated depressive symptoms at age 11 (2.05 +/- 0.05 vs 1.89 +/- 0.03; mean +/- standard error; P < .01) and anxiety symptoms at age 16 (2.72 +/- 0.06 vs 2.55 +/- 0.04; P < .05). Experiencing multiple conditions was also related to experiencing more depressive symptoms (b = 0.13; P < .01) and physiological anxiety symptoms (b = 0.13; P < .05). After adjusting for previous mental health symptoms, having any condition still predicted anxiety at age 16.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children with chronic physical health conditions have an increased risk of depressive symptoms and physiological anxiety symptoms, especially in early and midadolescence. Repeated screening for these symptoms may help identify children in need of interventions.

AB trajectories. A 4-group solution was selected as the bestfitting model: (1) ongoing stable low levels of depression; (2) very high depressive symptoms initially, but a steep decrease in symptoms over time; (3) moderately high depressive symptoms initially, but symptoms decreased over time; and (4) initially low levels of symptoms that increased over time. Trajectory group membership was associated with a range of psychosocial variables including temperament, childhood maltreatment, and young adult quality of life. Characterising these subgroups allows for a better understanding of how the interaction of risk factors increases the likelihood of depression and other poor outcomes, and highlights the importance of early interventions to prevent and treat adolescent depression. Variations in symptom trajectories within a population may represent distinct groups with different etiologies and outcomes. This study aimed to identify subgroups of depression symptom trajectories in a sample of adolescents, and to describe psychosocial attributes of the different groups. In a longitudinal study, 243 adolescents (121 males and 122 females), were assessed using a battery of measures of temperament, psychopathology, and psychological and behavioral functioning. Four phases of data collection over 7 years spanned average ages of the participants from 12 to 18 years old. Depressive symptoms from each phase were used to model latent class growth

AB The aim of the study was to test whether, and how much, specific objective Facebook behaviours are more frequent in problematic than non-problematic Facebook users. Differences between problematic and non-problematic Facebook users in objective Facebook behaviours were examined using frequentist and Bayesian t-tests. Participants were undergraduate students (n = 297, 80.8% female, age mean = 21.05, standard deviation = 1.88). Problematic Facebook use was assessed using fifteen items adapted from the scale developed and validated for the measurement of Generalized Problematic Internet Use. A specific R package was developed to obtain information about objective Facebook behaviours (friendship activities, events, wall activities, and text messages). T-tests indicated that non problematic and problematic users significantly differ in several objective Facebook behaviours. Bayesian analyses confirmed t-test results and supported that Problematic users scored higher than non problematic users in several dependent variables, such as number of friendships established, number of events attended, all wall activities (e.g. number of "like"), and private messages sent. The analysis of data about objective Facebook behaviours goes beyond the self-reported information about such activities, and helps to understand the role of its potentially addictive activities in predicting PFU.

AB Research on childhood adversity has traditionally focused on single types of adversity, which is limited because of high co-occurrence, or on the total number of adverse experiences, which assumes that diverse experiences influence development similarly. Identifying dimensions of environmental experience that are common to multiple types of adversity may be a more effective strategy. We examined the unique associations of two such dimensions (threat and cognitive deprivation) with automatic emotion regulation and cognitive control using a multivariate approach that simultaneously examined both dimensions of adversity. Data were drawn from a community sample of adolescents (N = 287) with variability in exposure to violence, an indicator of threat, and poverty, which is associated with cognitive deprivation. Adolescents completed tasks measuring automatic emotion regulation and cognitive control in neutral and emotional contexts. Violence was associated with automatic emotion regulation deficits, but not cognitive control; poverty was associated with poor cognitive control, but not automatic emotion regulation. Both violence and poverty predicted poor inhibition in an emotional context. Utilizing an approach focused on either single types of adversity or cumulative risk obscured specificity in the associations of violence and poverty with emotional and cognitive outcomes. These findings suggest that different dimensions of childhood adversity have distinct influences on development and highlight the utility of a differentiated multivariate approach.

AB Maltreatment is associated with chronic depression, high negative self-attributions, and lifetime psychopathology. Adolescence is a sensitive period for the formation of self-concept. Identifying neurobiomarkers of self-processing in depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse the effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic psychopathology. Depressed adolescents (n = 86) maltreated due to omission (DO, n = 13) or commission (DCM, n = 28) or without maltreatment (DC, n = 45), and HCs (HC, n = 37) appraised positive and negative self-descriptors in the scanner. DCM and DO showed hypoactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while processing positive versus negative self-descriptors compared to DC youth, who in turn showed reduced dACC recruitment versus HC. HC youth showed the highest activation in the dACC and striatum during positive self-descriptors; these regions showed a linear decline in activity across DC, DO, and DCM. Low dACC activity to positive versus negative self-descriptors was linked to inadequate coregulation of children's emotions by parents. Negative self-cognitions prevalent in DCM and DO adolescents may be perpetuated by activity in the dACC and striatum. Reduced activation of the dACC and striatum for positive self-descriptors, coupled with enhanced activity for negative self-descriptors, may heighten the risk for persistent depression.

AB Background: Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) may alter responses to stress. Children with PCE tend to grow up in suboptimal caregiving environments, conducive to child maltreatment (CM). Guided by the diathesis-stress model, the present study examined differences in self-reported responses to stress and coping in adolescents with and without PCE and explored whether childhood maltreatment (CM) moderated the effects of PCE.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 363; 184 PCE, 179 non-cocaine exposed (NCE)), primarily African-American and of low socioeconomic status, were prospectively enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth. The Responses to Stress Questionnaire was used to assess volitional coping (primary control, secondary control, disengagement) and involuntary responses (involuntary engagement, involuntary disengagement) to stress at the 15- and 17-year follow-up visits. CM was assessed retrospectively at age 17 using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire.
   Results: Findings from longitudinal mixed model analyses indicated that PCE was associated with poorer coping strategies only among adolescents with a history of CM. Adolescents with PCE who experienced CM reported less dominant use of primary (e.g., problem solving, emotional regulation) and secondary control (e.g., cognitive restructuring) and more dominant use of disengagement (e.g., denial, avoidance) and involuntary disengagement (e.g., inaction) than adolescents with PCE who did not experience CM or NCE adolescents regardless of CM. CM was associated with more dominant use of involuntary engagement (e.g., intrusive thoughts).
   Conclusions: PCE may increase sensitivity to CM, predisposing increased vulnerability to environmental risk. Continued studies into adulthood will elucidate how coping and involuntary stress responses affect social, vocational, and behavioral adjustment.

AB Objective: Hormonal variations during the menstrual cycle may affect emotional regulation. We aimed to investigate the association between dysmenorrhea (the severe abdominal pain and cramps associated with menstruation) and cognitive abilities, emotional function and sleep patterns in adolescent girls. Moreover, we evaluated the frequency of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in our population and then divided them into 4 groups: subjects with only PMS; subjects with only dysmenorrhea; individuals with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects.
   Study design: In this cross sectional study, 897 adolescent girls who had entered menarche were recruited. Of these, 35.9% had only dysmenorrhea, 14.9% had only PMS, 32.7% had both PMS and dysmenorrhea while 16.5% had no PMS and/or dysmenorrhea (Normal). We assessed the tests for cognitive, emotional function and sleep patterns were compared for these groups.
   Results: Individuals in the dysmenorrhea group had significantly higher depression, aggression, insomnia, daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea scores compared to normal controls and the PMS group, but did not have significantly different cognitive ability (P value < 0.05). These differences were strongly correlated to pain intensity (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences between those with only PMS and control subjects with regard to cognitive ability, emotional function and sleep pattern tests.
   Conclusions: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent among adolescents and appears to be associated with depressive mood, a tendency to aggressive behavior and sleep disorders among adolescent girls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The job search process is a stressful experience. This study investigated the effect of emotion regulation strategies on job search behavior in combination with anxiety and job search self-efficacy among Chinese university fourth-year students (N = 816, mean age = 21.98, 31.5% male, 34.9% majored in science, 18.0% from "211 Project" universities). Results showed that cognitive reappraisal was positively related to job search behavior, while expressive suppression was negatively related to job search behavior. Additionally, anxiety was negatively related to. job search behavior, while job search self-efficacy was positively associated with job search behavior. Moreover, both anxiety and job search self efficacy mediated the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and job search behavior. In general, emotion regulation strategies played an important role in job search behavior. Implications include the notion that emotion regulation interventions may be helpful to increase job search behavior among university students.

AB Whilst some form of ostracism is experienced by most people at some point in their lives, it is experienced far more often in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Little is known about how this social exclusion is interpreted, experienced or managed. This study aimed to explore the psychological (mood and social needs) as well as the physiological (arousal) effects of ostracism using a well-established paradigm, Cyberball. Results demonstrated no differences between groups on social needs, however, mood was rated as more negatively by ASDs overall. Arousal was increased in when excluded compared with when excluded for ASDs, but not for controls. Overall, individuals with ASD experienced heightened physiological arousal but whilst these individuals reported overall lower mood, this response to ostracism was not expressed as emotionally significant to these individuals, suggesting possible interoceptive difficulties in this population. This highlights the need for both understanding in non-ASD individuals and intervention of this emotional distress in individuals with ASD.

AB Sensory hypersensitivity and insistence on sameness (I/S) are common, co-occurring features of autism, yet the relationship between them is poorly understood. This study assessed the impact of sensory hypersensitivity on the clinical symptoms of specific phobia, separation anxiety, social anxiety and I/S for autistic and typically developing (TD) children. Parents of 79 children completed questionnaires on their child's difficulties related to sensory processing, I/S, and anxiety. Results demonstrated that sensory hypersensitivity mediated 67% of the relationship between symptoms of specific phobia and I/S and 57% of the relationship between separation anxiety and I/S. No relationship was observed between sensory hypersensitivity and social anxiety. These mediation effects of sensory hypersensitivity were found only in autistic children, not in TD children.

AB This study evaluated the magnitude of informant agreement and predictors of agreement on behavior and emotional problems and autism symptoms in 403 children with autism and their typically developing siblings. Parent-teacher agreement was investigated on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Agreement between parents and teachers fell in the low to moderate range. Multiple demographic and clinical variables were considered as predictors, and only some measures of parent broad autism traits were associated with informant agreement. Parent report on the SRS was a positive predictor of agreement, while teacher report was a negative predictor. Parent report on the CBCL emerged as a positive predictor of agreement, while teacher report emerged as a negative predictor.

AB BACKGROUNDMany emotional and behavioral problems first emerge in primary school and are the forerunners of mental health problems occurring in adolescence. However, the extent that these problems may be associated with academic failure has been explored less. We aimed to quantify the association between emotional and behavioral problems with academic performance.
   METHODSA stratified random sample of 8- to 9-year-olds (N=1239) were recruited from schools in Australia. Data linkage was performed with a national assessment of academic performance to assess reading and numeracy. Parent report assessed emotional and behavioral problems with students dichotomized into borderline/abnormal and normal categories.
   RESULTSOne in 5 grade 3 students fell in the borderline/abnormal category. Boys with total difficulties (=-47.8, 95% CI: -62.8 to -32.8), conduct problems, and peer problems scored lower on reading. Numeracy scores were lower in boys with total difficulties (=-37.7, 95% CI: -53.9 to -21.5) and emotional symptoms. Children with hyperactivity/inattention scored lower in numeracy. Girls with peer problems scored lower in numeracy.
   CONCLUSIONSBoys with emotional and behavioral problems in mid-primary school were 12months behind their peers. Children with emotional and behavioral problems are at high risk for academic failure, and this risk is evident in mid-primary school.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the factor structure of the Male Body Attitudes Scale (MBAS) among a sample of 212 adolescent males by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis. The data revealed that while muscularity and low body fat factors were appropriate for the male sample, the height factor was not supported. The composite MBAS-Spanish version (MBAS-S) and its two factors had high internal consistency and were not significantly related to the traditionally used measure of body image (Eating Disorder Inventory-Body Dissatisfaction [BD]), confirming that this subscale only appears to evaluate female body concerns. Correlations with psychological well-being variables (anxiety, emotional regulation, and self-esteem) supported the concurrent validity of the instrument. These findings provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that BD in males has been inappropriately evaluated by measures designed specifically for females. Despite the fact that our results did not replicate the original factorial structure of the instrument, the MBAS-S presents adequate psychometric properties and can be considered as a valuable assessment tool for BD among adolescent males.

AB The field of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is dominated by research conducted with Caucasian-majority samples in Western countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and European countries. This article critically reviewed the empirical research on NSSI in non-Western countries and among ethnic/racial minority individuals who live in the West to give voice to and understand the patterns of NSSI among individuals who do not fall within the dominant Caucasian majority. The study found both similarities and differences between Western and non-Western data in terms of characteristics and functions of NSSI. Differences in gender patterns in regards to prevalence of NSSI and methods used as well as presence of a more relational functionality of NSSI rather than emotion regulation functionality were two points of divergence in the findings of these studies. In addition, the findings seem to indicate that the role of ethnicity/race is mediated by important factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Existing gaps in the literature and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB Although experiencing child abuse (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, exposure to violence) is associated with a variety of mental health difficulties, simple exposure to abuse does not produce symptoms in every individual. The current study explored emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between a history of child abuse and symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. Adolescent females (ages 11-17 years) were asked to retrospectively report on their exposure to child abuse, current symptoms of PTSD/depression, and emotion regulation abilities. Caregiver report of adolescent emotional difficulties was also obtained. Analyses revealed that child abuse-exposed females, when compared to females without a trauma history, had worse emotion regulation abilities and increased mental health difficulties. Moreover, emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between child abuse and all assessed mental health symptoms. These findings extend previous work from adult samples, underscoring the importance of assessing emotion regulation abilities in abuse-exposed youth.

AB This study examined potential processes of change and mechanisms of action in an 8-week manualized mindfulness intervention for adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their parents. Five families (five adolescents aged 13-18 and seven parents) participated in semi-structured interviews about their lived experiences of mindfulness 1 to 3 months after the intervention. Thematic analysis guided by a phenomenological approach revealed several potential underlying mechanisms of action contributing to improved peer and family relationship quality after mindfulness training. Themes were consistent among parents and adolescents. Participant descriptions were indicative of enhanced present-focused awareness and detached self-observation, contributing to improved self-monitoring and self-regulation of attention, behavior, and emotions. Participants reported becoming more adept at implementing adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, problem-solving, and acceptance) and relying less on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination). Parents and adolescents described a parallel process of enhanced self-awareness and self-regulation that conjointly contributed to increased empathy, reduced emotional reactivity, improved communication, and reductions in the intensity and duration of conflicts. Furthermore, as individuals in the parent-child dyad became more adept at regulating their emotions, they mutually reinforced the emotion regulation skills of their social partner. A model of the co-regulatory process of change in parent-adolescent mindfulness training is proposed.

AB In August 2010, concerns were raised about an increase in the incidence rate of narcolepsy diagnosis in children and adolescents. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological sleep disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and attacks of muscle weakness which are often precipitated by strong emotions, known as cataplexy. We systematically examined and updated the scientific literature on the consequences of narcolepsy on cognitive function and psychosocial well-being in school-age children. Eight studies published between 2005 and 2015 were eligible for inclusion in this review. Collectively the results provide evidence to suggest that children who develop narcolepsy are at significant risk of cognitive impairment in at least one domain and emotional problems including depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. Children with narcolepsy should be monitored carefully in order to manage and reduce the impact of any impairments present. The existing literature is limited by small sample sizes, lack of appropriate controls and lack of longitudinal data. Future research should aim to address the limitations of the current work and aim to determine the underlying cause of cognitive and psychological impairments. This will enable the design of effective interventions to support children with narcolepsy so that they are able to achieve their full potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research has demonstrated that emotions expressed in parent-child relationships are associated with children's school success. Yet the types of emotional expressions, and the mechanisms by which emotional expressions are linked with children's success in school, are unclear. In the present article, we focused on negative emotion reciprocity in parent-child interactions. Using structural equation modeling of data from 138 parent to child dyads [children's mean age at Time 1 (T1) was 13.44 years, SD=1.16], we tested children's negative emotionality (CNE) at T1 and low attention focusing (LAF) at Time 2 (T2) as sequential mediators in the relation between parent and child negative emotion reciprocity at T1 and children's grade point average (GPA) and inhibitory control at T2. Our findings supported an emotion-attention process model: parent-child negative emotion reciprocity at T1 predicted CNE at T1, which predicted children's LAF at T2, which was, in turn, related to low inhibitory control at T2. Findings regarding children's GPA were less conclusive but did suggest an overall association of negative reciprocity and the two mediators with children's GPA. Our findings are discussed in terms of emotion regulation processes in children from negatively reciprocating dyads, and the effects of these processes on children's ability to obtain and use skills needed for success in school.

AB The ability to regulate emotion plays a key role in the development of prosocial behavior. This study uses the self-determination theory conceptualization of emotion regulation to explore whether children's emotion regulation styles differentially predict their prosocial behavior in class. For the study, 240 sixth and seventh grade Israeli students and their teachers responded to self-report measures. The results of structural equation modeling showed integrative emotion regulation predicts student prosocial behavior, both directly and through the mediation of empathy towards classmates. These findings suggest integrative emotion regulation can play an important role in promoting children's psychosocial adjustment in class. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emotional interference control refers to the ability to remain focused on goal-oriented processes when confronted with disrupting but irrelevant emotional stimuli, a process that may be impaired in children and adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, emotional interference levels are known to be associated with trait anxiety, and patients with ADHD often display elevated levels of trait anxiety, such as these may have confounded previous findings of decreased emotional interference control in this population. In the present study, male and female 8-13 years old (mean =11.0 years) children with ADHD (n=33) and typically developing (TD) children (n=24) performed a visual emotional working memory (n-back) task with 2 memory loads and three different background pictures (neutral/positive/negative), and trait anxiety measures were obtained. Children with ADHD performed less well, and displayed increased emotional interference in the presence of aversive distractors when compared with TD children. Contrary to our expectations, trait anxiety did not mediate the association between diagnostic group membership and the degree of emotional interference control; however, co-morbid ODD was associated with decreased levels of emotional interference in ADHD. Future research should aim at characterizing the mechanisms subtending decreased emotional interference control in the ADHD population.

AB Differences in emotional processing are prevalent in adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and are related to clinical impairment, but substantial heterogeneity exists. Within ADHD, some individuals experience difficulty with positive/approach emotions, negative/withdrawal emotions, or both. These problems may reflect differences in emotional reactivity, emotion regulation, or a combination, and the neurophysiological correlates remain unclear. Event-related potentials were collected from 109 adolescents (49 with ADHD) while they completed an emotional go/no-go task with three conditions: happy (positive/approach), fear (negative/withdrawal), and neutral. The P1 and N170 were used as a marker of early emotional processing and the P3b and late positive potential (LPP) were used as markers of later elaborative emotional processing. Emotional response style was assessed with parent and adolescent report on the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. There were no effects of emotion or group for the P1. Typically-developing adolescents exhibited a larger N170 to emotional vs. neutral faces while adolescents with ADHD showed the opposite pattern. All adolescents exhibited a larger P3b to fearful versus other faces and a larger LPP to emotional vs. non-emotional faces. Within the ADHD group, N170 responses to happy faces predicted parent ratings of positive/approach emotions. Findings highlight the importance of considering within-group heterogeneity when studying clinical populations and help clarify the time-locked neurophysiological correlates of emotion dysregulation.

AB The present study investigated a profile-based perspective of six dimensions of character strengths (i.e., heart strengths, heart/self-focused strengths, heart/others-focused strengths, mind strengths, mind/self-focused strengths, and mind/others-focused strengths), with the aim of identifying an optimal combination of Peterson's (2006) character strengths. A second aim was to examine whether profile membership was associated with mental health markers. We predicted that at least two qualitatively distinct profiles would emerge: the "heart" strengths profile and the "mind" strengths profile. We also predicted that a "heart" strengths profile would be more strongly associated with markers of mental health than a "mind" strengths profile. Respondents (N = 595, M-age = 34.11 years, SD = 13.18) completed measures assessing endorsement of character strengths and a range of mental health markers. A latent profile analysis identified an optimal 4-profile solution based on these six dimensions of strengths. Emergent profiles were Profile 1 (Low Strengths), Profile 2 (Mind Strengths), Profile 3 (Heart Strengths), and Profile 4 (High Strengths). As expected, profile membership was significantly associated with mental health markers. Notably, strengths of the heart (e.g., zest, hope, kindness) contributed to more favorable presentations. Therefore, cultivating strengths associated with the heart dimension might enhance mental health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Difficulty regulating positive mood and energy is a feature that cuts across different pediatric psychiatric disorders. Yet, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying different developmental trajectories of positive mood and energy regulation in youth. Recent studies indicate that machine learning techniques can help elucidate the role of neuroimaging measures in classifying individual subjects by specific symptom trajectory. Cortical thickness measures were extracted in sixty-eight anatomical regions covering the entire brain in 115 participants from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study and 31 healthy comparison youth (12.5 y/o;-Male/Female = 15/16; -IQ = 104;-Right/Left handedness = 24/5). Using a combination of trajectories analyses, surface reconstruction, and machine learning techniques, the present study aims to identify the extent to which measures of cortical thickness can accurately distinguish youth with higher (n = 18) from those with lower (n = 34) trajectories of manic -like behaviors in a large sample of LAMS youth (n = 115; 13.6 y/o; M/F = 68/47, IQ = 100.1, R/L = 108/7). Machine learning analyses revealed that widespread cortical thickening in portions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior and middle temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and bilateral paracentral gyri and cortical thinning in portions of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and right parahippocampal gyrus accurately differentiate (Area Under Curve = 0.89;p = 0.03) youth with different (higher vs lower) trajectories of positive mood and energy dysregulation over a period up to 5years, as measured by the Parent General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania Scale. Our findings suggest that specific patterns of cortical thickness may reflect transdiagnostic neural mechanisms associated with different temporal trajectories of positive mood and energy dysregulation in youth. This approach has potential to identify patterns of neural markers of future clinical course.

AB Few studies have examined physiological correlates of emotional reactivity and regulation in adolescents, despite the occurrence in this group of significant developmental changes in emotional functioning. The current study employed multiple physiological measures (i.e., startle-elicited eyeblink and ERP, skin conductance, facial EMG) to assess the emotional reactivity and regulation of 113 early adolescents in response to valenced images. Reactivity was measured while participants viewed images, and regulation was measured when they were asked to discontinue or maintain their emotional reactions to the images. Adolescent participants did not exhibit fear-potentiated startle blink. However, they did display affect-consistent zygomatic and corrugator activity during reactivity, as well as inhibition of some of these facial patterns during regulation. Skin conductance demonstrated arousal dependent activity during reactivity, and overall decreases during regulation. These findings suggest that early adolescents display reactivity to valenced pictures, but not to startle probes. Psychophysiological patterns during emotion regulation indicate additional effort and/or attention during the regulation process.

AB Daytime sleepiness is common in adolescents. The daytime sleepiness scales developed for western adolescents may not be applicable to Chinese adolescents. This study assesses the psychometric properties of the Chinese adolescent daytime sleepiness scale (CADSS) in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. The CADSS consists of 7 items assessing adolescents' general feeling of drowsiness and dozing off at different situations during daytime within the past month. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. A sample of 11,452 adolescents in China completed the CADSS and a structured questionnaire to assess sleep duration, sleep problems, hypnotic use, and behavioral/emotional problems. A subsample of 242 adolescents completed retest questionnaire 2 weeks later. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. The CADSS score ranged from 7 to 35 (M = 16.3, SD = 7.4). Internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.89 and 2-week test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.77. Both EFA and CFA yielded one dominant general factor defined as daytime sleepiness, indicating that the CADSS was essentially unidimensional. The CADSS score was significantly correlated with short nocturnal sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, poor sleep quality, sleep disordered breathing problems, and hypnotic use. ROC analysis indicated that a score of 17 was an acceptable cutoff in distinguishing adolescents with poor daytime functioning. The CADSS is a simple, reliable, and valid scale for assessing daytime sleepiness in Chinese adolescents. Further research is warranted to assess its psychometric properties with clinical samples and non-Chinese adolescents.

AB Background: Psychological interventions based on mindfulness and compassion approaches have demonstrated improved outcomes across a range of disorders. However, the application of these approaches to the at-risk mental state (ARMS) has received little attention to date. This paper explores their potential to enhance treatment of the ARMS.
   Methods: This article follows guidelines developed by the UK Medical Research Council and the US National Institute of Health on developing and evaluating complex interventions. The paper (1) describes the ARMS, treatment and outcomes, (2) explores relevant literature on mindfulness and compassion, (3) discusses the likely processes of change involved in a mindful compassionate approach, (4) provides a rationale for integrating mindfulness and compassion into treatment of the ARMS, and (5) offers recommendations to enhance knowledge and treatment in this area.
   Results: Common ARMS experiences include attenuated psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, insecure attachment style, and difficulties with daily functioning. In particular, voice tones are often hostile or critical and paranoia is associated with a self-attacking inner dialogue. Mindfulness and compassion are emotion regulation strategies that have the potential to tone down these threatening experiences by enhancing a sense of safety and reassurance. However, the potential impact of mindfulness and compassion on attachment style and feelings of social connectedness warrants further investigation.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness and compassion approaches are unique strategies that have the potential to significantly advance treatment of the ARMS. It is timely that a mindfulness and compassion-based intervention for the ARMS is developed and evaluated according to best practice guidelines.

AB Objective: This pilot study investigated predictors, moderators, and mediators of outcome and readmission in adolescents receiving specialist inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa.
   Method: Adolescents (n = 40) aged between 14 and 17 years (mean = 15.42) were assessed at admission and discharge from a specialist inpatient programme and again at three-month follow-up on the following outcome variables: eating disorder pathology, quality of life (QOL), and body mass index (BMI) centile. Readmissions to hospital were recorded over the three months post-discharge period. Potential predictors were drawn from theoretical models.
   Results: Readmission during the three-month follow-up period was less likely for first presentations. Higher baseline purging, concern over mistakes, perfectionism, ineffectiveness, and mood intolerance were associated with higher levels of eating disorder pathology and poorer QOL over all points of follow-up. Driven exercise moderated weight outcomes such that higher levels of baseline exercise resulted in a lower BMI centile at follow-up. Greater weight gain during treatment predicted higher BMI centile at follow-up, and increased perfectionism during treatment predicted a greater likelihood of being readmitted within three months of discharge.
   Conclusions: Weight gain during inpatient treatment should be encouraged to improve later weight outcomes. Focusing on the prevention of growth in perfectionism may be useful in improving psychological outcomes as will prioritising the elimination of purging and improved emotional regulation and self-efficacy. Efforts should be made to reduce driven exercise to promote better weight-related outcomes.

AB Aims: This paper examines the addictive potential of 8 different Internet applications, distinguishing male and female users. Moreover, differential correlates of problematic use are investigated in Internet gamers (IG) and generalized Internet users (GIU). Method: In a representative sample of 5,667 adolescents aged 12-19 years, use of Internet applications, problematic Internet use, psychopathologic symptoms (emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and psychosomatic complaints), personality (conscientiousness and extraversion), psychosocial correlates (perceived stress and self-efficacy), and coping strategies were assessed. The addictive potential of Internet applications was examined in boys and girls using regression analysis. MANOVAs were conducted to examine differential correlates of problematic Internet use between IG and GIU. Results: Chatting and social networking most strongly predicted problematic Internet use in girls, while gaming was the strongest predictor in boys. Problematic IG exhibited multiple psychosocial problems compared to non-problematic IG. In problematic Inter-net users, GIU reported even higher psychosocial burden and displayed dysfunctional coping strategies more frequently than gamers. Conclusion: The results extend previous findings on the addictive potential of Internet applications and validate the proposed distinction between specific and generalized problematic Internet use. In addition to Internet gaming disorder, future studies should also focus on other highly addictive Internet applications, that is, chatting or social networking, regarding differential correlates of problematic use.

AB The cognitive regulation of emotion is impaired in major depressive disorder and has been linked to an imbalance of pre-frontal-subcortical brain activity. Despite suggestions that this relationship represents a neurodevelopmental marker of depression, few studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation in depressed youth. We combined a 'cognitive reappraisal' paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the neural correlates of emotional regulation in a large sample of non-medicated depressed adolescents and young adults (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 64). As compared with healthy controls, young people with depression were less able to reduce negative affect during reappraisal, which corresponded to blunted modulation of amygdala activity. While in healthy individuals amygdala activation was modulated by age, no such relationship was observed in depressed individuals. Heightened activation of the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) and reduced activation of the dorsal midline cortex was also found for the depressed group. Overall, these findings suggest that brain systems that support cognitive reappraisal are functionally altered in youth depression. We argue that excessive engagement of the vmPFC in particular, may be central to understanding how the process of putting a 'positive spin' on negative emotional material may be altered in depressed youth.

AB Maltreated children are a vulnerable population, yet many of these youth follow positive developmental pathways. The primary aim was to identify social skills growth trajectories among at-risk youth to understand processes underlying resilience. Nationally representative, longitudinal data from 1,179 families investigated for child maltreatment (M-age=12.75) were obtained from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Four trajectories were identifiedstress-resistant, emergent resilience, breakdown, and unresponsive-maladaptive. Protective resources from multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and social service) predicted positive growth social skills trajectories. Resilience process and attendant positive outcomes in multiple domains of functioning were evident among the stress-resistant and emergent resilience trajectories. Results underscore the saliency of social skills development for resilient outcomes in youth.

AB Objectives: The current study examines whether psychosocial outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) vary as a function of children's rejection sensitivity (RS), defined as their disposition to be hypersensitive to cues of rejection from peers. Methods: Children ages 8-13 with a history of severe TBI (STBI, n=16), complicated mild/moderate TBI (n=35), or orthopedic injury (OI, n=49) completed measures assessing self-esteem and RS on average 3.28 years post-injury (SD=1.33, range=1.25-6.34). Parents reported on their child's emotional and behavioral functioning and social participation. Results: Regression analyses found moderation of group differences by RS for three outcomes: social participation, self-perceptions of social acceptance, and externalizing behavior problems. Conditional effects at varying levels of RS indicated that externalizing problems and social participation were significantly worse for children with STBI at high levels of RS, compared to children with OI. Social participation for the STBI group remained significantly lower than the OI group at mean levels of RS, but not at low levels of RS. At high levels of RS, self-perceptions of social acceptance were lower for children with moderate TBI compared to OI, but group differences were not significant at mean or low levels of RS. No evidence of moderation was found for global self-worth, self-perceptions of physical appearance or athletic ability, or internalizing problems. Conclusions: The findings highlight the salient nature of social outcomes in the context of varying levels of RS. These findings may have implications for the design of interventions to improve social outcomes following TBI.

AB Introduction: Attachment dysfunctions determine borderline personality disorder, which is a frequent background factor of multi-impulsivity; however, the relationship between attachment and multi-impulsive eating disorders is almost unexplored.
   Aim: To compare attachment features of multi-impulsive and classical eating disorder patients with individuals without eating disorders, and to test attachment as a predictor of multi-impulsivity.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey (148 females, mean age: 30.9 years) investigated maternal, paternal and adult attachment, depression, anxiety, eating disorder and multi-impulsive symptoms in these groups.
   Results: Altogether 41.3% of the individuals without eating disorders, 17.6% of classical and 11.8% of multi-impulsive eating disorder patients had secure attachment. Multi-impulsive patients had the most severe eating disorder symptoms (F-(2) = 17.733) and the lowest paternal care (F-(2) = 3.443). Preoccupied and fearful attachment explained 14.5% of multi-impulsive symptoms; however, with adjustment for depression only latter one remained the predictor of multi-impulsivity (t = 5.166, p< 0.01).
   Conclusion: Multi-impulsives are a distinct subgroup of eating disorder patients from the aspects of both symptoms and attachment. Handling their negative moods may hold therapeutic potentials. Longitudinal studies are required to investigate the therapeutic value of paternal care, attachment preoccupation and fearfulness.

AB Deficits in emotion regulation (ER) are an important factor in maintaining social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults. As SAD and ER problems typically develop during childhood and adolescence, and are maintained dynamically within the parent-child dyad, research on families can help to reveal the role ER plays in the early development of SAD. The current study assessed self-reported habitual ER in dyads of children with SAD (n = 31), children with mixed anxiety disorders (MAD; n = 41) and healthy control children (HC; n = 36), and their parents. Results indicate a transdiagnostic quality of ER in that, children with SAD and children with MAD similarly reported less adaptive and more maladaptive ER strategies than HC children, whereas no group differences in parental ER strategies emerged. Furthermore, children's ER strategies aggressive action, withdrawal and self-devaluation and the parental ER strategy reappraisal were associated with social anxiety symptoms. These results suggest that there may be deficits in ER which generalize across childhood anxiety disorders. Our results are discussed in relation to current theories and their implications for treatment of childhood SAD.

AB Goal formulation and tracking may support preference-based care. Little is known about the likelihood of goal formulation and tracking and associations with care satisfaction. Logistic and Poisson stepwise regressions were performed on clinical data for N = 3757 children from 32 services in the UK (M (age) = 11; SDage = 3.75; most common clinician-reported presenting problem was emotional problems = 55.6%). Regarding the likelihood of goal formulation, it was more likely for pre-schoolers, those with learning difficulties or those with both hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder. Regarding the association between goal formulation and tracking and satisfaction with care, parents of children with goals information were more likely to report complete satisfaction by scoring at the maximum of the scale. Findings of the present research suggest that goal formulation and tracking may be an important part of patient satisfaction with care. Clinicians should be encouraged to consider goal formulation and tracking when it is clinically meaningful as a means of promoting collaborative practice.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined mental health outcomes in extremely preterm children (EPT) born at 23 to 25 weeks of gestation between 1992 and 1998 at 2 Swedish tertiary care centers that offered regional and active perinatal care to all live-born EPT infants.
   METHODS; We assessed 132 (98%) of the 134 EPT survivors at 10 to 15 years of age alongside term-born controls. Behavioral and emotional problems were evaluated by using Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form and Conners' Parent and Teacher scales for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   RESULTS: Parents and teachers reported significantly more problems with internalizing behaviors as well as attention, social, and thought problems in EPT children than in controls, even when those with major neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) were excluded. Multivariate analysis of covariance of the behavioral problems reported by parents and teachers revealed no interactions, hut significant main effects emerged for group status (EPT versus control) and sex, with all effect sizes being medium to large and accounting for 8% to 14% of the variance. Compared with the controls, EPT children without NDDs had significantly increased rates of >= 90th percentile for total Conners' attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problem scores (parents: 40% vs 15%, odds ratio: 3.7, P <.001) (teachers: 24% vs 9%, odds ratio: 3.3, P =.005). The corresponding rates were higher in the total population.
   CONCLUSIONS: EPT children with or without NDDs had behavioral problems characterized by a higher risk for anxiety and attention, social, and thought problems. These findings further strengthen the proposition that a preterm behavioral phenotype is recognizable in adolescents born EPT.

AB This article presents a description and pilot evaluation of Tuned In, a brief group intervention using music listening to teach young people emotional awareness and regulation skills. The program is underpinned by a two-dimensional (valence and arousal) model of emotion and activities to enhance participants' emotional responses while listening to music. The four-session program was piloted with 51 university students aged 18-25 years (67% female). Approximately a third of the sample was above the normal range for depression, anxiety or stress symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to Tuned In or a wait-list control. Tuned In involved groups of around eight participants with two psychologist facilitators. Tuned In participants experienced greater improvement in emotional awareness and clarity and total emotion regulation than controls. Weekly ratings pooled for the entire sample (after the wait-listed participants had completed Tuned In) indicated significant improvements over time in emotional awareness, ability to name emotions, and ability to regulate emotions. Ratings of engagement were high and the overall attendance rate was 98%. Tuned In shows promise as a brief emotion regulation intervention for young adults.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of, and determine the effect of adverse childhood experiences on non-suicidal self-injury among children and adolescents referred to community and inpatient mental health settings. Data for this study were obtained from the interRAl Child and Youth Mental Health dataset. A total of 2038 children and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M = 12.49; SD = 2.88, 61.1% males) were analyzed. Binary logistic regression was fitted to identify predictors of non-suicidal self-injury as a function of adverse childhood experiences, depression, and social support while simultaneously controlling for age, gender, type of patient, legal guardianship, marital status of parents/caregivers, history of foster family placement, and mental health diagnoses. Of the 2038 children and adolescents examined, 592 (29%) of this clinical sample engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. In the multivariate logistic regression model, children and adolescents who were physically abused had 49% higher odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury and children and adolescents who were sexually abused had 60% higher odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury, when compared to their non-abused counterparts. Other predictors of non-suicidal self-injury include: older age, female gender, inpatient status, depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, and mood disorders. Children and adolescents who had some form of social support had a 26% decrease in the odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. Assessment procedures for indicators of mental health, particularly among children and adolescents with a history of adverse childhood experiences, should also take into account non-suicidal self-injury. In addition to bolstering social support networks, addressing depression and related emotion regulation skills in childhood may help prevent future non-suicidal self-injury behaviors.

AB Positive and negative trait affect and emotion regulatory strategies have received considerable attention in the literature as predictors of psychopathology. However, it remains unclear whether individuals' trait affect is associated with responses to state positive affect (positive rumination and dampening) or negative affect (ruminative brooding), or whether these affective experiences contribute to negative or positive interpersonal event generation. Among 304 late adolescents, path analyses indicated that individuals with higher trait negative affect utilized dampening and brooding rumination responses, whereas those with higher trait positive affect engaged in rumination on positive affect. Further, there were indirect relationships between trait negative affect and fewer positive and negative interpersonal events via dampening, and between trait positive affect and greater positive and negative interpersonal events via positive rumination. These findings suggest that individuals' trait negative and positive affect may be associated with increased utilization of emotion regulation strategies for managing these affects, which may contribute to the occurrence of positive and negative events in interpersonal relationships.

AB There is growing evidence that the capacity for emotion regulation is compromised in individuals with bipolar disorder. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an empirically supported treatment that specifically targets emotion dysregulation, may be an effective adjunct treatment for improving emotion regulation and residual mood symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. In this open, proof-of-concept pilot study, 37 participants engaged in a 12-week DBT group skills training program, learning mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills. Repeated measures mixed models revealed skill acquisition in the areas of mindfulness, emotion regulation and distress tolerance, as well as improved psychological well-being and decreased emotion reactivity. The results of this study support a burgeoning literature that DBT is a feasible adjunct intervention for patients with bipolar disorder.

AB Objective: To investigate associations between components of cumulative risk (CR) and physiological stress responses in African American adolescents and evaluate emotion regulation as a mediator and sex as a moderator of these associations.
   Methods: Cortisol and salivary alpha amylase (sAA) were collected in adolescents (N = 205; 55% female; 12.1 1.6 years at baseline) as part of a longitudinal study of stress and adjustment in families. CR was assessed at baseline and emotion regulation was assessed at baseline and 2 years later at Wave 3 (W3) using caregiver and adolescent reports. Cortisol and sAA responses to the social competence interview were assessed at W3.
   Results: Repeated-measures analyses of variance predicting cortisol and controlling for time of day, adolescent age, medication usage, and pubertal status revealed significant interactions of time with both psychosocial and sociodemographic risk. In both analyses, youths with higher levels of risk showed a steeper decline in cortisol than youths with lower levels of risk. In parallel analyses predicting sAA, time interacted with psychosocial but not with sociodemographic risk. There were no interactions with sex in any of the analyses. Although CR was associated with changes in emotion regulation, there was no evidence that these changes accounted for the observed CR-stress response associations.
   Conclusions: These findings illustrate the potential importance of disentangling CR and suggest that additional work is needed to help explicate why and how CR is associated with specific physiological responses to stress.

AB The current study examines emotion regulation as a novel dynamic factor of juvenile arrest as it compares with known static and dynamic risk factors. Participants included seventh graders at five urban public schools (N = 420, M-age = 13, 53% male). The predictive relationship between adolescent self-, parent-, and teacher-report of baseline adolescent emotional competence and arrest at 30-month follow-up was assessed. Stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that teacher report of emotion regulation strategies, minority status, and lifetime marijuana use were significant predictors of arrest. Findings indicate teacher report of emotion regulation competence in early adolescence may be an important consideration for prevention program development.

Most studies of emotional interactions have focused on dyadic behaviors or self-reports of emotional states but neglected the dynamical processes involved in family therapy. The main objective of this study is to quantify the dynamics of emotional expressions and their changes using the family therapy of patients with anorexia nervosa as an example. Nonlinear methods characterize the variability of the dynamics at the level of the whole therapeutic system and reciprocal influence between the participants during family therapy. Results show that the variability of the dynamics is higher at the end of the therapy than at the beginning. The reciprocal influences between therapist and each member of the family and between mother and patient decrease with the course of family therapy. Our results support the development of new interpersonal strategies of emotion regulation during family therapy. The quantification of emotional dynamics can help understanding the emotional processes underlying psychopathology and evaluating quantitatively the changes achieved by the therapeutic intervention.

AB The aim of the current study was to meta-analytically examine whether anxiety levels in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are elevated. A total of 83 articles were selected from a systematic literature search and were included in the meta-analyses. Results demonstrated that children with ASD had higher anxiety levels compared to typically developing children, and this difference increased with IQ. Youth with ASD also tended to have higher anxiety levels compared to clinically referred children, and this difference increased with age. Children with ASD had higher anxiety levels compared to youth with externalizing or developmental problems, but not when compared to youth with internalizing problems. The study findings highlight the importance of more research in order to fully understand the nature and development of anxiety in children with ASD. More specifically, the results suggest that especially high-functioning adolescents with ASD may be at risk for developing anxiety disorders. Therefore, it seems important to carefully follow and monitor children with ASD transcending to adolescence.

AB Research on cumulative risk is growing, however, little work has occurred in low- or middle-income countries, and few studies have focused on processes linking risk to outcomes. This study explored relations between components of cumulative risk and adjustment in a sample of 324 South African youth (M age = 13.11 years; SD = 1.54 years; 65% female; 56% Black/African; 14% Colored; 23% Indian; 7% White), and tested competing models of emotion dysregulation as a mediator or moderator of risk-adjustment links. Data was collected from youth and their female caregivers during home interviews. Structural equation models and regression analyses accounting for age and sex contributions revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated associations between sociodemographic risk and internalizing symptoms, externalizing problem behavior, and drug use severity, and moderated links between psychosocial risk and internalizing symptoms and externalizing problem behavior. For the mediator models, sociodemographic risk was associated with impaired emotion regulation, which in turn was linked with heightened adjustment difficulties. For the moderator models, psychosocial risk was linked with adjustment problems only when emotion dysregulation was high. These data indicate the importance of disentangling components of cumulative risk. Future research within the South African cultural context might build on these findings by adapting and testing school- or family-based prevention or intervention programs that include modules on emotion regulation.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder is associated with high risk for suicidal behavior that often develops in adolescence and young adulthood. Elucidation of involved neural systems is critical for prevention. This study of adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder with and without a history of suicide attempts combines structural, diffusion tensor, and functional MR imaging methods to investigate implicated abnormalities in the morphology and structural and functional connectivity within frontolimbic systems.
   Method: The study had 26 participants with bipolar disorder who had a prior suicide attempt (the attempter group) and 42 participants with bipolar disorder without a suicide attempt (the nonattempter group). Regional gray matter volume, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity during processing of emotional stimuli were compared between groups, and differences were explored for relationships between imaging modalities and associations with suicide-related symptoms and behaviors.
   Results: Compared with the nonattempter group, the attempter group showed significant reductions in gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; white matter integrity in the uncinate fasciculus, ventral frontal, and right cerebellum regions; and amygdala functional connectivity to the left ventral and right rostral prefrontal cortex. In exploratory analyses, among attempters, there was a significant negative correlation between right rostral prefrontal connectivity and suicidal ideation and between left ventral prefrontal connectivity and attempt lethality.
   Conclusions: Adolescent and young adult suicide attempters with bipolar disorder demonstrate less gray matter volume and decreased structural and functional connectivity in a ventral frontolimbic neural system subserving emotion regulation. Among attempters, reductions in amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity may be associated with severity of suicidal ideation and attempt lethality.

AB It is generally agreed that the human brain is responsive to environmental influences, and that the male brain may be particularly sensitive to early adversity. However, this is largely based on retrospective studies of older children and adolescents exposed to extreme environments in childhood. Less is understood about how normative variations in parent-child interactions are associated with the development of the infant brain in typical settings. To address this, we used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relationship between observational measures of mother-infant interactions and regional brain volumes in a community sample of 3-to 6-month-old infants (N = 39). In addition, we examined whether this relationship differed in male and female infants. We found that lower maternal sensitivity was correlated with smaller subcortical grey matter volumes in the whole sample, and that this was similar in both sexes. However, male infants who showed greater levels of positive communication and engagement during early interactions had smaller cerebellar volumes. These preliminary findings suggest that variations in mother-infant interaction dimensions are associated with differences in infant brain development. Although the study is cross-sectional and causation cannot be inferred, the findings reveal a dynamic interaction between brain and environment that may be important when considering interventions to optimize infant outcomes.

AB E motion regulation is a critical life skill that develops throughout childhood and adolescence. Despite this development in emotional processes, little is known about how the underlying brain systems develop with age. This study examined emotion regulation in 112 individuals (aged 6-23 years) as they viewed aversive and neutral images using a reappraisal task. On "reappraisal" trials, participants were instructed to view the images as distant, a strategy that has been previously shown to reduce negative affect. On "reactivity" trials, participants were instructed to view the images without regulating emotions to assess baseline emotional responding. During reappraisal, age predicted less negative affect, reduced amygdala responses and inverse coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala. Moreover, left ventrolateral prefrontal (vlPFC) recruitment mediated the relationship between increasing age and diminishing amygdala responses. This negative vlPFC-amygdala association was stronger for individuals with inverse coupling between the amygdala and vmPFC. These data provide evidence that vmPFC-amygdala connectivity facilitates vlPFC-related amygdala modulation across development.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are risk factors for mental and physical illness and more likely to occur for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study aimed to clarify the contribution of poverty, intellectual disability and mental health conditions to this disparity. Data on child and family characteristics, mental health conditions and ACEs were analyzed in 67,067 youth from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health. In an income-stratified sample, the association of ASD and ACEs was greater for lower income children and significantly diminished after controlling for child mental health conditions, but not intellectual disability. Findings suggest that the association of ACEs and ASD is moderated by family income and contingent on co-occurring mental health conditions.

AB Deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) are at risk for psychosocial adjustment problems, possibly due to delayed speech-language skills. This study investigated associations between a core component of spoken-language ability-speech intelligibility-and the psychosocial development of prelingually deaf CI users. Audio-transcription measures of speech intelligibility and parent reports of psychosocial behaviors were obtained for two age groups (preschool, school-age/teen). CI users in both age groups scored more poorly than typically hearing peers on speech intelligibility and several psychosocial scales. Among preschool CI users, five scales were correlated with speech intelligibility: functional communication, attention problems, atypicality, withdrawal, and adaptability. These scales and four additional scales were correlated with speech intelligibility among school-age/teen CI users: leadership, activities of daily living, anxiety, and depression. Results suggest that speech intelligibility may be an important contributing factor underlying several domains of psychosocial functioning in children and teens with CIs, particularly involving socialization, communication, and emotional adjustment.

AB Objective. Students with severe learning disabilities often show signs of anxiety, depression, and problem behaviors such as inattention and conduct problems. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in school settings constitute a promising option to alleviate these co-occurring symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the impact of an MBI on symptoms and behaviors of elementary school students with severe learning disabilities. Method. A one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The sample comprised 14 students aged 9 to 12 years with special education needs. Both student-report and teacher-report of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition were used. Results. Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a significant impact of the MBI on symptoms and behaviors such as anxiety, depression, inattention, aggression, and conduct problems. Effect sizes for all variables were considered large (partial eta(2) = .31-.61). Conclusion. These preliminary results indicate that MBIs can reduce the frequency of symptoms and problem behaviors often found in children with learning disabilities in elementary schools. Further multiple baseline experimental trials with a long-term follow-up are warranted to establish more robustly the effect of MBIs for children with learning disabilities.

DE Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Diagnosis; Adult; Media;

AB Objectives: The study aimed to identify the characteristics of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that was not diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, but only in adulthood.
   Methods: The characteristics of patients diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood were compared with those of patients diagnosed in childhood were assessed via a retrospective review of the medical records at one university hospital from 2005 to 2013. If the age at which they were confirmed as having ADHD was less than 19 years old, they were grouped as childhood-diagnosed group (CD); if they were 19 years old or more, they were grouped as adulthood-diagnosed group (AD).
   Results: The CD and AD included 50 (46.3%) and 58 (53.7%) patients, respectively. Inattention was the most common symptom in both groups. Behavioral and emotional problems were the second most frequent symptoms in the CD and AD, respectively. The intelligent quotient was significantly higher in the AD than in the CD. The most common comorbidity was depression in the CD and personality disorder in the AD. The most common reason for visiting the hospital was referral by acquaintances in the CD and media coverage in the AD.
   Conclusion: Clinicians should put ADHD on the index of suspicion when they examine adults with various psychiatric symptoms, because the diagnosis of ADHD might have been missed in childhood and the symptoms of ADHD might have changed as they grew up.

AB Studies increasingly highlight the importance of emotional competence in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms among adolescents. This finding requires an additional focus on the development of prevention programs. The Emotion Training with Students (ETS) is a school-based preventive program of depressive and anxiety symptoms, which promotes emotional awareness, emotion understanding, empathy, and emotion regulation. Carried out by teaching staff, the ETS targets the emotional competence in fifth, sixth, and seventh graders. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the training in a wait list control group design. A total sample of 543 students (46.6% girls, mean age = 11.46 years, SD =.69) from 54 classes (11 schools) participated in the study and was consecutively (nonrandomly) assigned to the ETS (n = 366) or the control group (n = 177). In each class a tandem of a teacher and a student, which has a bachelor's degree in clinical child psychology, conducted the training. All classes completed the training. The program took place between January and July 2015. Self-ratings of lack of emotional awareness, expressive reluctance, and subjective well-being as an opposite pole to depressive symptoms were measured immediately before (t1) and after the training (t2). The questionnaires proved to be sufficiently reliable. Compared with the first time of measurement, values did not change after completion of the ETS. Using group membership as a moderator variable in the relation between lack of emotional awareness and expressive reluctance at t1 and subjective well-being at t2, an effect was identified. In the ETS group, the negative impact of emotional awareness on subjective well-being was diminished. The effect of expressive reluctance found in the control group was not present in the training group. As no additional components of emotional competence were measured, it remains unclear whether these effects are attributable to a promotion in emotion understanding, empathy, or emotion regulation in the ETS group or not. Further studies may determine these mechanisms.

AB Objective Previous studies showing the association of exposure to peer (PeVA) and parental verbal abuse in childhood with structural alterations in the young adult brain suggest functional changes in adolescence. In this functional MRI study, we investigated the effects of exposure to PeVA, during elementary and middle school periods, on brain response to emotional words, in high school students.
   Methods An emotional Stroop task consisting of swear, negative, positive, and neutral words was performed during functional MRI scan for 23 subjects who were divided into low- and high exposure groups to PeVA.
   Results High-PeVA group had a higher depression score, greater left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity, and higher left VLPFC-left hippocampus connectivity in swear word conditions. The VLPFC activity and left VLPFC-left hippocampus connectivity was negatively related to the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively.
   Conclusion These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that exposure to PeVA, during childhood, is an aversive stimulus associated with meaningful functional change in emotional regulation network, showing hypersensitivity to swear words, at middle adolescence.

AB Background: Childhood chronic physical illness is associated with a greater vulnerability for emotional problems (i.e. depression and anxiety) in childhood. However, little is known about life-long effects of childhood chronic physical illness on mental health. The present study aims to systematically review evidence for associations between eight chronic physical illnesses with childhood onset (arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and epilepsy) and adult emotional problems. Methods: A database search of MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect was undertaken, and random effects meta-analyses were used to synthesise evidence from eligible studies. Results: In total, 37 studies were eligible for the systematic review (n = 45,733) and of these, 34 studies were included in the meta-analyses (n = 45,358). There were overall associations between childhood chronic physical illness and adult depression (OR = 1.31; 95% CI [1.12, 1.54]) and anxiety(OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.13, 1.92]). Separate meta-analyses for childhood asthma, type 1 diabetes and cancer were also conducted, with cancer being significantly associated with adult depression (OR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]). Conclusions: The effects of childhood chronic physical illness on the risk of emotional problems persist beyond childhood and adolescence. Mental health prevention and intervention strategies targeting children with chronic physical illnesses can have long-term benefits.

AB The current study sought to examine whether symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adolescent sexual assault (ASA), and drinking motivations (e.g., drinking to regulate emotional experiences) mediate the relationship between a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and subsequent alcohol-related problems among college women. Participants were 579 female students at a Midwestern university. Participants were recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study that investigated risk and resiliency factors related to sexual revictimization. Using a serial mediation model, the current study found that the proposed constructs mediated the relationship between CSA and subsequent alcohol-related problems via two separate paths. In one path, CSA was associated with PTSD, which in turn predicted drinking to regulate emotional experiences, which then was related to alcohol-related problems in adulthood. In the second path, CSA was related to ASA, which in turn predicted drinking to regulate emotional experiences, which then was related to alcohol-related problems in adulthood. These results suggest that individuals with a history of CSA are more likely to experience both revictimization in adolescence and PTSD symptoms in adulthood, which may lead to alcohol-related problems via drinking to regulate emotional experiences. These findings suggest the importance of incorporating skills training in adaptive emotion regulation strategies into treatment for individuals with a history of CSA and ASA.

AB This study tested the relation between cortical-subcortical functional connectivity and alcohol consumption in adolescents using an accelerated longitudinal design, as well as normative developmental patterns for these measures. Participants between ages 8 and 27 completed resting-state neuroimaging scans at two time points separated by two years (N=274 at T1, N=231 at T2). In addition, participants between ages 12 and 27 reported on recent and lifetime alcohol use (N=193 at T1, N=244 at T2). Resting-state connectivity analyses focused on amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity given prior research linking reduced coupling between these regions to alcohol use. Mixed model analyses revealed that age had a cubic relationship with alcohol use, with little to no use in childhood, steep increases in adolescence and leveling off in adulthood. No age effects were found for amygdala-OFC connectivity. Prediction analyses showed that left amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity at the first time point predicted recent and lifetime alcohol use two years later. There was no evidence for the reversed relation, suggesting that brain connectivity measures precede explorative risk-taking behavior in adolescence, possibly because decreased subcortical-frontal connectivity biases towards more explorative or risky behavior.

AB Positive emotions and good skills for emotion regulation are essential factors for healthy development. Children will only be well integrated into their social environment if they succeed in developing emotion regulation strategies. The quality of emotion regulation plays a crucial role in the development of mental disorders. Longitudinal studies demonstrate a significant connection between inadequate emotion regulation and the development of anxiety and depressive disorders on the one hand and aggressive behavior on the other hand.

AB Emotion regulation in children and adolescents is a major topic in developmental psychopathology. Prior research has focused on the development of emotion regulation - a central developmental task in childhood - and its role in children's mental health or academic success. While parental emotion regulation is recognized as a central aspect of parenting, the question of how parents regulate their own emotions, in terms of parenting, has not been sufficiently investigated to date. Parents have to cope with a wide range of emotions in daily interaction with their child. What happens if parents support their child's regulation at the expense of failing to regulate their own emotional state? This article provides an overview of the current state of research on the effects of parental emotion dysregulation on family processes of the child's emotion regulation and developmental outcome. The ISI Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched for Germanand English-language articles. We found 25 studies examining the relationship between parental emotion dysregulation and children's emotion regulation, parenting practices, emotional climate of the family or children's adjustment. Results of these studies show a direct effect of parental modeling on children's emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, parents reporting higher levels of emotion dysregulation tended toward unsupportive emotion parenting, which in turn was related to higher levels of child emotion dysregulation. Parents with emotion dysregulation also tended to apply harsh, hostile, and rejecting parenting practice. Children of parents with emotion dysregulation have no or only a few opportunities to learn adaptive emotion regulation, which in turn increases the risk for behavioral problems. The results of this review indicate a comprehensive knowledge of parental emotion dysregulation may help to understand and modify difficulties in parenting, or prevent and treat behavior and emotional problems in children and adolescents. Further research is needed to explain which emotion regulation strategies parents use in a caregiving context, and to determine the conditions under which these emotion regulation strategies are useful, in contrast to dysfunctional strategies, in parenting. For clinical practice, the findings of this review indicate that the integration of parental emotion and emotion regulation components into parent training interventions for child psychopathology, such as conduct problems, are important, given their potential impact on child and adolescent development.

AB Obesity is a significant public health concern that affects more than one-fifth of adolescents aged 12-19 in the United States. Theoretical models suggest that prolonged dietary restraint leads to binge-eating behaviors, which in turn increases individuals' risk for weight gain or obesity. Results from the literature indicate a potential role for negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed) as a mediating variable that explains the link between dietary restraint and binge-eating episodes. The current study tested short-term, prospective longitudinal associations among dietary restraint, binge eating, negative urgency, and weight gain among college students a population at increased risk for the development of overweight and obesity. We hypothesized that dietary restraint and weight gain would be mediated by negative urgency and binge eating, but only among participants with overweight and obesity. College students (N = 227) completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory, UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale, and self-reported weight and height to calculate body mass index. Results showed that the association between dietary restraint and weight gain was mediated by negative urgency and binge eating, but only among participants with overweight and obesity. Our findings indicated that negative urgency might represent a mechanism that explains why dietary restraint leads to future binge eating episodes and weight gain among college students with overweight and obesity. Results suggest that future treatment and prevention programs for overweight and obesity may benefit from incorporating strategies to improve emotion regulation as a way to reduce binge eating and to prevent additional weight gain among 'at-risk' populations.

AB Background: Extant research has demonstrated that parenting behaviour can be a significant contributor to the development of brain structure and mental health during adolescence. Nonetheless, there is limited research examining these relationships during late childhood, and particularly in the critical period of brain development occurring between 8 and 10 years of age. The effects of the family environment on the brain during late childhood may have significant implications for later functioning, and particularly mental health. The Families and Childhood Transitions Study (FACTS) is a multidisciplinary longitudinal cohort study of brain development and mental health, with two waves of data collection currently funded, occurring 18-months apart, when child participants are aged approximately 8- and 10-years old.
   Methods/design: Participants are 163 children (M age [SD] = 8.44 [0.34] years, 76 males) and their mothers (M age [SD] = 40.34 [5.43] years). Of the 163 families who consented to participate, 156 completed a video-recorded and observer-coded dyadic interaction task and 153 completed a child magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at baseline. Families were recruited from lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas to maximise rates of social disadvantage and variation in parenting behaviours. All experimental measures and tasks completed at baseline are repeated at an 18-month follow-up, excluding the observer coded family interaction tasks. The baseline assessment was completed in October 2015, and the 18-month follow up will be completed May 2017.
   Discussion: This study, by examining the neurobiological and mental health consequences of variations in parenting, has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of child development and risk processes. Recruitment of lower SES families will also allow assessment of resilience factors given the poorer outcomes often associated with this population.

AB Previous findings showed the associations between each of the Big Five personality trait and adolescents' life satisfaction were different. Some traits (extraversion and neuroticism) correlated with adolescents' life satisfaction, while other traits did not have the same associations with adolescents' life satisfaction. In order to explain why the Big Five traits differed in their associations with adolescents' life satisfaction, the present study verified the relations between each of the Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction, and demonstrated the mediating effects of coping style on the relations between these personality traits and life satisfaction in a sample of 2,357 Chinese adolescents. The results demonstrated that four of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) had significant associations with life satisfaction. Further, coping style partially mediated the relations between these four traits and life satisfaction, whereas coping style fully mediated the relation between openness to new experience and life satisfaction. The results implied a plausible explanation for why the Big Five traits differed in their associations with life satisfaction found among the previous literature: that there might be some partial or full mediation variables (such as coping style in this study) left unexamined. Theoretical and practical implications of this study on further research and educational practice are discussed.

AB Empathy is a basic socio-emotional process of human development that involves the ability to perceive, share, and understand the emotional states of others. This process is essential to successful social functioning. However, despite its significance, empathy has been difficult to define and measure, particularly when incorporating both its emotional and cognitive aspects. The purpose of this study was to develop an Empathy Questionnaire for children aged 9-12 years based on a model of social cognitive neuroscience and to analyze its construct validity and reliability. This questionnaire aimed to integrate the following aspects: emotional contagion, self-other awareness, perspective-taking, emotional regulation, and empathic action. Three studies were conducted. Study 1 evaluated the discriminative power of the items and studied the underlying structure of the instrument using exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the model obtained. Finally, the goal of Study 3 was to analyze the convergent and discriminant validity of the questionnaire and the internal consistency of its dimensions. The final version of the instrument contained 15 items that operationalized the previously listed dimensions. The results of the 3 studies indicated that the questionnaire had good validity and reliability. This study has important implications for research and clinical practice. Given its simplicity and brevity, this new self-report scale may work well as a screening method to evaluate the key psychological issues underlying numerous child behaviors that predict the success or failure of social relationships, individual quality of life, and mental well-being.

AB This study explored the potential contribution of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)-based Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) instrument to the developmental epidemiology research in Norway, by examining depressive symptoms in a school sample of adolescents (N = 846). The average PHQ-9 scores were 6.89 (SD = 5.13) for girls, and 4.57 (SD = 3.98) for boys; 8.5% of girls and 2.6% of boys were classified into the originally proposed categories indicative of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; PHQ-9 scores >= 15). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed a single-factor structure for the PHQ-9 with solid psychometric properties and high internal consistency for both genders. However, even though configural equality was observed, there was no evidence for metric or scalar equality across genders, warranting further investigation of measurement equivalence for the current Norwegian version of the PHQ-9. We observed no major associations between the PHQ-9 scores and adolescent religion or immigrant background. Further, school grade, not living together with both biological parents, and diagnosed chronic illness were differently associated with elevated depressive symptoms for boys and girls. Finally, high residential instability, perceived low SES, school dissatisfaction, lack of close friendships, history of suicide attempts and self-harm, and elevated emotional problems were all significantly and consistently associated with greater depression for both genders. Overall, the PHQ-9 appears to be a promising research tool, potentially offering clinically-relevant classification of adolescent self-reported depressive symptomatology in addition to the symptom severity captured by continuous scores. Nevertheless, further investigation concerning the observed measurement non-equivalence, as well as the comprehensive validation and comparison against the gold standard is required before the PHQ-9 is to be used for diagnostic screening in Norway.

AB Objective
   The majority of studies that have examined parental alcohol use and offspring outcomes have either focused on exposure in the antenatal period or from clinical populations. This study sought to examine proximal and distal associations between parental alcohol use and offspring conduct problems and depressive symptoms in a population birth cohort.
   Methods
   We used prospective data from a large UK based population cohort (ALSPAC) to investigate the association between parental alcohol use, measured in units, (assessed at ages 4 and 12 years) with childhood conduct trajectories, (assessed on six occasions from 4 to 13.5 years, n = 6,927), and adolescent depressive symptoms (assessed on four occasions from similar to 13 to similar to 18 years, n = 5,539). Heavy drinking was defined as >= 21 units per week in mothers and partners who drank 4+ units daily.
   Results
   We found little evidence to support a dose response association between parental alcohol use and offspring outcomes. For example, we found insufficient evidence to support an association between maternal alcohol use at age 4 years and childhood conduct problems (childhood limited: OR = 1.00, 95% CI =.99, 1.01; adolescent onset: OR = 0.99, 95% CI =.98, 1.00; and early-onset persistent: OR = 0.99, 95% CI =.98, 1.00) per 1-unit change in maternal alcohol use compared to those with low levels of conduct problems. We also found insufficient evidence to support an association between maternal alcohol use at age 4 years and adolescent depressive symptoms (intercept: b =.001, 95% CI = -.01,.01, and slope: b =.003, 95% CI = -.03,.03) per 1-unit change in maternal alcohol use. Results remained consistent across amount of alcohol consumed (i.e., number of alcohol units or heavy alcohol use), parent (maternal self-reports or maternal reports of partner's alcohol use), and timing of alcohol use (assessed at age 4 or age 12 years).
   Conclusions
   There is no support for an association between parental alcohol use during childhood and conduct and emotional problems during childhood or adolescence.

AB Objective: We applied self-determination theory to examine a model whereby perceived parental autonomy support directly and indirectly affects nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) through difficulties in emotion regulation. Method: 639 participants (53% female) with a mean age of 13.38 years (SD = 0.51) completed the How I Deal with Stress Questionnaire as a screener for NSSI, the Perceptions of Parents Scale, and the Difficulties in emotion Regulation Scale. Participants who indicated having ever hurt themselves on purpose without the intent to die (n = 116, 66% female) were classified in the NSSI lifetime group. Results: A mediation analysis with bootstrapping procedure revealed that adolescents who reported their parents as being less supportive of their need for autonomy were more likely to have engaged in NSSI. Further, this relationship was partially mediated by emotion regulation. Conclusion: Adolescents who do not perceive autonomy support from their parents, have more difficulties regulating their emotions, and may turn to NSSI as a means to cope. Clinical implications of the findings suggest involving the family, and specifically, targeting parental autonomy support may be beneficial when working with young adolescents who self-injure.
   Impact and Implications
   High school students in the present study report that a lack of parental autonomy support leads to difficulties in emotion regulation and increased risk for engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury. Considering this pathway, school psychologists may find it helpful to involve parents in interventions and to target specific parenting practices that can increase autonomy support.

AB Background: Drug abuse is a general health problem that threatens all groups in human societies. While youths are vulnerable to drug interests, the amplification of their powers along with creating all protective factors in their living environment is helpful in confronting this problem. This study has been performed with the aim of determining the factors related to the tendency towards drug abuse based on positive youth development model among high school students of Isfahan.
   Objective: This study has been performed with the aim of determining the factors related to the tendency towards drug abuse based on positive youth development model among high school students of Isfahan.
   Methods: This sectional study has been performed with the participation of 252 male and female high school second graders in Isfahan. The sampling method was a multi-stage cluster. The data-gathering tool was a researcher-made questionnaire in three parts whose validity and reliability were confirmed. The gathered data were analyzed by SPSS 18 software, Pearson correlation tests, and Regression analysis.
   Results: The mean and the standard deviation of the age of the participants were 15.82 +/- 0.66. Among the structures of the model of positive youth development, those of social competence, emotional competence, social norms, and self-efficacy were predicted 30.8% of changing the tendency towards drug abuse, and the structure of the attitude toward drugs could predict 35% of behavior changes (R-2 = 0.308, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The findings of this research shed light on the issue that the structures of social competence, emotional competence, prosocial norms, and self-efficacy along with attitude could be effective in decreasing the youths' tendency to drug abuse, which must be considered in the intervention programs with regard to the importance of the issue in the adolescents' lives.

AB The couple and family technology framework outlines how technology affects couple and family relationships. This framework has been applied to understanding the impact of technology on infidelity, contributed to our understanding of online gaming issues in couple relationships, and sexting. The purpose of this paper is to outline how to implement video gaming as a disciplinary tool for youth congruent with the couple and family technology framework. Specifically, we identify the elements of video games that can be applied as an intervention in family treatment with youth in a token economy. This proposed technique focuses on utilizing technology (and specifically video games) as a strategy to improve youth's behavior. Consistent with the couple and family technology framework, this paper outlines how accessibility, affordability, accommodation, and approximation can be used to improve behavior as well as improve parent-child relationships. Implications are included.

AB The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between negative life events and emotional-behavioral problems among adolescents from low SES; and the mediator role of self-regulation (SR) in this relationship. The study consisted of a sample of 358 7th and 8th grade-students living in Esenler neighborhood, Istanbul. Students were asked to complete a series of questionnaires, including Demographic Information Form, Life Events Checklist, Self-Regulation Inventory and Youth Self Report (YSR). Path Analysis was run to examine the associations between negative life events and internalizing-externalizing problems via self-regulation. Stability of these relationships across gender was also examined by multiple-group path analysis. Results showed that negative life events predicted both internalizing and externalizing problems directly and indirectly via self-regulation. As the number of negative life events increased, the level of self-regulation skills deteriorated, in turn, it predicted internalizing and externalizing problems. Negative life events more strongly predicted internalizing problems than externalizing problems, whereas self-regulation more strongly predicted externalizing problems than internalizing problems. Besides, the relationship between negative life events and emotional-behavioral problems, and the mediator role of self-regulation in the link between negative life events and problem behaviors did not change across gender. These findings were discussed in relation to the relevant literature focusing on the indicators and outcomes of self-regulation skills among adolescents.

AB Background: It is widely acknowledged that drug addiction is characterized by emotional dysregulation. Relatively few studies in this field, however, have focused on early adulthood. Aim: The present study aims to assess emotional functioning in young adults (aged 18-24) with drug addiction who have already been admitted to residential treatment. Methods: A group of young drug addicts admitted to residential treatment (N=41) was compared with a group of young adults without Substance Use Disorder (N=27). A series of psychological self-report questionnaires on emotional functioning, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 item, Sensation Seeking Scale VI, Emotional Quotient Inventory and Observer Alexithymia Scale were administered. Descriptive and nonparametric analyses (Pearson's chi square test, Mann-Whitney U test, and McNemar test) were performed. Results: High rates of alexithymia emerged from the administration of the observer scale, in contradiction with the self-report evaluation; also, past experiences related to sensation seeking and inadequate emotional intelligence abilities were identified as characteristics of this clinical group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that drug dependence in young adults is characterized by difficulties in emotional regulation, indicating the importance of specific and new treatment methodologies.

AB Background: The reduction of prevalence rates of Internet Use Disorder (IUD) and its effective treatment are at high priority in both public health and educational policies. School-based preventive interventions facilitate a low-threshold approach for individuals with IUD, who are typically characterized by high therapy avoidance. Moreover, indicated approaches which target adolescents at high-risk show larger effects than universal prevention programs. Simultaneously, they reduce unnecessary burden for the majority of high-school students that is not at-risk. The PROTECT group intervention for indicated prevention of IUD in school settings was developed based on these preventive strategies.
   Methods: Three-hundred and forty adolescents, aged 12-18 years, from 40 secondary schools in Germany, screened for high-risk of IUD onset, are randomly assigned to a) PROTECT preventive intervention group or b) assessment only control group. The tested intervention consists of a cognitive-behavioral 4-session brief-protocol. Follow-up assessments are at 1, 4 and 12 months after admission. Primary outcome is the 12-months incidence rate of IUD. Secondary outcomes are the reduction of IUD and comorbid symptoms as well as the promotion of problem solving, cognitive restructuring and emotion regulation skills.
   Conclusion: The indicated preventive intervention PROTECT follows the APA-guidelines for psychological prevention, i.e., it is theory- and evidence-based and addresses both risk-reduction and strength-promotion, it considers current research and epidemiology and ethical standards such as professional secrecy and is designed as a systemic intervention at the school-level. It is expected that the intervention decreases risk of IUD onset (incidence rate). (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Abundant literature documents the role of early relationships in the development of empathy. It mainly focuses on childhood, leaving the question of the processes at play in adulthood without answer. Links between empathy and, respectively, attachment to parents and attachment to the partner were examined among 26 men. The role of life events likely to impact emotion regulation necessary for empathy has also been examined. Results constantly reveal a link between empathy and security with parents, even after the experience of significant life events. This link was not observed for attachment to the partner. Results also suggest an impact of life events on the robustness of feelings of security. (C) 2016 Societe Franyaise de Psychologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent girls frequently manage problems by seeking help from friends. We examined girls' intentions of seeking help from a female friend and whether these intentions were related to their competencies (emotional competence, self-disclosure) directly and/or indirectly via specific friendship features (companionship, closeness). Participants included 222 Canadian girls (Grades 9-12) who completed an anonymous survey at school. Results showed that girls had high intentions of seeking help from a female friend and that higher self-disclosure competence was linked directly to higher intentions. Both competencies were linked indirectly to higher intentions mediated by friendship features. These findings indicate that competencies make help seeking by girls from girls likely in multiple ways and suggest how coping programs can address help seeking in girl-girl friendships.

AB In this paper, we analyze the needs of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to have a pervasive, feasible and non-stigmatizing form of assistance in their emotional self-regulation, in order to ease certain behavioral issues that undermine their mental health throughout their life. We argue the potential of recent widespread wearables, and more specifically smartwatches, to achieve this goal. Then, a smartwatch system that implements a wide range of self-regulation strategies and infers outburst patterns from physiological signals and movement is presented, along with an authoring tool for smartphones that is to be used by caregivers or family members to create and edit these strategies, in an adaptive way. We conducted an intensive experiment with two individuals with ASD who showed varied, representative behavioral responses to their emotional dysregulation. Both users were able to employ effective, customized emotional self-regulation strategies by means of the system, recovering from the majority of mild stress episodes and temper tantrums experienced in the nine days of experiment in their classroom.

AB Parenting plays a multifaceted role in adolescent development. In this article, we review studies based on an observational assessment of affective parenting behaviors collected as part of the longitudinal Orygen Adolescent Development Study and explore three ways that parenting may predict adolescent-onset depression. Specifically, we review findings that observed affective parental behaviors prospectively predict depressive symptoms and the onset of depressive disorder, predict adolescent depression indirectly via emotion regulation, and interact with brain development to predict adolescent depression. Parents who express higher frequencies of aggression or lower frequencies of positivity, or who are more likely to respond negatively to their adolescents' positive and aggressive behaviors, tend to have adolescents at greater risk for depression and suboptimal brain development. Accounting for the direct, indirect, and moderating effects of parenting may enable us to characterize more accurately the trajectories of adolescent development, which can inform prevention and early intervention efforts.

AB Background/aim: The introduction of sensory rooms within acute psychiatric settings provides a therapeutic space that promotes emotional self-regulation and reduces distress and disruptive behaviours. The current research investigated the clinical benefit of a sensory room within an adolescent psychiatric unit. It examined whether guided sensory room use can reduce distress for adolescents and identified characteristics of sensory room users. Seclusion rates 12months pre- and post-sensory room introduction were compared.
   Methods: The matched sample comprised 56 sensory room users and 56 sensory room non-users, aged 12-18years (M=15.35, SD=1.35). Sensory room users were administered a pre- and post-measure of distress. Further demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital files and results analysed.
   Results: Adolescents' distress was reduced following sensory room use. The greatest reduction of distress was predicted by a history of aggression. Female gender was associated with sensory room use, as was the presence of an anxiety disorder. There was no significant difference in seclusion rates after introducing the sensory room.
   Conclusions: Sensory rooms could provide occupational therapists with a valuable tool for reducing distress for adolescents in psychiatric units, especially for those with a history of aggression. Results suggested that female adolescents or adolescents with anxiety disorders may be particularly receptive to using the sensory room. This research provides evidence that can inform occupational therapists when tailoring therapeutic treatment strategies and guide the development of prevention and management of emotional dysregulation and aggression within adolescent psychiatric settings.

AB Complex developmental trauma impacts on neurobiological development through the creation of a frightening and unpredictable environment in which the brain develops. This early experience results in an under-developed limbic system and pre-frontal cortex. For some children and young people, their experiences of early trauma lead them into the residential Out-of-Home Care (OOHC) system. Neurodevelopmental delays that occur as a result of early trauma and abuse often become particularly pronounced during adolescence, including limited impulse control, poor emotional regulation and attachment impairments. These same delays contribute to offending behaviour and subsequent contact with the justice system. Complex developmental trauma has serious repercussions both for the individual and the society in which he or she lives. These repercussions may take the form of offending behaviour and contact with the justice system, drug and alcohol abuse, and continuing cycles of abuse and violence within families or victimisation.

AB Objectives: (1) To investigate the course of body image in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) during their first inpatient rehabilitation stay; and (2) to explore the association between demographic and injury-related variables and body image and the association between body image and psychological distress.
   Design: Longitudinal inception cohort study.
   Setting: Rehabilitation center.
   Participants: Of the 210 people admitted for their first inpatient SCI rehabilitation program (between March 2011 and April 2015), 188 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, N=150 (80%) agreed to participate.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measure: The Body Experience Questionnaire was used to measure 2 dimensions of body image: alienation and harmony.
   Results: Mean scores on the Body Experience Questionnaire alienation subscale decreased significantly during the rehabilitation program. Mean scores on the Body Experience Questionnaire harmony subscale did not increase significantly but showed a trend in the hypothesized direction. The 2 subscales showed weak correlations with demographic and injury-related variables. The 2 subscales together explained 16% and 14% of the variance of depression and anxiety, respectively, after correction for demographic and injury-related variables.
   Conclusions: During participants' first inpatient rehabilitation stay after SCI, body image progressed toward a healthier state. Body image explains part of the variance in depression and anxiety, and the entire rehabilitation team should be targeting interventions to improve body image.

AB Background Recent studies have indicated an increased risk of autism, behavioural and emotional problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in individuals with Down syndrome.
   Method In a large-scale survey-based study, we examined the rates of these problems and their relationship to age and gender, in a sample of 674 individuals (4-18 years) with Down syndrome. The relationship with IQ level was also explored in a sub-sample (n = 175). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Social Communication Questionnaire were used to assess behavioural and emotional problems and autism traits.
   Results On the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, peer problems were the most frequently reported difficulty (48%> cut-off), followed by hyperactivity/inattention (34%>cut-off). On the Social Communication Questionnaire, 37% scored at or above cut-off (>= 15) for autism spectrum disorder; 17% were at or above the suggested cut-off (>= 22) for autism. Little association between age and behavioural or emotional problems or with severity of autistic symptomatology was found. However, peer problems were more common in adolescents than in junior school children (P<0.001); Hyperactivity/inattention was less prevalent among adolescents (P<0.001).
   Conclusions High rates of autistic features, emotional and behavioural problems are documented. These problems are related to age, gender and degree of intellectual disability.

AB Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is prevalent among young adults and associated with negative medical and psychological consequences, necessitating its treatment. However, few treatments have been developed to treat NSSI specifically, or to treat the behavior among individuals without borderline personality disorder. The purpose of this study was to investigate the Treatment for Self-Injurious Behaviors (T-SIB), a brief, behavioral intervention specifically developed to treat NSSI among young adults, in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Method: Young adults (N = 33; age: M = 22.36 years, SD = 3.40) meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the treatment (T-SIB; n = 15) or treatment as usual (n = 18) condition. The sample was 93.9% female, 42.4% Caucasian, and 30.3% Hispanic/Latino. Results: Feasibility and acceptability of the study and intervention were supported, and medium effects were found for decreased NSSI frequency in the T-SIB group using intent-to-treat analyses. Conclusion: Results of this study support the further evaluation of T-SIB in a larger RCT.
   What is the public health significance of this article?
   A novel intervention for nonsuicidal self-injury was compared to treatment as usual in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The feasibility and acceptability of the treatment and study design were supported. Medium effect sizes for decreased nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors among the Treatment for Self-Injurious Behaviors condition add support for a larger RCT to further evaluate the intervention.

AB Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit functional impairment even those having less visible symptoms. Therefore, it is of great clinical importance to identify ADHD symptoms among adolescents in the community. Furthermore, little is known regarding the role of internalizing symptoms in their quality of life. Thus, this study aimed to screen ADHD in a sample of high school students using the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale (ASRS) and to investigate the impact of internalizing symptoms on their well-being. In the first year, adolescents aged 15-17 years old from a senior high school (N = 1947) completed the Adult ADHD Self-rating Scale (ASRS), Wender Utah Rating Scale, Impulsiveness Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory and Beck's Anxiety Inventory. In the second year, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF was applied for the measurement of their psychosocial outcomes. Results showed that adolescents with higher ASRS scores manifested more severe concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. ADHD symptoms among these adolescents were significantly associated with poorer quality of life 1 year later (p < 0.001). And both depressive and anxiety symptoms were mediators in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and quality of life. The finding of this study supports that the concurrent internalizing symptoms may underlie the negative relations between ADHD symptoms and quality of life in adolescents in the community. The application of ASRS in adolescents may help clinicians in early intervention for their ADHD problems as well as emotional symptoms.

AB The present study examined measurement invariance and convergent validity of a novel vignette-based measure of emotion-specific self-regulation that simultaneously assesses attributional bias, emotion-regulation, and self-efficacy beliefs about emotion regulation. Participants included 541 youth-mother dyads from three countries (Italy, the United States, and Colombia) and six ethnic/cultural groups. Participants were 12.62 years old (SD = 0.69). In response to vignettes involving ambiguous peer interactions, children reported their hostile/depressive attribution bias, self-efficacy beliefs about anger and sadness regulation, and anger/sadness regulation strategies (i.e., dysregulated expression and rumination). Across the six cultural groups, anger and sadness self-regulation subscales had full metric and partial scalar invariance for a one-factor model, with some exceptions. We found support for both a four- and three-factor oblique model (dysregulated expression and rumination loaded on a second-order factor) for both anger and sadness. Anger subscales were related to externalizing problems, while sadness subscales were related to internalizing symptoms.

AB Dysregulated behaviors (DBs), such as self-harm or binge eating, are related to various negative outcomes. In this study, we investigate how classes of individuals vary in their level of DBs. We compare the classes with regards to their experiences regarding negative mental images and emotion regulation strategies. A web-based survey assessed eleven DBs in a sample of N=912 adults. A latent class analysis (LCA) identified a class of 168 adults that were prone to various DBs ("high(DBs)"). Another class (n = 46) reported drunkenness and risks for drug use and overeating ("high(Intake)"). The majority of individuals (n = 698) featured a low rate of DBs ("low(DBs)"). The high(DBs) exhibited the highest scores in distressing imagery and maladaptive emotion regulation. The high(Intake) had a low overall profile; however, it displayed increased imagery nowness. Class differences were leveled by depressive symptoms. The findings help extend the knowledge on DBs and their correlates. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB This review of the literature examines the problem of suicide and bullying from a developmental perspective with a focus on the unique characteristics of adolescence that may contribute to the bullying-suicide link. Adolescence is a time of peak physical health, yet can be a period of risky behavior and heightened emotionality. In this literature review, it is argued that a number of developmental factors leave adolescents especially vulnerable to suicidal behavior following exposure to bullying. This review highlights the importance of developmental factors in understanding the bullying-suicide link during adolescence. Adolescence, with an increase in emotionality, risk-taking, and an increased focus on peer relationships, is an at-risk period for the development of suicidality following exposure to bullying. Also highlighted are gender differences, special challenges facing LGBTQ adolescents, and recommendations for intervention and prevention.

AB This study investigated the relationship between self-reported time in bed and sleep quality in association with self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a sample of 285 elementary school students (52 % female) recruited from a rural Midwestern elementary school. Path models were used to estimate proposed associations, controlling for grade level and gender. Curvilinear associations were found between time in bed and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and irritability. Marginal curvilinear trends were found between time in bed and emotion dysregulation, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression. Sleep quality was negatively associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, irritability, reactive aggression, and delinquency engagement. Gender and grade differences were found across models. Findings suggest that examining self-reported time in bed (both linear and quadratic) and sleep quality is important for understanding internalizing and externalizing symptoms associated with sleep in school-age youth. Incorporating self-reported sleep assessments into clinical practice and school-based evaluations may have implications for a child's adjustment.

AB Executive functions are a collection of cognitive abilities necessary for behavioural control and regulation, and are important for school success. Executive deficits are common across acquired and developmental disorders in childhood and beyond. This review aims to summarize how studies using event-related potential (ERP) can provide insight into mechanisms underpinning how executive functions develop in children from preschool to adolescence. We specifically focus on ERP components that are considered to be well-established markers of executive functioning, including the ability to resist distraction (inhibition, N200), hold scenes in mind (visuospatial working memory, contralateral delay activity), attend to specific stimuli (information processing, P300), follow rules (response monitoring, error-related negativity [ERN], and error-related positivity [Pe]), and adjust to feedback (outcome monitoring, feedback-related negativity). All of these components show developmental changes from preschool to adolescence, in line with behavioural and neuroimaging findings. These ERP markers also show altered developmental trajectories in the context of atypical executive functions. As an example, deficits in executive function are prominently implicated in attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Therefore, this review highlights ERP studies that have investigated the above ERP components in this population. Overall, ERPs provide a useful marker for the development and dysfunction of executive skills, and provide insight into their neurophysiological basis.

AB Maternal depression in the peri-natal period is associated with increased risk for young adult depression in offspring. This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n=13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies.

TI Eating Pathology in adolescents: Effects of Attachment and Emotion

DE eating pathology; emotion regulation; attachment; adolescence
AB The aim of the present work is to explore associations between eating pathology (EP), emotion regulation (ER) and attachment in a non-clinical adolescent sample; and whether insecure attachment and difficulties in emotion regulation explain EP. A sample of 485 adolescents (240 females) aged 12-18, completed the EDI-2, DERS and EPERIC questionnaires. Sex differences were analyzed. Sex differences in EP level occur since the age of 14-15. Associations with high effect sizes between these three constructs were found. It is possible to predict EP from difficulties in emotion regulation and insecure attachment features (R-2 Nagelkerke=.305 in females, and .236 in males). EP shows strong association with fear of rejection or abandonment in females and with preference for independence in males. Conclusions. There are sex differences on the associations between these three constructs considered in the present study and in EP explanation too. This has implications in prevention.

AB Aim: The use of computerized mental health programs with vulnerable youth, such as early school leavers, remains relatively unstudied. This pilot study examined the feasibility of delivering a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) gaming intervention (SPARX-R) for young people (age 15-20 years) who have left school early and are attending Youthreach, an alternative education (AE) program in Ireland.
   Method: Students (n = 146) from twenty-one Youthreach Centers were randomized to SPARX-R and no-intervention control. All students within the group were included in the study whether or not they were exhibiting heightened levels of depression. Program impact was examined on both negative and positive indicators of mental health, including depression (primary outcome), generalized anxiety, general mental wellbeing, coping and emotion regulation. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-intervention (7 weeks). Participants that provided data at post-assessment (n = 66) were included in the analysis.
   Results: The participants completed on average 5.3 modules of SPARX-R with 30% (n = 9) completing the entire program. A significant improvement in emotion regulation strategies was detected, with expressive suppression decreasing significantly in the SPARX-R group in comparison to the control (-2.97, 95% CI -5.48 to -0.46, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that SPARX-R has a positive impact on emotion regulation. The lack of significant findings on other outcome measures may be attributed to inadequate sample size, and therefore, further research with larger samples are required to establish the effectiveness of the program in reducing depression and anxiety and improving psychological wellbeing among young people attending AE.

AB This qualitative study utilized a narrative approach to explore the process of self regulation in adolescents and to examine the functions of various relational genres on psychological state and context expressions in this process. Nineteen participants, who live in high-risk settings were recruited from a youth development and life skills program located at an urban public high school in the United States. The goal of this project is to craft a process method for research and practice on adolescents' self-regulation while providing evidence for self-regulation being a complex process. This research uses an exploratory study design with a narrative approach, utilizing text message based activities in the method. Findings from the plot analysis suggest that for adolescents, the process of self-regulation begins as highly emotional and then becomes a more emotionally and cognitively balanced process. In addition, adolescents utilize different strategies to resolve conflict situations across different contexts and relational genres.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention models may not address psychological complexities among adolescents with mental illnesses. This study examined contextual factors related to HIV/STI risk among heterosexually active Black adolescents with mental illnesses to inform the development of targeted HIV/STI prevention strategies. Black adolescent males and females (aged 14-17) were recruited from outpatient mental health programs in Philadelphia, PA to complete a computer-assisted personalized interview on sociodemographics, sexual behaviors, and emotion regulation (N = 53). Two sample t-tests, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests and regression modeling were used to examine differences in the study measures by gender and relationship status. Reports of sexual partner concurrency were high-both while already in a sexual relationship (67.3%) and multiple sexual partners in the same day (42.3%). Boys reported significantly more risk behaviors than girls. Sadness dysregulation predicted currently being in a relationship, older age at first oral sex, fewer vaginal sexual partners and fewer unprotected oral sexual encounters. Coping difficulties predicted a greater number of vaginal and oral sexual partners, and a lower age at first vaginal sex. Increasing depression severity was related to older age at first vaginal sex, fewer vaginal sexual partners and fewer unprotected oral sexual encounters in the past 3 months. This formative work suggests that coping mechanisms should be addressed in HIV/STI prevention research through the inclusion of activities targeted toward emotion regulation and decreasing sexual risk behaviors. Psycho-education and skills building may mitigate the psychopathology that contributes to HIV/STI risk in the target demographic.

AB Purpose: The purposes of this study were to test the predictions that lower self-esteem and higher shyness in individuals with a history of language impairment (LI) would continue from adolescence into early adulthood and that those with LI would have lower social self-efficacy in early adulthood.
   Method: Participants were young people with a history of LI and a comparison group of age-matched peers. Both groups were tested at ages 17 and 24 years. Participants completed measures of language ability, nonverbal IQ, shyness, global self-esteem, and (at age 24 years only) social self-efficacy.
   Results: Young adults with LI scored lower than age-matched peers on self-esteem, higher on shyness, and lower on social self-efficacy (medium to large effect sizes). In line with expectations, in the group with LI, language ability in adolescence predicted shyness in young adulthood, which, in turn, was negatively associated with self-esteem. There was also a direct association between language ability in adolescence and self-esteem in young adulthood.
   Conclusions: Young people with a history of LI are likely to be entering adulthood less socially confident than their peers. Interventions may be desirable for young adults with LI, and the present findings indicate social self-efficacy as a key area of social confidence that calls for practitioners' attention.

AB Approximately 80% of all arrested youth are diverted from detention and supervised in the community through probation, specialty courts and other community-based diversion efforts. Justice-involved youth have greater psychiatric impairment, substance use and sexual risk behaviors than their non-justice-involved peers. Family based interventions to address mental health, substance use and recidivism have been successful in improving these youth outcomes; but the lack of integration of HIV/STI prevention is notable given the co-occurrence of substance use, delinquency and sexual risk-taldng behaviors among justice-involved youth. Moreover, emotion dys-regulation may be an important and understudied underlying construct of these co-occurring risk behaviors for justice-involved youth. Study participants were 47 caregiver-youth dyads enrolled in a juvenile drug court program. As part of a pilot efficacy trial, dyads were randomized to a 5-session family-based integrated substance use and HIV/STI prevention intervention that relied on affect management strategies for risk reduction or an adolescent-only psychoeducation condition matched for time and attention. Data collected at baseline and 3 months post-intervention suggest that a family-based integrated affect management substance use and HIV prevention pilot intervention may lead to justice-involved youths' enhanced motivation to change their marijuana use, decreased marijuana use and decreased risky sexual behavior over time. Future research is required to replicate these pilot trial findings and should also examine family-level mediators and moderators of treatment response, particularly with respect to HIV prevention efforts for these youth.

AB Objective: Adolescents in alternative schools for behavioral and emotional problems have an earlier sexual onset and higher rates of sexual risk than their peers. They also often have difficulty managing strong emotions, which can impair sexual decision making. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention programs for these adolescents may be most effective if skills for coping with strong emotions during sexual situations are included.
   Method: This article reports the 6-month outcomes of a three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing an HIV prevention intervention with affect management (AM) to a standard, skills-based HIV prevention intervention (SB), and a general health promotion intervention (HP). HP was similar to a general health class, and SB was based on previous effective HIV prevention programs used with community adolescents, whereas AM included affect management skills in addition to effective HIV prevention skills. Youth (N = 377) in two US cities were 13 to 19 years of age and attending alternative schools for behavioral and emotional problems.
   Results: Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for the baseline scores, age, and gender, found that adolescents in AM were significantly less likely to report being sexually active at follow-up (80% versus 91%, adjusted odds ratio = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.08-0.96) and more consistently using condoms than those in HP at follow-up (62%, versus 39%, adjusted odds ratio = 3.42, CI = 1.10-10.63).
   Conclusion: Affect management techniques tested in this project, focused on sexual situations, are similar to those that are used in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and in clinical practice. These data suggest that these techniques might decrease risk behaviors and improve the health of adolescents with emotional/behavioral problems.

AB Although behavioral inhibition (BI) is clearly identified as a temperamental risk factor for childhood anxiety psychopathology, much less is known about whether the strength of this association may vary as a function of parasympathetic nervous system regulation in children with anxiety disorders. To build upon extant research in this area, the present study examined whether respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can explicate the conditions in which BI is linked to increased symptom severity among anxiety disordered children (N = 44; M = 9.61 years, SD = 1.63; 52% female and African American, respectively). We examined RSA responding both during a basal period and during a stressor ("challenge" RSA): interacting with a "mystery guest" who was wearing a mask. As hypothesized, the interaction between BI and both basal and challenge RSA was significantly related to anxiety disorder symptom severity, even after controlling for depressive symptoms. The form of the interaction indicated that highest levels of anxiety disorder symptoms were found among children with high levels of BI and low basal and challenge RSA, respectively. These data provide novel empirical evidence of a clinically-relevant interplay between RSA and BI in relation to anxiety disorder symptom severity among clinical youth. Future work is needed to expand on the specific mechanisms that may be responsible e for the interplay between temperamental and psychobiological risks for childhood anxiety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The adverse impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the developing mind in adolescence can extend well into adulthood. The developmental malleability of cognitive control capacity in this age group, however, may hold particular promise for cognitive training interventions. The present study investigated the effects of affective working memory (aWMT) compared to placebo-training on cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents with PTSD. 30 treatment-seeking adolescents trained for 20 days on either an affective dual n-back task (aWMT; n = 15) or a feature match task (placebo; n = 15). The aWMT group showed greater pre-topost-training increases in cognitive control as measured by the GoNogo task as well as improvements in symptoms of PTSD and increased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. These preliminary findings are promising given the potential for free and easy dissemination of the aWMT in schools and online. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A significant proportion of youth engage in health risk behaviors, which are of concern, as they are associated with adverse health consequences across development. Two factors associated with engagement in such behaviors are emotion dysregulation and impulsivity. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is an effective intervention that enhances emotion regulation skills to reduce problem behaviors among adolescent populations; however, limited research has been conducted implementing the program within school settings. The current study was a 9-week DBT skills group conducted among 80 middle school youth, with pre-posttest data among 53 students. Findings indicated feasibility to implement the program in schools and preliminary evidence of efficacy in decreasing youth's likelihood to engage in risky, particularly among youth high on an emotion-based impulsivity trait. Brief DBT skills group may be an effective program to be utilized by school nurses and health-care teams to reduce health risk behaviors among school-aged youth.

AB Objective: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) exposed to family violence are in need of professional healthcare. However, only one-third of them seek professional help.
   Methods: This study investigates healthcare needs of twelve AYA exposed to family violence. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews using purposive sampling to reach diversity. Open thematic coding was used to identify the most important themes.
   Results: Participants experienced emotional problems, distrusted others and felt unsafe as an important consequence of their exposure to family violence. All participants expressed a need for help, but as help involved informing others, they considered it unsafe. Trust, safety and control regarding healthcare interventions emerged as vital needs. The anonymity of the Internet was considered as offering safeguards in seeking and receiving help.
   Conclusion: Trust, safety and control regarding healthcare interventions emerged as vital needs for AYA exposed to family violence. The great importance of being in control of healthcare interventions has not been reported earlier. A personal bond can lower the need for control.
   Practice implications: To comply with the three basic needs, healthcare providers should grant AYA as much control as possible while still monitoring patient safety. The Internet can be an important resource for offering low-threshold professional and peer support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectivesWomen victims of IPV are more likely insecurely attached and have experienced childhood abuse, which according to the attachment theory is deeply related to disorganized attachment. This case-control study was performed with the aim to compare the attachment status and the defensive processing patterns of women victims of IPV (cases) with women with no experiences of IPV (controls).
   MethodsCases were 16 women with an age range from 26years to 51years. The control group included 16 women with an age range from 26years to 59years. Women's states of mind in regard to attachment were evaluated with the Adult Attachment Projective PictureSystem, which allows classifying attachment status and defensive mechanisms.
   ResultsCompared with control group, most IPV women resulted having an unresolved attachment status and describing characters less capable to draw upon internal resources, that is, internalized secure base, and less capable to act than controls. Women victims of IPV used significantly more words referring danger and failed protection than controls.
   ConclusionsThe results evidenced the strong effectiveness of the AAP on analysing the psychological attitudes of women victims of IPV. The dramatic events lived by the women victims of IPV are so dominant in their minds that they invade their stories. This could represent a clue of emotional dysregulation.
   Practitioner points
   The use of AAP improves the understanding of the agency of self and of the specific levels of trauma experienced by IPV victims, on clarifying their frightening/frightened dynamic, typical of the disorganized attachment relationship, which undermines their activity of mentalization. The therapist will assume the stance of a secure base and then both promoting exploration and contrasting impotence, humiliation, and subordination that IPV women have experienced. This therapeutic interpersonal context will be functional to reach two different but related therapeutic goals: (1) to facilitate the rebuilding of agency (through an activation of subject to explore concrete strategies for exiting from IPV), (2) to explore attachment-related segregated systems from awareness, and to integrate them in memory.

AB This study aimed to examine relations between parent and child attachment representations and neuropsychological functions at age 8, as well as relations between these constructs and ADHD symptoms over a 10-year period. A community-based sample of 105 children (52 boys) participated. Measures of attachment representations and a range of neuropsychological functions were collected at age 8. Parents rated emotion dysregulation and ADHD symptoms at age 8 and ADHD symptoms again at age 18. Significant, although modest, relations were found between disorganized attachment and some aspects of neuropsychological functioning in childhood. When studying outcomes in late adolescence and controlling for early ADHD symptom levels, spatial working memory and disorganized attachment remained significant in relation to both ADHD symptom domains, and one measure of inhibition remained significant for hyperactivity/impulsivity. When examining independent effects, spatial working memory and disorganized attachment were related to inattention, whereas spatial working memory and dysregulation of happiness/exuberance were related to hyperactivity/impulsivity. Our findings showing that disorganized attachment is longitudinally related to ADHD symptoms over and above the influence of both neuropsychological functioning and early ADHD symptom levels highlights the importance of including measures of attachment representations when trying to understand the development of ADHD symptoms. If replicated in more "at-risk" samples, these findings could also suggest that parent-child attachment should be taken into consideration when children are referred for assessment and treatment of ADHD.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a yoga-based social-emotional wellness promotion program, Transformative Life Skills (TLS), on indicators of adolescent emotional distress, prosocial behavior, and school functioning. Participants included 159 students attending an inner-city school district who were randomly assigned to treatment or business-as-usual comparison conditions. Results suggested that students who participated in the TLS program demonstrated significant reductions on unexcused absences, detentions, and increases in school engagement. Significant concurrent improvements in primary engagement stress-coping strategies and secondary engagement stress-coping strategies were noted as well. Specifically, significant increases in student emotion regulation, positive thinking, and cognitive restructuring in response to stress were found. No effects were found for measures of somatization, suspensions, academic grades, or general affect. Student report of treatment acceptability indicated that the intervention was generally well-received and strategies were perceived as socially valid by most participants. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury is a complex behaviour, disturbingly prevalent, difficult to treat and with possible adverse outcomes in the long term. Previous research has shown individuals most commonly self-injure to cope with overwhelming negative emotions. Mindfulness has been shown to be associated with emotion regulation, and mindfulness-based interventions have shown effectiveness in a wide range of psychological disorders. This research explored whether lack of mindfulness or problems in mindfulness are involved in self-injury. A non-clinical sample of 263 participants (17-65 years) completed an online survey measuring self-injurious behaviours and mindfulness. Differences in levels of mindfulness between individuals with and without a history of self-injury were investigated. Analysis of variance indicated mindfulness (overall and in terms of specific facets "act with awareness", "non-judge" and "non-react") was significantly lower in individuals with a history of self-injury compared to those without. Pairwise comparisons revealed current self-injurers reported significantly lower mindfulness than past self-injurers and non-self-injurers, with medium effect sizes of d = 0.51 and d = 0.77, respectively. In logistic regression, low mindfulness significantly predicted self-injury (B = 0.04, p < .001). These findings have clinical implications, suggesting that mindfulness-based interventions may assist individuals to give up self-injurious behaviours and may be an important part of prevention strategies.

AB The present study examines the moderating role of unconditional self acceptance and self esteem in relation to frustration intolerance beliefs and psychological distress. Participants were one hundred and fifty student (aged 18-25) studying at three universities (COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, University of Management Sciences, and University of Central Punjab) of Lahore, Pakistan. They completed a demographic information sheet, the Frustration Discomfort Scale (Harrington in Clin Psychol Psychother 12:374-387, 2005a), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg in Society and the adolescent self image. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1965), the Unconditional Self Acceptance Questionnaire (Chamberlain and Haaga in J Ration Emotive Cogn Behav Ther 19:163-176, 2001a), and the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg in Manual of the General Health Questionnaire. NFERNelson, Great Britain, 1972). The results demonstrated the moderating effects of unconditional self acceptance and self esteem in the relationship between frustration intolerance beliefs (entitlement, achievement, emotional intolerance, and discomfort intolerance) and psychological distress . The present findings highlight the importance unconditional self acceptance that reduces the emotional problems of students hindering their educational and personal growth.

AB Associations have been found among sexting, attachment insecurity, emotional dysregulation, and sexual and risky sexual behavior in young adults. In a sample of 92 young adult women in romantic relationships, this study aimed to examine whether emotional regulation might constitute an indirect pathway linking attachment and sexting, and the potential implications for engaging in condomless sex. Findings revealed that in young adult women in romantic relationships, attachment anxiety was associated with sexting through difficulty controlling impulses during moments of emotional distress. Also, sexting directly predicted condomless sex. Attachment avoidance and anxiety were both associated with sexting in the bivariate correlations. Findings highlight the role of digital technology in understanding how people's negotiation of needs for attachment and emotional regulation might lead to risky sexual behavior. Interventions targeting the interplay of attachment, emotional regulation and technology use may positively impact relational and behavioral health outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: There is a need to prevent anxiety and depression in young people and mindfulness contains important emotion regulation strategies. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a mindfulness-based therapy, has yet to be evaluated as a prevention program, but has demonstrated an ability to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult and adolescent populations. This study examines the feasibility of using an ACT-based prevention program in a sample of year 10 (aged 14-16 years) high school students from Sydney, Australia.
   Methods: Participants were allocated to either their usual classes or to the ACT-based intervention. Participants were followed for a period of 5 months post-intervention and completed the Flourishing Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and a program evaluation questionnaire. Analyses were completed using intention-to-treat mixed models for repeated measures.
   Results: The results indicated that the intervention was acceptable to students and feasible to administer in a school setting. There were no statistically significant differences between the conditions, likely due to the small sample size (N = 48). However, between-group effect sizes demonstrated small to large differences for baseline to post-intervention mean scores and medium to large differences for baseline to follow-up mean scores, all favouring the ACT-based condition.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that an ACT-based school program has potential as a universal prevention program and merits further investigation in a larger trial.

AB Using a normative sample of 1,057 children studied across 4 waves over 6 years with multiple informants, we investigated transactional relations for sleep problems, anxious-depressed symptoms, and social functioning from preschool to preadolescence, assessing cumulative effects on children's emotional and social adjustment. To examine sex differences in the developmental processes, we conducted separate analyses for boys and girls. For both boys and girls, longitudinal cross-lagged panel analyses showed that preschool sleep problems directly predicted anxious-depressed symptoms 2 years later; indirect effects continued into preadolescence. For girls, early and later sleep problems directly or indirectly predicted a wide variety of preadolescent emotional and social adjustment domains (e.g., depressive symptoms, school competence, emotion regulation, risk-taking behaviors). For boys, social competence played a more important role than sleep problems in predicting preadolescent adjustment. Among the first set of findings that demonstrate longitudinal relations between sleep problems and social functioning in middle childhood and preadolescence, these results support Dahl's and Walker's neurological models of sleep and emotional functioning. We discuss these findings in light of relations between sleep and affect during pre-pubertal development and discuss differential findings for boys and girls.

AB Despite emerging evidence suggesting a biological basis to our social tiles, our understanding of the neural processes which link two minds is unknown. We implemented a novel approach, which included connectome similarity analysis using resting state intrinsic networks of parent-child dyads as well as daily diaries measured across 14 days. Intrinsic resting-state networks for both parents and their adolescent child were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Results indicate that parents and children who had more similar RSN connectome also had more similar day-to-day emotional synchrony. Furthermore, dyadic RSN connectome similarity was associated with children's emotional competence, suggesting that being neurally in-tune with their parents confers emotional benefits. We provide the first evidence that dyadic RSN similarity is associated with emotional synchrony in what is often our first and most essential social bond, the parent-child relationship.

AB Attachment insecurity is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, but few studies have examined the effects of gene-environment interactions. In the context of environmental stress, a functional variant in the glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone FKBP5 gene has been repeatedly shown to increase risk for psychiatric illness, including depression. We expand on prior work by exploring cross-sectional attachment by gene effects on both attachment insecurity and downstream physiological and behavioral measures in a diverse community sample of school-aged children (N=99, 49% girls, M-age =10.29 years, 66.6% non-White) and their mothers. Specifically, we examined moderating effects of FKBP5 rs3800373 genotype on the links between parenting insensitivity (overcontrol) and child attachment. Further, we assessed whether FKBP5 moderates the links between maternal and child attachment and children's emotion regulation self-report, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in response to a standardized laboratory stressor, and depressive symptoms. Higher levels of overcontrol predicted lower child attachment security only in FKBP5 minor allele carriers. Among children with two minor alleles (CC), attachment security was negatively associated with emotion suppression, rumination, depressive symptoms, and RSA reactivity; similarly, for these children, maternal attachment anxiety was positively associated with depressive symptoms. The findings can be conceptualized in a differential susceptibility framework, where the FKBP5 minor allele confers either risk or resilience, depending on the parenting environment.

AB Sport has the potential to foster the development of life skills, such as initiative, teamwork, emotion regulation, and goal setting, that transcend the fields and courts on which youth participate (Danish, Forneris, Hodge, & Heke, 2004). However, it is often acknowledged that this growth does not occur on its own. One factor that plays a central role in shaping positive sport experiences is the coach (Hellison & Cutforth, 1997). The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature on coaching strategies considered best practices for life skills development as well as to provide illustrative examples of many of these practices garnered from a case study of a model coach and the strategies he used in his high school tennis program. The paper concludes with additional practical considerations and recommendations for practitioners, coach educators, and scholars who continue to add to the body of knowledge regarding a coach's role in positive youth development.

AB Intervention in psychological flexibility as emotional competence in adolescents: a case series. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological flexibility program in adolescents. An A-B-A-type within-subject replication design was used. Twenty-five students (53.8% was women) from a compulsory secondary education centre were enrolled from 129 adolescents aged 13-15 years old (M = 13; SD =.76). The primary dependent variables analysed in the study are emotional intelligence, measured with Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion, evaluated with Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y); and acceptance levels, evaluated with Willingness & Action Measure for Children and Adolescents (WAM-C/A). Impulsivity, measured with Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11-A). Treatment consisted of 9 weekly one-hour sessions for an intervention program based on three protocols in Contextual Therapies (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy more specifically). At the beginning, 50% of the participants showed experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion patterns. Results showed significant decrease in attention, perceived emotional intelligence, and experiential avoidance Therefore, this intervention program has improved cognitive defusion and experiential avoidance.

TI Anger regulation and school-related somatic complaints in children with

AB Somatic complaints are a widespread problem among children, and are considered as an important precursor to internalizing problems. Particularly, children with special educational needs are at risk of suffering from school related somatic complaints. However, there is a lack of research on the role of anger regulation for the development of somatic complaints. Moreover, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. We assumed that the effect of anger regulation on somatic complaints is mediated by school-related affect, and that the effect of anger regulation on school-related affect is moderated by intelligence. A representative German sample of 467 elementary school children with special educational needs participated in the study. We collected longitudinal data at two measurement occasions (Grade 3 and Grade 4). Children were asked about their use of adaptive anger regulation strategies, their school-related affect, and their somatic complaints in school, and they completed an intelligence test at the first measurement point. Somatic complaints again were assessed one year later. As expected, adaptive anger regulation strategies were not related directly to somatic complaints, but were positively related to school-related affect, which, in turn, predicted decreased somatic complaints over and above initial levels. Also, as expected, children higher in intelligence benefitted more from using adaptive anger regulation strategies in terms of school-related affect. Our findings support the assumption that adaptive anger regulation strategies and intelligence may be important protective factors and potential starting points in the prevention of somatic complaints in children with special educational needs.

AB Objective: Among older children and adolescents, keeping secrets from parents is consistently associated with lower levels of psychological well-being. Further, concealing one's thoughts and emotions has been associated with poor physical health outcomes in adults. However, it remains an open question whether secret-keeping is associated with poorer health and health-related behaviors (such as sleep) among youth and, if those hypothesized links exist, what the psychological mechanisms might be. We investigated the associations among youth secrecy towards parents, daily asthma symptoms and daily sleep behaviors in a sample of low-income youth with asthma aged 10-17 and tested negative affect as a possible mediator of these associations.
   Methods: One hundred and seventy two youths reported the extent to which they kept secrets towards parents over a period of four days. Asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings, sleep onset latency, and subjective sleep quality were assessed with daily diaries completed by youths.
   Results: More frequent secret-keeping was associated with more severe asthma symptoms, lower ratings of sleep quality and greater number of nighttime awakenings. Secrecy was also associated with increased negative affect, which accounted for the associations between secrecy and number of awakenings and daytime asthma symptoms. These findings remained significant after controlling for youth age and other relevant demographic factors.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that secrecy towards parents can have consequential health outcomes for youth with asthma and point to the importance of investigating affective processes as mediators of the influence of secret-keeping on youth health.

AB Social victimization refers to being targeted by behaviors intended to harm one's social status or relationships (Underwood, 2003), including malicious gossip, friendship manipulation, and social exclusion (both verbal and non-verbal). The current study examined social victimization experiences longitudinally from middle childhood through late adolescence. Participants (N5273, 139 females) reported on their social victimization experiences in grades 4-11 (ages 9 to 16 years). Using mixture (group-based) modeling, four social victimization trajectories were identified: low, medium decreasing, medium increasing, and elevated. High parent-child relationship quality decreased the odds of being in the elevated group compared to the low group; however, parent-child relationship quality was no longer a significant predictor when emotional dysfunction was added to the model. Higher emotional dysfunction and male gender increased the odds of being in the elevated group and medium increaser group relative to the low group even after controlling for parent-child relationship quality. Implications for intervention and future research directions are discussed.

AB Despite multi-type maltreatment, some individuals demonstrate positive adaptation and continue to develop in a healthy way. A multitude of strength factors have been linked to adaptive functioning and resilience, but this has not been adequately examined in maltreated adolescent's psychosocial functioning. This study sought to examine the role of strengths such as having talents/interests, family relationships, educational support, the role of the recognition and application of these strengths, and the role of multi-type maltreatment on anger control and conduct problems. One hundred and thirty participants (61 males; 69 females) aged 13-19 years old were rated using the Singapore version of Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) tool. The results revealed that certain strengths were associated with anger and conduct problems, but the recognition and application of strengths emerged as a consistently significant predictor for both outcomes. Hence, to understand and apply one's strengths may be equally as important as merely possessing those strengths. This study extends current understanding of the importance of strengths with a group of maltreated adolescents in an Asian context. Adopting a person-centered and strength-based approach will further enhance the effectiveness of interventions and improve outcomes for maltreated adolescents living in residential care.

AB Although child maltreatment exposure is a recognized risk factor for self-harm, mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. Self-harm may function as a compensatory strategy to regulate distressing emotions. This cross-sectional study examines if emotion dysregulation mediates between the severity of maltreatment exposure and self-harm, adjusting for demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Participants were 108 adolescent patients recruited from a psychiatric hospital in Singapore (mean age 17.0 years, SD= 1.65; 59.3% female). Study measures included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF), Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (FASM), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of maltreatment exposure on self harm via emotion dysregulation, controlling for demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Indirect effects were tested using bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI). Results showed that self-harm was highly prevalent in our sample (75.9%). Emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms were found to be associated with higher self-harm frequency. In addition, results from path analysis showed that the association between the severity of maltreatment exposure and self-harm frequency was significantly mediated by emotion dysregulation B= 0.07, p <0.05, 95% CI [0.02, 0.16]. Thus, emotion dysregulation may be a proximal mechanism linking maltreatment exposure and adolescent self-harm. Notably, self-harm may represent maladaptive attempts to manage emotion dysregulation that may have resulted from maltreatment. Findings from the study have implications for the prevention and treatment of self-harm in maltreated youth. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Adolescents in foster care are at high risk for mental health and emotional problems, however many do not receive needed services. The objective of this qualitative study was to examine the subjective experiences and perceptions related to mental health and help seeking of adolescents in care. Seven individuals aged 16-20 completed in-depth semi-structured interviews, which were coded following a grounded theory approach. Identified concepts or themes were related to level of need (i.e., stressful situations related to school, family, and foster care); predisposing and enabling factors (e.g., attitudes toward help seeking, previous help seeking, and awareness of sources); seeking help (i.e., a preference to talk to others with shared experiences); and stages of help seeking (i.e., problem recognition; recognition of need for help; evaluation of appropriate sources of help; and seeking help). Findings address gaps in the literature, and suggest targets for intervention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this literature review is to integrate the results of various studies regarding body image and body image distortion into a unified framework. The concept of body image is complex and can be interpreted from multiple points of view. The first part of the study touches upon different age characteristics, attentional focus on the body, the early and important role of the body in identity formation, specific features in adolescence, gender differences, and the often-observed stability of body image (distortion), which may be present as a (trait) marker throughout the lifespan. The second part focuses on the organization of body image. The results of different studies on cognitive information processing are reviewed, the question of perceptual accuracy is addressed and the concepts of embodiment are examined. The third topic is body image distortion. First, the concept is contextualized along different continua, then discussed in a clinical sense along with the complexity of diagnostic methods, as well as the state and trait aspects of body image distortion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify whether child and mother characteristics in early childhood predict TV exposure and engagement during mealtime in middle childhood.
   METHODS: A total of 220 low-income mother-child dyads participated. Children were 4.26 years old (SD = 0.51) at baseline and 5.94 years (SD = 0.68) at 2-year follow-up. Mothers completed baseline measures of child negative emotionality and parenting practices. Family mealtimes were video recorded and coded for background TV exposure and child TV engagement. Multinomial logistic regression tested whether child emotionality and parenting practices during early childhood predicted risk of child TV exposure or engagement during mealtime, relative to no TV use, 2 years later.
   RESULTS: Children with greater negative emotionality in early childhood were more likely to engage with TV during mealtime than to have no TV. Similarly, early parenting disciplinary practices characterized by over-reactivity and laxness increased the risk for child TV engagement versus no TV during mealtime approximately 2 years later.
   CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 factors that associated with an increased risk for TV viewing during meals. Helping parents manage child negative emotionality using positive parenting strategies might reduce later child TV engagement and improve the quality of family mealtimes.

AB Background: This paper compares adolescents with primary opioid problem use (OPU) to those with primary marijuana or alcohol problem use (MAPU) who received up to six months of Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), an empirically supported treatment.
   Methods: Intake clinical characteristics, treatment implementation measures, and clinical outcomes of two substance problem groups (OPU and MAPU) were compared using data from 1712 adolescents receiving A-CRA treatment. Data were collected at intake and 3, 6, and 12 months post-intake.
   Results: At intake, adolescents in the OPU group were more likely than those in the MAPU group to be Caucasian, older, female, and not attending school; report greater substance and mental health problems; and engage in social and health risk behaviors. There was statistical equivalence between groups in rates of A-CRA treatment initiation, engagement, retention, and satisfaction. Both groups decreased significantly on most substance use outcomes, with the OPU group showing greater improvement; however, the OPU group had more severe problems at intake and continued to report higher frequency of opioid use and more days of emotional problems and residential treatment over 12 months.
   Conclusions: The feasibility and acceptability of A-CRA for OPUs was demonstrated. Despite significantly greater improvement by the OPU group, they did not improve to the level of the MAPU group over 12 months, suggesting that they may benefit from A-CRA continuing care up to 12 months, medication to address opioid withdrawal and craving, and the inclusion of opioid-focused A-CRA procedures.

DE Theory of mind; Cerebral palsy; Social difficulties; Emotion regulation
ID DISABILITIES; COMMUNICATION; POPULATION; CHILDHOOD
AB Aims: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether children and adolescents with dystonic cerebral palsy (CP) present with emotional and social difficulties along side motor limitations.
   Participants/measures: Twenty-two verbal and nonverbal children and adolescents with dystonic CP were compared with a normative sample of twenty children and adolescents on measures of theory of mind (ToM), emotion regulation (ER), and social difficulties (SD).
   Results: Higher social and emotional difficulties were found in the dystonic CP group compared to the control group. Nonverbal participants with dystonic CP were found to present with greater social impairment and lower ToM ability than their verbal counter parts. Emotional regulation and hyperactivity and attentional difficulties (HAD) significantly predicted ToM ability and social difficulties. Lower Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level and IQ also contributed to differences in ToM ability.
   Interpretation: Findings support the need for greater attention to the emotional health and social development of children/adolescents with dystonic CP, along with assessments of motor difficulties in the planning and implementation of interventions and individual care plans. Further research is needed to explore links between motor disorder and mental state understanding in this clinical group. (C) 2017 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A review of 7 published studies and 1 anecdotal report involving dogs born in high-volume commercial breeding establishments and sold to the consumer directly via the Internet or indirectly through retail pet stores revealed an increased incidence of behavioral and emotional problems that cause distress in adulthood compared with dogs from other sources, especially noncommercial breeders. The most consistent finding among studies is an increase in aggression, which is most commonly directed toward the dog's owners and family members but also to unfamiliar people, and other dogs. Increased fear was also identified in response to unfamiliar people, children, other dogs, nonsocial stimuli, and when taken on walks. Undesirable behaviors related to separation and/or attention seeking and a heightened sensitivity to touch have been reported. Because of how dogs sold through pet stores and/or born in commercial breeding establishments are bred, housed, weaned, transported, handled, homed, and raised, potential contributing factors for these reported outcomes are numerous. Some key factors include genetics, early-life stimulus deprivation (inadequate stimulus exposure, inappropriate or lack of social exposure), stress (prenatal maternal stress and postnatal early-life adversity), early weaning and maternal separation, transport and pet-store-related factors, and owner-related factors such as inadequate knowledge and experience with dogs as well as different levels of commitment to the pet dog. All published studies suggest a role for major stressors during puppy development from the prenatal stage through adolescence in the development of many behavioral problems. Accordingly, for any dog breeding operation, a standard of care that adequately redresses the welfare of the mother and pups and the risk of later behavior problems attendant with early stress and distress need to be formulated and followed in a manner supported by the emerging data.

AB Recurring pain can lead to major impairment in childhood and adolescence.
   Based on data from wave 1 of the nationwide KiGGS study (2009-2012), the 3aEuromonth prevalence of recurrent headaches, abdominal and back pain in girls and boys aged 3-17 years is reported according to various socio-demographic factors, and a comparison with the prevalence from the KiGGS baseline survey (2003-2006) is made. In addition, whether recurrent pain causes health impairments is investigated.
   Database was a subsample from KiGGS wave 1 (n > 10,600). Parents and adolescents from the age of 11 were interviewed by telephone about pain. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire and emotional problems (anxiety, depressive symptoms) with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Prevalence and mean values with 95 % confidence intervals were reported.
   In 3aEuro to 6aEuroyear-old girls and boys abdominal pain was the most frequent type of pain affecting 25.0 %, i. e. one in four children. Abdominal pain was almost equally frequent in 7aEuro to 10-year-olds (girls: 26.0 %; boys: 19.8 %). Headaches were the most frequent type of pain in 11- to 17-year-olds affecting more than one in three girls (35.2 %) and one in five boys (19.8 %). Three-month prevalence of recurrent headaches, abdominal and back pain changed only slightly compared to the KiGGS baseline survey. Girls and boys with recurrent headaches, abdominal or back pain had decreased HRQoL and were more often affected by emotional problems than their peers who did not suffer from recurrent pain.
   The results confirm the high prevalence of pain in children and adolescents and therefore refer to the public health relevance of this subject at a young age.

AB BackgroundEmotional lability (EL) is frequent in school-aged children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with more frequent comorbidities and more severe impairment. However, little research has investigated the association between EL, ADHD and comorbid symptoms in preschoolers. This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety).
   MethodOne hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted.
   ResultsHigher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety.
   ConclusionsEmotional lability seems to be a potential marker for ADHD symptoms with internalizing problems in preschoolers and could be a target for diagnosis and early interventions. This finding should be treated with caution as the study was limited by the low response rate of the participants and consequently the small sample size.

AB Children exposed to problematic parental substance use (PPSU) often face a number of deleterious developmental outcomes, yet these children are less likely to become known to child protection and welfare services. Although there is a growing evidence base for equine-assisted therapy (EAT) as an effective treatment modality for atypically developing children and adolescents, scant research has explored the benefit of EAT for children exposed to PPSU. The current study is the first to explore the benefit of EAT for children exposed to PPSU in Victoria, Australia. Five 12-week EAT programmes were delivered from 2012 to 2015 with a total of 41 children (mean age of 10.26 years) taking part. Children's parents (n = 41) and schoolteachers (n = 31) completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. Parents reported that children's total difficult behaviour and emotional problems decreased following the 12-week EAT programme. In addition, parents and teachers observed a significant decrease in children's hyperactivity. The findings obtained highlight the benefit of EAT for children exposed to PPSU and thus, extends the existing evidence base for this treatment modality.

AB Although theory and research evidence indicate that less securely attached persons are more likely than their secure peers to experience emotion regulation difficulties, this is not necessarily a pre-ordained outcome. Emotion regulation difficulties may be more proximally predicted by individuals' maladaptive psychological defenses such as humor styles. This study explored the interrelationships between adult attachment orientations (attachment anxiety and avoidance) and perceived bonds with parents (perceived levels of parental care and control), emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating humor). Attachment anxiety, avoidance, and maternal care and overprotection were associated in expected directions with aggressive and self-defeating humor, but paternal care and overprotection were not. Additionally, aggressive and self-defeating humor were positively associated with expressive suppression and negatively associated with cognitive reappraisal. Self-defeating humor partially mediated the relationship between a number of attachment predictors (attachment anxiety, avoidance, maternal care, and maternal control) and expressive suppression. For example, attachment anxiety predicted higher use of self-defeating humor, which in turn predicted higher levels of expressive suppression. Finally, aggressive humor partially mediated the relationship between avoidance and cognitive reappraisal. Avoidance predicted higher use of aggressive humor, which in turn predicted lower levels of reappraisal. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

Using data from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development, we find that perceived spirituality mediates religion-health relations, but that varies based on youths' conceptualisation of spirituality. With findings confirming that perceived spirituality potentially promote youths' psychosocial health, we offer some future research directions and implications regarding relations between youths' spirituality, religion and health behaviours.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Anxiety disorders are the leading cause of mental illness in adolescence. While anxious adolescents show impairments in emotion processing and deficits in emotion regulation, few studies have attempted to improve emotion regulation within these populations.
   Method: This study used a multi-method design to test a newly developed emotion regulation training aimed at improving insight into emotions and instructing cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of cognitive reappraisal was investigated in 27 clinically anxious youth (Age: M=12.36, SD=2.59) and 43 healthy controls (Age: M=13.07, SD=2.19) using psychophysiological measures. Specifically, heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and visual fixations were recorded while youth had to up-or downregulate their emotions in response to affective pictures in the Psychophysiological Indicators of Emotion Regulation (PIER) task.
   Results: The novel training effectively improved self-reported emotion regulation and momentary anxiety in both groups. Moreover, initial group differences in emotional reactivity mostly disappeared when participants were instructed to apply emotion regulation in the task. However, pupil dilation data suggested that participants with anxiety disorders required more cognitive resources for the upregulation of negative affect to counteract this effect.
   Limitations: The relatively small sample size and large age range could hamper detection of additional group differences that may exist.
   Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that anxious youth can apply cognitive reappraisal to a similar extent as healthy adolescents after emotion regulation training but may need to exert more effort to do so. This training could be a valuable addition to current treatment programs.

AB BackgroundResearch on susceptibility to alcohol use disorder within the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) population has begun to expand examination of putative moderators and mediators in order to develop effective treatments. Specific dysregulated emotions have been separately associated with ADHD and with alcohol use difficulties. The current study is the first to conjointly study these variables by testing anger-irritability as a mediator of ADHD risk for adolescent alcohol use.
   MethodsFrequency of binge drinking, drunkenness, and alcohol problems were examined for 142 children with ADHD followed into adolescence and compared to 100 demographically similar youth without ADHD. Parent-rated anger-irritability was tested as a mediator. Behavioral and cognitive coping skills, which are key clinical treatment targets, were studied as moderators of these associations.
   ResultsChildhood ADHD was positively associated with anger-irritability and the drinking outcomes in adolescence. Anger-irritability mediated the association between ADHD and alcohol use problems, but not binge drinking or drunkenness. Behavioral and cognitive, but not avoidant, coping played a moderating role, but only of the association between childhood ADHD and anger-irritability.
   ConclusionsActive coping strategies by adolescents with ADHD may reduce the vulnerability to alcohol problems through a reduction of negative emotions. Future research on additional mediators and treatments that target these skills is encouraged.

AB BackgroundAlthough music therapy (MT) is considered an effective intervention for young people with mental health needs, its efficacy in clinical settings is unclear. We therefore examined the efficacy of MT in clinical practice.
   MethodsTwo hundred and fifty-one child (8-16years, with social, emotional, behavioural and developmental difficulties) and parent dyads from six Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service community care facilities in Northern Ireland were randomised to 12 weekly sessions of MT plus usual care [n=123; 76 in final analyses] or usual care alone [n=128; 105 in final analyses]. Follow-up occurred at 13weeks and 26weeks postrandomisation. Primary outcome was improvement in communication (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) (SSIS) at 13weeks. Secondary outcomes included social functioning, self-esteem, depression and family functioning.
   ResultsThere was no significant difference for the child SSIS at week 13 (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95% CI -1.2 to 6.1; p=.19) or for the guardian SSIS (0.5; 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8; p=.78). However, for participants aged 13 and over in the intervention group, the child SSIS communication was significantly improved (6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.5; p=.007) but not the guardian SSIS (1.1; 95% CI -2.9 to 5.2; p=.59). Overall, self-esteem was significantly improved and depression scores were significantly lower at week 13. There was no significant difference in family or social functioning at week 13.
   ConclusionsWhile the findings provide some evidence for the integration of music therapy into clinical practice, differences relating to subgroups and secondary outcomes indicate the need for further study. ISRCTN Register; ISRCTN96352204.

AB In this investigation the factor structure of the Adult Attachment Interview was studied in a partially at-risk sample of 120 young adults. More specifically, 60 participants had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; 53 females, M age = 20.38 years), and 60 were non-self-injuring controls matched by age and sex. Theoretically anticipated differential associations between preoccupied (but not dismissing) states of mind and NSSI were then examined. Exploratory factor analyses identified evidence for two weakly correlated state of mind dimensions (i.e., dismissing and preoccupied) consistently identified in factor analyses of normative-risk samples. As hypothesized, results further showed that preoccupied (but not dismissing) states of mind were associated with NSSI behavior. Findings support existing arguments suggesting that the regulatory strategy adults adopt when discussing attachment-related experiences with primary caregivers, particularly passive, angry, or unresolved discourse patterns, is uniquely correlated with NSSI.

AB Objective: To investigate the association between the perception of expressed emotion and psychopathology of school-going adolescents in a non-clinical sample.
   Methods: The cross-sectional field study was conducted in Kocaeli, Turkey, and comprised high-school students during the 2014-15 school years. Data was collected using the Information Collection Form, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Shortened Level of Expressed Emotion Scale. SPSS 21 was used for data analysis.
   Results: Of the 487 subjects, 295(60.57%) were girls and 192(39.43%) were boys. The overall median age was 16 (inter-quartile range: 15-17 years). There were significant positive relationships between the scales in terms of emotional problems (p<0.001), behavioural problems (p<0.001), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p<0.001), and peer relationship problems (p<0.001). There was also a negative significant relationship between pro-social behaviours and expressed emotion (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The concept of perceived expressed emotion in non-clinical adolescents is useful in alarming clinicians and preventing mental disorders.

AB Because loneliness is a subjective experience, it is often examined using self-reports. Yet, researchers have started to use other-reports to examine loneliness. As previous research suggests that discrepancies between self- and other views might have important implications for adolescents' mental health, the current study examines discrepancies in multi-informant reports on adolescents' loneliness in relation with prosocial behavior, aggression, and adolescents' parent-related loneliness. The sample consisted of 374 mother-adolescent dyads and 318 father-adolescent dyads (41.80% male, M (age) = 15.67 years, SD = 1.25). Results indicated that informants used different reference points to assess adolescents' peer-related loneliness, but were otherwise comparable. Moreover, informant discrepancies were associated with greater adolescents' reported parent-related loneliness. The current study did not provide evidence that discrepancies were related to prosocial or aggressive behavior. The current study adds to the notion that other-reports on loneliness show substantial convergence with self-reports. In addition, this study indicates that the discrepancy between other- and self-reports on loneliness holds valuable information for adolescent socio-emotional adjustment.

AB Verbal and physical aggression begin early in life and steadily decline thereafter in normal development. As a result, elevated aggressive behavior in adolescence may signal atypical development and greater vulnerability for negative mental and health outcomes. Converging evidence suggests that brain disturbances in regions involved in impulse control, emotional regulation, and sensation seeking may contribute to heightened aggression. However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive and reactive aggression) and whether they differ between males and females. Using a sample of 106 14-year-old adolescent twins, this study found that striatal enlargement was associated with both proactive and reactive aggression. We also found that volumetric alterations in several frontal regions including smaller middle frontal and larger orbitofrontal cortex were correlated with higher levels of aggression in adolescent twins. In addition, cortical thickness analysis showed that thickness alterations in many overlapping regions including middle frontal, superior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex and temporal regions were associated with aggression in adolescent twins. Results support the involvement of fronto-limbic-striatal circuit in the etiology of aggression during adolescence. Aggr. Behav. 43:230-240, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Whereas previous research on environmental factors implicated in the intergenerational transmission of depression has tended to focus on the role of parenting quality (e.g., harshness), the current study sought to assess whether structural aspects of families may contribute to depression-relevant affective and immune processes in youths. Specifically, the present study examined the role of family routines in linking parental depressive symptoms to youth emotion regulation, a depression-relevant marker of low-grade inflammation, and depressive symptoms in youths. 261 parent-adolescent dyads reported on their own depressive symptoms, family routines, and youths' emotion regulation abilities. In addition, peripheral blood was drawn from youths to assess levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Path analyses provided support for a model in which parental depressive symptoms related to fewer family routines, which in turn were associated with higher IL-6 and depressive symptoms in youths as well as marginally associated with worse youth emotion regulation. Moreover, family routines were found to statistically account for part of the association between parent- and youth- depressive symptoms. Together, these results suggest that family routines may represent an additional facet of the family environment that can potentially contribute to the intergenerational transmission of depressive symptoms.

AB The People in My Life questionnaire (PIML) is one of the few available self-report measures for assessing children's representations of the relationship with attachment figures (parents and peers) in middle childhood. The current study presents validation studies of the PIML in a sample of Portuguese children aged between 8 and 12 years (N = 314) and adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years (N = 281). The original factor structure, composed of a second-order factor of attachment and three first-order factors (Trust, Communication, and Alienation), was confirmed for both scales (Parents Attachment and Peers Attachment) in the sample of children and replicated in the sample of adolescents using confirmatory factor analyses. The Portuguese version of the PIML showed adequate internal consistency and correlated as expected with measures of intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning (internalizing and externalizing problems, prosocial behavior, quality of life, self-compassion, and emotion regulation strategies). The PIML proved to be a psychometrically robust measure of children's representations of their relationships with parents and peers, representing an important advance in the measurement of attachment in middle childhood.

AB Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases typically emerging during childhood and adolescence. Biological vulnerabilities such as a protracted maturation of prefrontal cortex functioning together with heightened reactivity of the limbic system leading to increased emotional reactivity are discussed as factors contributing to the emergence and maintenance of SAD. Sleep slow wave activity (SWA, 0.75-4.5 Hz) and sleep spindle activity (9-16 Hz) reflect processes of brain maturation and emotion regulation. We used high-density electroencephalography to characterize sleep SWA and spindle activity and their relationship to emotional reactivity in children and adolescents suffering from SAD and healthy controls (HC). Subjectively rated arousal was assessed using an emotional picture-word association task. SWA did not differ between socially anxious and healthy participants. We found a widespread reduction in fast spindle activity (13-16 Hz) in SAD patients compared to HC. SAD patients rated negative stimuli to be more arousing and these arousal ratings were negatively correlated with fast spindle activity. These results suggest electrophysiological alterations that are evident at an early stage of psychopathology and that are closely linked to one core symptom of anxiety disorders such as increased emotional reactivity. The role of disturbed GABAergic neurotransmission is discussed as an underlying factor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have examined non-suicidal self-injury in community and clinical samples, but there is no published research on non-suicidal self-injury in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. This lack of research is surprising, since individuals with autism spectrum disorder have high rates of risk factors for non-suicidal self-injury, including depression and poor emotion regulation skills. Using an online survey, we examined non-suicidal self-injury methods, frequency, severity, functions, and initial motivations in adults with autism spectrum disorder (n=42). We also compared their non-suicidal self-injury characteristics to those of a gender-matched group of adults without autism spectrum disorder (n=42). Of the participants with autism spectrum disorder, 50% reported a history of non-suicidal self-injury. This proportion is higher than non-suicidal self-injury rates previously reported for college students, adult community samples, and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, which suggests that adults with autism spectrum disorder have increased risk for engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. Women with autism spectrum disorder were significantly more likely to endorse non-suicidal self-injury, relative to men with autism spectrum disorder. A history of non-suicidal self-injury was not related to current depression or emotion dysregulation for the participants with autism spectrum disorder. Non-suicidal self-injury characteristics among the adults with autism spectrum disorder were similar to non-suicidal self-injury in adults without autism spectrum disorder. These preliminary findings highlight the need for increased awareness and further research about non-suicidal self-injury within autism spectrum disorder.

AB BACKGROUND: Changes in neural circuitry function may be associated with longitudinal changes in psychiatric symptom severity. Identification of these relationships may aid in elucidating the neural basis of psychiatric symptom evolution over time. We aimed to distinguish these relationships using data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms cohort.
   METHODS: Forty-one youth completed two study visits (interscan mean = 21.3 months). Elastic net regression (multiple-response Gaussian family) identified emotional regulation neural circuitry that changed in association with changes in depression, mania, anxiety, affect lability, and positive mood and energy dysregulation, accounting for clinical and demographic variables.
   RESULTS: Nonzero coefficients between change in the previously mentioned symptom measures and change in activity over the interscan interval were identified in right amygdala and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Differing patterns of neural activity change were associated with changes in each of the previously mentioned symptoms over time. Specifically, from scan 1 to scan 2, worsening affective lability and depression severity were associated with increased right amygdala and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortical activity. Worsening anxiety and positive mood and energy dysregulation were associated with decreased right amygdala and increased left ventrolateral prefrontal cortical activity. Worsening mania was associated with increased right amygdala and decreased left ventrolateral prefrontal cortical activity. These changes in neural activity between scans accounted for 13.6% of the variance; that is, 25% of the total explained variance (39.6%) in these measures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Distinct neural mechanisms underlie changes in different mood and anxiety symptoms over time.

AB Objective: Psychosocial stress can be a health threat by stimulating unhealthier eating behaviors. We aim to test the role of the hormone leptin in the association between stress and diet/emotional eating as detected in primary school children. Method: In a two-wave longitudinal study with 308 Belgian children (5-12y) in 2010-2012, the association of fasting serum leptin with reported stress (negative events and emotional problems), measured stress by salivary cortisol (overall cortisol output and awakening response), emotional eating and food consumption frequency was examined. Analyses were split by sex. Mediation and moderation by leptin change were tested. Results: One stress marker (overall cortisol output) was significantly correlated with high leptin levels, but only in girls and cross-sectionally. Only in boys, leptin was associated with low emotional eating. Leptin was not a significant predictor of unhealthy food consumption. Leptin change was not a mediator but an enhancing moderator in the link between stress (high cortisol output and emotional problems) and emotional eating in girls: high reports of emotional eating in 2012 were present in the case of combined high 2-year leptin increase and high stress at baseline. Discussion: Stress (represented by emotional problems and high daily cortisol) seems to lead to hyperleptinemia in girls; and the combination of high stress and hyperleptinemia might make girls more vulnerable to stress-induced eating. No functional data on leptin sensitivity were present, but results might suggest that stress induces lower sensitivity to the anorexigenic leptin activity.

AB Theoretical and empirical work suggests that aggression in those with borderline personality disorder (BPD) occurs primarily in the context of emotional reactivity, especially anger and shame, in response to perceived rejection. Using intensive repeated measures, we examined a within-person process model in which perceived rejection predicts increases in aggressive urges and behaviors via increases in negative affect (indirect effect) and in which BPD symptoms exacerbate this process (moderated mediation). Participants were 117 emerging adult women (ages 18-24) with recent histories of aggressive behavior who were recruited from a community-based longitudinal study of at-risk youth. Personality disorder symptoms were assessed by semistructured clinical interview, and aggressive urges, threats, and behaviors were measured in daily life during a 3-week ecological momentary assessment protocol. Multilevel path models revealed that within-person increases in perceived rejection predicted increases in negative affect, especially in women with greater BPD symptoms. In turn, increases in negative affect predicted increased likelihood of aggressive urges or behaviors. Further analysis revealed that BPD symptoms predicted greater anger and shame reactivity to perceived rejection, but not to criticism or insult. Additionally, only anger was associated with increases in aggression after controlling for other negative emotions. Whereas BPD symptoms exacerbated the link between perceived rejection and aggression via increases in negative affect (particularly anger), this process was attenuated in women with greater antisocial personality disorder symptoms. These findings suggest that anger reactivity to perceived rejection is one unique pathway, distinct from antisocial personality disorder, by which BPD symptoms increase risk for aggression.

AB Background: Early adversity is a known risk factor for unipolar depression. We examined the impact of 9 types of early adversity on risk for moderate to severe unipolar depression in adolescence or adulthood, and evaluated whether these effects were moderated by gender and adversity timing.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study using Danish national registers. The sample included all individuals born in Denmark between 1980 and 1998 (N=978,647). Exposure to early adversity was assessed from ages 0-15. Types of adversity included parental illness, incarceration, death, disability, and psychiatric diagnosis; family disruption; out-of-home care; and childhood abuse. Individuals were followed from age 15 until first in- or outpatient depression diagnosis (ICD-10 codes F32, F33) in a psychiatric hospital, death, emigration, or December 31st, 2013, whichever came first. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regressions.
   Results: All adversities were significantly associated with increased risk for moderate to severe adolescent/adult depression (HR range: 1.30-2.72), although the effects were attenuated after mutual adjustment (adjusted HR range: 1.06-1.70). None of the effects were moderated by gender. The effect of family disruption was strongest between ages 0-4 (HR=1.66, 95% CI=1.61-1.71), while the effect of out-of-home care was strongest between ages 10-14 (HR=2.45, 95% CI=2.28-2.64).
   Limitations: Untreated and primary-care treated depression were not measured.
   Conclusions: Our results support past findings that multiple types of early adversity increase risk for moderate to severe unipolar depression in adolescence and adulthood. Certain adversities may be more harmful if they occur during specific developmental time periods.

AB This study examined predictors of depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood in a sample of 1142 individuals (94% African American) who grew up in urban poverty. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study that followed participants from age five and included participant, parent, and teacher surveys, and administrative records. Depressive symptoms were self-reported at age 22-24 using a modified version of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1975). Binary logistic regression analyses identified several significant predictors of depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood, including: sex, adverse childhood experiences (ACE) score, socio-emotional adjustment in the classroom, juvenile arrest, and on-time graduation. Significant sex differences were also detected, with the final models fitting the male sample better than the full study or female samples. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB Objective: It has been reported that Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) can be differentiated into distinct subtypes associated with different outcomes in adulthood. We examined whether ODD is conceptually independent and coherent, and whether ODD and Conduct Disorder (CD) are expressions of the same core deficit. Method: The data come from a sample of 4,380 children for whom SNAP rating scales were available. Parallel analysis was performed on the eight-item ODD diagnostic items and on the SNAP-90 scale. These were factor analyzed and the components were correlated. Results: ODD has one underlying factor, whereas the parent-rated SNAP has nine underlying factors. ODD items grouped together with emotional lability and irritability items, which did not group with CD. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the separation of ODD and CD but not ODD and emotion dysregulation. Conclusion: The expanded ODD factor more likely captures a disorder of emotion regulation, rather than a disruptive behavior disorder.

AB A pilot mindfulness home intervention was conducted for 6 weeks among 8-12-year-old children born with esophageal atresia and their parents. Participants were randomly assigned to a waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 8) and an experimental group (n = 12). When all participants had completed the mindfulness-based program, data were pooled and treated for the entire sample (n = 19). Self-assessment measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale for Adolescents (MAAS-A), the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), the modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Child (STAI-C), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Kids version (CERQ-k). Parental assessment measures included the modified STAI-C. The results underlined the program's feasibility and acceptability. Clinical effects of the mindfulness-based program were observed. Self-assessed data for children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group showed increased mindfulness and decreased depression. Reduced anxiety was found in all groups. Positive affect tended to improve from pre-test to post-test in children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group. Parental assessments showed significant improvement in positive affect and decreases in anxiety and negative affect in the intervention group compared to the WLC group. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were also affected by the mindfulness-based program. Rumination scores significantly decreased from pre-test to post-test in the intervention group. This preliminary study suggests that regular mindfulness practice presents a promising approach to reducing the burden of this neonatal malformation.

AB Objective To systematically review the evidence for associations between exposure to community violence and physical health outcomes in children and adolescents. Methods A thorough search of multiple online databases and careful consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded a final 28 studies for detailed review. In addition to review of findings, studies were rated on overall quality based on study design. Results Seven categories of physical health outcomes emerged, including asthma/respiratory health, cardiovascular health, immune functioning, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, sleep problems, weight, and a general health category. There were mixed findings across these categories. Evidence for a positive association between community violence exposure and health problems was strongest in the cardiovascular health and sleep categories. Conclusion There is reason to believe that community violence exposure has an effect on some areas of physical health. Additional well-designed research that focuses on mechanisms as well as outcomes is warranted.

AB Dating aggression occurs frequently in early to mid-adolescence and has negative repercussions for psychosocial adjustment and physical health. The patterns of behavior learned during this developmental timeframe may persist in future dating relationships, underscoring the need to identify risk factors for this outcome. The current study examined longitudinal relations between beliefs supporting aggression, anger regulation, and dating aggression. Participants were 176 middle school students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade (50 % female; 82 % African American). No direct effects were found between beliefs supporting reactive or proactive aggression and dating aggression. Beliefs supporting reactive aggression predicted increased rates of anger dysregulation, and beliefs supporting proactive aggression led to subsequent increases in anger inhibition. Anger dysregulation and inhibition were associated with higher frequencies of dating aggression. An indirect effect was found for the relation between beliefs supporting reactive aggression and dating aggression via anger dysregulation. Another indirect effect emerged for the relation between beliefs supporting proactive aggression and dating aggression through anger inhibition. The study's findings suggested that beliefs supporting proactive and reactive aggression were differentially related to emotion regulation processes, and identified anger dysregulation and inhibition as risk factors for dating aggression among adolescents.

AB Adolescence is a potentially important time in the development of emotion regulation and parenting behaviors may play a role. We examined associations among parenting behaviors, parent resting heart rate variability, adolescent resting heart rate variability and parenting behaviors as moderators of the association between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. Ninety-seven youth (11-17 years; 49.5 % female; 34 % African American, 37.1 % Euro-American, 22.6 % other/mixed ethnic background, and 7.2 % Hispanic) and their parents (n = 81) completed a physiological assessment and questionnaires assessing parenting behaviors. Inconsistent discipline and corporal punishment were negatively associated with adolescent resting heart rate variability, while positive parenting and parental involvement were positively associated. Inconsistent discipline and parental involvement moderated the relationship between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. The findings provide evidence for a role of parenting behaviors in shaping the development of adolescent resting heart rate variability with inconsistent discipline and parental involvement potentially influencing the entrainment of resting heart rate variability in parents and their children.

AB Background: Adolescent bullying may be a key driver of interest in cosmetic surgery. This study examined the extent of such interest and whether any effect was sex-specific, and examined psychological functioning as a potential mechanism through which bullying involvement may lead to a wish for cosmetic surgery.
   Methods: A two-stage design was used. In the first stage, 2782 adolescents (aged 11 to 16 years) were screened for bullying involvement using self-reports and peer nominations. In the second stage, 752 adolescents who were bullies, victims, bully-victims, or uninvolved in bullying reported their desire for cosmetic surgery. Psychological functioning was constructed as a composite of self-esteem and emotional problems (assessed at stage 1) and body-esteem scores (assessed at stage 2).
   Results: Adolescents involved in bullying in any role were significantly more interested in cosmetic surgery than uninvolved adolescents. Desire for cosmetic surgery was greatest in adolescents who were bullied (victims and bully-victims) and girls. Desire for cosmetic surgery was highest in girls, but sex did not interact with bullying role. Being victimized by peers resulted in poor psychological functioning, which increased desire for cosmetic surgery. In contrast, desire for cosmetic surgery in bullies was not related to psychological functioning, which was in the normal range. Conclusions: Bullying victimization is related to poor psychological functioning, and both are related to a greater desire for cosmetic surgery in adolescents.
   Cosmetic surgeons should screen candidates for psychological vulnerability and may want to include a short screening questionnaire for a history of peer victimization.

AB Background. Emotions and emotional competency are gaining in importance these days. This relevance is especially shown by their relationships to psychological and psychosomatic diseases as well as performance-related aspects like motivation and cognition.
   Goal and methods. The present study investigated the extend of which a body-related program can lead to direct or sustainable improvements in emotional skills in physical education. Overall, the data of 44 female pupils were collected at three different times using the Emotional Competence Questionnaire to measure their development.
   Results. The results shows direct and sustainable positive effects of the body-related program on emotion regulation abilities and long-term positive effects on emotional competency as a whole. It is particularly advised to rethink and revise the organization of the program's time management in order to increase efficiency.

AB Background: Adolescent behaviour is strongly linked to emotions. The aim of this study is 1) analyse the differences between young offenders and non-offenders in emotional instability, anger, aggressive behaviour, anxiety and depression, and also the differences according to sex; and 2) compare the relation between emotional instability and anxiety, depression and aggressive behaviour mediated or modulated by anger in both groups. Method: participants are 440 adolescents, both male and female (15-18 years old). 220 were young offenders from four different correctional centres of the Valencia Region. The other 220 participants were randomly chosen from ten public and private schools in the Valencia metropolitan area. In the Schools the instruments were applied collectively in the classroom, with a 50 minutes maximum duration. In the Youth Detention Centre the application was carried out in small groups. Results: The structural equation model (SEM) carried out on each group, young offenders and non-offenders show a relation between the assessed variables. Emotional instability appears strongly related with anger in both samples, but anger just predicts depression and aggressive behaviour in the offender population. Conclusions: The results give relevant information for treatment and prevention of aggressive behaviour and delinquency in teenagers through emotional regulation.

AB Background. Although there is robust evidence linking childhood adversities (CAs) and an increased risk for psychotic experiences (PEs), little is known about whether these associations vary across the life-course and whether mental disorders that emerge prior to PEs explain these associations.
   Method. We assessed CAs, PEs and DSM-IV mental disorders in 23 998 adults in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to investigate the associations between CAs and PEs, and the influence of mental disorders on these associations using multivariate logistic models.
   Results. Exposure to CAs was common, and those who experienced any CAs had increased odds of later PEs [ odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-2.6]. CAs reflecting maladaptive family functioning (MFF), including abuse, neglect, and parent maladjustment, exhibited the strongest associations with PE onset in all life-course stages. Sexual abuse exhibited a strong association with PE onset during childhood (OR 8.5, 95% CI 3.6-20.2), whereas Other CA types were associated with PE onset in adolescence. Associations of other CAs with PEs disappeared in adolescence after adjustment for prior-onset mental disorders. The population attributable risk proportion (PARP) for PEs associated with all CAs was 31% (24% for MFF).
   Conclusions. Exposure to CAs is associated with PE onset throughout the life-course, although sexual abuse is most strongly associated with childhood-onset PEs. The presence of mental disorders prior to the onset of PEs does not fully explain these associations. The large PARPs suggest that preventing CAs could lead to a meaningful reduction in PEs in the population.

AB Background: Addicts to specific internet applications involving communication features showed increased social anxiety, emotional competence deficits and impaired prefrontal-related inhibitory control. The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) likely plays an important role in cognitive control and negative affect (such as social exclusion, pain or anxiety).
   Aim: To assess (social) anxiety-related inhibitory control in specific Internet addiction (addicted use of games and social networks) and its relation to altered dACC activation.
   Methods: N=44 controls and n=51 specific internet addicts completed an anxious words-based Affective Go/No-Go task (AGN). A subsample of n=23 healthy controls and n=25 specific internet addicts underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while completing an Emotional Stroop Task (EST) with socially anxious, positive, negative and neutral words. Subgroups of internet gaming and social network addicts were exploratively assessed. Psychometric measures of social anxiety, emotional competence and impulsivity were additionally explored.
   Results: Specific internet addicts showed higher impulsivity, social anxiety and reduced emotional competence. Between-group differences in AGN and EST behavioral measures were not detected. No group differences were found in the dACC, but explorative analyses revealed decreased left middle and superior temporal gyrus activation during interference of socially anxious words in internet gaming and relative to social network addicts.

AB Background: Discrepancies between multiple informants often create considerable uncertainties in delivering services to youth. The present study assessed the ability of the parent and youth scales of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to predict mental health problems/disorders across several mental health domains as validated against two contrasting indices of validity for psychopathology derived from the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA): (1) an empirically derived computer algorithm and (2) expert based ICD-10 diagnoses. Methods: Ordinal and logistic regressions were used to predict any problems/disorders, emotional problems/disorders and behavioural problems/disorders in a community sample (n = 252) and in a clinic sample (n = 95). Results: The findings were strikingly similar in both samples. Parent and youth SDQ scales were related to any problem/disorder. Youth SDQ symptom and impact had the strongest association with emotional problems/disorder and parent SDQ symptom score were most strongly related to behavioural problems/disorders. Both the SDQ total and the impact scores significantly predicted emotional problems/disorders in males whereas this was the case only for the total SDQ score in females. Conclusion: The present study confirms and expands previous findings on parent and youth informant validity. Clinicians should include both parent and youth for identifying any mental health problems/disorders, youth information for detecting emotional problems/disorders, and parent information to detect behavioural problems/disorders. Not only symptom scores but also impact measures may be useful to detect emotional problems/disorders, particularly in male youth.

AB Background: Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness for young people. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a mindfulness training (MT) programme to enhance mental health, wellbeing and social-emotional behavioural functioning in adolescence.
   Methods/design: To address this aim, the design will be a superiority, cluster randomised controlled, parallel-group trial in which schools offering social and emotional provision in line with good practice (Formby et al., Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) Education: A mapping study of the prevalent models of delivery and their effectiveness, 2010; OFSTED, Not Yet Good Enough: Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education in schools, 2013) will be randomised to either continue this provision (control) or include MT in this provision (intervention). The study will recruit and randomise 76 schools (clusters) and 5700 school students aged 12 to 14 years, followed up for 2 years.
   Discussion: The study will contribute to establishing if MT is an effective and cost-effective approach to promoting mental health in adolescence.

AB The present study tested and extended Lane and Terry's (2000) conceptual model of mood-performance relationships using a large dataset from an online experiment. Methodological and theoretical advances included testing a more balanced model of pleasant and unpleasant emotions, and evaluating relationships among emotion regulation traits, states and beliefs, psychological skills use, perceptions of performance, mental preparation, and effort exerted during competition. Participants (N = 73,588) completed measures of trait emotion regulation, emotion regulation beliefs, regulation efficacy, use of psychological skills, and rated their anger, anxiety, dejection, excitement, energy, and happiness before completing a competitive concentration task. Post-competition, participants completed measures of effort exerted, beliefs about the quality of mental preparation, and subjective performance. Results showed that dejection associated with worse performance with the no-dejection group performing 3.2% better. Dejection associated with higher anxiety and anger scores and lower energy, excitement, and happiness scores. The proposed moderating effect of dejection was supported for the anxiety-performance relationship but not the anger-performance relationship. In the no-dejection group, participants who reported moderate or high anxiety outperformed those reporting low anxiety by about 1.6%. Overall, results showed partial support for Lane and Terry's model. In terms of extending the model, results showed dejection associated with greater use of suppression, less frequent use of re-appraisal and psychological skills, lower emotion regulation beliefs, and lower emotion regulation efficacy. Further, dejection associated with greater effort during performance, beliefs that pre-competition emotions did not assist goal achievement, and low subjective performance. Future research is required to investigate the role of intense emotions in emotion regulation and performance.

AB Background Time-limited, early-life exposures to institutional deprivation are associated with disorders in childhood, but it is unknown whether effects persist into adulthood. We used data from the English and Romanian Adoptees study to assess whether deprivation-associated adverse neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes persist into young adulthood.
   Methods The English and Romanian Adoptees study is a longitudinal, natural experiment investigation into the long-term outcomes of individuals who spent from soon after birth to up to 43 months in severe deprivation in Romanian institutions before being adopted into the UK. We used developmentally appropriate standard questionnaires, interviews completed by parents and adoptees, and direct measures of IQ to measure symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, inattention and overactivity, disinhibited social engagement, conduct or emotional problems, and cognitive impairment (IQ score <80) during childhood (ages 6, 11, and 15 years) and in young adulthood (22-25 years). For analysis, Romanian adoptees were split into those who spent less than 6 months in an institution and those who spent more than 6 months in an institution. We used a comparison group of UK adoptees who did not experience deprivation. We used mixed-effects regression models for ordered-categorical outcome variables to compare symptom levels and trends between groups.
   Findings Romanian adoptees who experienced less than 6 months in an institution (n=67 at ages 6 years; n=50 at young adulthood) and UK controls (n=52 at age 6 years; n=39 at young adulthood) had similarly low levels of symptoms across most ages and outcomes. By contrast, Romanian adoptees exposed to more than 6 months in an institution (n=98 at ages 6 years; n=72 at young adulthood) had persistently higher rates than UK controls of symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, disinhibited social engagement, and inattention and overactivity through to young adulthood (pooled p<0.0001 for all). Cognitive impairment in the group who spent more than 6 months in an institution remitted from markedly higher rates at ages 6 years (p=0.0001) and 11 years (p=0.0016) compared with UK controls, to normal rates at young adulthood (p=0.76). By contrast, self-rated emotional symptoms showed a lateonset pattern with minimal differences versus UK controls at ages 11 years (p=0.0449) and 15 years (p=0.17), and then marked increases by young adulthood (p=0.0005), with similar effects seen for parent ratings. The high deprivation group also had a higher proportion of people with low educational achievement (p=0.0195), unemployment (p=0.0124), and mental health service use (p=0.0120, p=0.0032, and p=0.0003 for use when aged <11 years, 11-14 years, and 15-23 years, respectively) than the UK control group. A fifth (n=15) of individuals who spent more than 6 months in an institution were problem-free at all assessments.
   Interpretation Notwithstanding the resilience shown by some adoptees and the adult remission of cognitive impairment, extended early deprivation was associated with long-term deleterious effects on wellbeing that seem insusceptible to years of nurturance and support in adoptive families.

   Emotional Maturity among Adolescents
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE School Counseling; Effectiveness; Counselor; Adolescence; Emotional
   Maturity
AB Children and adolescents are considered as the valuable asset of any country. Such an emphasis is obviously based on the immense potentials of the youth persons to contribute intellectually, politically and economically to the society. They need to be well adjusted to their physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual competences need to be properly developed. This is achieved through family, school community and society.
   Among all these agencies, the school system and the teachers play a vital role in molding healthy personalities. If a favorable environment is produced in schools, it would go a long way in promoting the mental health of children and adolescents, preventing several emotional problems, and offering timely intervention for their psychological problems through appropriate psycho social care by school counselors.
   The study is a modest attempt to examine the effectiveness of counseling services offered to the students and the difference it creates in certain domains of their personality. The research design is descriptive in nature and the sampling technique adopted for the study is stratified random sampling. From the findings it was concluded that, even though the emotional maturity level increases after a good counseling, it was observed that the results among adolescent boys showed a sheer decline in emotional maturity after their counseling. This shows some revamp in counseling models as such.

AB Objective: This pilot study sought to better understand what can be achieved by an evidence-based classroom social and emotional education programme.
   Design and Methods: A 10-lesson, classroom-based programme that taught about emotional literacy, personal strengths, coping and problem-solving strategies, stress management, emotional regulation and support seeking was provided to 56 students in Years 7 (13 years) and 8 (14 years) in an Australian middle school. Teachers were trained to deliver the programme, with participatory modelling of each activity. Before and after delivery of the programme, students were surveyed for their social and emotional wellbeing using the Kessler 10 (K10) instrument for non-specific psychological distress; the 'Internal Assets', 'School Resources' and 'Cooperation and Communication' questions from the Resilience and Youth Development Module (RYDM) of the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS); and questions developed for this study on class connectedness and social and emotional skills. Subsequent to programme completion, focus groups were conducted with teachers and participating students to gauge programme fidelity, utility and engagement.
   Results: There was an improvement in psychological distress that approached significance (t=2, df=42, p =.053), although the symptomatic score remained in the range indicative of medium-level distress. Cooperation and communication improved significantly (t = -2.34, df = 42, p =.024) as did class connectedness (t = -2.46, df = 43, p =.018). There was no change in individual resilience factors, school protective factors, or social and emotional skills. The focus groups were generally positive about the programme, but indicated fidelity was compromised, mainly because the lesson periods were too short.
   Conclusion: While this small-scale pilot study has a number of limitations, it does indicate the need to improve the psychological wellbeing of middle school students. The findings also provide evidence that brief social and emotional education programmes can have some positive effects.

AB Background: Adolescents and young adults form a high-risk group for non-suicidal self-injury but these behaviours are often inadequately understood. Aims: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the perceptions of student self-injury, among school and college teachers in an urban city in India. Methods: A 62-item measure, Teacher Awareness and Understanding about Self-injury Survey Questionnaire, was completed by 152 teachers from high school, pre-university college and undergraduate college levels, drawn from 21 private and government educational institutions. This assessed teachers' perceptions about the rates, methods, characteristics and functions of student self-injury, their self-reported knowledge and emotional reactions, and their views about appropriate help-seeking options and responses. Results: The results indicated underestimation of the rates of student self-injury by a large proportion of teachers, although a majority felt that these behaviours were on the rise. Self-injurious acts were largely viewed as warning signs of mental illness and most strongly seen as reflecting a depressive illness. There were divergent perceptions about the relationship between self-injurious behaviours and suicide. The belief in the 'attention-seeking' function of self-injurious acts was prominent, with the emotion regulation function being less frequently endorsed. Results indicated that there were some difficult emotional reactions and knowledge gaps in the understanding of student self-injury. There were significant associations between teachers' reports of knowledge about self-injurious behavior, the ease of identification of self-injury and the sense of confidence in responding to an injuring student. Conclusion: The findings have implications for gatekeeper training, counselling services and referral pathways in educational institutions.

ID INTELLIGENCE; EDUCATION
AB In the educational psychology field, responding to the social and emotional needs unmet by traditional academic education, through emotional education, is currently sought. This is considered necessary for an emotionally healthy development, with healthy emotional relationships and mental states. Hence the importance to develop emotional skills, both in the classroom and in the family, to provide children with more tools, that help them to face multiple situations throughout their lives. In this sense, the end of childhood constitutes a real opportunity to assimilating emotional competencies, making responsible decisions, solving problems and dealing with risk situations. Therefore, the interest in this work is to reflect, from a theoretical perspective, on the development of emotional competencies and responsible decision making in pre-adolescents, examining the involvement of teachers and parents in this process.

AB Although peer crowd affiliations have been studied extensively in adolescence, less is known about the crowd structure of emerging adults. The current study tested whether college students' self-reported crowd affiliations were uniquely associated with a broad range of adjustment indices. Participants were 588 emerging adults at a small liberal arts college in the Western United States (Mage = 20.07, SD =1.34; range = 18-26; 411 women). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the peer crowds examined were best described by four underlying crowd dimensions (i.e., social, athletic, scholastic, and counterculture). Regression analyses showed that scholastic and athletic affiliations predicted social-emotional adjustment and low- risk- related behaviors. Social and counterculture identification predicted risk- related behaviors. However, while social affiliation predicted social- emotional adjustment, affiliation with the counterculture crowd predicted high levels of loneliness and low belongingness. The results highlight the importance of crowd affiliations in emerging adulthood and their implications for college students' adjustment.

AB Mental Toughness (MT) provides crucial psychological capacities for achievement in sports, education, and work settings. Previous research examined the role of MT in the domain of mental health and showed that MT is negatively associated with and predictive of fewer depressive symptoms in nonclinical populations. The present study aimed at (1) investigating to what extent mentally tough individuals use two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression; (2) exploring whether individual differences in emotion regulation strategy use mediate the relationship between MT and depressive symptoms. Three hundred sixty-four participants (M = 24.31 years, SD = 9.16) provided self-reports of their levels of MT, depressive symptoms, and their habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between MT and two commonly used measures of depressive symptoms. A small statistically significant positive correlation between MT and the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal was also observed. The correlation between MT and the habitual use of expressive suppression was statistically significant, but the size of the effect was small. A statistical mediation model indicated that individual differences in the habitual use of expressive suppression mediate the relationship between MT and depressive symptoms. No such effect was found for the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal. Implications of these findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.

AB Aims. -Maltreatment during childhood or adolescence has been linked to later physical and social-emotional symptoms, and in particular to the use of risk-related substances. This paper draws up a review of the literature concerning the relationships between childhood maltreatment and risk-related substance use in young adulthood, which is known to be a period of increased psychological vulnerability.
   Method. -A comprehensive literature review was conducted on several online databases with a set of predefined keywords. Only empirical, prospective or retrospective studies, published from the year 2000 onwards and specifically relating to the effects of childhood maltreatment on risk-related substance use in young adulthood were selected.
   Results. -This literature review clearly supports the link between childhood maltreatment and an increased risk of legal and illegal substance use. However, most available studies are retrospective and/or correlational and therefore do not enable prospective exploration of the processes that link these two phenomena. The main explanatory hypotheses are based on the long-term consequences of childhood exposure to a multi risk psychosocial environment or to dysfunctional parental models; on disturbances in the construction of attachment, on lack of emotional regulation and mentalisation, and on the neurodevelopmental impact of trauma.
   Discussion. -Despite the significant body of research demonstrating its long-term effects, child abuse is still widespread, often unrecognized, and the children concerned are not protected. However, relatively few studies provide an analysis of subsequent risk-related substance use taking into account all types of maltreatment. Emotional abuse and neglect may be deemed less harmful and/or may be more difficult to identify, leading to their exclusion from some of the studies that only consider physical, severe and/or legally established forms of abuse, which results in some bias.
   Conclusion. -This review stresses not only the need for improvement in early prevention strategies targeting parents and child care professionals, but also for implementation of prevention and support programs directed towards young adults with a past history of childhood abuse.

AB Introduction. - For a decade, the concept of irritability has known a renewed interest in infant and child psychopathology. Indeed, longitudinal follow-up studies clearly highlighted their predictive value in the short, medium and long terms of a broad field of behavioral disorders and emotion dysregulation. This dimensional and transnosographic approach of irritability, coupled with the latest neuroscience data, points out that irritability could be the equivalent of a psychopathological marker, covering both a neurobiological, cognitive and emotional component. It is a major challenge today to better understand the developmental sequence of severe chronic irritability and its predictive influence on the etiology of mental disorders from childhood to adulthood.
   Method. - We briefly review here the latest current data on this topic.
   Results. - The important point is that chronic and non -episodic irritability in children, associated with strong emotional sensitivity to negative events and frequent access of anger, could have a predictive value for progression to anxiety disorder or severe mood disorder but not to bipolar disorder as it was believed until now. The risk of developing a bipolar disorder would be more frequently correlated with the notion of transient and episodic irritability in a context of previous family history of bipolar disorder.
   Conclusion. - Further studies are expected to narrow the discriminative validity of this notion of severe irritability and confirm or not its relevance as a major clinical criterion of Severe Mood Disorders in children and adolescents introduced in the last version of DSM (DSM-5).

AB Introduction. - Obesity in adolescents remains little studied. Our clinical observations within center treatment of obesity in Franche-Comte, and inventory of various theories supporting a psychological origin of obesity with integrative spirit of research, led us to study capacities of emotional awareness and attachment representations compared to a control group.
   Objective. - In reference to developmental theory of alexithymia and clinical observations of Hilde Bruch, investigate the possible link between capacities of emotional awareness and representations and security of the bond of parent child attachment, among obese adolescents, that lead to hyperphagic behavior.
   Method. - Seventeen obese adolescents, and 21 controls were tested. Participants completed the Level Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS); the Inventory of parent and peer Attachment (IPPA), and the Relationships Scale Questionnaire (RSQ).
   Results. - The group of obese adolescents presents a level of emotional awareness significantly lower than the control group. The results of this study show a peculiarity regarding the quality of parent child attachment. There seems to be an imbalance between the security of maternal bonding and paternal bonding perceived by the young obese. RSQ results support the hypothesis that those adolescents are at the margins of security from the perspective of attachment.
   Discussion. - The results support the interest of psychological treatments of obesity in the adolescent, by the implementation of therapy in the field of emotional regulation and family therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB It has been well-established that a variety of mind-body (MB) techniques, including yoga, mental imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback, and meditation, are effective at addressing symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea, and insomnia, as well as helping with a wide variety of medical, emotional, and behavioral issues in pediatric populations. In addition, MB skills can also be health-promoting in the long-term, and with regular practice, could potentially contribute to longer attention spans, social skills, emotional regulation, and enhanced immune system functioning. Importantly, the benefits accrued from MB skills are largely dose-dependent, meaning that individuals who practice with some consistency tend to benefit the most, both in the short-and long-term. However, clinical experience suggests that for busy patients, the regular practice of MB skills can be challenging and treatment adherence commonly becomes an issue. This commentary reviews the concept of technology-assisted relaxation as an engaging and effective option to enhance treatment adherence (i.e., daily practice) for pediatric patients, for whom MB skills have been recommended to address physical and mental health challenges.

AB Mind-body medicine is a system of health practices that includes meditation/relaxation training, guided imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback, yoga, art/music therapy, prayer, tai chi, and psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Clinical hypnosis is an important mind-body tool that serves as an adjunct to conventional medical care for the adolescent patient. Clinical hypnosis specifically uses self-directed therapeutic suggestions to cultivate the imagination and facilitate the mind-body connection, leading to positive emotional and physical well-being. There are many similarities between clinical hypnosis and other mind-body/self-regulatory modalities such as visual imagery, mindfulness meditation, yoga, and biofeedback that incorporate experiential learning and mechanisms for change. They may be viewed as subtypes of the hypnotic experience and share the common experience of trance as the entree into self-empowered change in physiologic and psychological states. Clinical hypnosis can be used by health care providers to teach adolescents coping skills to deal with a wide variety of conditions such as chronic headaches, recurrent abdominal pain, anxiety, depression, grief and bereavement, phobias, anger, family stressors, sleep disorders, or enuresis. Clinical vignettes are given to help illustrate the effectiveness of hypnosis in adolescents.

AB Background: Sedentary behaviors (SB) are associated with health indicators; however, there are currently very few studies that have examined these associations, especially in conjunction with psychological factors, in children. The current study examined the independent relationship between objectively assessed SB, and indicators of obesity and psychological, well-being, among Japanese children. Methods: A total of 967 elementary-school children completed a cross-sectional survey. SB was measured with accelerometers for 7 consecutive days. Psychological well-being data (eg, anxiety and behavior problems) were collected via a self-report questionnaire. To determine the relationship of SB with degree of obesity and psychological well-being, linear regression analyses were conducted to relate the indicators of obesity and psychological well-being on SB, adjusted by gender, grade, percentage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, duration spent wearing the accelerometer, and degree of obesity. Results: SB was significantly related to behavioral/emotional problems (beta = .280, P = .010, R-2 = .015). There was a statistically significant relationship between SB and anxiety (beta = .206, P = .059, R-2 = .007). No significant association with degree of obesity was found. Conclusions: Excess SB relates higher levels of behavioral/emotional problems and anxiety. These results can inspire the development of interventions that promote well-being and enhance psychological health, by focusing on SB in Japanese children.

AB This study examined cross-sectional associations among coping, mental health, and asthma outcomes in racially/ethnically diverse urban children. Children (N=42; 65% female) ages 9 to 17 (M=11.9) years old and their parents reported on the child's coping, emotional and conduct problems, asthma control, and school missed due to asthma. Higher child and parent reported secondary control coping was correlated with fewer mental health problems and better child reported asthma control. Child reported emotional problems partially accounted for associations between child and parent reported secondary control coping and child reported asthma control. Secondary control coping may improve asthma by reducing emotional difficulties.

AB Objective: Parents play an important role in children's illness management, in promoting child adjustment and reducing behavior problems. Little research has focused on the evaluation of parenting interventions in the context of childhood chronic illness. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief, group parenting intervention (Healthy Living Triple P) in improving parenting skills and parent adjustment, and reducing child behavioral and emotional difficulties in the context of childhood asthma and eczema. Method: One hundred seven parents of children with a diagnosis of asthma and/or eczema were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 52) or care as usual (CAU; n = 55). Parents completed self-report measures of their child's behavioral and emotional adjustment, their own parenting, and their own level of adjustment at pre-and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. Parent-child interactions were observed and coded at each time point. The intervention consisted of 2 group sessions of 2 hr each delivered by trained, accredited practitioners. Results: Attrition was low, with T2 and T3 assessment completed by 84.6% and 80.8% of intervention families and 92.7% and 81.8% of CAU families, respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that overall parent-reported ineffective parenting as well as parental overreactivity reduced as a result of intervention. Parent report of child behavior problems also decreased, but there were no changes in children's emotional adjustment. No changes in observed parent or child behavior were found. Stress reduced for parents in the intervention group compared to the CAU group, but there were no changes in parental anxiety or depression. Effects showed evidence of reliable and clinical change and were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: The intervention shows promise as an addition to clinical services for children with asthma and eczema and may have broader application to other chronic health conditions.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of maternal depressive symptoms on adolescent alcohol use among a sample of Latino/Latina youth aged 10 to 16 years from a high-risk community. Direct and mediating effects of youth depressive symptoms, controlling for levels of concurrent emotion dysregulation, on alcohol use were examined. Participants consisted of 525 children and their mothers randomly sampled from low-income schools with high rates of substance use. The panel design included four waves, and we used structural equation modeling with a longitudinal mediational framework. Results indicated that the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescent alcohol use was mediated by adolescents' symptoms of depression for girls only. Findings are discussed in the context of the development of skills to cope with negative affect and the influence parental depressive symptoms may have on this process.

AB Anger regulation among adolescents is important to investigate given theoretical and empirical support for its critical association with peer relationships. This study examined two aspects of anger regulation (i.e., inhibition, dysregulation) using self-report and peer-nominations and their associations with social acceptance among 163 Black and White adolescents ((X) over bar = 13.87 years). We explored gender and ethnicity differences in anger regulation predicting peer acceptance. Self-reports and peer-nominations of anger regulation were significantly correlated. Within-gender ethnicity differences in anger regulation were found: White girls reported higher levels of anger inhibition than Black girls, and Black girls reported higher levels of anger dysregulation than White girls. For all adolescents, self-reports and nominations of anger inhibition were associated with higher levels of social acceptance, whereas nominations of anger dysregulation predicted lower social acceptance. The results indicate the importance of considering gender and ethnicity in adolescents' anger management within peer contexts.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are among the most debilitating psychiatric conditions. Behaviors and traits associated with these disorders can have profound influences on those surrounding the affected individual. Accordingly, researchers have begun to examine effects of these symptoms on parent-child relationships. Theoretical and empirical work suggests that one mechanism linking maternal psychopathology to child symptoms is familial transmission of emotion dysregulation. The authors examined children's emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child behavior problems 1 year later. Analyses revealed that a composite of maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms had a direct effect on child internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms. Associations between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and youth problems were partially mediated by child emotion regulation difficulties, even with maternal depression and other relevant covariates included in the models. Thus, maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child emotion regulation difficulties represent potential targets for prevention of psychopathology among youth.

   Objective: We examined whether the brain-reward response to food is related to future weight variability.
   Design: A total of 162 healthy-weight adolescents, who were aged 14-18 y at baseline, were enrolled in the study and were assessed annually over a 3-y follow-up period with 127 participants completing the final 3-y follow-up assessment. With the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested whether the neural responses to a cue that signaled an impending milkshake receipt and the receipt of the milkshake predicted weight variability over the follow-up period. Weight variability was modeled with a root mean squared error method to reflect fluctuations in weight independent of the net weight change.
   Results: Elevated activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area, cingulate gyrus, cuneus and occipital gyrus, and insula in response to milkshake receipt predicted greater weight variability. Greater activation in the precuneus and middle temporal gyrus predicted lower weight variability.
   Conclusions: From our study data, we suggest that the elevated activation of reward and emotional-regulation brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and insula) and lower activation in self-reference regions (precuneus) in response to milkshake receipt predict weight variability over 3 y of follow-up. The fact that the reward response in the current study emerged in response to high-calorie palatable food receipt suggests that weight variability may be a measure of propensity periods of a positive energy balance and should be examined in addition to measures of the net weight change. With our collective results, we suggest that weight variability and its brain correlates should be added to other variables that are predictive of weight gain to inform the design of obesity-preventive programs in adolescents.

AB Objective: Individuals' lay beliefs about mental health problems and attitudes toward mental health care are thought to be influenced by the cultural background of these individuals. In the current study, we investigated differences between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents and adolescents in lay beliefs about emotional problems and attitudes toward mental health care. Additionally, among immigrant Dutch parents, we examined the associations between acculturation orientations and lay beliefs about emotional problems as well as attitudes toward mental health care. Method: In total, 349 pairs of parents and their adolescent children participated in our study (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese-Dutch, 87 Turkish-Dutch, 82 Moroccan-Dutch). A vignette was used to examine participants' lay beliefs. Results: Immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents differed in their lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care, whereas hardly any differences were revealed among their children. Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch parents showed more passive and fewer active solutions to emotional problems compared to native Dutch parents. Additionally, Moroccan-Dutch and Surinamese-Dutch parents reported greater fear of mental health care compared to native Dutch parents. Furthermore, the results showed that immigrant Dutch parents who were more strongly oriented toward the Dutch culture reported less fear of mental health care. Conclusion: Our results showed clear differences in lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents but not between their children. Substantial differences were also found between parents from different immigrant Dutch populations as well as within the population of immigrant Dutch parents.

AB Objectives: It is imperative that individual differences in the cultural contexts of adolescent mothers, whose parenting is often linked to poor child outcomes, be better understood, especially among Puerto Rican-origin mothers who experience high rates of poverty. Behaviors that mothers use to elicit compliance from their children are important to investigate, because children's ability to engage in regulated, compliant behavior has long-term consequences for their adjustment. This study tested whether mothers' orientation to both American and Latino cultures influenced the associations between such maternal behaviors and compliant and defiant child behaviors. Method: The sample included 123 young, Puerto Rican-origin mothers and their 24-month-old toddlers. Behaviors coded from a toy cleanup task measured maternal guidance and control and child compliance and defiance, and acculturation and enculturation were measured with a self-report questionnaire. Results: Maternal guidance predicted more child compliance, with no significant variations by cultural orientation; however, mothers who were more enculturated had children who were more compliant. As predicted, mothers' more frequent use of control was related to more child defiance for mothers reporting high levels of acculturation, and not for less acculturated mothers. Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that individual differences in cultural orientation influence variations in associations between certain maternal and child behaviors.

AB People often seek to regulate their affective reactions when confronted with hassles. Hassle reactivity is lower for people with higher cognitive control, presumably because of better affect regulation. Many adolescents, however, show higher hassle reactivity than children, despite better cognitive control. The present study aims to understand whether motivational differences when seeking to regulate affective experiences moderate the association between cognitive control and hassle reactivity in adolescence. We hypothesized that higher cognitive control is related to lower hassle reactivity only for adolescents with a strong hedonic orientation, that is, for adolescents who seek to maintain or enhance positive or to dampen negative affect. We investigated 149 boys' (age range: 10-20 years) hedonic orientation and affect reactivity toward daily hassles during 2 weeks of experience sampling. Higher cognitive control, assessed with a working memory battery in the laboratory, was associated with stronger hassle reactivity in individuals with low hedonic orientation. The more hedonic-oriented individuals were, the lower was their hassle reactivity, but only in combination with high cognitive control. Our findings illustrate that higher cognitive control is not always related to lower hassle reactivity. Rather, when daily hassles compromise affect balance, hedonic orientation is equally important to understand affect reactivity in adolescent boys.

AB Emotion regulation is assumed to play an important role in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. However, the role of core components of emotion regulation, such as emotional awareness, is not well understood so far. Thus this meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with emotional awareness in youth. A systematic literature search (PsycINFO, Medline, Google Scholar) identified 21 studies, from which 34 effect sizes were extracted. Results from random effects models showed that difficulties in emotional awareness were significantly correlated with a medium effect size for each, depressive and anxiety symptoms separately, and for their combined effects (overall outcome). Additionally, further analyses revealed that age was a significant moderator of the relationship between emotional awareness with depressive and anxiety symptoms, with younger samples (mean age <= 12 years) showing a stronger association between difficulties in emotional awareness and depressive and anxiety symptoms as compared to older samples (mean age > 12 years). The results suggest that emotional awareness may be of relevance for depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. Future work is required to examine longitudinal developments, moderators, and mediators in multi-method approaches. Moreover, children and adolescents may benefit from interventions that aim to enhance emotional awareness.

AB This study evaluated the effectiveness of a system-wide reform effort to implement trauma-informed care (Trauma Systems Therapy [TST)) across a large, private child welfare system. The longitudinal associations among implementation of TST and four measures of children's well-being (functioning, emotional regulation, and behavioral regulation) and placement stability were examined. A description of the implementation of TST can be found in a separate article in this issue. Latent growth curve models were estimated using child-level administrative data on children's well-being, placement stability, and exposure to TST dosage for 1499 children in out of-home placements. Results indicate that, as children's care teams implement TST, children demonstrate greater improvements in functioning, emotional regulation, and behavioral regulation and they experience increased placement stability. Moreover, results demonstrate that positive effects of implementation of TST are produced by both those who work closely with the child (caregivers, case managers, and therapists) and those who work more distally with the child (case manager supervisors and family service coordinators), suggesting that no one staff member or caregiver is central to providing trauma-informed care; rather it may be the confluence of the TST skills of the child's entire care team that produces better outcomes.

AB The study examined the social skills of 92 Russian children (males = 64) adopted by Italian families. The children, aged between 8 and 14 years, were compared with a control group of children who grew up with the biological family. Evaluation by both parents and children of the children's social competence were investigated. The results showed that, according to the parents' reports, the adopted children had more problems in social functioning than peers in the control group, along with a greater propensity to use maladaptive behaviors such as Oppositive Behavior, Rule-Breaking Behavior, Aggressive Behavior and Externalization. By contrast, according to the children's assessments, the adopted children were less aggressive and used prosocial behaviors to a greater extent than children raised in the biological family. The views of the parents and the children about the children's aggressive behavior were mutually conflicting. Finally, the influence of adoption related variables on the social competence of children was examined. Contrary to our expectations, there were no significant relationships between social competence and age of adoption, the duration of institutionalization and the time spent in the adoptive family.

AB Social anxiety and depression are common mental health problems among adolescents and are frequently comorbid. Primary aims of this study were to (1) elucidate the nature of individual differences in specific emotion regulation deficits among adolescents with symptoms of social anxiety and depression, and (2) determine whether repetitive negative thinking (RNT) functions as a transdiagnostic factor. A diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065) completed measures assessing emotion regulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. Results indicated that adolescents with high levels of social anxiety and depression symptoms reported decreased emotional awareness, dysregulated emotion expression, and reduced use of emotion management strategies. The hypothesized structural model in which RNT functions as a transdiagnostic factor exhibited a better fit than an alternative model in which worry and rumination function as separate predictors of symptomatology. Findings implicate emotion regulation deficits and RNT in the developmental psychopathology of youth anxiety and mood disorders.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent among adolescents and associated with various mental health problems and suicidality. Previous studies have found that certain personality traits are related to NSSI behavior, however only few studies examined personality traits in adolescents with NSSI. Our study aimed to assess the relationship between personality traits and emotional and behavioral problems in predicting repetitive NSSI among adolescents from a school sample.
   Methods: Four hundred and forty-seven students (M = 14.95 years, SD = 0.74, 52% male) completed self-report measures on NSSI, personality traits, and emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results: The past year prevalence of occasional and repetitive NSSI was 4.9% and 6.3% respectively. Repetitive NSSI was significantly associated with female gender, higher levels of age, novelty seeking, harm avoidance, self-transcendence, antisocial behavior, and positive self and lower levels of persistence and self-directedness in univariate analyses. However, multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that only high levels of antisocial behavior and low levels of self-directedness significantly predicted repetitive NSSI.
   Conclusions: The association between a lack of self-directedness and NSSI emphasizes the significance of targeting self-directedness in psychotherapy by strengthening self-awareness, affect tolerance and emotion regulation, as well as establishing and pursuing long-term goals.

AB Interactions between parents and children establish norms for managing emotions and behavior, which aremarkers of resilience. This study examines how features of interpersonal communication between parents and children facilitate the resilience of children of alcoholic parents versus nonalcoholic parents. Parent-adolescent dyads (30 families of alcoholics, 30 families of nonalcoholics) were invited to participate in two videotaped interactions, which were then rated for parental responsiveness and control and adolescent emotion regulation and behavioral impulsivity. Parental responsiveness was positively associated with emotion regulation, and parental control was negatively associated with emotion regulation and positively associated with impulsivity. Moderation analyses point to several notable differences in the effects for alcoholic versus nonalcoholic families.

AB Associations between variability in sympathetic nervous system arousal and individual differences in symptom severity were examined for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirty-four families participated in a laboratory visit that included continuous measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA) during a battery of naturalistic and structured parent-child, child alone, and direct testing tasks. Multiple indices of EDA were considered. Greater variability in EDA was associated with higher levels of ASD symptoms, with findings generally consistent across tasks. Intellectual functioning did not moderate the relation between EDA and ASD symptoms. Sympathetic arousal tendencies may represent an important individual difference factor for this population. Future directions and conceptualizations of EDA are discussed.

AB Recent studies on attachment in middle childhood suggest that dismissing children tend to underreport their psychological distress relative to physiological indices of distress. However, this has yet to be examined in the context of behavioral indicators of distress. In this longitudinal study, a community sample of children (N = 34, M (age) = 9.59 years) completed the Child Attachment Interview at Time 1. Three years later, they returned and completed the Trier Social Stress Task for Children (TSST-C), providing ratings of their state anxiety before and after the stressor. Four raters coded children's behavioral signs of anxiety (e.g., non-signaling gestures, eye movement, posture, facial expression) on a 7-point scale during the storytelling and arithmetic tasks in the TSST-C. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that greater attachment dismissal was associated with greater behavioral anxiety in both the story and math tasks, but was not associated with greater increases in self-reported anxiety. Dismissal prospectively predicted increased divergence of behavioral and self-reported anxiety, such that higher dismissal was associated with higher divergence scores (i.e., underreporting of anxiety relative to behavioral indicators). We discuss these results in terms of their contribution to understanding attachment and emotion in an understudied developmental phase.

AB There is a lack of psychometrically sound tools for measuring youth outcomes in out-of-school time (OST) settings. Consequently, behavior ratings completed by OST staff are being scored as though the raters were teachers, even though cross-informant correlations are notoriously low (meta-analysis r = .27). Across 26 schools, 227 students were assessed by both teachers and OST staff using the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to measure Social Emotional Competence. These 4th and 5th grade students were 50% male; 53% 5th graders; and 51% Latino, 20% Mixed/Other, 11% Black, 11% Asian, and 7% White. In the full sample, OST staff rated children's behavior more harshly than teachers (p < .001; d = .32), although the scores were associated (r = .31, p < .001). Among the ratings completed within the same week, teacher and staff distributions were not statistically different. Teacher and staff ratings had a "medium" correlation (r = .42; p = .01) and a classification consistency (88%) that exceeded chance by a "moderate" amount (kappa = .43). Few, if any, studies have previously compared the ratings of the same children by teachers and OST providers. Cross-informant inter-rater reliability between teachers and OST staff was higher than expected on the DESSA.

AB High prevalence rates of aggression during adolescence and associated adjustment difficulties for perpetrators and victims highlight the need for effective violence prevention programs. School-based prevention programs are advantageous as they occur in a key setting for youths' social and emotional development. The current study compared the efficacy of a combined universal violence prevention approach that included individual-level skill-building (i.e., lessons from Second Step) and school environment (i.e., Olweus Bullying Prevention Program; OBPP) interventions to OBPP alone. Participants were 231 sixth, seventh, and eighth graders (ages 11-15; M = 12.6, SD = 1.0) in middle school (48 % male, 67 % African American). A total of 14 classrooms were randomly assigned to the combined intervention (seven) or OBPP only comparison (seven) condition, split evenly across grades. Intervention effects were moderated by disability status and gender. Among students without disabilities those who received the combined intervention reported greater increases in anger regulation coping skills than those in the comparison condition. In contrast, among youth with disabilities greater increases in teacher-rated social skills were found for students in the combined intervention than students in the comparison condition at posttest. Gender-moderated effects included greater decreases in teacher ratings of externalizing problems and bullying behaviors for boys in the combined intervention versus the comparison condition at posttest. Study results inform school-based violence prevention programs and are discussed along with implications.

AB Background and Aim Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a frequent feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can be observed as a dysregulation profile or a deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) profile. Oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD) comorbidity is prevalent in ADHD and known to be related with ED. The first-line treatment of ADHD includes psychostimulants, but their effects on ED are not well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of methylphenidate (MPH) treatment on ED in ADHD + ODD/CD cases.
   Methods A total of 118 ADHD + ODD/CD patients with a mean age of 9.0 1.9 years were treated with MPH for 1 year. Also, parents of cases were recruited for a parent-training program, which initiated after first month of MPH treatment. Symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 12th month by Turgay Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Based Child and Adolescent Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale-Parent Form, Children Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist 4-18 years, and Parental Acceptance and Rejection Questionnaire-Mother Form.
   Results Emotional dysregulation (DESR + DP) was present in 85.6% of cases. Conduct disorder was significantly higher in patients with DP, whereas ODD was significantly higher in the DESR and non-ED groups (P < 0.0001). Symptoms of ADHD and ED were significantly improved with 1-year of MPH treatment (P < 0.05). The improvement in ED was independent of improvement in ADHD symptoms and parent training (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions Emotional dysregulation is highly prevalent in disruptive behavioral disorders as ODD and CD, which are comorbid with ADHD. The MPH treatment is effective on ED independently from other clinical determinants.

AB The effects of video games on children's psychosocial development remain the focus of debate. At two timepoints, 1 year apart, 194 children (7.27-11.43 years old; male = 98) reported their gaming frequency, and their tendencies to play violent video games, and to game (a) cooperatively and (b) competitively; likewise, parents reported their children's psychosocial health. Gaming at time one was associated with increases in emotion problems. Violent gaming was not associated with psychosocial changes. Cooperative gaming was not associated with changes in prosocial behavior. Finally, competitive gaming was associated with decreases in prosocial behavior, but only among children who played video games with high frequency. Thus, gaming frequency was related to increases in internalizing but not externalizing, attention, or peer problems, violent gaming was not associated with increases in externalizing problems, and for children playing approximately 8 h or more per week, frequent competitive gaming may be a risk factor for decreasing prosocial behavior. We argue that replication is needed and that future research should better distinguish between different forms of gaming for more nuanced and generalizable insight.

AB The Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) was specifically developed to assess mindfulness in children and adolescents. This study's main aim was to explore the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the CAMM using item response theory (IRT). We investigated how well each item of the CAMM concurred in measuring mindfulness in children and adolescents, the reliability of the scale in measuring different levels of a trait, and whether items showed gender and age differential item functioning (DIF). The scale's validity was tested by investigating the relationships of CAMM scores with emotion regulation, life satisfaction, and attention and depression problems. Our results confirmed the unidimensional structure of the scale and generated evidence that with a few exceptions, the items were able to discriminate well among respondents with different levels of the trait being measured and adequately covered the spectrum of the latent trait. Satisfactory information values were obtained for a substantial range of the trait, indicating that the Italian version of the CAMM is adequately reliable across the continuum of the trait. The entire scale appeared to be gender and age invariant and evidence of validity was provided. Using IRT, the current study provides information about the psychometric adequacy of the Italian version of the CAMM in measuring mindfulness in young people.

AB The most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence are anxiety disorders. Temperament in early childhood, parental psychopathology, and genetic disposition play a central role in the development of anxiety. Aspects of emotion regulation and abnormalities of attachment patterns are increasingly the topics of discussion. Anxiety disorders often occur in combination with internalizing disorders (e.g., depression) as well as externalizing behavior (e.g., aggression). A transdiagnostic approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders appears to be especially promising.

AB We compared the mentoring experiences and mental health and behavioral outcomes associated with program-supported mentoring for 125 Aboriginal (AB) and 734 non-Aboriginal (non-AB) youth ages 6-17 participating in a national survey of Big Brothers Big Sisters community mentoring relationships. Parents or guardians reported on youth mental health and other outcomes at baseline (before youth were paired to a mentor) and at 18 months follow-up. We found that AB youth were significantly less likely than non-AB youth to be in a long-term continuous mentoring relationship. However, AB youth were more likely than non-AB youth to be in a long-term relationship ending in dissolution. AB youth were also more likely than non-AB youth to have been mentored by a female adult. AB youth were significantly more likely than non-AB youth to report a high quality mentoring relationship, regular weekly contact with their mentor, and monthly mentoring activities. Structural equation model results revealed that, relative to non-mentored AB youth, AB youth with mentors experienced significantly fewer emotional problems and symptoms of social anxiety. These relationships were not found for non-AB youth. Our findings suggest that mentoring programs may be an effective intervention for improving the health and well-being of AB youth.

AB Hypersexuality, or extreme normophilic sexual urges and behaviors, is a controversial construct that was recently considered as a candidate disorder for the DSM-5 and was rejected. It was also rejected for inclusion in Section III (Conditions for Further Study). Nonetheless, it has been found to be an important predictor of recidivism among sex offenders, and it continues to be discussed widely in the literature. In the present study, we investigated the developmental roots of this construct in a sample of 529 adult male sexual offenders, who were administered the Multidimensional Assessment of Sex and Aggression. Physical, psychological, and sexual abuse experiences were estimated using several scales of early development. Psychological abuse in childhood and adolescence, especially by a father, was found to be the most prominent predictor of sub sequent hypersexual thoughts and behaviors. The accumulation of abuse types, however, was also associated with a monotonic increase in the latent trait of hyper sexuality. The consequences of these results for conceptualizations of the construct are discussed.

AB Parenting and attachment are critical in the emergence of self-regulation (SR) in preschool. However, most studies use general indexes of parenting quality, failing to explore the unique contributions of sensitivity and home quality to SR. Further, the nature of the interplay between parenting and attachment history is not well understood. Using a sample of 938 children from The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, a series of structural equation models were fit to determine whether sensitivity and home quality concurrently predicted SR at 54 months, and whether attachment mediated or moderated these pathways. Results suggest that both sensitivity and home quality uniquely predict SR. Further, these early parenting variables were each indirectly associated with SR through children's attachment history. That is, higher levels of sensitivity and home quality predicted secure attachment history, which, along with parenting, predicted more advanced SR skills at 54 months. No moderated pathways emerged, suggesting that attachment history may be best conceptualized as a mediating mechanism.

AB The parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P) is a widely used scale that assesses children's and adolescents' strengths and difficulties. The present study applied this scale to Italian adolescents and compared the current results with previous Chinese findings and the United Kingdom norm. Participants were 422 Italian parents and their adolescent children. Parents and adolescents answered the parent-report and the self-report SDQ, respectively. Results showed that the five-factor first-order model was better than other competing models. Cronbach's alpha of emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, prosocial behavior, and total difficulties was .63, .52, .69, .51, .59, and .77 respectively for mother-report measure, and .67, .48, .67, .46, .55, and .79 respectively for father-report measure. Parent-adolescent agreements ranged from low to medium, whereas mother-father agreements were large. Parents did not rate boys and girls as well as early-adolescence and mid-adolescence differently. Italian parents rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity, peer problems, total difficulties, and higher levels of prosocial behavior than Chinese parents; and Italian mothers rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity than United Kingdom parents. In conclusion, the current findings suggest both strengths and inadequacies of the SDQ-P for Italian adolescents.

AB Objective: We investigated cognitive reappraisal in children with ADHD by means of the late positive potential (LPP) and self-report ratings. We expected diminished LPP modulation following reappraisal and lower self-report scores in children with ADHD.
   Methods: Eighteen children with ADHD and 24 typically developing (TD) children (8-12 years) performed a cognitive reappraisal task, while EEG was recorded, and filled out a questionnaire on cognitive reappraisal.
   Results: Despite the lack of main reappraisal effects on LPP, the LPP was less positively modulated during reappraisal in ADHD compared to TD children.
   Conclusions: Children with ADHD reported less use of reappraisal and could be distinguished from TD children based on LPP modulation. However the lack of main effects of reappraisal on LPP in both groups hinders clear interpretation of this finding and questions the suitability of LPP modulation within the current paradigm as a neural index of reappraisal in children 8-12 years old, and warrants further research on the inter-individual variability and sensitivity of LPP modulation as a neural index of emotion regulation in children.
   Significance: This is the first study investigating the LPP during cognitive reappraisal in children with ADHD. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rumination and worry have recently been grouped under the broader transdiagnostic construct of repetitive thought (Watkins, 2008). The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of scales used to assess repetitive thinking across a broad range of contexts: depression, anxiety, trauma, stress, illness, interpersonal difficulties, positive affect, and so forth. We also include scales developed or adapted for children and adolescents. In the extant literature, measures of repetitive thinking generally show small-to-moderate correlations with measures of psychopathology. This review highlights problems with the content validity of existing instruments; for example, confounds between repetitive thought and symptomatology, metacognitive beliefs, and affect. This review also builds on previous reviews by including newer transdiagnostic measures of repetitive thinking. We hope that this review will help to expand our understanding of repetitive thinking beyond the mood and anxiety disorders, and suggest ways forward in the measurement of repetitive thinking in individuals with comorbid conditions.

AB Consistent with Response Styles Theory, this study aimed to examine the prospective associations between changes in response styles and depressive symptoms during mid-adolescence, with a focus on gender differences. A 2-year longitudinal study was conducted consisting of three waves, each separated by 1 year. The participants were 663 Spanish adolescents (M = 13.50, SD = .75) who individually completed the Children's Depression Inventory-Short and a short version of the Children's Response Styles Scale. Girls showed higher rumination and lower distraction than boys and more depressive symptoms. A multivariate latent growth curve model indicated that the increase in depressive symptoms during mid-adolescence in girls was associated with an increase in rumination and a decrease in distraction. After a 2-year follow-up, changes in response styles to negative affect (in rumination and distraction independently and in the ratio score) were interrelated with the changes in depressive symptoms in adolescent girls.

AB Exposure to trauma in childhood is associated with elevated risk for multiple forms of psychopathology. Here we present a biopsychosocial model outlining the mechanisms that link child trauma with psychopathology and protective factors that can mitigate these risk pathways. We focus on four mechanisms of enhanced threat processing: information processing biases that facilitate rapid identification of environmental threats, disruptions in learning mechanisms underlying the acquisition of fear, heightened emotional responses to potential threats, and difficulty disengaging from negative emotional content. Supportive relationships with caregivers, heightened sensitivity to rewarding and positive stimuli, and mature amygdalaprefrontal circuitry each serve as potential buffers of these risk pathways, highlighting novel directions for interventions aimed at preventing the onset of psychopathology following child trauma.

AB Using a multi-method approach, this study examined differences in parental meta-emotional philosophy (including, parental emotional awareness and emotion coaching) for families with anxiety disordered (AD; n = 74) and non-AD (n = 35) children (aged 7 to 15). Further, it was investigated whether children's emotion regulation (ER) varied across the AD and non-AD groups. Parent(s) were interviewed about their awareness of emotions and emotion coaching; completed a battery of questionnaires that included a measure assessing children's emotion regulation; and engaged in a parent-child discussion task. Results indicated that compared to parents of non-AD youth, parents of AD youth were less aware of their own emotions and their children's emotions, and these results varied by emotion type. Parents of AD youth engaged in significantly less emotion coaching than parents of non-AD youth. AD youth were identified as having significantly greater difficulty regulating their emotions when compared to non-AD youth. Implications for the role of parental meta-emotional philosophy and AD youth's emotion regulation are discussed.

AB This study aimed to analyze the prospective associations during adolescence between depressive symptoms and response styles to positive affect and to examine gender differences. A longitudinal study was conducted with three waves separated by 1 year each to assess a non-clinical sample of 622 Spanish adolescents who were 13 and 14 years old (50.2% boys, 49.8% girls). The participants completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms and responses to positive affect (emotion-focused positive rumination, self-focused positive rumination and dampening of positive emotion). The results showed that the increase in depressive symptoms was associated with an increase in dampening and decreases in emotion-focused and self-focused positive rumination. Furthermore, girls presented more depressive symptoms, as well as higher dampening and lower self-focused positive rumination, than boys. The conclusions highlight the need to consider responses to positive affect in explaining gender differences in depressive symptoms during mid adolescence, as well as in designing prevention programs.

AB Background: Childhood maltreatment is a potent predictor of poor mental health across the life span. We argue that there is a need to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that confer psychiatric vulnerability following maltreatment, if we are to progress from simply treating those with a manifest disorder, to developing effective preventative approaches that can help offset the likelihood that such disorders will emerge in the first place. Methods: We review extant functional neuroimaging studies of children and adolescents exposed to early neglect and/or maltreatment, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse across four neurocognitive domains: threat processing, reward processing, emotion regulation and executive control. Findings are discussed in the context of 'latent vulnerability', where alterations in neurocognitive function are considered to carry adaptive value in early adverse caregiving environments but confer long-term risk. Results: Studies on threat processing indicate heightened as well as depressed neural responsiveness in maltreated samples, particularly in the amygdala, thought to reflect threat hypervigilance and avoidance respectively. Studies on reward processing generally report blunted neural response to anticipation and receipt of rewards, particularly in the striatum, patterns associated with depressive symptomatology. Studies on emotion regulation report increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during active emotion regulation, possibly reflecting greater effortful processing. Finally, studies of executive control report increased dorsal ACC activity during error monitoring and inhibition. Conclusions: An emerging body of work indicates that altered neurocognitive functioning following maltreatment: (a) is evident even in the absence of overt psychopathology; (b) is consistent with perturbations seen in individuals presenting with psychiatric disorder; (c) can predict future psychiatric symptomatology. These findings suggest that maltreatment leads to neurocognitive alterations that embed latent vulnerability to psychiatric disorder, establishing a compelling case for identifying those children at most risk and developing mechanistically informed models of preventative intervention. Such interventions should aim to offset the likelihood of any future psychiatric disorder.

AB Although the consensus view is that Agreeableness originates from childhood difficultness and regulatory deficits, few studies have investigated such assumptions longitudinally. In this study, we examined this issue by assessing enduring and mediating effects of self-regulation as well as the impact of parenting behaviors on the development of Agreeableness from preschool to late adolescence. Longitudinal data from 965 Norwegian families following children from 1.5 years to 16.5 years were used. Path analyses revealed childhood difficultness at age 4 to be related to Agreeableness at age 16.5; this effect was mediated through emotion regulation in late childhood. However, such mediation effects were primarily found when parents used punitive practices towards their children. Our findings point to personality coherence throughout development.

AB Social withdrawal, or refraining from social interaction in the presence of peers, places adolescents at risk of developing emotional problems like anxiety and depression. The personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness also relate to emotional difficulties. For example, high conscientiousness predicts lower incidence of anxiety disorders and depression, while high neuroticism relates to greater likelihood of these problems. Based on these associations, socially withdrawn adolescents high in conscientiousness or low in neuroticism were expected to have lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Participants included 103 adolescents (59 % female) who reported on their personality traits in 8th grade and their anxiety and depressive symptoms in 9th grade. Peer ratings of social withdrawal were collected within schools in 8th grade. A structural equation model revealed that 8th grade withdrawal positively predicted 9th grade anxiety and depressive symptoms controlling for 8th grade anxiety and depressive symptoms, but neuroticism did not. Conscientiousness moderated the relation of withdrawal with depressive symptoms but not anxiety, such that high levels of conscientiousness attenuated the association between withdrawal and depressive symptoms. This buffering effect may stem from the conceptual relation between conscientiousness and self-regulation. Conscientiousness did not, however, moderate the association between withdrawal and anxiety, which may be partly due to the role anxiety plays in driving withdrawal. Thus, a conscientious, well-regulated personality partially protects withdrawn adolescents from the increased risk of emotional difficulties.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to investigate potential bidirectional relationships between sport participation and mental health during early adolescence. Methods: Data were taken from wave 5 (2012) and wave 6 (2014) of the K cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. In total, there were 4023 participants (mean age = 12.41 yr, SD = 0.49 yr, at baseline), and this sample was followed up 24 months later. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine bidirectional relationships between sport participation (hours per week for team, individual, and total sport participation) and mental health (total psychological difficulties, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems) as measured by the parent-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: Bidirectional relationships were evident between time involved in sport and overall mental health (Sport(12 ->)SDQ(14): beta = -0.048; SDQ(12 ->)Sport(14): beta = -0.062). Bidirectional relationships were also evident between time involved in sport participation and internalizing (social and emotional) problems (Sport(12 ->)SDQ(14): beta = -0.068; SDQ(12 ->)Sport(14): beta = -0.067). The relationship between time in organized sport and externalizing problems (conduct problems and inattention/hyperactivity problems) was not bidirectional. Externalizing problems predicted later sports participation (beta = -0.039), but not vice versa. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate bidirectional relationships between sport participation and adolescent mental health. The design and implementation of youth sport programs should maximize mental health benefits, and programs should be designed, implemented, and marketed to be attractive to participants with poor psychosocial health.

AB Background: Against the background that crystal methamphetamine (colloquially known as "tik") is extensively used by the emerging working class Coloured youth in Cape Town, South Africa, this exploratory qualitative study was conducted to explore the experience of mothers whose children use methamphetamine.
   Methods: The researchers conducted one-to-one semi-structured in-depth interviews with sixteen (16) purposively selected caregivers (mothers) whose sons use methamphetamine. Interviews were recorded and simultaneously translated and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to the experiences of caregivers of youth with methamphetamine problems.
   Results: Findings showed that youth misbehaviour provided a context that led to feelings of shame and embarrassment. Participants also experienced personal challenges which included emotional problems, fear and self-blame. Participants also expressed family disruptions and financial drain as adverse experiences as a results of their sons' misbehaviour.
   Conclusion: The study results highlight the psychosocial challenges for caregivers of children who use methamphetamine. These findings underscore the need for effort to be directed at the development of formal support interventions for mothers of youth who are troubled with addiction.

AB Background: Violence against and among children is a global public health problem that annually affects 50% of youth worldwide with major impacts on child development, education, and health including increased probability of major causes of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. It is also associated with the experience of and perpetration of later violence against women. The aim of this article is to describe the intervention, study design, methods, and baseline findings of a cluster randomized controlled trial underway in Pakistan to evaluate a school-based play intervention aiming to reduce peer violence and enhance mental health.
   Methods: A cluster randomized controlled design is being conducted with boys and girls in grade 6 in 40 schools in Hyderabad, Pakistan, over a period of 2 years. The Multidimensional Peer-Victimization and Peer Perpetration Scales and the Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI 2) are being used to measure the primary outcomes while investigator-derived scales are being used to assess domestic violence within the family. Specifics of the intervention, field logistics, ethical, and fidelity management issues employed to test the program's impact on school age youth in a volatile and politically unstable country form this report.
   Baseline Results: A total of 1,752 school-age youth were enrolled and interviewed at baseline. Over the preceding 4 weeks, 94% of the boys and 85% of the girls reported 1 or more occurrences of victimization, and 85% of the boys and 66% of the girls reported 1 or more acts of perpetration. Boys reported more depression compared with girls, as well as higher negative mood and self-esteem scores and more interpersonal and emotional problems.
   Interpretation: Globally, prevalence of youth violence perpetration and victimization is high and associated with poor physical and emotional health. Applying a randomized controlled design to evaluate a peer violence prevention program built on a firm infrastructure and that is ready for scale-up and sustainability will make an important contribution to identifying evidence-informed interventions that can reduce youth victimization and perpetration.

AB Background: Adolescent bullying is associated with a range of adversities for those who are bullied i.e., victims and bully-victims (e.g., those who bully others and get victimised), including reduced psychological functioning and eating disorder symptoms. Bullies are generally well-adjusted psychologically, but previous research suggests that bullies may also engage in problematic diet behaviours. This study investigates a) whether adolescents involved in bullying (bullies, victims, bully-victims) are at increased risk of weight loss preoccupation, b) whether psychological functioning mediates this relationship and c) whether sex is a key moderator.
   Method: A two-stage design was used. In stage 1, adolescents (n = 2782) from five UK secondary schools were screened for bullying involvement using self and peer reports. In stage 2, a sample of bullies, victims, bully-victims and uninvolved adolescents (n = 767) completed a battery of assessments. The measures included the eating behaviours component of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, which was reduced to one factor (weight loss preoccupation) and used as the outcome variable. Measures of self-esteem, body-esteem and emotional problems were reduced to a latent (mediator) variable of psychological functioning. Multi-group analysis examined the effects of sex and all models were adjusted for covariates (BMI, pubertal stage, age, parental education and ethnicity).
   Results: Bullies, victims and bully-victims were at increased risk of weight loss preoccupation compared to adolescents uninvolved in bullying. The mechanism by which bullying involvement related to increased weight loss preoccupation varied by bullying role: in bullies the effect was direct, in victims the effect was indirect (via reduced psychological functioning) and in bully-victims the effect was both direct and indirect. Sex significantly moderated the relationship in bullies: weight loss preoccupation was only statistically significant in bullies who were boys.
   Conclusion: Bullying involvement during adolescence is associated with weight loss preoccupation. Bullies are likely driven by a desire to increase attractiveness and social status; whereas weight loss preoccupation in bullied adolescents may have maladaptive influences on diet and exercise behaviours due to its association with reduced psychological functioning. Future research should consider peer victimisation as a potential modifiable risk factor for reduced psychological functioning and weight loss preoccupation, which if targeted, may help to prevent maladaptive diet and exercise behaviours.

AB This study aimed to evaluate an intervention programme for the enhancement of social-emotional well-being of young children through improving the social-emotional competence of kindergarten teachers and a specifically designed curriculum, in an urban city in the East Asia region. The design and some preliminary results on the outcome evaluations of the intervention programme are reported in this paper. The design of the intervention programme was based on the conceptual framework of the evidence-based Wisconsin Pyramid Model for Supporting Social Emotional Competence in Infants and Young Children. Kindergarten teachers and children under their care were recruited using a random cluster sampling technique with teachers undergoing a training programme for 2 months with hands on workshops. The social-emotional well-being of preschool children was assessed with the Social Competence and Behavioural Evaluation (SCBE-30) Scale pre-and post-intervention. Changes in outcome measures that compared assessments between baseline and post-intervention were analysed with adjustment to clustering effects. Results suggested a statistically significant improvement in social competence and reduction to anxiety-withdrawal and anger-aggression after intervention. These results were indicative of a potentially successful intervention programme that would require a proper trail to establish its efficacy.

AB Background. Previous work demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of attachment anxiety are prone to increased binge eating (Alexander & Siegel, 2013). Given that our society rejects obese individuals and individuals with higher levels of attachment anxiety tend to be highly sensitive to rejection (Downey & Feldman, 1996), it follows that those with increased attachment anxiety may be especially fearful of becoming fat.
   Methods. Undergraduate psychology students = 148) completed surveys measuring attachment, binge eating, and fear of becoming fat.
   Results. The data demonstrate that attachment anxiety is positively associated with a fear of becoming fat (beta =.30, p < .001) and binge eating mediates this relationship. In other words, binge eating underlies the fear of becoming fat.
   Discussion. These findings contribute to a more refined understanding of binge eating which may create pathways for professionals to develop targeted interventions.

AB The far-reaching impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on a person's life is well documented, yet PTSD often goes undetected and untreated. Previous literature suggests that there may be particular challenges in assessing PTSD in children and adolescents. There is evidence that once PTSD has been identified, a trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) approach is effective at treating PTSD in young people. Where PTSD in adolescents presents in response to multiple traumas it may be necessary to make some modifications to treatment protocols. This might include offering more sessions, extending the stabilization period, addressing common trauma themes, and tackling additional issues that may arise beyond a simple PTSD presentation. This single-case quasi-experimental design (n=1) details the assessment (phase A) and treatment with individualized TF-CBT (phase B) of previously undiagnosed PTSD in response to multiple events in an adolescent girl who had been seen by several mental health professionals previously. The paper is also a clinical case report, paying particular attention to how PTSD was assessed and what other factors, for example emotion regulation, self-esteem and relationships, were found to be important. Trauma, anxiety and depression were measured with the Child PTSD Symptom Scale and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. Scores reduced from clinically significant to non-clinical levels by the end of treatment, with these gains being maintained at 3-month follow-up. Suggestions are made around assessing and treating trauma responses in young people, especially where PTSD exists in response to multiple traumas.

AB This study utilized a multimethod approach (self-reported affect, observed behavior, and psychophysiology) to investigate differences between clinically depressed and nondepressed adolescents across three different affective interaction contexts with their parents. A total of 152 adolescents (52 males, 14-18 years old), and their parents, participated in a laboratory session in which they discussed positive and negative aspects of their relationship and reminisced on positive and negative memories. We found that across contexts depressed adolescents exhibited higher negative affect and behaviors, lower positive behaviors, and greater autonomic and sympathetic activity. Context-specific findings indicated that (a) depressed adolescents exhibited greater persistence of negative affect and dysphoric behavior across the sequence of tasks, whereas these phenomena declined among their nondepressed peers; (b) depressed adolescents had greater increases in aggressive behaviors during negative interactions; and (c) depressed adolescents had greater parasympathetic withdrawal during negative interactions, whereas this response characterized the nondepressed group during positive interactions.

AB There is growing interest in understanding how beliefs about emotion regulation are related to individual emotional experiences. Extant studies have mainly focused on explicit beliefs about emotion regulation among individuals in Western societies. The current study examined implicit emotion regulation and explored their contributions to emotional outcomes in 147 Chinese adolescents. Participants were tested on their implicit beliefs about emotion regulation and their negative emotion experiences. Results showed that the down-regulation was implicitly evaluated as more positive than up-regulation. Moreover, positive implicit beliefs about down-regulation increased with age. Among younger adolescents, those who evaluated down-regulation more positively had less negative emotional experiences. These results suggest that down-regulation may have important implications in Chinese culture.

AB The purpose of the current study was to understand the association between bullying experiences (i. e., bullying, victimization, and defending) and social, emotional, and cognitive factors. The social factor was social skills (i. e., empathy, assertion, cooperation, responsibility); the emotional factor was emotional difficulties (i. e., personal adjustment, internalizing problems, school problems), and the cognitive factor was executive functioning skills (i. e., selfmonitoring, inhibitory control, flexibility, emotional regulation). Data on students' perceptions of their own social skills, emotional difficulties, and bullying role behavior were collected from 246 sixth through eighth grade students. Teachers provided reports of students' executive functioning skills. Results indicated that (a) emotional difficulties were significantly and positively associated with victimization for boys and girls, (b) emotional difficulties were significantly and positively associated with defending for girls, (c) executive functioning was significantly and negatively associated with defending for boys, and (d) social skills were significantly and positively related to defending behavior for boys and girls. These results emphasize the importance of examining the social, emotional, and cognitive factors associated with bullying. Social skills and emotional and executive functioning appear to vary systematically across bullying roles and should be considered when developing targeted social emotional interventions to stop bullying, increase defending, and support victims or those at risk for victimization.

AB Introduction. - The contribution of the learning climate and attachment security to students' academic competence and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition has not been examined.
   Objectives. - The main purpose of this prospective study was to examine the complementary contributions of these two contextual determinants. A second goal was to test the moderating effect of attachment security perceived by students in the relationship between the learning climate and both outcomes (academic competence, anxiety symptoms).
   Method and results. - Participants were 627 students in Grade 6 (54% girls). Latent structural modeling analysis revealed that a mastery climate predicted higher levels of perceived academic competence perceived in the first year of middle school, although attachment security to the mother in Grade 6 predicted perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms in the first year of middle school. A moderating effect was found, in which greater attachment security to the mother appeared to lessen the relationship between a performance climate and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition.
   Conclusion. - The results suggest that attachment security to the mother predicts perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition. Additionally, attachment security to the mother can moderate the potentially harmful effects of a learning climate emphasizing social comparison and performance on anxiety.

AB This study aimed at determining whether adolescents and young adults use music as an agent of consolation when dealing with daily sorrow and stress. We furthermore tested whether three aspects of music listening, i.e., the music itself, its lyrics, and experiences of closeness to artists and fans, were experienced as comforting. Third, we explored whether consolation through music listening was related to music use and psychological problems. Overall, 1,040 respondents, age 13-30 years (M = 20.3, 70.7% female), responded to items measuring listening hours, music importance, music preferences, positive and negative affects elicited by music (PANAS), internalizing and externalizing problems, and consolation through music. Slightly over 69% reported that they (definitely) use music as a source of consolation. Furthermore, female respondents and respondents with higher levels of anxiousness/depression and lower levels of aggression sought consolation by music more often. The same result emerged for respondents with a preference for chart pop music, for those who found music important, and for those with stronger emotional reactions to music. Music's consoling effects were reported as resulting particularly from the sound and texture of the music itself, from attribution of personal meaning to music's lyrics, and, to a lesser extent, from perceptions of closeness to artists and other listeners.

AB The present cross-sectional study tested a portion of the tripartite model of familial impacts on self-regulation (Morris et al., 2007) in reference to social competence during early adulthood. N = 302 young adults ages 18 to 24 years (64.9% female; 80.4% European American; 10% Hispanic) were recruited through Mechanical Turk (n = 254) and the local community (n = 48). All participants responded to anonymous online questionnaires about self-regulation, parenting practices, and interpersonal competence with same-sex peers and romantic partners. High parental acceptance and low psychological control were linked to high levels of self-regulation. High social competence in both relationship types was associated with high acceptance and self-regulation; lifetime romantic relationship experience also covaried with high romantic competence. Findings suggest that the tripartite model is applicable to interpersonal competence in emerging adulthood. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Researchers have called for increased evaluation of the processes that contribute to African American children's successful emotional development in the face of discrimination. Parents' racial/ethnic and emotion socialization have been linked to children's emotional adaption. Although few studies have explicitly evaluated their joint influence on African American children's emotion adaptation, researchers studying racial and ethnic socialization have indirectly incorporated emotion socialization through evaluating parents' guided emotion regulation strategies as ways to cope with discrimination. Similarly, researchers who study emotion socialization have described emotion socialization practices among African American parents as intentionally preparing children for racial bias regarding how others perceive their emotions. In this article, we synthesize two separate and emerging literatures-the racial/ethnic socialization literature and the literature on emotion socialization among African American families- and outline a conceptual model illustrating the overlap in the two constructs and their joint influence on African American children's social-emotional adjustment.

AB Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) experience significant difficulties in attention, learning, executive functions, and behavioral regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that computerized cognitive training may remediate these impairments. In a double blind controlled trial, 76 children with IDD (4-11 years) were randomized to either an attention training (n = 38) or control program (n = 38). Both programs were completed at home over a 5-week period. Outcome measures assessed literacy, numeracy, executive functioning, and behavioral/emotional problems, and were conducted at baseline, post-training, and 3-month follow-up. No training effects were observed at post-training; however, children in the training group showed greater improvements in numeracy skills at the 3-month follow-up. These results suggest that attention training may be beneficial for children with IDD; however, the modest nature of the intervention effects indicate that caution should be taken when interpreting clinical significance.

AB Children's emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms are known to be affected by a range of individual (parent, child) and systemic (parent-child, marital, and family) characteristics. The current study builds on this literature by examining the unique role of coparental affect in children's emotion dysregulation, and whether this association mediates the link between parent and child depressive symptoms. Participants were 51 mother-father-child triads with children aged 7 to 12 (M age=9.24years). Triads discussed a time when the child felt sad and a time when the child felt happy. Maternal and paternal displays of positive affect were coded, and sequential analyses examined the extent to which parents were congruent in their displays of positive affect during the emotion discussions. Results indicated that interparental positive affect congruity (IPAC) during the sadness discussion, but not the happiness discussion, uniquely predicted parent-reported child emotion dysregulation, above and beyond the contributions of child negative affect and parental punitive reactions. The degree of IPAC during the sadness discussion and child emotion dysregulation mediated the association between maternal, but not paternal, depressive symptoms and child depressive symptoms. Findings highlight the unique role of coparental affect in the socialization of sadness in youth and offer initial support for low levels of IPAC as a risk factor for the transmission of depressive symptoms in youth.

AB The study by media psychologists of emotional communication in online bereavement still leaves many questions unanswered. Previous research has identified similarities as well as differences in emotion regulation patterns of children, adolescents, and adults (Doveling 2015a). Extending that research, this investigation of digitally mediated bereavement goes one step further by exploring additional types of mechanisms within the emotion regulatory processes of coping online. A total of 4 different bereavement platforms, used by mourners of differing ages and kinds of losses, from young children to widowers, were examined in a quantitative content analysis of online postings (N = 1036), generating insights into shared emotion regulation patterns and intimacy online. The findings highlight interpersonal empathy, irrespective of age of the bereaved or type of loss, but also disclose age-based differences in emotion regulatory processes. Implications for further media psychological analysis are laid out.

AB Objective This study evaluated direct and indirect associations between aerobic fitness, executive control, and emotion regulation among a community sample of preadolescent children. Methods Two-hundred and seventy-eight children aged 8-12 years completed measures of aerobic fitness (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) and executive control (Stroop Test). Parents completed questionnaires assessing child emotion regulation and executive control (Emotion Regulation Checklist; Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire). We evaluated associations between these constructs using structural equation modeling. Results Study findings supported a moderate direct association between childhood aerobic fitness and executive control, a strong direct negative association between executive control and emotion regulation, and a moderate indirect association between aerobic fitness and emotion regulation through executive control. Conclusions These findings provide preliminary evidence that executive control functions as a mediator between aerobic fitness and emotion regulation and may help explain the mechanism by which aerobic exercise influences emotional well-being among preadolescent children.

AB Mindfulness-based interventions show consistent benefits in adults for a range of pathologies, but exploration of these approaches in youth is an emergent field, with limited measures of mindfulness for this population. This study aimed to investigate whether multifactor scales of mindfulness can be used in adolescents. A series of studies are presented assessing the performance of a recently developed adult measure, the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME) in 4 early adolescent samples. Study 1 was an investigation of how well the full adult measure (37 items) was understood by youth (N = 292). Study 2 piloted a revision of items in child friendly language with a small group (N = 48). The refined questionnaire for adolescents (CHIME-A) was then tested in Study 3 in a larger sample (N = 461) and subjected to exploratory factor analysis and a range of external validity measures. Study 4 was a confirmatory factor analysis in a new sample (N = 498) with additional external validity measures. Study 5 tested temporal stability (N = 120). Results supported an 8-factor 25-item measure of mindfulness in adolescents, with excellent model fit indices and sound internal consistency for the 8 subscales. Although the CFA supported an overarching factor, internal reliability of a combined total score was poor. The development of a multifactor measure represents a first step toward testing developmental models of mindfulness in young people. This in turn will aid construction of evidence based interventions that are not simply downward derivations of adult mindfulness programs.

AB The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of a culturally adapted version of the Strong Start intervention program on the social-emotional outcomes of African American male students. Externalizing behavior problems of children, specifically African American males, are of great concern for schools. Punitive discipline polices such as expulsion and suspension have proved to be ineffective and harmful. Consequently, school-based social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions have been proposed to teach children coping skills that can help them increase positive social behaviors and emotional regulation. Sixty-one African American male students enrolled in an urban elementary school participated in this intervention. This study employed a randomized delayed treatment control design. Results indicated positive effects in the areas of self-regulation and self-competence. However the intervention did not have an impact on student's empathy, responsibility, or externalizing behavior. Implications are discussed in terms of developing culturally relevant school-based interventions for African American males.

AB Positive psychology is the scientific study of positive emotions, positive thoughts and positive behaviors that serve as protective factors to help people bounce back and recover from stress. Fredrickson's broaden and build model postulates that positive emotions catalyze upward spirals toward future well-being by broadening people's positive thoughts and behaviors. This study investigated direct and interactional effects of emotional competence and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms among a sample of secondary school students in Hong Kong, China. A cross sectional survey design was adopted, and data was collected from 513 adolescents (197 males, 316 females, mean age=13.80) from four secondary schools. Results showed that dispositional optimism and emotional competence were significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms. In addition, emotional competence enhanced the protective effects of dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite their culture-specific meanings in the Chinese context, dispositional optimism and emotional competence were found to independently and jointly protect Chinese adolescents to offset depression, which lends empirical support to the cross-cultural validity of the two positive psychological constructs and the Broaden and Build model of positive emotions. This study sheds light on promoting a positive psychology model that includes both cognitive and emotional positive psychological factors for depression prevention or early intervention.

AB Objective: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of pharmacotherapies among children and adolescents diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia subgrouped according to their co-occurring psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort design was employed, using South Carolina's (USA) Medicaid claims dataset covering outpatient and inpatient medical services, between January, 1999 and December, 2013 to identify patients <= 17 years of age. Random effects regression analyses assessed differential changes in acute psychiatric service utilization over time across the 3 subgroups associated with antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, psychostimulant, or antidepressant pharmacotherapy.
   Results: For patients with schizophrenia and comorbid mood disorders or emotional dysregulation (Cluster 1), or schizophrenia and severe cognitive impairments (Cluster 2), those treated with monotherapy second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) over time demonstrated consistently lower use of acute psychiatric treatment services as did those coprescribed mood stabilizers, primarily lithium, or anticonvulsants. In all clusters, including the relatively homogenous subgroup of patients with early onset schizophrenia and few comorbid disorders, acute psychiatric service utilization was significantly higher and more variable over time for those prescribed multiple SGAs.
   Conclusions: Regardless of the specific constellation of symptoms and comorbid disorders targeted, the coprescription of multiple SGAs was not effective over time in stabilizing children and adolescents outside of acute care settings.

AB Objective: Given the greater severity and chronicity of psychiatric disorders that first declare in individuals under the age of 18, early onset schizophrenia (EOS) and its association with co-occurring psychiatric conditions deserve further investigation.
   Methods: Cluster and discriminant analyses were used to examine the heterogeneity of children and adolescents diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1 statewide system of care. A retrospective cohort design was employed, using South Carolina's (USA) Medicaid claims dataset covering outpatient and inpatient medical services between January, 1999 and December, 2013 to identify patients <= 17 years of age.
   Results: Among the 613 EOS patients selected, 3 main clusters of ICD-9 psychiatric diagnoses were identified: (1) older children with schizophrenia coaggregated with a spectrum of mood/emotional dysregulation conditions; (2) younger children with coaggregated schizophrenia, mental retardation/intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders; and (3) older children with schizophrenia and significantly fewer diagnosed co-occurring conditions. Externalizing/disruptive behavior disorders (i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder) were significantly associated with Clusters 1 and 2.
   Conclusion: Symptom patterns plus age of first diagnosis are important differentiators of EOS subgroups in this cohort. Earlier recognition of psychiatric symptom/syndrome patterns that frequently co-occur may enable clinicians to stratify/tailor treatment interventions.

AB Maternal depression is associated with an increased risk for depression in offspring; the factors explaining this association, however, are unclear. We examined coping in a group of 9-to 14-year-old daughters of mothers with and without a history of major depressive disorders. We tested whether daughters' adaptive coping mediated the association between mothers' and daughters' depressive symptoms, and whether these relations were moderated by daughters' pubertal status. Using moderated mediation analyses, higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms were related to less adaptive coping in daughters, which was related to higher levels of daughters' depressive symptoms. The mediating effect of coping was evident only for daughters in late stages of pubertal maturation. Early interventions aimed at strengthening coping in girls may have a protective effect on daughters' risk for depression at later pubertal stages.

AB QWe tested the hypothesis that indices of chronic self-regulatory stress specified by Social Action Theory (SAT; Ewart, 2011) and indices of affect specified by the Dynamic Model of Relapse (DMR; Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2004) predict daily alcohol use by persons in outpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Participants (69 men, 50 women; aged 19-76) in AUD outpatient programs completed 2 baseline laboratory assessments, then provided daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports of state affect and alcohol use for 28 days. SAT indices of chronic self-regulatory stress were obtained in the laboratory with the Social Competence Interview (SCI) and the Anger Transcendence Challenge (ATC). Chronic regulatory stress was indexed by blood pressure responses to both tasks. Emotion regulation capabilities were indexed by anger regulation behavior observed during ATC, and by self-ratings of recent positive social interactions and goal thoughts. DMR indices of trait and state affect were obtained with the General Psychiatric Distress scale of the Brief Symptom Inventory, the trait anger scale of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and intensive EMA ratings of state affect (anger, sadness, fear, happiness, stress) during each day. The outcomes were: (a) not drinking on a given day, and (b) number of drinks consumed when drinking. Statistical models accounting for problems of zero inflation in drinking data and missing data evaluated the hypothesis that " tonic" (cumulative) and phasic (situational) processes specified by the SAT and DMR models together shape drinking in a given moment. No drinking was reported on 91% of days; reports were missing on 7.2% of days. Both drinking outcomes were predicted by SAT indices of SCI self-directive stress, ATC anger regulation, positive goal cognitions and social interactions, and by DMR indices of general distress and state affect (sad, angry, stressed). Unexpected and potentially informative associations emerged also. The findings were robust under models that accounted for different missing data assumptions. Findings suggest that SAT and DMR models and methods may advance scientific understanding of drinking risk during outpatient AUD treatment.

AB Attachment-based theories and related research illustrate that emotion regulation develops in the context of a secure relationship between a child and caregiver. When a secure bond is broken, such as in the context of betrayal trauma, children fail to develop necessary emotion regulation skills which can lead to an array of relational problems. The current study examined the relations between betrayal trauma history, type of communication during a stressful interpersonal laboratory task, and emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of trauma-exposed adolescents. Results showed that adolescents with a betrayal trauma history reported more emotion regulation difficulties and exhibited more aggressive and fewer positive communication behaviors when engaged in a stressful interpersonal task with their mothers than did adolescents exposed only to nonbetrayal trauma. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relation between betrayal trauma history and negative communication. The clinical and developmental implications from these findings are discussed.

AB Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a marker of parasympathetic activity, has been shown to moderate the relation between adversity and child behavioral outcomes; however, this work has been conducted in primarily Caucasian samples and limited in focus to family-level adversity. The current analysis extends the previous literature to examine the co-contribution of exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), baseline RSA, and RSA withdrawal to internalizing and externalizing behavior in a sample of primarily African American youth (n = 92) recruited using neighborhood mapping techniques from communities high in epidemiological indicators of adversity. Exposure to PTEs was associated with lower baseline RSA. Complex interactions were observed between sex of the child, baseline RSA and RSA withdrawal, and PTE exposure predicting to internalizing behaviors. Among girls with high (4+) levels of PTEs, high baseline RSA and RSA withdrawal predicted higher internalizing; for RSA withdrawal only, the inverse was observed for girls with low PTE exposure, for whom high RSA withdrawal predicted lower internalizing. No associations were observed from RSA to externalizing, or among boys to internalizing. Findings are consistent with distinct patterns among primarily African American samples and suggest the need for sex-specific conceptualizations of the link between environmental adversity, physiological reactivity, and internalizing behaviors.

AB In this article, we investigated the extent and nature of informant discrepancies on parent- and adolescent self-report versions of a checklist measuring youth exposure to life stressors. Specifically, we examined (a) mean-level differences, relative consistency, and consensus for family-level and youth-specific stressors and (b) the utility of parent-youth discrepancies in accounting for variance in youth temperament and psychopathology. Participants were 106 parent- child dyads (47 male, 59 female; 90.6% mothers) aged 13 to 18 years old (M = 16.01, SD = 1.29). The results revealed evidence for both congruence and divergence in parent and youth reports, particularly with respect to respondents' accounts of youth-specific stressors. Discrepancies for youth-specific stressors were associated with adolescents' negative affectivity, surgency, effortful control, and internalizing problems. Discrepancies for youth stressors may therefore reveal individual differences in emotionality and self-regulation, thus reflecting meaningful variance in adolescents' functioning.

AB Previous research indicates that students who drop out of high school are at risk for a number of negative outcomes. Both ecological and individual risk factors contribute to students' propensity for dropout. This study examined the effectiveness of a targeted dropout prevention program at improving academic achievement and investigated whether improved social support and emotional competencies partially mediated the association between intervention participation and student outcomes. A sample of 110 middle and high school students (55 intervention participants and 55 students in a matched control group) completed surveys investigating their social-emotional assets and schools provided academic data for participants. Structural equation modeling revealed that students who participated in the program had higher academic achievement compared to the control group. Prior levels of academic achievement moderated the effectiveness of the program with students with low initial levels of academic achievement benefiting more. Emotional competencies and social support did not mediate the relation between participation and achievement. The intervention was related to improved academic achievement among participants; however, the means by which it was effective was unclear. Given the evidence that the program was more effective for some students than others, targeting interventions to meet specific needs of students may be advantageous. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The quality of parenting children receive affects a diverse range of child and youth outcomes. Addressing the quality of parenting on a broad scale is a critical part of producing a more nurturing society. To achieve a meaningful population-level reduction in the prevalence rates of child maltreatment and social and emotional problems that are directly or indirectly influenced by parenting practices requires the adoption of a broad ecological perspective in supporting families to raise children. We make the case for adopting a multilevel, whole of population approach to enhance competent parenting and describe the essential tasks that must be accomplished for the approach to be successful and its effects measurable. We describe how a theoretically integrated system of parenting support based on social learning and cognitive behavioral principles can be further strengthened when the broader community supports parental participation. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

AB Purpose of Review Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common mental health threat among adolescents. This review aims to present the current literature on epidemiology, etiology, and therapeutic approaches with a focus on the period of adolescence.
   Recent Findings NSSI is widespread among adolescents both in community as well as in clinical settings with lifetime prevalence rates between 17 and 60% in recent studies. It is influenced by multiple factors including social contagion, interpersonal stressors, neurobiological background, as well as emotional dysregulation and adverse experiences in childhood.
   Summary There is still a lack of studies regarding the psychotherapeutic as well as the psychopharmacological treatment of NSSI in adolescence. Furthermore, sufficient evidence for prevention programs is missing.

AB Research consistently chronicles a variety of mental health difficulties that plague institutionally reared children, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even if not all institutionalized children evince such problems. In seeking to extend work in this area, this research on gene x environment (GXE) interplay investigated whether the effect of the quality of institutional care-most notably, caregiver intrusiveness-on ADHD symptoms is moderated by the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism. One hundred and twenty-seven institutionalized preschoolers were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist. Caregiver-rated attention problems and hyperactivity were unrelated to both 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and caregiver intrusiveness. A significant GXE effect, independent of age at placement or duration of institutionalization, emerged, however, consistent with the differential-susceptibility hypothesis: s/s homozygotes manifest the most and least ADHD symptoms when they experienced, respectively, more and less intrusive caregiving. These results provide new insight into the reasons why some institutionalized children, but not others, exhibit ADHD symptoms.

AB Purpose: The use of foul language becomes increasingly popular among youth, yet scientific research on this topic is grossly missing in the literature. This longitudinal study examined the developmental change of foul language use and its relations to emotional competence, social competence, and moral competence over high school years.
   Methods: Data were from a six-year longitudinal study between grade 7 and grade 12 with an annual assessment on 3,328 Hong Kong adolescents (mean age = 12.59 +/- .74 years). Multiplegroup latent growth curve modeling based on six waves of longitudinal data were conducted.
   Results: Results showed that the use of foul language increased, but the increase rate slowed down over time; males showed faster increase rate yet faster deceleration than did females. In addition, changes in emotional competence, social competence, and moral competence negatively predicted the change in use of foul language across males and females, respectively.
   Conclusions: Adolescents are vulnerable to increasing their use of foul language. However, promoting emotional competence, social competence, and moral competence could be helpful to minimize the increasing trend of use of foul language. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Background: Irritability and emotion regulation are both important transdiagnostic factors that contribute to the development of internalizing symptoms during adolescence. The current study examined whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms.
   Methods: To examine this relationship we analysed the indirect effect of irritability (measured using a single item from the Goldberg Mania Questionnaire) on internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) via the mediator, emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale) in 112 adolescent females.
   Results: Mediation analysis, using bootstrapping, showed a significant indirect effect and suggests that the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms is mediated by emotion dysregulation.
   Limitations: These include measuring irritability using a single item and employing a cross sectional design.
   Conclusions: These novel findings add to our understanding of the processes and mechanisms by which irritability contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms.

AB Objective: Posttraumatic distress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) may coexist in trauma survivors, but there are mixed relationships between PTSD and PTG. To elucidate their relationship and constructs, it is necessary to examine simultaneously predictive factors, and to compare their determining factors. The aim of this study was to increasing our understanding the relationship between PTSD and PTG by examining simultaneously the role of social support and emotion regulation in PTSD and PTG among adolescents after the earthquake. Methods: Six months after the Ya'an earthquake, 315 middle school students in Lushan county were assessed using measures of trauma exposure, social support, and emotion regulation, as well as Child PTSD Symptom Scale and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Results: Social support had significant direct association with PTG but not with PTSD, but social support had a negative indirect prediction on PTSD and a positive indirect prediction on PTG through cognitive reappraisal. Social support, through expressive suppression, had a significant and indirect prediction on PTSD, but a nonsignificant indirect prediction on PTG. Conclusions: This study indicate that the predictive mechanism of PTSD and PTG were different and further suggest that PTSD and PTG are separate, independent dimensions of psychological experiences following adversity.

Evidence gleaned from a detailed review of the literature makes clear that improvement of all three capabilities is critical to help young people better navigate challenges and prevent or reduce externalizing and related problems. Moreover, interventions can successfully improve these three capabilities and have been found to produce behavioral improvements with real-world significance. Examples of how successful interventions remediate more than one of these capabilities are provided. Future directions in research and practice are also proposed to move the field toward the development of more comprehensive programs for adolescents to foster their integration.

AB Objectives: This review outlines a conceptual framework adapted from the biopsychosocial model of pain to examine the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and chronic pain in youth to highlight the state of current research and guide future efforts.
   Methods: A review of the literature was performed in the areas of ACEs and health outcomes with general adult and pediatric populations in addition to studies within the pain literature. Potential relationships between ACEs, chronic pain, and its impact in youth are outlined and discussed.
   Results: The literature suggests an association between adverse outcomes of ACEs and chronic pain in children and adolescents although causal links have not been confirmed. However, ACEs are associated with multiple risk factors identified in the biopsychosocial model of pain, and may serve to exacerbate or confer heightened risk for pain and poor outcomes.
   Discussion: Adverse experiences in childhood may be associated with greater risk for the development/maintenance of chronic pain in youth. More research is needed on ACEs and how they uniquely affect the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying chronic pain in children throughout the lifespan.

AB The present study aims to investigate the impact of family-level variables (emotional autonomy and the quality of the parents-adolescent relationship) on socio-emotional adjustment (loneliness and self-esteem) in adolescents with learning disabilities (LDs) and the role of the quality of the teacher-adolescent relationship in moderating the effects of these impacts. The participants are 293 typically developing adolescents (TD group) and 50 adolescents with learning disabilities (LD group), aged between 13 and 20. The following measures were administered: the Emotional Autonomy Scale (EAS), the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents (LACA), the Assessment of Interpersonal Relations (AIR), and the Multidimensional Self Concept Scale (MSCS). The data showed that adolescents with LDs display significantly higher levels of peer-related loneliness, and lower levels of self-concept and perceived quality of relationships with parents and teachers. No significant differences emerged between the groups in emotional autonomy and in parent-related loneliness. Path analysis indicated that, in adolescents with LDs, emotional autonomy was more closely related to self-concept than in typically developing adolescents. A positive teacher-adolescent relationship could have a moderating effect on the relationships between the dimension considered only in the LD group. The findings have important implications for the implementation of intervention programs focused on social and emotional competences in young people with LDs.

AB This research analyses the emotional competence difficulties (measured through emotional intelligence and empathy) and social communication disorders of young victims of abuse. These minors are in residential care centres with protective measures after suffering maltreatment and/or neglect. The relation between their emotional competence and social communication is analysed, as well as the contribution of empathy and emotional intelligence in predicting their social communication. The results indicate that a lack of emotional competence is related to and can predict their difficulties in social communication. The study manifests a scarcity of emotional intelligence, affecting attention, emotional repair and clarity of feelings, as well as a deterioration in affective and cognitive empathy. The minors' scarce ability to put themselves in the place of others, to understand others' intentions and emotional states, limits their use of language in social interactions. The research stresses the need to set up intervention programmes aimed at training in interpersonal and intrapersonal emotional competences which can encourage social communication.

AB The present study aims to analyze the role of parenting styles in the development of suicidal ideation in adolescents, as well as test the mediating role of attachment to parents in the association between authoritative, authoritarian and permissive parenting style and suicidal ideation. The sample was made up of 604 individuals, aged between 15 and 18. In order to gather data, the Styles & Dimensions Questionnaire: Short Version, the Father/Mother Attachment Questionnaire and the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire were used. The results suggest that the relations with parents, which are characterized by inhibition of exploration and of individuality, contribute to an emotional maladjustment being positively associated with suicidal ideation (r = .26 to r = .28). This confirmed the mediating role of parental attachment in the association between authoritative and permissive parenting styles from father and mother to suicidal ideation. It was also verified also a partial mediation, through the attachment to parents, in the association between the parent's authoritarian style and the mother's permissive styles and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, it was found the presence of total mediation, by throughout to attachment to the father, in the association between the father's permissive style and suicidal ideation. The results suggest the importance of adopting authoritative parenting styles, since they seem to facilitate the development of the quality of attachment with parents. The results were analyzed in light of the attachment theory, taking into consideration the importance of parenting styles in understanding the processes inherent to suicidal ideation in adolescence.

AB While shame is essential for adaptive functioning, experiencing shame more often or intensely than others is strongly associated with psychopathology. To date, no measure of the behavioral expression of shame exists, despite the great potential for use in research and clinical settings. The present study aimed to assess the Shame Code, a new behavioral coding system of the expression of shame. Participants included 149 youth between the ages of 12 and 17 (50 % female, M = 14.5). Shame was elicited with a spontaneous speech task. Participants' overall Shame Code scores were correlated only with a state measure of shame, however, structural equation modeling results showed that Shame Code variables combined differentially to assess state and trait shame scores. A two-factor model was the best fit to the data. The first factor, Fidget, consisted of Hiding, Fidget (positively loaded), Nervous Positive, and Stillness (negatively loaded). The second factor, Freeze, was comprised of Stillness, Facial Tension, and Silence (positively loaded). The Fidget factor was associated with higher Trait Shame and the Freeze factor was associated with higher State Shame but lower Trait Shame. Therefore, the Shame Code not only effectively captured the behavioral manifestations of shame, but Shame Code variables also differentially predicted state and trait shame.

AB The adolescent brain is marked by functional and structural modifications, particularly within the inhibitory system of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These changes are necessary for the acquisition of adult cognitive functions and emotion regulation, and impairments in these processes are associated with neuropathologies such as schizophrenia and affective disorders. The molecular mechanisms regulating this adolescent refinement of prefrontal inhibitory circuits remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor Npas4 plays a major role in this process. Using a series of behavioral, molecular, pharmacological and genetic approaches in mice, we demonstrate that deficiency in Npas4 affects adolescent expression of multiple markers of GABAergic transmission in the PFC, including parvalbumin and GAD67, in a sex-specific manner. This abnormal pattern of expression of GABAergic markers is associated with sex-specific cognitive and emotional impairments that occur only when Npas4 deficiency begins at adolescence but not post-adolescence. Finally, we show that chronic treatment with the GABA enhancing drug sodium valproate during adolescence is sufficient to induce long-lasting recovery of the molecular and behavioral abnormalities observed in Npas4 deficient mice. Altogether, we provide evidence for the involvement of the transcription factor Npas4 to the structural changes that affect prefrontal inhibitory circuits during adolescence. Further investigations of Npas4 role in the adolescent brain might provide new insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders that emerge during adolescence.

AB Internalizing mental health issues are a significant developmental and clinical concern during adolescence, but rarely identified as a problem among school staff. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examined the associations between adolescent emotional distress, school connectedness, and educational achievement by exploring potential mechanistic and interactive roles of perceived school connectedness on the emotion-education association. Emotional distress was negatively associated with adolescents' perceptions of belonging to school, which, in turn, may negatively influence educational achievement. School connectedness also had both additive and multiplicative interaction effects on the emotion-education relationship. Results support previous evidence of school connectedness as a protective factor for adolescents with internalizing mental health concerns, although much of the work to date has focused on externalizing problems. This study informs our understanding of how, why, and for whom emotional problems influence educational outcomes in light of social support in the school context.

Yet there is a lack of attention to how mentoring relationships work or the attributes of mentoring that contribute to successful outcomes. In this study, we employ qualitative in-depth interviews with mentors in a school-based program to learn about their perceptions of the strain experienced by their mentees, and how they respond to it during sessions. We focus on emotional regulation, conflict resolution, future orientation, and active listening - four positive coping strategies associated with enhanced resilience among at-risk youth. This study considers how these positive strategies fit into mentors' descriptions of their approaches and the implications for intervention programming.

AB Studies have demonstrated inefficient use of antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategies in children with ADHD attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the current study we tested for the first time if ADHD is also associated with difficulties in response-focused strategies by measuring the ability to override action tendencies induced by emotional information. Performance data on a computer-based approach-avoidance paradigm of 28 children with ADHD and 38 typically developing children between 8 and 15 years of age were analyzed, by comparing a congruent condition in which they were instructed to approach positive and avoid negative pictures and an incongruent condition where they had to override these automatic reactions and approach negative and avoid positive pictures. Children also rated the valence and salience of the pictures. Children with ADHD and typically developing children rated the emotional valence of the pictures appropriately and similarly, while positive pictures were rated as more arousing by children with ADHD. Solid congruency effects were found indicating that the task measured response-focused emotion regulation; however groups did not differ in this respect. Our findings do not support a deficit in emotion regulation in ADHD in terms of the ability to override natural tendencies to approach positive and avoid negative pictures.

AB Four distinct patterns of adolescents' behavioral, emotional, and physiological responses to family conflict were identified during mother-father-adolescent (M=13.08years) interactions. Most youth displayed adaptively regulated patterns comprised of low overt and subjective distress. Under-controlled adolescents exhibited elevated observable and subjective anger. Over-controlled adolescents were withdrawn and reported heightened subjective distress. Physiologically reactive adolescents had elevated cortisol coupled with low overt and subjective distress. Regulation patterns were associated with unique mental health trajectories. Under-controlled adolescents had elevated conduct and peer problems whereas over-controlled adolescents had higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Physiologically reactive adolescents had low concurrent, but increasing levels of depressive, anxiety, and peer problem symptoms. Findings underscore the importance of examining organizations of regulatory strategies in contributing to adolescent mental health.

AB Background: Conduct problems (CP) comprise abnormal behaviors associated with aberrant aspects of affective empathy as well as learning. However, behavioral measures for affective empathy are challenging, and previous results concerning learning in patients with CP are inconsistent.
   Methods: Nineteen boys with CP and 24 typically developing (TD) boys aged 11-17 years (M = 14.34, SD = 1.93) participated in the study. An ultimatum-game was applied in order to elicit the feeling of like or dislike towards the opponent for a subsequent gambling task, which was played by the opponents (OTHER-condition) and by the participants themselves (SELF-condition). Functional MRI data were recorded throughout the experiment.
   Results: In accordance with the model of insensitivity to punishment, hypo-activation of the left amygdala, left anterior insula, ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) was observed as a response to losing in participants with CP during the SELF-condition. Callous unemotional (CU)-traits correlated negatively with activation of amygdala and right TPJ. During the OTHER-condition, TD participants showed activation in brain areas associated with theory of mind (right TPJ, left IFG), and affect regulation (right DLPFC) rather than areas associated with affective empathy. This pattern was not found in adolescents with CP. Moreover, and independently of individual characteristics of their opponents, adolescents with CP demonstrated reward-associated activation (ventral striatum) observing others win, which was positively correlated with CU -traits. This may be interpreted in line with the theory of reward dominance.
   Conclusions: The current study provides support for the theory of abnormal learning processing in adolescents with CP which yields implications for further research as well as clinical practice. The gambling task did not activate affective empathy networks, but was specific for cognitive empathy, inhibition, and affect regulation. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been related to functional brain activities and structural brain abnormalities.
   Purpose: To investigate the neural mechanism on working memory dysfunction in patients with GAD in terms of the combined functional and morphological brain abnormalities.
   Material and Methods: Patients with GAD and healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education level underwent high-resolution T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). In this study, fMRI and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used for assessing the differential brain activation patterns, as well as for comparing the morphological alterations between the two groups.
   Results: In response to the neutral distractors, the patients showed significantly lower activities in the regions of the fusiform gyrus (FuG), superior parietal gyrus (SPG), precuneus (PCu), superior occipital gyrus (SOG), lingual gyrus (LiG), cuneus (Cun), calcarine cortex (CaC), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and cerebellar cortex (Cb) compared to the controls. In response to the anxiety-inducing distractors, the patients showed significantly higher activity in the hippocampus and lower activities in the regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), FuG, SPG, PCu, SOG, and Cb. Also, the patients showed a significant reduction of the white matter volumes in the DLPFC, anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and midbrain.
   Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence for the association between the morphometric alterations and functional deficit in the working memory processing with the neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors in GAD patients. These findings would be helpful to understand the neural mechanisms on working memory impairment in connection with GAD symptoms.

AB The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in attention and self-regulation by modulating physiological arousal to meet environmental demands. Core symptoms of ADHD such as inattention and behavioral disinhibition may be related to dysregulation of the ANS, however previous findings have been equivocal. We examined autonomic activity and reactivity by assessing heart rate variability (HRV) in a large sample of un-medicated children and adolescents (6-19 years) with ADHD (n = 229) compared to typically-developing controls (n = 244) during rest and sustained attention. Four heart rate variability measures were extracted: Root mean square of successive differences between inter-beat-intervals (rMSSD), absolute high frequency (HFA) power, absolute low frequency (LFA) power and ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power (LF/HF). There were no group differences in HFA or rMSSD, even when assessing across child and adolescent groups separately, by gender or ADHD subtype. LF/HF however was higher in ADHD during both rest and sustained attention conditions, particularly in male children. Sustained attention was impaired in ADHD relative to controls, and a higher LF/HF ratio during sustained attention was associated with poorer performance in both groups. Lower rMSSD and HFA were associated with higher anxiety, oppositional behaviors and social problems, supporting prevailing theories that these measures index emotion regulation and adaptive social behavior. Different measures of heart rate variability provide important insights into the sustained attention and emotional and behavioral regulation impairments observed in ADHD and may aid in delineating ADHD pathophysiology.

AB Research documents how exposure to adversity in childhood leads to negative health outcomes across the lifespan. Less is known about protective factors - aspects of the individual, family, and community that promote good health despite exposure to adversity. Guided by the Resilience Portfolio Model, this study examined protective factors associated with physical health in a sample of adolescents and adults exposed to high levels of adversity including child abuse. A rural community sample of 2565 individuals with average age of 30 participated in surveys via computer assisted software. Participants completed self-report measures of physical health, adversity, and a range of protective factors drawn from research on resilience. Participants reporting a greater burden of childhood victimization and current financial strain (but not other adverse life events) had poorer physical health, but those with strengths in emotion regulation, meaning making, community support, social support, and practicing forgiveness reported better health. As hypothesized, strengths across resilience portfolio domains (regulatory, meaning making, and interpersonal) had independent, positive associations with health related quality of life after accounting for participants' exposure to adversity. Prevention and intervention efforts for child maltreatment should focus on bolstering a portfolio of strengths. The foundation of the work needs to begin with families early in the lifespan.

AB Social-emotional competence is a critical factor to target with universal preventive interventions that are conducted in schools because the construct (a) associates with social, behavioral, and academic outcomes that are important for healthy development; (b) predicts important life outcomes in adulthood; (c) can be improved with feasible and cost-effective interventions; and (d) plays a critical role in the behavior change process. This article reviews this research and what is known about effective intervention approaches. Based on that, an intervention model is proposed for how schools should enhance the social and emotional learning of students in order to promote resilience. Suggestions are also offered for how to support implementation of this intervention model at scale.

AB Moderate inverse correlations are typically found between well-being and mental illness. We aimed to investigate the role of genes and environments in explaining the relationships between two aspects of well-being and two measures of internalizing symptoms. Altogether, 4700 pairs of 16-year-old twins contributed data on subjective happiness and life satisfaction, as well as symptoms of depression and emotional problems. Well-being was moderately correlated with internalizing symptoms (range=-0.45, -0.58). Multivariate twin model-fitting indicated both genetic and environmental overlap. Life satisfaction and happiness demonstrated different patterns of overlap, with stronger genetic links between life satisfaction and depression. Non-shared environmental influences were largely specific to each trait. This study supports the theory of mental health and illness being partly (but not entirely) correlated dimensions. There are also significant genetic and environmental factors to identify for well-being that go beyond the absence of mental illness. It is therefore possible that different interventions are needed for treating mental illness and promoting mental health.

AB Previous studies have investigated constructs that facilitate adaptation to chronic disease and improve quality of life and constructs that lead to psychopathological complications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of coping and emotional regulation on the quality of life of patients on dialysis. Three questionnaires were administered to 78 patients on dialysis: Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced, Short Form (36), and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regressions analyses indicated that age, Rumination, Positive Refocusing, Avoidance Strategies, Approach to the Problem, and Transcendent Orientation predicted Physical Health. With regard to Mental Health, the predictors were gender, Self-Blame, Acceptance, Rumination, Positive Reappraisal, Catastrophizing, Avoidance Strategies, and Transcendent Orientation. This study confirms the relationship between emotional regulation, coping, and quality of life. The results highlight the need for total care of the patients, including an assessment of both physical state and psychological functioning in order to promote total well-being.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit emotional problems, which can be associated with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Parent co-regulation is often associated with child ER and emotional problems, though little work has been done with reference to youth with ASD. This study investigated the association among parent co-regulation, child ER, and internalizing and externalizing problems in 51 parents and school-aged children with ASD. Parent co-regulation strategies and scaffolding were not associated with parent-reported levels of child internalizing problems. Parent scaffolding and child ER predicted externalizing problems, after controlling for child age and IQ. Suggestions for future research on parent involvement in the emotional development of children with ASD are discussed, as well as implications for ER-focused interventions.

AB Several studies have highlighted the adaptive role of self-compassion on human suffering and on a wide range of psychopathological conditions. Extensive research has shown that emotional intelligence has been associated with well-being, mental and physical health and quality of interpersonal relationships. We set out to explore the mediating role of self-compassion and emotional intelligence on the relationship between shame traumatic memories and depressive symptoms, and to explore if these were different between female and male adolescents. The sample was composed of 1101 adolescents from general population, whose age ranged from 14 to 18 years. Participants filled out a battery of self-report questionnaires designed to measure shame traumatic memories, self-compassion, emotional intelligence and depressive symptoms. Correlational analysis showed that in male and female adolescents, shame traumatic memories are associated with more depressive symptoms and with lower levels of self-compassion and emotional intelligence. Multigroup analysis showed that emotional intelligence has a greater impact on depression in female adolescents. Also, the impact of shame traumatic memories on depression is stronger in males, even though females report shame traumatic memories as more impactful. This study provides preliminary evidence that self-compassion and emotional intelligence are important emotion regulation processes for depressive symptoms in adolescence.

AB Background The aim of the present study was to conduct a preliminary empirical evaluation of the KooLKIDS program, a school-based intervention that utilises a combination of whole-of-class and individual sessions for young children with early onset antisocial behaviour.Method Trained facilitators delivered the 13-session program to a completer sample of 49 primary school-aged children (7-11 years) with early onset antisocial behaviour (42 boys and seven girls suspended from school or at risk for suspension) and their peers.Results Analyses showed significant postintervention reductions on many outcome variables, including teacher and child self-rated aggression and antisocial traits. Significant improvements were also found on measures of emotional intensity and peer acceptance. Acceptability and feasibility data were promising.Conclusion KooLKIDS has the potential for redirecting the trajectory of antisocial behaviour towards more positive social and emotional outcomes for these at-risk children.

AB Pre-adolescence is a key developmental period in which complex intrinsic volitional methods of self regulation are acquired as a result of rapid maturation within the brain networks underlying the self-regulatory processes of attention control and emotion regulation. Fostering adaptive self-regulation skills during this stage of development has strong implications for physical health, emotional and socioeconomic outcomes during adulthood. There is a growing interest in mindfulness-based programmes for pre-adolescents with initial findings suggesting self-regulation improvements, however, neurodevelopmental studies on mindfulness with pre-adolescents are scarce. This analytical review outlines an integrative neuro-developmental approach, which combines self-report and behavioural assessments with event related brain potentials (ERPs) to provide a systemic multilevel understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms of mindfulness in pre-adolescence. We specifically focus on the N2, error related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), P3a, P3b and late positive potential (LPP) ERP components as indexes of mindfulness related modulations in non-volitional bottom-up self-regulatory processes (salience detection, stimulus driven orienting and mind wandering) and volitional top-down self-regulatory processes (endogenous orienting and executive attention).

AB The present study aimed to investigate the role of certain personality traits, such as callous-unemotional traits, behavioral activation system (BAS), and emotion regulation in the associations between proactive and reactive relational aggression (RA) and Cyberbullying (CB). Participants were 347 Greek adolescents who completed a self-report questionnaire. Based on prior evidence the present study examined personality characteristics both as predictors of relational and cyber aggression, as well as moderators in bidirectional models between these aggressive forms. Results showed that high callous and uncaring traits as well as low BAS moderated the pathway from CB to proactive and reactive RA. Further, proactive and reactive RA were positively associated with CB at high levels of callous and uncaring traits and low levels of BAS. Low cognitive reappraisal moderated the links between both RA functions (i.e. proactive and reactive) to CB. Finally, adolescents who engage in proactive and reactive RA and use high cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions are more likely to use CB. Overall, these results indicate that relational and cyber aggression share some common ground and aggressors do not significantly differ in terms of their personality traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current research examined the role of two emotion regulation processes, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression, on maladaptive victimisation coping following school-based peer-victimisation in late childhood (n = 443). The relationship between emotion regulation and maladaptive coping was also tested for serial mediation effects, linking peer-victimisation and school loneliness. Results showed that poor emotion regulation in children was positively associated with maladaptive peer-victimisation coping. Moreover, the relationship between cognitive reappraisal and maladaptive coping was found to mediate the relationship between peer victimisation experiences and school loneliness. These findings have implications for the development of school-based peer-victimisation intervention strategies that focus on improving children's emotional competencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Sex as self-injury has become a concept in Swedish society; however it is a largely unexplored area of research, not yet conceptualized and far from accepted in the research field. The use of sex as a way of affect regulation is known in the literature and has, in interviews with young women who sell sex, been compared to direct selfinjury, such as cutting or burning the skin. The aim of this study was to investigate the self-reported frequency of sex as self-injury and the association to sociodemographic factors, sexual orientation, voluntary sexual experiences, sexual risk-taking behaviors, sexual, physical and mental abuse, trauma symptoms, healthcare for psychiatric disorders and non-suicidal self-injury.
   Methods: A representative national sample of 5750 students in the 3rd year of Swedish high school, with a mean age of 18 years was included in the study. The study was questionnaire-based and the response rate was 59.7%. Mostly descriptive statistics were used and a final logistic regression model was made.
   Results: Sex as self-injury was reported by 100 (3.2%) of the girls and 20 (. 8%) of the boys. Few correlations to sociodemographic factors were noted, but the group was burdened with more experiences of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Non-heterosexual orientation, trauma symptoms, non-suicidal self-injury and healthcare for suicide attempts, depression and eating disorders were common.
   Conclusions: Sex used as self-injury seems to be highly associated with earlier traumas such as sexual abuse and poor mental health. It is a behavior that needs to be conceptualized in order to provide proper help and support to a highly vulnerable group of adolescents.

AB The present study assessed the effects of the mindfulness/compassion cultivating program: "Call to Care-Israel" on the performance in visual perception (VP) and motor accuracy, as well as on anxiety levels and self-reported mindfulness among 4th and 5th grade students. One hundred and thirty-eight children participated in the program for 24 weekly sessions, while 78 children served as controls. Repeated measures ANOVA's yielded significant interactions between time of measurement and group for VP, motor accuracy, reported mindfulness, and anxiety. Post hoc tests revealed significant improvements in the four aforementioned measures in the experimental group only. In addition, significant correlations were obtained between the improvement in motor accuracy and the reduction in anxiety and the increase in mindfulness. Since VP and motor accuracy are basic skills associated with quantifiable academic characteristics, such as reading and mathematical abilities, the results may suggest that mindfulness practice has the ability to improve academic achievements.

AB Children exposed to extreme early-life neglect such as in institutional rearing are at heightened risk for developing depression and anxiety disorders, and internalizing problems more broadly. These outcomes are believed to be due to alterations in the development of neural circuitry that supports emotion regulation. The specific neurodevelopmental changes that contribute to these difficulties are largely unknown. This study examined whether microstructural alterations in white matter pathways predicted long-term risk for internalizing problems in institutionally reared children. Data from 69 children were drawn from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized clinical trial of foster care for institutionally reared children. White matter was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) when children were between 8 and 10 years of age. Internalizing symptoms were assessed at the time of the MRI scan, and once children reached 12-14 years of age. Results indicated that neglect-associated alterations in the external capsule and corpus callosum partially explained links between institutional rearing status and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence. Findings shed light on neural-mechanisms contributing to increased risk for emotional difficulties among children reared in adverse conditions and have implications for prevention and intervention.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) strategies have a clear impact on mental health outcomes. In 2 studies (N = 695, N = 433) we investigated gender differences in the use of 2 ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) to handle parent-child conflict in Taiwanese adolescents. We also identified the implications of these differences for some negative emotions (self-blame and resentment) and internalizing problems (psychosomatic symptoms and social withdrawal). Results of the correlation analyses in both studies indicated that reappraisal and suppression ER strategies are positively correlated only in male Taiwanese adolescents. Hierarchical regression analyses in the second study confirmed that reappraisal buffers male but not female adolescents against the negative effects of suppression on the arousal of negative affect and internalizing problems.

AB We proposed to explore the functional brain changes during a self-reference processing (SRP) task in adolescents with sexual abuse-related post-traumatic stress disorder (N=10), compared with healthy adolescents (N=10). While patients showed no behavioral disturbances in (SRP), they exhibited changes in activity and connectivity in regions involved in emotional regulation (amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortex) and semantic memory (temporal and ventrolateral prefrontal regions). These preliminary results suggest that these alterations may have an effect on self-esteem which may contribute to a possible retention and impairment of symptoms in adulthood.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to assess emotion regulation processes in adolescents with self-harm behavior by the emotional schema approach. Methods: The study included 101 adolescents with delibrate self-harm behavior (DSH), 99 adolescents with psychiatric diagnose and treatment without DSH (without DSH) and 99 healthy adolescents as the control group. Adolescents with DSH were asked to complete Sociodemographic Data Form, Self-Harm Behavior Form, and Leahy Emotional Schema Scale (LESS). Other two groups were asked to complete sociodemographic data form and LESS, afterwards these three groups were compared. Data were assessed with chi-square test and one way analysis of variance methods. Results: While suicide attempts, childhood violence and domestic violence were found significantly more in the DSH and without DSH groups, separation from parents and migration history frequency were found significantly higher only in the DSH group according to other two groups. Groups were compared with LESS; and it was found that 'weakness against emotions', 'uncontrollability', 'rumination', 'seeing emotions as dangerous', 'dissimilarity' and 'guilt' subscale's mean scores were significantly higher in DSH group. Beside these results LESS 'acceptance of feelings', 'consensus', 'comprehensibility' subscales were lower in DSH group. Discussion: These results show that psychological stressors which individuals encountered in developing period, have establishing effects for DSH. Findings of our research support that DSH is one of the maladaptive coping styles for experienced negative emotions. Focusing on the emotion regulation functions of DSH and accompanying emotional schemas, may help dealing with difficulties through treatment.

AB Objective: Emotional dysregulation is an important element in the pathophysiology of childhood anxiety disorders and can distinguish anxious subjects from controls. Treatment with selective serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs) has been found to lessen anxiety, but its effects on emotional reactivity and regulation are less documented. The aim of the study was to prospectively assess changes in emotional reactivity and regulation in response to citalopram in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, with special focus on the mechanism of reappraisal.
   Methods: The sample included 70 children and adolescents (38 boys, 32 girls) 10-17 years of age, divided into three groups: Those with anxiety disorder treated with citalopram for 8 weeks (n = 35); untreated subjects with anxiety disorder on the waiting list for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (n = 15); and subjects without anxiety disorder (controls) (n = 20). Emotional reactivity and regulation (i.e., reappraisal), were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks (follow-up) with validated computer based instruments, Reactivity and Regulation-Situations (REAR-S) and Reactivity and Regulation-Images (REAR-I).
   Results: Citalopram-treated subjects showed significantly greater improvement in reappraisal ability than CBT-waitlisted subjects. Improvement in the ability to reappraise threatening images correlated significantly with the decrease in anxiety. There was a decrease in negative emotional reactivity between assessments, which was positively correlated with clinical improvement. Higher intensity of baseline reactivity (on the REAR-S) predicted more severe symptoms at follow-up.
   Conclusions: Citalopram therapy improves reappraisal ability in children and adolescents with anxiety. However, the improvement in other examined emotional reactivity indices occurred in both medicated and waitlisted groups. It is possible that these findings may have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of anxiety in children and adolescents.

AB CASE: Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers.
   His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.
   Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.
   Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.
   His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there. How might you assist this child and his mother by helping to integrate therapeutic goals into the academic environment?

AB The current study examined longitudinal relations between overt and relational victimization, sadness and anger dysregulation, and depressive and anxiety symptoms across 6 months among an ethnically diverse sample of sixth graders (N = 485; 48% male; 65% African American). No direct longitudinal relations were found between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms or between internalizing symptoms and peer victimization, and these findings were consistent across gender and disability status. The relation between overt victimization and subsequent increases in relational victimization was stronger for youth with versus without high incidence disabilities. Significant indirect effects were found for overt victimization on both depressive and anxiety symptoms via sadness dysregulation. The strength of the indirect effects did not differ by gender. Findings highlight the merits of school-based violence prevention programs that address emotional management and are embedded within multi-tiered school environment interventions.

AB Research suggesting nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) may belong in a distinct diagnostic category has led to the inclusion of NSSI disorder in the DSM-5 section for future study. There has been limited research, however, examining the validity of Criterion A (the frequency criterion). The current study aimed to examine the validity of the frequency criterion of NSSI disorder through the use of an exploratory data mining method, structural equation modeling trees, as a way to determine a NSSI frequency that optimally discriminates pathological NSSI from normative behavior among undergraduate students (n = 3,559), 428 who engaged in NSSI in the previous year. The model included psychopathology symptomology found to be comorbid with NSSI and cognitive-affective deficits commonly associated with NSSI. Results demonstrated a first split between individuals with 0 and 1 act of NSSI in the past year, as was expected. Among individuals with 1 or more previous acts, the optimal split was between those with 5 and 6 NSSI acts in the past year. Results from the current study suggest that individuals with 6 acts of NSSI in past year, compared with those with 5 acts or less, may represent a more severe group of self-injurers. These individuals reported higher levels of related psychopathology symptomology and cognitive-affective deficits, in addition to decreased quality of life. Findings have potential implications for the proposed frequency criteria of NSSI disorder and how pathological NSSI is characterized.

AB Background: Exposure to trauma was found to increase later violent behaviours in youth but the underlying psychopathological mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to test whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is related to violent behaviours and whether PTSD symptoms mediate the relationship between the number of trauma experiences and violent behaviours in adolescents.,
   Method: The present study is based on a nationally representative sample of 9th grade students with 3434 boys (mean age = 15.5 years) and 3194 girls (mean age = 15.5 years) in Switzerland. Lifetime exposure to traumatic events and current PTSD were assessed by the use of the University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (UCLA-RI). Logistic regression was used to assess associations between PTSD and violent behaviours, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the meditation effects of PTSD.
   Results: PTSD (boys: OR = 7.9; girls: OR = 5.5) was strongly related to violent behaviours. PTSD symptoms partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and violent behaviours in boys but not in girls. PTSD symptoms of dysphoric arousal were positively related to violent behaviours in both genders. Anxious arousal symptoms were negatively related to violent behaviours in boys but not in girls.
   Conclusions: In addition to trauma, posttraumatic stress is related to violent outcomes. However, specific symptom clusters of PTSD seem differently related to violent behaviours and they do not fully explain a trauma-violence link. Specific interventions to improve emotion regulation skills may be useful particularly in boys with elevated PTSD dysphoric arousal in order to break up the cycle of violence.

ID HARM; PREVALENCE; CHILDHOOD; OUTCOMES; SUICIDE
AB In order to assess the relationships among borderline personality disorder features, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and emotion dysregulation, 122 community-dwelling Italian adolescents were administered by the Italian translations of the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children-11, the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Regression models showed that both Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI) and DERS scores significantly predicted Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children-11 total score; moreover, the DSHI total score significantly predicted the DERS total score. Our findings suggest that borderline personality features in adolescence are moderately, albeit significantly related to NSSI, and that emotion dysregulation does not completely account for the association between borderline personality features and NSSI, although it seems to explain a non-trivial proportion of this relationship.

AB Childhood family adversity (CFA) increases the risk for conduct disorder (CD) and has been associated with alterations in regions of affective processing like ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala. However, no study so far has demonstrated neural converging effects of CFA and CD in the same sample. At age 25 years, functional MRI data during two affective tasks, i. e. a reward (N = 171) and a face-matching paradigm (N = 181) and anatomical scans (N = 181) were acquired in right-handed currently healthy participants of an epidemiological study followed since birth. CFA during childhood was determined using a standardized parent interview. Disruptive behaviors and CD diagnoses during childhood and adolescence were obtained by diagnostic interview (2-19 years), temperamental reward dependence was assessed by questionnaire (15 and 19 years). CFA predicted increased CD and amygdala volume. Both exposure to CFA and CD were associated with a decreased VS response during reward anticipation and blunted amygdala activity during face-matching. CD mediated the effect of CFA on brain activity. Temperamental reward dependence was negatively correlated with CFA and CD and positively with VS activity. These findings underline the detrimental effects of CFA on the offspring's affective processing and support the importance of early postnatal intervention programs aiming to reduce childhood adversity factors.

AB Research has underscored the importance of adolescence in the development of depression and its associated key risk factors, namely rumination. Recently, there has been an emphasis on exploring the neuropsychological correlates of depression and rumination, including the role of executive functioning (EF). However, research has yet to fully elucidate the relationship among these constructs from a developmental perspective. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between various components of EF, rumination, and depression among a normative sample of adolescents. A secondary aim of this study was to examine whether rumination mediates the relationship between EF and depression. Multiple regression analyses indicated a significant association between perseveration, set-shifting and inhibitory impairments and increased depressive symptomatology. Set-shifting deficits were also associated with higher levels of rumination. Additionally, rumination significantly mediated the relationship between impaired set-shifting and depressive symptoms. These findings add to the limited extant literature examining the associations among these constructs in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. Further, this study is the first to examine the mediating effects of rumination in youth.

AB Background: Maternal depression is associated with increased risk of psychiatric illness in offspring. While risk may relate to depressed mothers' difficulties regulating emotions in the context of interacting with offspring, physiological indicators of emotion regulation have rarely been examined during mother-child interactions-and never among mother-adolescent dyads in which both mother and adolescent have histories of major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: We examined changes in high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), an indicator of parasympathetic (vagal) function that has been related to depression, stress, social engagement, and emotion regulation, in 46 mother-daughter dyads (23 in which both mother and daughter had an MDD history and 23 never-depressed controls). Hierarchical linear models evaluated changes in HF-HRV while mother-daughter dyads engaged in discussions about shared pleasant events and relationship conflicts.
   Results: While control dyads displayed positive slopes (increases) in HF-HRV during both discussions, MDD dyads displayed minimal change in HF-HRV across discussions. Among controls, HF-HRV slopes were positively correlated between mothers and daughters during the pleasant events' discussion. In contrast, HF-HRV slopes were negatively correlated between MDD mothers and daughters during both discussions.
   Conclusions: Vagal responses observed in control mother-daughter dyads suggest a pattern of physiological synchrony and reciprocal positive social engagement, which may play a role in adolescent development of secure social attachments and healthy emotion regulation. In contrast, MDD mothers and daughters displayed diminished and discordant patterns of vagal responsiveness.

AB Despite major advances in the development of interventions for youth anxiety and depression, approximately 30% of youths with anxiety do not respond to cognitive behavioral treatment, and youth depression treatments yield modest symptom decreases overall. Identifying networks of modifiable risk and maintenance factors that contribute to both youth anxiety and depression (i.e., internalizing problems) may enhance and broaden treatment benefits by informing the development of mechanism-targeted interventions. A particularly powerful network is the rich array of family processes linked to internalizing problems (e.g., parenting styles, parental mental health problems, and sibling relationships). Here, we propose a new theoretical model, the triadic model of family process, to organize theory and evidence around modifiable, transdiagnostic family factors that may contribute to youth internalizing problems. We describe the model's implications for intervention, and we propose strategies for testing the model in future research. The model provides a framework for studying associations among family processes, their relation to youth internalizing problems, and family-based strategies for strengthening prevention and treatment.

AB Pediatric anxiety is associated with comorbid externalizing behaviors and social problems, and these associations may be related to altered emotion processing. The late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential component, is a neural marker of emotion processing, and there is evidence that anxious youth exhibits enhanced LPPs to threatening signals. It is unknown, however, if differences in the LPP are related to externalizing behaviors and social problems co-occurring with anxiety and if these associations are driven by altered processing of threatening (angry or fearful faces) or rewarding (happy faces) socio-emotional signals. Thus, in the present study, we examined, in a sample of 39 anxious youth, the association between LPPs, following socio-emotional signals and externalizing behaviors and social problems. Results indicated an association between attenuated LPPs in response to happy faces and greater rule-breaking and social problems. These findings suggest that differences in positive socio-emotional signal processing are related to heterogeneity in pediatric anxiety and that LPPs are a sensitive index of such heterogeneity.

AB Across two studies, we investigated how friends' typically used emotion regulation strategies (rumination or reappraisal) influence judgements about their vicarious emotions (sympathy, tenderness, and personal distress) when presented with a photograph of a suffering toddler. Results of both studies demonstrated that participants reporting on a ruminative friend indicated that their friend would feel greater personal distress and less tenderness and would perceive the toddler as experiencing more need and pain than participants reporting on a reappraising friend. These results are consistent with the behavioural trajectories associated with rumination and reappraisal, and are discussed in light of their implications for interpersonal emotion regulation.

AB Cognitive control is the process of employing executive functions, such as attention, planning or working memory, to guide appropriate behaviors in order to achieve a specific goal. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest a superordinate cognitive control network, comprising the dorsal regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and parietal cortex (DPC). How gray matter structure changes across this network throughout neurodevelopment and how these changes impact cognitive control are not yet fully understood. Here we investigate changes in gray matter volume of the key nodes of the cognitive control network using structural MRI scans from 176 participants aged 8-38 years. One hundred and eleven of these also completed a longitudinal follow-up at two years. We compare these with performance on a cognitive battery also measured at these two time points. We found that volume decreases in the cognitive control network were associated with improved performance in executive function (in left DLPFC and bilateral DPC), information processing (in bilateral dACC and right DPC) and emotion identification tasks (left DLPFC). These results were significant after controlling for age. Furthermore, gray matter changes were coordinated across the network. These findings imply age-independent synaptic pruning in the cognitive control network may have a role in improving performance in cognitive domains. This study provides insight into the direct impact of structural changes on behavior within this network during neurodevelopment and provides a normative evidence base to better understand development of cognitive dysfunction in brain disorders.

AB The present studies examined the influence of extraversion on physiological reactivity, recovery, and physiological habituation-sensitization to repeated social stressors. In Study 1, subjective and physiological data were collected from 97 college students who were categorized as high (n=51) and low (n=46) on extraversion (NEO-FFI) across five laboratory stages: baseline, stress 1, poststress 1, stress 2, and poststress 2. Results indicated high extraversion (HE) participants exhibited relative lesser heart rate (HR) reactivity and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) withdrawals to, and more complete HR and RSA recovery after the first social stress, and also exhibited relative lesser HR reactivity to the second social stress. When repeatedly exposed to a social stressor, HE participants showed pronounced systolic blood pressure (SBP) adaptation, low extraversion (LE) participants displayed diastolic blood pressure (DBP) sensitization. In Study 2, data were collected from another 78 participants (HE: n=40, LE: n=38) across the same laboratory stages with speech performance videotaped. After controlling for the speech styles, Study 2 found the same HR response and SBP/DBP adaptation pattern across extraversion groups to social stress as Study 1 but not RSA reactivity. These findings suggest extraverts exhibit more adaptive physiological reactivity to recurrent social stressors, which thus might benefit their health.

AB Insecure attachment is believed to play a fundamental role in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). In fact, the quality of parent-child attachment relationships has become an emerging topic attracting a growing number of theoretical and research contributions in the field of NSSI. However, despite these considerable advances in the scientific study of NSSI, progress pertaining to investigating the quality of romantic attachment relationship is lacking. In an effort to expand current knowledge, the present study aims to not only explore the relationships between romantic attachment and NSSI, but also to explore the mechanisms by which these two variables relate by examining the mediating role that emotion regulation and dyadic coping might play in this relationship. Participants consisted of 797 (81.9 % female) university students, all of whom were involved in a romantic relationship for at least 6 months and between the ages of 17 and 25. Results revealed that although difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the relationships between romantic attachment insecurity (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance) and NSSI, dyadic coping was not found to be a significant mediator. These results highlight the importance of attachment security and internal processes to manage stress in the prevention of NSSI.

AB This research explored the effectiveness of a manualized contemplative intervention among children receiving intensive residential psychiatric care. Ten children with severe psychiatric disabilities received 12 sessions (30-45 min) of "Mindful Life: Schools" (MLS) over the course of a month. Facility-reported data on the use of physical intervention (i.e., seclusions and restraints) were analyzed. Acceptability questionnaires and broad-band behavioral questionnaire data were also collected from children and their primary clinicians. Robust logistic regression analyses were conducted on person-period data for the 10 children to explore the timing of incidents resulting in the use of physical intervention. Incidents within each person-period were regressed on indicators of days of contemplative practice and days without contemplative practice. Results indicated that during the 24-h period following MLS class, relative to a comparison 24-h period, children had significantly reduced odds of receiving a physical intervention (OR = 0.3; 95 % CI 0.2, 0.5; p < 0.001). Behavioral questionnaires did not indicate significant contemplative intervention effects (ps > 0.05), and MLS was found to be generally acceptable in this population and setting. These data indicate that contemplative practices acutely reduced the utilization of physical interventions. Clinicians seeking to implement preventative strategies to reduce the necessity of physical intervention in response to dangerous behavior should consider contemplative practices. Those wishing to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of contemplative practices should consider evaluating objective measures, such as utilization of physical intervention strategies, as oppose to subjective reports.

AB Background: Self-harm is highly prevalent in adolescence, often serving an emotion regulation function. Social stressors such as bullying are associated with self-harm. The neurobiological background of the relationship between social stressors and self-harm needs to be further understood to inform prevention and therapy.
   Methods: Participants were members of an epidemiological cohort study. 130 female participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) at age 19. Of them, 21 reported a history of self-harm as assessed by the Youth Self Report. Psychiatric diagnoses were recorded.
   Results: Participants with a history of self-harm showed significantly lower blood cortisol levels throughout the TSST. Early psychosocial adversity did not significantly differ between groups with and without self-harm, with self-harming participants reporting more childhood adversities.
   Conclusion: These results add to the limited field of studies showing an altered HPA axis activity in females with self-harm. Future studies need to address the causal mechanisms behind this association. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Children victimized by peers are at increased risk of ongoing depression. This study investigates treatment resistant depression in children victimized by peers, following participation in a targeted cognitive behavioral family intervention. The sample comprised 39 children aged 6-12 years with elevated depression compared with a general sample, prior to the intervention. Six months after the intervention, 26 were no longer depressed and 13 were still depressed. This study investigated the differentiation of these two groups on the basis of parenting and child factors. Children with treatment resistant depression were discriminated from other children by lower levels of peer support and facilitative parenting immediately after the intervention. It was concluded that ongoing support from parents and peers is needed to reduce the risk of ongoing depression even if victimization has been reduced. Further research could develop a comprehensive profile of children at risk of depression following peer victimization.

AB A number of studies have identified discrepancies in informant ratings of externalizing behaviors in youth, but it is unclear whether similar discrepancies exist between informants when rating psychopathic traits. In this study, we examined parent-child agreement on ratings of both psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors, and examined the factors that influence agreement in both of these domains. A total of 282 children between 7 and 16 years (M = 10.60 years, SD = 1.91) from an outpatient child psychiatric clinic participated in this study. Our findings revealed low levels of parent-child agreement on these measures (ICC values ranging from .02 to .30 for psychopathic traits; ICC values ranging from .09 to .30 for externalizing behaviors). In addition, our findings did not support the moderating effects of child's age, gender, clinical diagnosis, informant, and parental conflict on the relationship between parent- and child-ratings of psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Further research is needed to better understand how parents and child reports of child's externalizing behaviors and psychopathic traits are similar and/or different from one another and factors that influence these agreements.

AB Emotion regulation (ER)one of the most important developmental tasks in early adolescencehas been proposed to mediate the relation between parenting and adolescents' psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of parental psychological control and autonomy support on adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), as well as to examine the mediating role of adolescents' anger regulation and the moderating effect of gender. We collected three-year longitudinal questionnaire data from N=923 parents and their (at first assessment) 9- to 13-year-old children. Path-analysis results mainly support the mediating role of adolescents' adaptive and maladaptive anger regulation and suggest parental autonomy support to be beneficial for regulatory abilities and psychosocial adjustment, whereas the opposite was found for psychological control. Gender differences were found for parent report data, but not for adolescent report data. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB This study is the first to comprehensively examine the effect of state anti-bullying laws (ABLs) on school safety and youth violence. Using existing data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and the Uniform Crime Reports, and newly-collected data on school shootings, we find little evidence that the typical state ABL is effective in improving school safety and student well-being. However, this null finding masks substantial policy heterogeneity. State mandates that require school districts to implement strong, comprehensive anti-bullying policies are associated with a 7 to 13 % reduction in school violence and an 8 to 12 % reduction in bullying. In addition, our results show that strong anti-bullying policy mandates are associated with a reduction in minor teen school shooting deaths and violent crime arrests, suggesting potentially important spillover effects.

AB Adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior, is strongly associated with adolescent psychopathology and personality traits, particularly those characterized by poor self-regulation. Some parental psychopathology and personality traits have also been identified as risk factors for adolescent NSSI, but specific parental characteristics and mechanisms involved in this association have not been systematically examined. The current study comprehensively investigated the contribution of parental psychopathology and personality to adolescent NSSI using data from the baseline wave of the Adolescent Development of Emotion and Personality Traits (ADEPT) study of 550 adolescent girls (mean age = 14.39 years, SD = 0.63) and their biological parents. We first investigated whether parental lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, and personality and clinical (rumination, self-criticism, emotional reliance) traits were associated with adolescent NSSI. We also tested whether adolescent history of psychiatric illness, personality, and clinical traits mediated the associations between parental characteristics and adolescent NSSI. Parental substance use disorder, adult-ADHD symptoms, self-criticism, and lower agreeableness and conscientiousness were associated with offspring's NSSI. These associations were mediated through adolescent characteristics. In contrast, parental mood and anxiety disorders and neuroticism were unrelated to adolescent NSSI. The results suggest that parental traits and disorders characterized by self-regulatory difficulties and lack of support constitute risk factors for self injury in adolescent girls, acting via adolescent traits. This demonstrates that parental influences play a significant role in the etiology of adolescent NSSI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This group case study describes the course of a 14-session Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Latino adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and depressive symptoms. The intervention, known as CBT-DM, is an adaptation of an efficacious group intervention for adolescent depression. The treatment rationale and cultural adaption model are described, as well as procedures used to achieve sensitivity to the characteristics of the T1DM culture as experienced by Latino youth from Puerto Rico. Session-by-session protocol is reviewed, and treatment gains on the group as a whole and on its individual members are presented, providing quantitative and qualitative data. Treatment feasibility, clients' acceptance and satisfaction with treatment, and follow-up data up to 6 months post-treatment are also examined, considering cognitive, behavioral, emotional, relational, medical, and functional outcomes. Complicating factors, barriers to care, and treatment implications are discussed in the context of treating clients with comorbid chronic physical illness and emotional problems also embedded in a Latino culture. Translation of evidence-based treatments for depression into primary care settings and adapting protocols to youth populations with other medical illnesses is proposed. Recommendations for clinicians are provided, emphasizing the establishment of collaborative relationships with clients, assessing their stage in the process of accepting their chronic illness, as well as understanding their overall context to avoid unnecessary attributions of pathology to their thoughts, behaviors, and feelings.

AB Rumination has a large direct effect on psychopathology but has received relatively little attention in autism spectrum disorder despite the propensity to perseverate in this population. This study provided initial evidence that adolescents with autism spectrum disorder self-report more anger-focused rumination than typically developing controls, though there was substantial within-group variability. Anger rumination was positively correlated with autism symptom severity with both groups combined. Future studies that include measures of perseveration on special interests are needed to understand whether anger rumination is a manifestation of a perseverative type of repetitive behavior or a distinct trait. Even when controlling for autism symptom severity, however, anger-focused rumination was associated with poorer functioning, including more depression symptoms and overall emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Therefore, further inquiry regarding anger rumination in autism spectrum disorder is clinically important, and the potential impact of rumination-focused interventions should be explored.

AB Children in foster care are at risk for behavioral and emotional problems that require higher levels of care than other children. To meet these needs and reduce placement disruptions, foster parents require effective parenting skills. Although a number of training models have been evaluated, the findings on the efficacy of foster parent training (FPT) are mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis of the FPT outcome research from 1984 to 2014 to develop a clearer understanding of the impact of such trainings. Fifteen samples (16 studies) were identified that investigated the impact of FPT on self-reported parenting skills and knowledge and child problem behaviors. The mean effect size for child disruptive behavior using a random effects model was small but significant at -.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.39, -.01], Z = 2.05, p < .05), suggesting that, on average, foster parents who were involved in the trainings reported fewer child behavior problems than parents who did not receive the training. The mean effect size for parenting was moderate and significant at .52 (95% CI = [.22, .82], Z = 3.38, p < .05), indicating that, on average, parents in the treatment groups reported higher levels of skills and knowledge following training than did those in the control group. While these results are promising, more research is necessary to investigate the inconsistency in effect sizes across studies.

AB Objective: Problematic Internet Use (PIU), broadly conceptualized as an inability to control one's use of the Internet leading to negative consequences in daily life, is fast becoming a matter of significant concern in our society, particularly in adolescents. In the present study we aimed to assess a model in which metacognitions and emotion regulation independently predicted PIU.
   Method: A total of 380 adolescent students from a secondary school in Italy voluntarily participated in the study. Students completed a set of online self- report scales assessing PIU, metacognitions, and emotion regulation.
   Results: Metacognitions, with the exception of cognitive self-consciousness, were positively correlated with PIU. Moreover, emotion regulation negatively correlated with PIU. The model tested indicated that both metacognitions and emotion regulation had direct effects (positive and negative respectively) on PIU and that the relationship between metacognitions and emotion regulation was not significant.
   Conclusions: Both metacognitions and emotion regulation appear to be relevant to PIU among adolescents. We discuss the implications of these findings.

AB Interoception refers to the perception of the physiological condition of the body, including hunger, temperature, and heart rate. There is a growing appreciation that interoception is integral to higher-order cognition. Indeed, existing research indicates an association between low interoceptive sensitivity and alexithymia (a difficulty identifying one's own emotion), underscoring the link between bodily and emotional awareness. Despite this appreciation, the developmental trajectory of interoception across the lifespan remains under-researched, with clear gaps in our understanding. This qualitative review and opinion paper provides a brief overview of interoception, discussing its relevance for developmental psychopathology, and highlighting measurement issues, before surveying the available work on interoception across four stages of development: infancy, childhood, adolescence and late adulthood. Where gaps in the literature addressing the development of interoception exist, we draw upon the association between alexithymia and interoception, using alexithymia as a possible marker of atypical interoception. Evidence indicates that interoceptive ability varies across development, and that this variance correlates with established age-related changes in cognition and with risk periods for the development of psychopathology. We suggest a theory within which atypical interoception underlies the onset of psychopathology and risky behaviour in adolescence, and the decreased socio-emotional competence observed in late adulthood.

AB Although prior research has consistently documented the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and poor mental health outcomes, the mechanisms that underlie this link are still unclear. The present 3-wave longitudinal study tested the mediating role of anger regulation in the discrimination-mental health link among 269 Mexican-origin adolescents (M-age = 14.1 years, SD = 1.6; 57% girls), 12 to 17 years old. Three competing anger regulation variables were tested as potential mediators: outward anger expression, anger suppression, and anger control. Longitudinal mediation analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling that disaggregated within-person effects from between-person effects. Results indicated that outward anger expression was a significant mediator; anger suppression and anger control were not significant mediators. Within a given individual, greater racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with more frequent outward anger expression. In turn, more frequent outward anger expression was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression at a given time point. Gender, age, and nativity status were not significant moderators of the hypothesized mediation models. By identifying outward anger expression as an explanatory mechanism in the discrimination-distress link among Latino youths, this study points to a malleable target for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating the detrimental impact of racism on Latino youths' mental health during the developmentally critical period of adolescence.

AB Although cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy are evidence-based treatments for pediatric anxiety, many youth with anxiety disorders fail to respond to these treatments. Given limitations of clinical measures in predicting treatment response, identifying neural predictors is timely. In this study, 35 anxious youth (ages 7-19 years) completed an emotional face-matching task during which the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) component that indexes sustained attention towards emotional stimuli, was measured. Following the ERP measurement, youth received CBT or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, and the LPP was examined as a predictor of treatment response. Findings indicated that, accounting for pre-treatment anxiety severity, neural reactivity to emotional faces predicted anxiety severity post- CBT and SSRI treatment such that enhanced electrocortical response to angry faces was associated with better treatment response. An enhanced LPP to angry faces may predict treatment response insofar as it may reflect greater emotion dysregulation or less avoidance and/or enhanced engagement with environmental stimuli in general, including with treatment.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to determine the unique utility of poor sleep health in predicting the onset of substance use in adolescents.
   Methods: Middle school students (N = 829, mean (M) age = 12.6 years, 52% female, 73% white) who participated in an ongoing prospective study of alcohol onset and progression completed a set of Web-based health behavior surveys over a 4-year period, with recruitment beginning in 2009. Surveys included assessments of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use as well as sleep duration, bedtime delay (from weekdays to weekends), and daytime sleepiness. Data were analyzed using discrete-time Cox Proportional hazard's regression.
   Results: Controlling for participant age at sleep assessment, gender, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, shorter sleep duration and greater daytime sleepiness in year 1 were associated with increased odds of having had a full drink of alcohol, having engaged in heavy episodic drinking, and having experienced alcohol-related consequences by year 4. Shorter sleep duration was also associated with increased odds of marijuana use by year 4. No sleep parameter was uniquely associated with increased odds of cigarette use (first puff or first full cigarette). Effects were evident for both males and females. Age at sleep assessment did not moderate effects.
   Conclusions: Sleep health is a prospective predictor of the onset of alcohol and marijuana use among adolescents. Increased efforts to prevent and intervene in sleep problems among adolescents are warranted. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB The prevalence and severity of behavioral problems in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be context dependent leading to discrepant informants' reports and complicating case conceptualizations and treatment goals. This study examines the inter-rater agreement of parents and teachers on behavioral problems of 58 youth with ASD and 42 youth without an ASD diagnosis. Parents and teachers of 26 youth with ASD (M = 4.08, SD = 1.02) and 21 youth with non-ASD diagnoses (M = 4.38, SD = 0.80), ages 2-5 years, and 32 youth with ASD (M = 7.47, SD = 1.44), and 21 youth with non-ASD diagnoses (M = 7.71, SD = 1.23), ages 6-10, completed the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form. Compared to youth with a non-ASD diagnosis (ages 2-5 years), youth with ASD also had poor to moderate agreement across subscales with the exception of comparable substantial agreement on Externalizing Behavior (ICC = 0.73 and ICC = 0.63, respectively) and Aggressive Behavior subscales (ICC = 0.72 and ICC = 0.69, respectively). Compared to youth with a non-ASD diagnosis (ages 6-10 years), youth with ASD similarly had poor agreement across subscales with the exception of moderate agreement on Anxious/Depressed subscale (ICC = 0.41 and ICC = 0.06, respectively). These results suggest that the severity and prevalence of behavior problems in youth may depend on the context and reporter of the symptoms.

AB The study examined the moderating effect of emotional closeness to grandparents on the relationship between parenting styles of parents and social competence of children. A total of 297 individuals (99 mothers, 99 fathers and 99 adolescents) living in joint family system including three generations (grandparents, parents, and grandchildren), with at least one child aged 13-18 years, participated in the study. Stepwise hierarchical regression analyses showed that child-reported parenting predicted children's social competence even after controlling for demographic and parent-reported parenting and explained 7-18 % of the variance in social skills of children. Emotional closeness to grandparents moderated the relationship between mother authoritativeness and overconfidence of children (beta = -.30, p < .05; Delta R (2) = .09), suggesting a positive relationship between mother authoritativeness and overconfidence of children when children are low on emotional closeness to grandparents and a negative relationship when children are high on emotional closeness to grandparents. Emotional closeness to grandparents also moderated the effect of father authoritativeness on inappropriate assertiveness (beta = -.37, p < .05; Delta RA(2) = .13) and withdrawal (beta = -.36, p < .05; Delta RA(2) = .08) of children, suggesting that an increase in father authoritativeness is associated with a decrease in undesired traits, i.e., inappropriate assertiveness and withdrawal, under higher levels of emotional closeness to grandparents. It is concluded that in the course of psychosocial development, the emotional closeness of children to grandparents serves as safeguard against negative family conditions.

AB BackgroundWe explored whether school-based Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT) may optimise both academic and psychological outcomes at school. Training of executive control skills may form a novel approach to enhancing processes that predict academic achievement, such as task-related attention, and thereby academic performance, but also has the potential to improve the regulation of emotion, social problems and behavioural difficulties.
   MethodsPrimary school children (Mean age=12years, N=148) were cluster-randomised to complete active CWMT, a nonadaptive/placebo version of CWMT, or no training.
   ResultsNo evidence was found for training effects on task-related attention when performing academic tasks, or performance on reading comprehension and mathematics tasks, or teacher-reported social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.
   ConclusionsCWMT did not improve control of attention in the classroom, or regulation of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.

AB Objective: Food Insecurity (FI) occurs in 21% of families with children and adolescents in the United States, but the potential developmental and behavioral implications of this prevalent social determinant of health have not been comprehensively elucidated. This systematic review aims to examine the association between FI and childhood developmental and behavioral outcomes in western industrialized countries. Method: This review provides a critical summary of 23 peer reviewed articles from developed countries on the associations between FI and adverse childhood developmental behavioral outcomes including early cognitive development, academic performance, inattention, externalizing behaviors, and depression in 4 groups-infants and toddlers, preschoolers, school age, and adolescents. Various approaches to measuring food insecurity are delineated. Potential confounding and mediating variables of this association are compared across studies. Alternate explanatory mechanisms of observed effects and need for further research are discussed. Results: This review demonstrates that household FI, even at marginal levels, is associated with children's behavioral, academic, and emotional problems from infancy to adolescence across western industrialized countries -even after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: While the American Academy of Pediatrics already recommends routine screening for food insecurity during health maintenance visits, the evidence summarized here should encourage developmental behavioral health providers to screen for food insecurity in their practices and intervene when possible. Conversely, children whose families are identified as food insecure in primary care settings warrant enhanced developmental behavioral assessment and possible intervention.

AB BackgroundEmotion regulation has been identified as a robust predictor of adaptive functioning across a variety of domains (Aldao et al. ). Furthermore, research examining early predictors of competence and deficits in ER suggests that factors internal to the individual (e.g. neuroregulatory reactivity, behavioural traits and cognitive ability) and external to the individual (e.g. caregiving styles and explicit ER training) contribute to the development of ER (Calkins ). Many studies have focused on internal sources or external sources; however, few have studied them simultaneously within one model, especially in studies examining children with developmental delays (DD). Here, we addressed this specific research gap and examined the contributions of one internal factor and one external factor on emotion dysregulation outcomes in middle childhood. Specifically, our current study used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine prospective, predictive relationships between DD status, positive parenting at age 4years and child emotion dysregulation at age 7years.
   MethodParticipants were 151 families in the Collaborative Family Study, a longitudinal study of young children with and without DD. A positive parenting factor was composed of sensitivity and scaffolding scores from mother-child interactions at home and in the research centre at child age 4years. A child dysregulation factor was composed of a dysregulation code from mother-child interactions and a parent-report measure of ER and lability/negativity at age 7years. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that positive parenting would mediate the relationship between DD and child dysregulation.
   ResultsMothers of children with DD exhibited fewer sensitive and scaffolding behaviours compared with mothers of typically developing children, and children with DD were more dysregulated on all measures of ER. SEM revealed that both DD status and early positive parenting predicted emotion dysregulation in middle childhood. Furthermore, findings provided support for our hypothesis that early positive parenting mediated the relationship between DD and dysregulation.
   ConclusionsThis work enhances our understanding of the development of ER across childhood and how endogenous child factors (DD status) and exogenous family factors (positive parenting) affect this process. Our findings provide clear implications for early intervention programmes for children with DD. Because of the predictive relationships between (a) developmental status and ER and (b) parenting and ER, the results imply that sensitive parenting behaviours should be specifically targeted in parent interventions for children with DD.

AB Electronic media play an important role in the everyday lives of children and adolescents and have been shown to be associated with sleep problems. The objective of this study was to assess the associations between time spent using different electronic media and insomnia complaints (IC) in German adolescents with particular respect to gender differences in use patterns and associations with IC. Cross-sectional data of a weighted total of 7533 adolescents aged 11-17 stem from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS study) that was conducted from 2003 to 2006. The assessment of IC and time spent using different electronic media (television, computer/internet, video games, total screen time, mobile phones, and music) was included in a self-report questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between time spent per day with each electronic media and IC. Age, SES, emotional problems (anxiety/depression) and presence of a medical condition were considered as covariates in the adjusted model. Boys and girls were considered separately. For boys: computer/internet use of >= 3 h/d (AOR = 2.56, p < 0.05) and total screen time of >= 8 h/d (AOR = 2.45, p < 0.01) were associated with IC in users. Playing video games for 0.5-2 h/d reduced the odds for IC (AOR = 0.60, p < 0.05) compared to nonusers. For girls: Listening to music for >= 3 h/d was associated with IC (AOR = 4.24, p < 0.05) compared to non-listeners. Everyday use of electronic media devices is associated with IC in adolescents. Clinicians dealing with adolescents referred for sleep problems should be aware of gender-specific patterns of media use and sleep problems.

AB The role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.

AB Both impulsivity and sleep disturbance have been associated with heavy alcohol use among young adults; yet studies to date have not examined their interactive effects. The current study aimed to determine if adequate sleep moderates the association between impulsive personality traits and alcohol use among young adults. College students (N = 568) who had been mandated to alcohol treatment following violation of campus alcohol policy provided information regarding alcohol use and related consequences, impulsive personality traits (measured using the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale), and perception of sleep adequacy as part of a larger intervention trial. Higher urgency, lower premeditation, and higher sensation-seeking predicted greater levels of alcohol consumption, while higher urgency predicted more alcohol-related consequences. As hypothesized, there was a significant interaction between premeditation and sleep adequacy in the prediction of drinks per week; in contrast to hypotheses, however, premeditation was associated with drinking only among those reporting adequate (rather than inadequate) sleep. Specifically, the tendency to premeditate was associated with less drinking among those who reported adequate sleep and was not associated with drinking among those reporting inadequate sleep. Sensation-seeking and urgency are associated with greater alcohol involvement among young adults, regardless of sleep adequacy. Conversely, the ability to plan ahead and anticipate the consequences of one's behaviors (premeditation) is only protective against heavy drinking among individuals receiving adequate sleep. With replication, these findings may inform alcohol prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Objective: Dysregulation of autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is a putative intermediate phenotype linking childhood adversity (CA) with later psychopathology. However, associations of CAs with autonomic nervous system and HPA-axis function vary widely across studies. Here, we test a novel conceptual model discriminating between distinct forms of CA (deprivation and threat) and examine their independent associations with physiological reactivity and psychopathology.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 169; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.4] years) with a range of interpersonal violence (e.g., maltreatment, community violence) and poverty exposure participated in the Trier Social Stress test (TSST). During the TSST, electrocardiogram, impedance cardiograph, salivary cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate data were collected. We compared the associations of poverty (an indicator of deprivation) and interpersonal violence (an indicator of threat) on sympathetic, parasympathetic, and HPA-axis reactivity to the TSST, and assessed whether these differences mediated the association of adversity with internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: Exposure to poverty and interpersonal violence was associated with psychopathology. Interpersonal violence, adjusting for poverty, was associated with blunted sympathetic (b=1.44, p=.050) and HPA-axis reactivity (b=-.09; p=.021). Blunted cortisol reactivity mediated the association of interpersonal violence with externalizing, but not internalizing, psychopathology. In contrast, poverty was not associated with physiological reactivity after adjusting for interpersonal violence.
   Conclusions: We provide evidence for distinct neurobiological mechanisms through which adversity related to poverty and interpersonal violence is associated with psychopathology in adolescence. Distinguishing distinct pathways through which adversity influences mental health has implications for preventive interventions targeting youths exposed to childhood adversity.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of a modest delay (15 min) in school start time (SST) on adolescent sleep patterns, mood, and behaviors.
   Methods: Two secondary schools in Hong Kong with a total of 1173 students (intervention: n = 617; comparison school n = 556) completed both baseline and follow-up questionnaires. School start time was delayed by 15 min, from 7: 45 a. m. to 8: 00 a. m., in the intervention school. The comparison school maintained their regular SST at 7: 55 a. m. Students' sleep-wake patterns, daytime sleepiness, and mental and behavioral aspects were assessed by validated questionnaires before and after the intervention.
   Results: Students in the intervention school significantly delayed their weekday wake-up time (p < 0.001) and increased their total time in bed (p < 0.001) when compared to students in the comparison school. Both groups experienced a delay in their weekday bedtime. The students in the intervention school showed improved mental health [ General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score, p = 0.015], better prosocial behaviors (p = 0.009), better peer relationships (p < 0.001), greater attentiveness (p < 0.001), less emotional problems (p = 0.002), and less behavioral difficulties (p < 0.001) as measured by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Conclusions: A modest delay (15 min) in school start time can increase adolescent sleep with corresponding improvement in mood and behaviors. Current findings have significant implications for education policy, suggesting that school administrators and policy makers should systematically consider delaying school start time to promote sleep and health among school-aged adolescents.

AB Affective Social Competence (ASC) is a conceptual framework describing complementary processes of sending, receiving, and experiencing emotions in dynamic interactions. This framework may be applied across the lifespan. To date, however, empirical studies addressing ASC have focused predominantly on childhood samples. In this review, we examine empirical evidence relevant to ASC in adolescence in comparison with childhood. We then discuss future directions that may promote understanding of Affective Social Competence among adolescent samples: the use of person-oriented analyses to integrate all three components of ASC; consideration of understudied social contexts that may influence and be influenced by ASC; and use of microgenetic designs to examine growth across transitions during early, middle, and late adolescence.

AB There has been increased awareness recently of the unique medical and psychosocial needs of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. However, the existing AYA literature is mainly focused on curative disease or survivorship rather than on advanced disease. Using qualitative methodology, we sought to understand the experience of younger adults with advanced cancer.
   Participants were interviewed using open-ended, discovery-oriented interviews. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. In total, ten English-speaking advanced cancer patients who were being treated at a comprehensive cancer center in Canada, were interviewed. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 35, and seven of them were female.
   The diagnosis of cancer was universally experienced as isolating and unexpected, with serious illness regarded as a problem of older individuals. The core challenge of living in the face of dying was felt to be constantly present yet typically unarticulated. Meaning-making tended to be constructed around future-oriented goals rather than upon the life that had been lived. Individuals felt forcefully removed from the stream of life, with a perceived interruption in the developmental tasks of establishing adult identity, becoming autonomous, and forming new relationships. All cited a need for young adult-specific services, yet none could describe specific services that would be beneficial. Many expressed reluctance to engage in individual psychotherapeutic treatment.
   Advanced cancer in younger adults was perceived by them as isolating and as interfering with age-appropriate developmental tasks. Creative and flexible psychosocial support programs are needed to engage this population with limited expected survival.

AB The current study examined moderator roles of two dimensions of attachment quality (maternal availability and child dependency on mothers) in the relationship between personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion) and emotion regulation (ER) strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). Differential effects of child dependency on mothers and maternal availability were expected on personality and ER strategies link. Participants were 267 first-year high school students from high schools located in Ankara, Turkey. Mean age of the adolescent sample was 15.00 (SD = 0.39). Adolescents were administered scales assessing ER strategies, attachment quality, and personality traits. Results revealed that high extraversion was associated with increased cognitive reappraisal for adolescents who reported high dependency on mothers, but it was unrelated to cognitive reappraisal for adolescents who reported low dependency. On the other hand, high neuroticism was associated with increased expressive suppression for adolescents who reported low maternal availability in times of stress, but it was unrelated to expressive suppression for adolescents who reported high maternal availability. This study was the first to document that maternal availability and child dependency on mothers differentially moderate the association between ER strategies and personality traits. Findings will be discussed in line with socialization and cultural context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as well as the relationships between emotion dysregulation, negative attitudes towards the body, and NSSI, within a sample of college students. We administered self-report measures to 143 diverse college students. Results revealed an NSSI prevalence rate of approximately 27%. Those who identified as a racial/ethnic minority were no more likely to endorse NSSI than those who identified as White/European American. There were no significant differences in emotion dysregulation between participants who endorsed NSSI and those who did not, yet negative bodily attitudes were significantly related to NSSI. Based upon the results, it is argued that negative attitudes towards the body should be considered an important risk factor in NSSI engagement among diverse college students.

AB Objective: The reduction of the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) following cognitive reappraisal has been used as a neural marker of emotion regulation. However, studies employing this neural marker in children are scarce and findings are not conclusive, with most studies showing a lack of LPP modulation after reappraisal in children in the age range of 5-12 years. The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate developmental changes in sensitivity of LPP modulation to cognitive reappraisal. To do so, LPP modulation due to cognitive reappraisal of negative pictures was compared between two age groups (8- to 11- versus 12- to 15-year-olds) and regression analyses were applied within the total sample to test whether sensitivity of LPP modulation shows a linear increase with age.
   Method: In 63 children the LPP was measured after negative pictures that were either combined with a negative story or with a neutral, reappraising story. Results: Although groups did not differ for self-reports on reappraisal, a significant reduction of LPP following cognitive reappraisal was only found in the older children, whereas such an effect was absent in the younger children. Findings were similar for boys and girls. Additional analyses showed a linear increase in sensitivity of LPP modulation with age.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that LPP modulation as measured in the current paradigm can be used as a valid index of emotion regulation in boys and girls but that caution is recommended using it in younger children.

AB Background: The novel group treatment program Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA) was developed to target specific mechanisms based on neuroscience findings in adolescent depression and framed within the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria. TARA contains training of autonomic and emotional self-regulation, interoceptive awareness, relational skills, and value-based committed action.
   Methods: We performed a single-arm trial to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of TARA in reducing depression and anxiety levels and assessed whether the specific targeted domains of function reflected the hypothesized symptom change. Twenty-six adolescents (14-18 years old, 7 males and 1(females) participated in the 12-week group program. Assessment was performed before (T0), immediately after (T1), and 3 months after the end of TARA (T2).
   Results: Significant improvement was seen in depression symptoms (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale Second Edition) between T0-T1 (t-value = -3.56, p = 0.002, CI = -6.64, -1.77) and T0-T2 (t-value = -4.17, p < 0.001, CI = -11.20, -3.75) and anxiety symptoms (Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children) between T0-T1 (t-value = -2.26, p = 0.033, CI = -4.61, -0.21) and T0-T2 (t-value = -3.06, p = 0.006, 95% confidence interval = -9.02, -1.73). Significant improvements in psychological flexibility, sleep, and mindfulness skills were also found between T0 and T2.
   Limitations: The sample size was small without a control condition. The pilot design did not allow for testing the hypothesized brain changes and effect of TARA on relevant systemic biomarkers.
   Conclusion: TARA is feasible in a sample of clinically depressed and/or anxious adolescents and preliminary efficacy was demonstrated by reduced depression and anxiety symptoms. The specific symptom and behavioral outcomes corresponded well with the hypothesized mechanisms of change.

   VALIDITY
AB Objective: Both bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) present with emotion-regulation deficits, but require different clinical management. We examined how the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion regulation might differentiate youth with BPSD versus ADHD (and healthy controls, HCs), specifically assessing functional connectivity (FxC) of amygdala-prefrontal circuitry during an implicit emotion processing task.
   Methods: We scanned a subset of the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) sample, a clinically recruited cohort with elevated behavioral and emotional dysregulation, and age/sex-ratio matched HCs. Our sample consisted of 22 youth with BPSD, 30 youth with ADHD/no BPSD, and 26 HCs. We used generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) to calculate group differences to emerging emotional faces vs. morphing shapes in FxC between bilateral amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex. Results: FxC between amygdala and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in response to emotions vs. shapes differed by group (p=.05): while BPSD showed positive FxC (emotions > shapes), HC and ADHD showed inverse FxC (emotions < shapes). A group x emotion interaction was found in amygdala-subgenual cingulate FxC (p=.025), explained by differences in FxC in response to negative emotions. While BPSD showed positive FxC, HC showed inverse FxC; ADHD were intermediate. Amygdala-subgenual FxC was also positively associated with depressive symptoms and stimulant medication.
   Limitations: Co-morbidity and relatively small sample size.
   Conclusions: Youth with BPSD showed abnormally positive FxC between amygdala and regions in the ventral prefrontal cortex during emotion processing. In particular, the amygdala-VLPFC finding was specific to BPSD, and not influenced by other diagnoses or medications.

AB Background: The Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP), (high scores in Anxious/ Depressed, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior subscales), has been related to poor emotional and behavioral self-regulation in children and adolescents. Our aim is to evaluate if it may be associated with auto-aggression in youth with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
   Method In 72 consecutively referred youths with ODD, emotional dysregulation was assessed with the CBCL-DP, auto-aggression and physical aggression against other persons with the Modified Overt Aggression Scale.
   Results: Regression analysis showed that greater higher CBCL-DP scores were associated to higher levels of auto-aggression, even when controlling for the levels of physical aggression against others and CBCL Total score. Limitations: The small sample size, the cross-sectional design, and the lack of a control group limit the generalization of our findings.
   Conclusions: Referred ODD youths with higher scores of CBCL-DP are more likely to present auto aggression, besides aggression against others. The CBCL could improve the screening and detection of these high-risk patients.

ID YOUNG-ADULTS; COMMUNITY SAMPLE; ADOLESCENTS; INJURY; SUICIDE;
   STRATEGIES; THOUGHTS; EPISODES; PEOPLE; MODEL
AB Background: Self-harm affords people a means of coping. However, little is known about how functional coping dynamics differ between stressful situations in which people self-harm (enactment), think about harming (ideation), or experience no self-harmful thoughts or behaviours.
   Methods: Participants (N = 1,157) aged 16-49 years (M = 18.21, SD = 3.24) with a recent history of self-harm (past 3 months) reported how they coped in response to their most significant recent stressor (3 months).
   Results: Almost 40% of participants, all of whom had self-harmed in the last 3 months, had no self-harm experience (thoughts or behaviours) in response to their most significant stressor in that time frame. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for symptoms of depression and anxiety, reappraisal coping was predictive of self-harm thoughts. Approach, emotion regulation and reappraisal coping were predictive of self-harm behaviour. Emotion regulation coping differentiated self-harm ideation and enactment groups.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study precludes the ability to make inferences regarding causality. Further, there is no agreed definition of 'recent' self-harm.
   Conclusions: Taken together, the findings suggest that functional coping dynamics may be differentially associated with self-harm ideation and enactment. This is important, given that understanding the transitions between ideation and enactment has been identified as a critical frontier in suicide prevention. Further, results indicate that seemingly innocuous events may have a profound impact as tipping points for enaction; this has implications for clinical practice, including the co-production of safety plans.

AB The cardinal characteristics of tic-related disorders are stereotyped motor movements and vocalizations. However, they may be accompanied by non-motor features that appear sequentially during the course of the disorder and can sometimes be more disabling than the tics themselves. This review presents our perspectives on several non-motor aspects of Tourette syndrome based on the long experience of the Neuropsychiatric Tourette Clinic of a tertiary pediatric medical center. The effect of premonitory urges, sensory modulation disorder, tic-related cognitions, and environmental conditions on the expression and intensity of tics is elaborated, with suggestions for treatment approaches to each. We also describe the mediatory effect of parental attachment style on the link between maternal stress and ticcing intensity and the need to adjust psychotherapy interventions to account for the importance of this factor in emotion regulation. This review is intended to direct attention to the non-motor aspects of Tourette syndrome. An in-depth understanding of this complex and debilitating disorder will facilitate the formulation of innovative therapeutic protocols.

AB Background The functional neuroanatomy for explicit memory in conjunction with the major anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has not yet been clearly identified.
   Purpose To investigate the brain activation patterns on the interaction between emotional and cognitive function during the explicit memory tasks, as well as its correlation with clinical characteristics in GAD.
   Material and Methods The participants comprised GAD patients and age-matched healthy controls. The fMR images were obtained while the participants performed an explicit memory task with neutral and anxiety-inducing words.
   Results Patients showed significantly decreased functional activities in the putamen, head of the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and middle cingulate gyrus during the memory tasks with the neutral and anxiety-inducing words, whereas the precentral gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly increased only in the memory tasks with the anxiety-inducing words. Also, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the hippocampus were positively correlated with the recognition accuracy for both neutral and anxiety-inducing words.
   Conclusion This study identified the brain areas associated with the interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive function in the explicit memory tasks in patients with GAD. These findings would be helpful to understand the neural mechanism on the explicit memory-related cognitive deficits and emotional dysfunction with GAD symptoms.

AB Background: Complex trauma involves prolonged or repeated exposure during critical developmental windows or transitions (including adolescence) to intentional interpersonal victimization that is inescapable and causes profound insecurity. Developmental Trauma Disorder is a clinical framework for describing heterogeneous sequelae of complex trauma.
   Objective: To review the conceptual, diagnostic, clinical, and scientific issues and evidence with regard to the nature and sequelae of complex trauma in adolescence.
   Method: Variants of posttraumatic stress disorder in adulthood that foreshadow Developmental Trauma Disorder are described, including Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified and Enduring Personality Change Associated with Catastrophic Experiences. The clinical and developmental rationale for Developmental Trauma Disorder, and results of research supporting the clinical utility of Developmental Trauma Disorder as a distinct diagnostic construct and an integrative parsimonious framework for clinical assessment and treatment, are described with a focus on adolescence. Emergent empirically supported psychotherapy models designed to enhance self-regulation in youth with complex trauma histories are described.
   Results and Conclusion: Complex trauma and Developmental Trauma Disorder provide a self-regulation framework that can advance research and clinical psychiatric assessment and treatment of highly complex trauma-related forms of adolescent psychopathology.

AB In this study we examined the relative risk of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) associated with a history of physical and sexual abuse/assault, poor attachment relationships, and poor emotion regulation among adolescents. A total of 2,637 adolescents (aged 12-15 years) completed questionnaires at 3 time-points: baseline, 12, and 24 months later. Across the study, 9.4% reported a history of NSSI. Each of past or recent abuse/assault, poor attachment relationships, and poor emotion regulation was associated with NSSI. We also observed a potential high-risk group among those reporting recent sexual abuse or assault. Knowledge of abuse history, recent sexual assault, attachment, and emotion regulatory ability will enable clinicians to assist adolescents in avoiding some of the more negative outcomes of these, including NSSI.

AB In Part 1 of this paper, we discussed emerging evidence suggesting that a general psychopathology or 'p' factor underlying the various forms of psychopathology should be conceptualized in terms of the absence of resilience, that is, the absence of positive reappraisal mechanisms when faced with adversity. These impairments in the capacity for positive reappraisal seem to provide a comprehensive explanation for the association between the p factor and comorbidity, future caseness, and the 'hard-to-reach' character of many patients with severe personality pathology, most notably borderline personality disorder (BPD). In this, the second part of the paper, we trace the development of the absence of resilience to disruptions in the emergence of human social communication, based on recent evolutionary and developmental psychopathology accounts. We argue that BPD and related disorders may be reconceptualized as a form of social understanding in which epistemic hypervigilance, distrust or outright epistemic freezing is an adaptive consequence of the social learning environment. Negative appraisal mechanisms become overriding, particularly in situations of attachment stress. This constitutes a shift towards a more socially oriented perspective on personality psychopathology in which the absence of psychological resilience is seen as a learned response to the transmission of social knowledge. This shift in our views has also forced us to reconsider the role of attachment in BPD. The implications for prevention and intervention of this novel approach are discussed.

AB Background: Research has supported the notion that emotion dysregulation is a core feature of BPD. However, given that this feature is typical of healthy adolescents as well as adolescents with other psychiatric disorders, the specificity of emotion dysregulation to BPD in this age group has not yet been determined. The overall aim of this study was to examine emotion dysregulation in adolescent inpatients with BPD compared with non-BPD inpatient adolescents and healthy non-clinical adolescents, taking into account both global emotion dysregulation deficits and more specific impairments.
   Method: The sample included 185 adolescent inpatients with BPD (M = 15.23, SD = 1.52), 367 non-BPD psychiatric inpatient adolescents (M = 15.37, SD = 1.40), and 146 healthy adolescents (M = 15.23, SD = 1.22), all of whom were between the ages of 12 and 17. Borderline personality features were assessed, along with emotion dysregulation and psychiatric severity.
   Results: After controlling for age, gender, and psychiatric severity, results revealed that adolescents with BPD had higher overall emotional dysregulation compared with non-BPD psychiatric controls and healthy controls. These differences were apparent in only two domains of emotion dysregulation including limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective and impulse control difficulties when experiencing negative emotions.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest BPD-specific elevations on emotion dysregulation generally, and subscales related to behavioral regulation specifically.

AB Background: Developmental theories for the aetiology of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) suggest that both individual features (e.g., childhood dysregulated behaviour) and negative environmental experiences (e.g., maladaptive parenting, peer victimisation) may lead to the development of BPD symptoms during adolescence. Few prospective studies have examined potential aetiological pathways involving these two factors.
   Method: We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We assessed mother-reported childhood dysregulated behaviour at 4, 7 and 8 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); maladaptive parenting (maternal hitting, punishment, and hostility) at 8 to 9 years; and bully victimisation (child and mother report) at 8, 9 and 10 years. BPD symptoms were assessed at 11 years using the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV BPD. Control variables included adolescent depression (assessed with the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-SMFQ) and psychotic symptoms (assessed with the Psychosis-Like Symptoms Interview-PLIKS) at 11 to 14 years, and mother's exposure to family adversity during pregnancy (assessed with the Family Adversity Scale-FAI).
   Results: In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, childhood dysregulated behaviour and all environmental risk factors (i.e., family adversity, maladaptive parenting, and bully victimisation) were significantly associated with BPD symptoms at 11 years. Within structural equation modelling controlling for all associations simultaneously, family adversity and male sex significantly predicted dysregulated behaviour across childhood, while bully victimisation significantly predicted BPD, depression, and psychotic symptoms. Children displaying dysregulated behaviour across childhood were significantly more likely to experience maladaptive parenting (beta = 0.075, p < 0.001) and bully victimisation (beta = 0. 327, p < 0.001). Further, there was a significant indirect association between childhood dysregulated behaviour and BPD symptoms via an increased risk of bullying (beta = 0.097, p < 0.001). While significant indirect associations between dysregulated behaviour, bully victimisation and depression (beta = 0.063, p < 0.001) and psychotic (beta = 0.074, p < 0.001) outcomes were also observed, the indirect association was significantly stronger for the BPD outcome (BPD depression = 0.034, p < 0.01; BPD -psychotic symptoms = 0.023, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Childhood dysregulated behaviour is associated with BPD in early adolescence via an increased risk of bully victimisation. This suggests that childhood dysregulation may influence the risk of bully victimisation, which in turn influences the development of BPD. Effective interventions should target dysregulated behaviour early on to reduce exposure to environmental risks and the subsequent development of BPD.

AB This study adopted a social-ecological perspective to exploring perpetration of serious physical violence against others among Arab-Palestinian adolescents. A total of 3178 adolescents (aged 13-18) completed anonymous, structured, self-report questionnaire, which included selected items from several instruments that measured variables relating to the constructs examined in the study. We explored the association of individual characteristics (age, gender, normative beliefs about violence, and perceived ethnic discrimination), familial characteristics (parent-adolescent communication and socioeconomic status), and contextual characteristics (exposure to community violence in the neighborhood) with perpetration of serious physical violence against others. A moderation-mediation model was tested, and 28.4% of the adolescents reported that they had perpetrated serious physical violence against others at least once during the month preceding the study. The findings also show that exposure of youth to violence in their neighborhood correlated significantly and positively with their perpetration of serious physical violence against others. A similar trend was revealed with respect to personal perceptions of ethnic discrimination. These correlations were mediated by the adolescents' normative beliefs about violence. Furthermore, the correlation of direct exposure to violence in the neighborhood and normative beliefs about violence with perpetration of serious physical violence against others was stronger among adolescents who have poor communication with their parents than among those who have strong parental communication.

AB High levels of ADHD symptoms are related to severe negative outcomes, which underscore the importance of identifying early markers of these behavior problems. The main aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether neuropsychological deficits in preschool are related to later ADHD symptoms and academic achievement, over and above the influence of early ADHD symptom levels. The present study is unique because it includes a broader range of predictors compared to previous studies and the participants are followed over time for as long as 13 years (i. e., ages 5-18 years). Preschool data included measures of executive functioning and reaction time variability as well as emotional reactivity and emotion regulation of both positive and negative emotions. When controlling for early ADHD symptom levels, working memory, reaction time variability, and regulation of happiness/exuberance were significantly related to inattention whereas regulation of happiness/exuberance and anger reactivity were significantly related to hyperactivity/impulsivity. Furthermore, working memory and reaction time variability in preschool were significantly related to academic achievement in late adolescence beyond the influence of early ADHD symptoms. These findings could suggest that it is possible to screen for early neuropsychological deficits and thereby identify children who are at risk of negative outcomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that interventions need to look beyond executive functioning deficits in ADHD and also target the role of emotional functioning and reaction time variability. The importance of including both the positive and negative aspects of emotional functioning and distinguishing between emotion regulation and emotional reactivity was also demonstrated.

AB Past research results suggest that executive functioning (EF) impairment represents an important vulnerability factor in depression. Little research, however, has examined mechanisms underlying this association. The current study investigates the associations between EF impairment, emotion regulation (ER) strategies, and depressive symptoms in a sample of 579 adolescents (320 females, mean age =12.06 years). Parents reported on adolescents' EF and general psychopathology, and adolescents self-reported ER strategies and depressive symptoms. The results indicate that greater EF impairment is associated with more depressive symptoms. Youth with greater EF impairment reported more maladaptive ER and less adaptive ER, and maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies jointly mediated the association between EF impairment and depressive symptoms. The results highlight an important role of both maladaptive and adaptive ER in explaining the relationship between EF and depressive symptoms and suggest that clinical interventions targeting ER skills may provide one strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression. Further longitudinal research is needed to replicate these results and evaluate the causality of the relations.

AB Morningness/eveningness (M/E) preference is an important circadian rhythm indicator with strong individual variation. M/E chronotype has been found to be correlated with depression in adults, yet the relationship is less clear in children and adolescents. Additionally, poor sleep quality is another commonly studied risk factor for depression. The aims of the present study are to investigate the independent effects of M/E chronotype on youth depression using both self-report and parental-report questionnaires. We also evaluated how poor sleep quality may affect the relationship through a mediating or moderating effect. In total, 2,139 students attending grades 1 to 7 participated in this study. They completed questionnaires regarding M/E chronotype, depression, and sleep quality. A total of 1,708 parents also participated and filled out parental-reports of emotional and behavioral problems of their children. The prevalence of self-and parental-report depression was 16.8% and 12.8% among young students, respectively. Overall, 15.4% of the students were the eveningness type. Being an eveningness type was independently associated with self-report depression after adjustment for poor sleep quality (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.07-3.24). We also observed that poor sleep quality mediated the influence of M/E chronotype on self-report depression among students aged 7-13 years (p < 0.001). On the other hand, being an eveningness type was associated with a number of parental-report emotional and behavioral problems in the students, in addition to depression, although these associations become non-significant after adjusted for poor sleep quality. Our results demonstrate the importance of M/E chronotype on youth depression and poor sleep quality partly mediates this effect.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a complex behaviour, routinely engaged for emotion regulatory purposes. As such, a number of theoretical accounts regarding the aetiology and maintenance of NSSI are grounded in models of emotion regulation; the role that cognition plays in the behaviour is less well known. In this paper, we summarise four models of emotion regulation that have repeatedly been related to NSSI and identify the core components across them. We then draw on social cognitive theory to unite models of cognition and models of emotion in developing a new cognitive-emotional model of NSSI. Our model articulates how emotion regulation and cognition can work in concert to govern NSSI, and offers several new research questions that can be addressed within this framework.

AB Most empirical studies of emotion regulation have relied on retrospective trait measures, and have not examined the link between daily regulatory strategies and every day emotional well-being. We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n=187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably adaptive cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently good or bad.

   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   Participants included 312 adolescents attending high schools. 162 of the participants were female and 150 were male, with an average age of 16.26, SD = 1.21. Data collection was conducted with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotion Regulation Scale for Adolescents, the Coping Scale for Children and Youth, and the Positivity Scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, regression based on ordinary least squares, and the bootstrap method were used to analyze the research data.
   RESULTS
   The research findings indicated that internal dysfunctional emotion regulation, assistance seeking, problem solving, and behavioral avoidance mediated the relationship between perceived stress and positivity.
   CONCLUSION
   In conclusion, internal dysfunctional emotion regulation, seeking assistance, problem solving, and behavioral avoidance were found to mediate the relationship between adolescents' perceived stress and positivity. Thus, preparing individual and group psychological counseling as well as emotion regulation and coping-oriented psycho-educational programs for adolescents to regulate negative emotions and to cope with stress may be important. The research findings were discussed and interpreted based on the relevant literature, and suggestions for relevant experts were included.

AB Objective: This study aimed to characterize the risk of mental health problems among a representative sample of 6,310 4-17-year-olds, 147 of whom had parent-reported hearing problems.
   Methods: The study used data from the Young Minds Matter survey. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) assessed prevalence of mood, anxiety and behavioural disorders. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed social and emotional problems. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds of having mental health problems adjusting for child factors (speech and language problems, global health, age and gender), family factors (family structure, parent income, education, financial strain and psychological distress) and school-related factors (bullying, school liking, school absence).
   Results: In unadjusted analyses, children and young people with hearing problems had substantially higher odds of most mental health problems. Hearing problems were not associated with any mental health problem among 4-11-year-olds after adjusting for other child factors. After adjustments for child, family and school-related factors, 12-17-year-olds with a hearing problem remained at greater risk of social phobia and generalized anxiety (DISC-IV), and of peer and emotional problems (SDQ).
   Conclusions: Clinicians caring for children and young people with hearing problems should be alert for heightened risk of specific mental health problems based on age and the nature of hearing problems. Understanding a wider range of correlates associated with the higher prevalence of mental health problems may allow health professionals to be more informed about the nature of mental health problems that are comorbid to hearing problems.

AB IMPORTANCE Developmental stuttering is a neuropsychiatric condition of incompletely understood brain origin. Our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study indicates a possible partial basis of stuttering in circuits enacting self-regulation of motor activity, attention, and emotion.
   OBJECTIVE To further characterize the neurophysiology of stuttering through in vivo assay of neurometabolites in suspect brain regions.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Proton chemical shift imaging of the brain was performed in a case-control study of children and adults with and without stuttering. Recruitment, assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in an academic research setting.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate plus N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) and choline compounds (Cho) to Cr in widespread cerebral cortical, white matter, and subcortical regions were analyzed using region of interest and data-driven voxel-based approaches.
   RESULTS Forty-seven children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years (22 with stuttering and 25 without) and 47 adults aged 21 to 51 years (20 with stuttering and 27 without) were recruited between June 2008 and March 2013. The mean (SD) ages of those in the stuttering and control groups were 12.2 (4.2) years and 13.4 (3.2) years, respectively, for the pediatric cohort and 31.4 (7.5) years and 30.5 (9.9) years, respectively, for the adult cohort. Region of interest-based findings included lower group mean NAA: Cr ratio in stuttering than nonstuttering participants in the right inferior frontal cortex (-7.3%; P = .02), inferior frontal white matter (-11.4%; P < .001), and caudate (-10.6%; P = .04), while the Cho: Cr ratio was higher in the bilateral superior temporal cortex (left: +10.0%; P = .03 and right: +10.8%; P = .01), superior temporal white matter (left: +14.6%; P = .003 and right: +9.5%; P = .02), and thalamus (left: +11.6%; P = .002 and right: +11.1%; P = .001). False discovery rate-corrected voxel-based findings were highly consistent with region of interest findings. Additional voxel-based findings in the stuttering sample included higher NAA: Cr and Cho: Cr ratios (regression coefficient, 197.4-275; P < .001) in the posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, hippocampal, and parahippocampal cortices and amygdala, as well as lower NAA: Cr and Cho: Cr ratios (regression coefficient, 119.8-275; P < .001) in the superior frontal and frontal polar cortices. Affected regions comprised nodes of the Bohland speech-production (motor activity regulation), default-mode (attention regulation), and emotional-memory (emotion regulation) networks. Regional correlations were also observed between local metabolites and stuttering severity (r = 0.40-0.52; P = .001-.02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This spectroscopy study of stuttering demonstrates brainwide neurometabolite alterations, including several regions implicated by other neuroimaging modalities. Prior ascription of a role in stuttering to inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, caudate, and other structures is affirmed. Consistent with prior functional magnetic resonance imaging findings, these results further intimate neurometabolic aberrations in stuttering in brain circuits subserving self-regulation of speech production, attention, and emotion.

AB Several studies have found that perceived social support plays a crucial role in the psychological and physical wellbeing of young people. A number of instruments measuring perceived social support have been developed and validated, including the Perceived Social Support from Family and Friends subscales. The psychometric properties of the Perceived Social Support from Family and Friends subscales have been demonstrated in a range of samples, although not in Ghana. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of the Perceived Social Support from Family and Friends subscales in Ghanaian adolescents using data from a school-based survey (N = 770; 14-21 years). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire containing the Perceived Social Support from Family and Friends subscales, the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire, and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. An exploratory factor analysis in addition to simultaneous confirmatory factor analyses with structural equation modelling were performed to evaluate the factor structure and factorial validity of the subscales along with Cronbach's alpha and intercorrelations. Three factors and two factors were extracted for the Friends and Family subscales respectively. While the unidimensional model of the friends subscale had a better fit with the data than the three-factor model, the two-factor model of the family subscale had a better fit than the unidimensional model, even though the unidimensional models of both subscales produced higher internal consistency coefficients. With respect to construct validity, the family subscale demonstrated some evidence of convergent and discriminant validity, but the friends subscale demonstrated some evidence of only discriminant validity, in terms of the association between social support and common mental illness and perceived stress. It appears that the Perceived Social Support subscales are useful instruments for assessing social support from family and friends and could therefore be used to further our understanding about the role of social support in stressful life events and psychological functioning of Ghanaian adolescents, although further research is required for the friends subscale.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the role of worry versus sadness in influencing young consumers' purchase decisions and to clarify the differences across the worry-consumption versus the sadness-consumption relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three studies were conducted. Study 1 was a 3 (emotion: worry vs sadness vs neutral) x 2 (brand perceptions: conflicting vs consistent) between-subject design. Study 2 was a 3 (emotion: sadness vs worry vs neutral) x 2 (product type: social status associated vs hedonic) mixed design. Study 3 was a questionnaire survey.
   Findings - The results demonstrate that worry induces young consumers' identification with peers, and is more related to youth's purchase intention for social status associated products rather than hedonic products. Sadness induces young consumers to follow their own perceptions, and is more associated with purchase intention for hedonic rather than social status-associated products. The drivers of purchase behavior for expensive products also differ: worried young consumers' purchase intention is driven by perceptions of social status value associated with these products, whereas sad consumers' purchase intention is driven by perceptions of hedonic value.
   Practical implications - This research has significant implications for marketing practitioners on strategic marketing and communication to young consumers. It also provides important suggestions to young consumers on how to effectively regulate negative emotions via socially accepted behavior (i.e. purchases).
   Originality/value - This research contributes to the extant literature on emotion's impact on consumer behavior by elaborating carryover effects of emotion varying in the overlooked personal-and social-focus dimension. It also extends the literature on peer influence among young consumers.

AB The current study aims to examine the strategies of adolescents' emotion regulation to predict the Internet addiction and the smartphone addiction. The study participants included totally 262 high school students with 132 females (50.4%) and 130 (49.6%) males. Students' ages ranged between 14 and 19 with average age being 16.57, SD = 1.13. Emotion Regulation Scale for Adolescents, Young Internet Addiction Test-Brief Form, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Brief Form, and Personal Information Form were used as instruments to collect data in the current research. Based on the research findings, it was seen that external-dysfunctional emotion regulation, internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation, and internal-functional emotion regulation significantly predicted both the Internet addiction and the smartphone addiction; however, external-functional emotion regulation predict neither of the variables on significant levels. Emotion regulation strategies overall explained the 38% of variance in the Internet addiction and 19% of that in the smartphone addiction. The current research findings were discussed and interpreted, and suggestions were included for relevant researchers.

AB Substance use disorders andmood disorders are highly comorbid and confer a high risk for adverse outcomes. However, data are limited on the neurodevelopmental basis of this comorbidity. Substance use initiation typically occurs during adolescence, and sex-specific developmental mechanisms are implicated. In this preliminary study, we review the literature and investigate regional gray matter volume (GMV) associated with subsequent substance use problems in adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD) and explore these associations for females and males. Thirty adolescents with DSM-IV-diagnosed BD and minimal alcohol/substance exposure completed baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. At follow-up (on average 6 years post baseline), subjects were administered the CRAFFT interview and categorized into those scoring at high (>= 2: CRAFFT(HIGH)) vs. low (< 2: CRAFFT(LOW)) risk for alcohol/substance problems. Lower GMV in prefrontal, insular, and temporopolar cortices were observed at baseline among adolescents with BD reporting subsequent alcohol and cannabis use compared to adolescents with BD who did not (P < 0.005, clusters >= 20 voxels). Lower dorsolateral prefrontal GMV was associated with future substance use in both females and males. In females, lower orbitofrontal and insula GMV was associated with future substance use, while in males, lower rostral prefrontal GMV was associated with future use. Lower orbitofrontal, insular, and temporopolar GMV was observed in those who transitioned to smoking tobacco. Findings indicate that GMV development is associated with risk for future substance use problems in adolescents with BD, with results implicating GMV development in regions subserving emotional regulation in females and regions subserving executive processes and attention in males.

AB Distress tolerance and emotion regulation deficits are associated with many emotional and behavioral concerns and may be important deficit areas for college students especially during the transition to college. However, little is known about how distress tolerance and emotion regulation relate to each other or what typical profiles of these deficit areas might be. We took a variable-centered (i.e., exploratory factor analysis) and a person-centered approach (i.e., latent profile analysis) to identify the overlap and distinctiveness of distress tolerance and emotion regulation deficits and then evaluated how the profiles related to several emotional and behavioral concerns. Participants were undergraduates (N = 627; age M = 20.23, SD = 1.40; 60 % female; 47 % European-American) who completed an online assessment. The exploratory factor analysis of distress tolerance and emotion regulation subscales demonstrated three factors with one factor corresponding to distress tolerance and two factors defined by emotion regulation. Subscales demonstrated significant multidimensionality across the factors. The latent profile analysis with distress tolerance and emotion regulation subscales produced three profiles corresponding to "Functional", "At Risk", and "Challenged" levels of distress tolerance and emotion regulation abilities. Internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal ideation) had significantly higher symptom severity in the "At Risk", and "Challenged" profiles than in the "Functional" profile. ADHD symptoms and hostility showed a similar pattern. Conduct problems and substance use were much less related to the deficit profiles. Implications for the etiology of mental health, for prevention and treatment of college students are discussed.

AB Objective: To date, the factors contributing to emergence of resilience in different stages of adolescence have yet to be sufficiently examined.This study looks at the influence of extracurricular activities on resilience. Method: The sample consists of 413 adolescents (f = 14.8) reporting personal problems (mood, concentration problems, behavior). The effect of extracurricular activities on resilience (gathered by the RS25) was analyzed by linear regression models. Predictor variables in these models were extracurricular activities (sport, hobbies, club memberships, household duties) and the subscales of the SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Because of the lack of homoscedasticity, two different regression models (model A: Realschule and Grammar School. Model B: Hauptschule) were specified. Results: The explained variance of both models (model A: R = .516; model B: R = .643) is satisfactory. In both models "prosocial behavior" (SDQ) turns out to be a significant positive predictor for resilience (model A:beta = 2.815; model B;beta = 3.577) and emotional symptoms (model A:beta = -1.697; model B:beta = -2.596) are significant negative predictors for resilience. In addition, model A presents significant positive influences of sport (beta = 16,314) and significant negative influences of "hyperactivity" (SDQ). In contrast, in model B "club memberships" (beta = 15.775) and" peer relationship problems" (beta = 1.508) are additional positive predictors. Conclusions: The results of the study demonstrate the important role of prosocial behavior and emotional competence in the manifestation of resilience. The effect of extracurricular activities proves to depend on the social environment (type of school). Thus, these results could form the basis for further more specific developmental programs.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as well as the relationships between emotion dysregulation, negative attitudes towards the body, and NSSI, within a sample of college students. We administered self-report measures to 143 diverse college students. Results revealed an NSSI prevalence rate of approximately 27%. Those who identified as a racial/ethnic minority were no more likely to endorse NSSI than those who identified as White/European American. There were no significant differences in emotion dysregulation between participants who endorsed NSSI and those who did not, yet negative bodily attitudes were significantly related to NSSI. Based upon the results, it is argued that negative attitudes towards the body should be considered an important risk factor in NSSI engagement among diverse college students.

AB Resolving conflict situations in assertive way requires emotional regulation. Happy 8-12 and 12-16 Happy programs are an innovation in the field of emotional education, since they are educational video games that train the process of emotional regulation for the assertive conflict resolution, both children and teens. Both games have been implemented and evaluated in primary education (Happy 8-12) and compulsory secondary education (12-16 Happy). This article shows in detail these programs, as well as its proposed methodology and the main results.

ID NEGATIVE AFFECT; INTELLIGENCE; VALIDATION
AB Evolutive stage of adolescence is conceived as a turning point in vital development. This is a period of constant change at different areas: physical, mental, emotional and social, in which affective and existential reorganization takes place. During adolescence, on the emotional level there are tendencies to apathy, negative moods and emotional instability. For this reason, socio-emotional support in adolescence is especially important. The aim of the present research is to study the emotional characteristics of 46 adolescents (28 females, 60.87%) on 3rd grade of Secondary School, to design and implement an emotional education program, comparing the results of an experimental group with a control group. The variables evaluated were Emotional Intelligence, Emotional Competences, Empathy, Affects and Emotional Vocabulary. The instruments used were the Spanish modified Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24, Fernandez-Berrocal, Extremera, and Ramos, 2004), Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ, Taksic, Mohoric, and Duran, 2009) Empathy Scale (BES, Jolliffe and Farrington, 2006) and Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences (SPANE, Diener et al., 2010), and also a quantitative and qualitative assessment of adolescents about the program. Results show that our emotional education program has been useful to significantly increase the positive affection of adolescents and their cognitive empathy along with their emotional vocabulary. The remaining emotional variables also increased in the experimental group compared to the control group, but not significantly. In conclusion, it is important to develop emotional education programs with empirical efficacy, in order to increase the psychosocial adjustment and well-being of adolescents.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological disorder that is characterized by attention deficit and concentration difficulties which can occur with hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder usually causes negative effects in the school, family and social environments. With an aim to alleviating these adverse effects, Mindfulness is an intervention based on oriental meditation, introduced in western medicine in the 1970s by Jon Kabat-Zinn, who developed a stress reduction program (MBSR). Since then, Mindfulness has been used in different contexts, including the clinical, as a treatment of different psychiatric pathologies, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing and improving the symptoms of several of them. In the case of ADHD, several studies have applied Mindfulness interventions, obtaining positive results in terms of attention level, emotional regulation, self-control, anxiety and aggressiveness. In this article, in particular, we review 13 studies that apply Mindfulness in children, adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. Despite some methodological limitations, these studies corroborate the effectiveness of Mindfulness as an alternative or a complement to the treatment of this disorder.

AB Is it possible to indicate biological foundations for personality traits? There is no explicit answer to this question, which additionally raises controversies. If we allow ourselves to accept such a perspective, then a new question arises regarding the actual impact of psychotherapeutic effects on a change of reinforced templates of our functioning (understood as personality traits or cognitive schemes).
   In the presented work, the authors made an attempt to find the common denominator for J. Young's theory of early maladaptive schemes and the neurodevelopmental theory by P. Galecki and M. Talarowska.
   Young's theory belongs to the so-called third wave of cognitive and behavioural therapies. It is a long-lasting therapy which combines concepts of the cognitive and behavioural approach, the psychodynamic approach, the humanistic approach, and the interpersonal approach. Its techniques are applied (and turn out to be effective) among others in the treatment of personality disorders. The neurodevelopmental theory of depression integrates the contemporary understanding of the aetiology of depression, and emphasises the role of biological factors and three development stages (the prenatal period, early years, and adolescence).
   Functional and anatomical changes in cooperating regions of the brain, i.e. the amygdala - the hippocampus - the prefrontal cortex (excessive activity of the amygdala in response to negative emotional stimuli associated with difficulties in inhibiting such content by the prefrontal cortex), seem to be a common element determining the shape of maladaptive cognitive schemes and personality traits predisposing to the occurrence of symptoms of depression.
   In our opinion, the answer to the question presented in the introduction is positive and the universality of the neurodevelopmental theory fully justifies it.

AB Despite increasing societal acceptance of sexual-minority individuals, there are still gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) adolescents who experience negative mental health outcomes. Minority stress theory posits that stigma-related stress associated with sexual-minority status drives increased risk among GLB individuals. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that minority stress impacts emotion regulation (ER), identified as a particularly important risk factor for sexual-minority youth (SMY). Current research has identified some aspects of parenting contribute to GLB youth's mental health. We review the literature in these areas, and also integrate research from the broader developmental field on families and emotion socialization in order to identify the need for studies of parenting that go beyond existing data on parental acceptance and supportiveness of youth's sexual orientation. Limitations of the current literature and directions for future research are discussed, with specific focus on implications for interventions with SMY and their families.

AB In this study, we investigated the effects of mindfulness training with 23 pre-service teachers. Subjects were assigned to either a six-week mindfulness training program or a control condition. Postintervention, mindfulness participants reported greater emotional clarity and improved regulation of negative emotions. In particular, the mindfulness group was shielded from an increase in negative emotions compared to the control group. In addition, within-group differences suggested that mindfulness training helps student-teachers control impulsive behavior and respond more flexibly to stressful emotions. These findings add to a growing body of research on the benefits of mindfulness. Pre-service teachers, it seems, gain the most benefit in the realm of emotional regulation.

AB The questionnaire study examined the contribution of gender, age and reinforcement sensitivity to the common structure of child personality and problem behaviors in two samples, parent reports of 2-18-year-olds (N = 968) and self-reports of 11-18-year-olds (N = 1543), using the Inventory of Child Individual Differences - Short version (ICID-S) to measure personality, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess emotional and behavioral problems, and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). A joint factor analysis of the ICID-S and SDQ scales suggested a four-factor structure, including Organization, Positive, Behavior Problems, and Internalizing. This four-factor model was remarkably similar to previously reported models of personality and psychopathology. Congruence coefficients indicated that factors based on parent reports and adolescent self-reports were highly similar at all levels of the hierarchy. Gender, age, sensitivity to punishment, and sensitivity to reward generally made independent contributions to personality-psychopathology factors. Sensitivity to reward made a substantial contribution to Externalizing (conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention), whereas sensitivity to punishment contributed to Internalizing (shyness, fears and emotional symptoms). The link between sensitivity to punishment and Internalizing in older adolescents was stronger than in younger. The protective effect of punishment sensitivity on Externalizing was found in girls only. These findings demonstrate the role of motivational brain-behavior systems in the development of normal and abnormal patterns of behavior and emotions.

AB Equine-facilitated interventions have shown promise for facilitating emotional and behavioural changes in diverse groups. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of an equine workshop for vulnerable Guatemalan youth using a mixed-method approach. The 37 participants (M-age = 18.22, SD = 2.25, 14 girls) came from difficult circumstances including poverty and other risks. Using a wait-list control group design with random assignment, the effects of a 2-day equine-based workshop were evaluated. Participants completed quantitative measures of leadership, emotion regulation, aggression, and interpersonal response to threat. Mentors completed reports of aggression and prosocial behaviour. Self-reported leadership increased significantly in the group receiving the intervention; mentor reports of aggression revealed significant decreases. Focus groups with participants and family members reported multiple benefits, including improved emotion regulation. Equine-based interventions may provide at-risk Guatemalan youth with tools of leadership, reduced violence and aggression, and better emotion regulation.

AB Growing evidence points to the success of mindfulness for supporting the well-being of older children in schools; less is known about the effects with younger schoolchildren. This study sought to test the feasibility and acceptability of a program of mindfulness-based activities with a nonclinical sample of young children within a school setting. In addition, the impact of the program on measures of attention, inhibition, well-being, and mindfulness were assessed. A 4-week program of mindfulness-based activities was delivered within a classroom of 26 children, age 6 to 7 years. The program was feasible to implement and acceptable to the majority of participants. Outcomes assessed at four time points (baseline, pre-, postintervention, and follow-up) demonstrated mixed effects. Sustained attention significantly increased postintervention and inhibition increased significantly during the baseline and intervention period. There was no change in well-being and mindfulness. Limitations on measurements are considered in light of the findings; appropriate measures of mindfulness and well-being need to be developed for this age group.

AB Although mindfulness, or the self-regulation of attention, has been found beneficial in reducing teacher stress and burnout and in increasing students' cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, no study has explored students' attitudes toward meditation practices in depth. This mixed-methods study reports results from a randomized, controlled trial of a 10-week mindfulness intervention in a public school setting with 28 4th-grade students from lower income and ethnic minority backgrounds. Over the course of the intervention, students were asked to respond to writing and drawing prompts about their feelings and attitudes toward mindfulness. At the end of the intervention, the experimental teacher rated students on how often they had practiced mindfulness breathing during class. Qualitative analysis of journal entries yielded personality traits of students who were receptive or resistant to mindfulness training. Practical strategies for identifying and remediating resistant students and for implementing mindfulness interventions in a school setting are discussed.

AB Background and objectives: In the related literature numerous instruments have been developed to measure children and adolescents' coping with stress. Considering the cultural differences in individuals' choice for coping strategies, along with the limitations of the existing measures of coping for children and adolescents (e.g., being derived from coping measures developed for adults; unrepresentative samples with limited age range, etc.), the current study aimed to construct a self-report coping scale for a non-western population of children and adolescents.
   Design and methods: The study design included both qualitative and quantitative methodology. Three consecutive studies were conducted for the development and validation of the Children and Adolescents' Coping with Stress Scale (CACSS), a self-report measure assessing coping strategies of children and adolescents aged from 9 to 18 in response to self-identified stressors.
   Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in a 61-item CACSS with 10 factors. The scale appears to have a clear factor structure; sufficient temporal stability; and good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity.
   Conclusions: By addressing limitations of existing coping scales, CACSS is believed to contribute to the literature as a developmentally appropriate and multidimensional tool.

AB Purpose - Previous literature demonstrated low-to-moderate rates of agreement between children and mothers regarding child anxiety. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate factors related to differences between mother-child dyads who disagreed vs agreed in their reports of child anxiety symptoms.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 87 children aged 9-12 years old and their mothers completed questionnaires regarding maternal perceptions of child behavior, maternal separation anxiety about the child's individuation, and mother-child relationship characteristics.
   Findings - The results showed that mothers in mother-child dyads who disagreed on child anxiety symptoms, compared to those in dyads who agreed on child anxiety symptoms, perceived their children as showing higher affect intensity and behavioral problems. They also expressed greater anxiety about the children's individuation process, characterized in part by children's increased autonomy and decline of reliance on them. Further, children in dyads who disagreed, compared to those in dyads who agreed, reported lower mother-child attachment security.
   Originality/value - The results extend the literature by identifying specific factors related to the discrepancy between mothers' and children's reports of childhood anxiety in early adolescence. The results highlight the need to consider both mothers' and children's views when assessing childhood anxiety. Importantly, the results also indicate that specific factors investigated in this study, including maternal perception of children's behavioral problems and their affect intensity, maternal anxiety about child individuation, and mother-child attachment security, could be used to inform clinical decisions regarding informant discrepancies.

AB Disordered sleep is strongly linked to future depression, but the reasons for this link are not well understood. This study tested one possibility - that poorer sleep impairs emotion regulation (ER), which over time leads to increased depressive symptoms. Our sample contained individuals with a wide range of depression symptoms (current depression, N = 54, remitted depression, N = 36, and healthy control, N = 53), who were followed clinically over six months and reassessed for changes in depressive symptom levels. As predicted, maladaptive ER mediated both cross-sectional and prospective relationships between poor sleep quality and depression symptoms. In contrast, an alternative mediator, physical activity levels, did not mediate the link between sleep quality and depression symptoms. Maladaptive ER may help explain why sleep difficulties contribute to depression symptoms; implications for interventions are discussed.

AB Rumination is a maladaptive form of emotion regulation associated with psychopathology. Research with adults suggests that rumination covaries with diurnal cortisol rhythms, yet this has not been examined among adolescents. Here, we examine the day-to-day covariation between rumination and cortisol, and explore whether trait rumination is associated with alterations in diurnal cortisol rhythms among adolescent girls. Participants (N = 122) provided saliva samples 3 times per day over 3 days, along with daily reports of stress and rumination, questionnaires assessing trait rumination related to peer stress, and diagnostic interviews assessing depression and anxiety. Greater rumination than usual during the day was associated with lower cortisol awakening responses the following morning, but this effect was not significant after accounting for wake time and an objective measure of adherence to the saliva sampling protocol. Trait rumination was associated with lower average cortisol levels at waking and flatter diurnal slopes, accounting for wake time, protocol compliance, and other factors. These patterns may help to explain why rumination is related to the development of psychopathology.

AB Exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) significantly impacts outcomes for children in behavioral health systems of care (SOCs). The present study built on previous research that found parenting stress influences outcomes for children exposed to PTEs. The sample included 184 young children and their families who were enrolled in an early childhood SOC. Path analyses demonstrated that parenting stress mediated the relationship between the number of PTEs a child experienced and caregiver-reported internalizing/externalizing problem behaviors at baseline. Parenting stress also mediated PTEs and internalizing problem behaviors at 6 months. In response to the culmination of these studies, we discuss ways SOCs can support parents to help alleviate parenting stress.

AB The vast majority of young people have mobile phones. This has become a must-have item in their lives, with traditional socialization spaces displaced by virtual ones. They use their mobile phones for many hours a day, to the detriment of their psychological and social functioning, showing greater vulnerability to abusive or excessive use, and more likely to become problematic or addicted users. This paper aims to study the impact of mobile phone abuse in a sample of college students, assessing the social, personal, and communicational realms and deepening understanding of the different cyberbullying profiles, analyzing who has more personal and social problems using mobiles: victims or aggressors. Whether the number of hours of mobile phone use has an effect on these problems will also be explored. The sample (1,200 students) was selected by multistage cluster sampling among the faculties of the University of Extremadura. Data were obtained through Victimization (CYB-VIC) and Aggression (CYB-AGRES) through the mobile phone scales, and the Questionnaire of Experiences related to Mobile (CERM). The results show that mobile phone abuse generates conflicts in young people of both sexes, although girls have more communication and emotional problems than boys. In addition, age, field of knowledge, victim/aggressor profile, and hours of mobile phone use are crucial variables in the communication and emotional conflicts arising from the misuse of mobile.

AB The Scale of Impulsivity and Emotion Dysregulation (IES-27) in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) became established in research and in practice for adult patients. An adapted version of the instrument can also be applied to juveniles (IES-27-J) as well as their relatives (IES-27-A). The aim of the study was to evaluate these self-assessment and external assessment scales. The psychometric properties of the IES-27-J were verified by means of two independent psychiatric samples (n = 109 and n = 170), while the IES-27-A was verified with a sample of relatives (n = 31). Item analysis revealed good results for both instruments. The Internal consistency was a =.95 for the IES-27-J in both samples and a =.92 for the IES-27-A. The test retest reliability was excellent (p =.97). Based on a principal component analysis, a one-factor structure was concluded for the IES-27-J. Juveniles with BPD achieved significantly higher sum scores than patients with a depressive or conduct disorder, which can be an indication of the discriminative validity of the IES-27-J. The two questionnaires correlate moderately. Both versions can be applied in research and in practice. In the future, standardization should be achieved using data from healthy adolescents.

AB A two-wave longitudinal study of 380 preadolescents (M age = 10.87) from largely middle-class schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, assessed the hypothesis that friendship security, but not friendship intimacy, moderates the stability of anxiety during adolescence. This central but largely overlooked question about peer relations concerns which aspects of friendship account for the effects of friendship on emotional adjustment. Anxiety and friendship quality were measured via self-report questionnaires, employing the Network of Relationships Inventory for security and intimacy items. An index of friendship durability, which combined reciprocity and stability within first-and second-best friendship choices, was derived from sociometric measures. A latent variable path analysis examined with structural equation modeling showed that anxiety was less stable for children who perceived their friendships as secure. The moderating effect of intimacy was statistically nonsignificant. A follow-up analysis showed that the effects of security did not result from friendship durability. These findings provide support for the long-standing but previously unaddressed hypothesis that security, rather than intimacy, accounts for friendship's effect on anxiety reduction during early adolescence.

AB Research has studied family functioning in families of patients suffering from eating disorders (EDs), particularly investigating the associations between mothers' and daughters' psychopathological symptoms, but limited studies have examined whether there are specific maladaptive psychological profiles characterizing the family as a whole when it includes adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). Through the collaboration of a network of public and private consultants, we recruited n=181 adolescents diagnosed for EDs (n=61 with AN, n=60 with BN, and n=60 with BEDs) and their parents. Mothers, fathers, and youths were assessed through a self-report measure evaluating family functioning, and adolescents completed a self-report questionnaire assessing psychopathological symptoms. Results showed specific family functioning and psychopathological profiles based on adolescents' diagnosis. Regression analyses also showed that family functioning characterized by rigidity predicted higher psychopathological symptoms. Our study underlines the importance of involving all members of the family in assessment and intervention programs when adolescent offspring suffer from EDs.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate an innovative, protocol-based, group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered by trained teachers to reduce emotional distress and improve psychological functioning among the war-traumatized Syrian refugee students living in Istanbul.
   Methods: A total of 32 participants, aged between 10 and 15 years (mean = 12.41, SD = 1.68) and mostly females (m/f = 12/20) were randomly selected from a sample of 113 refugee students based on their trauma-related psychopathology as reflected in the Child Post-Traumatic Stress -Reaction Index (CPTS-RI) total score. The treatment program was implemented by the teachers trained by the study team to deliver a weekly, eight-session, protocol-based intervention in school setting. The degree of the fidelity to the original program was tested via video-recordings and subsequent analyses of the sessions. Effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated by a pre-test/post-test comparison using the CPTS-RI, Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Results: All participants were accompanied minors. A significant proportion of them had either witnessed or been personally exposed to traumatic events. Statistically significant reduction in post-intervention evaluation was observed in the SCAS total score (t = 3.73, p = 0.001); CPTS-RI total score (t = 2.72, p = 0.011) and in the intrusive (t = 3.88, p = 0.001) and arousal (t = 2.60, p = 0.015) symptoms of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In line with improvement in emotional problems as revealed in the anxiety and PTSD scales, the SDQ subcategory of the emotional problems was the only symptom area that showed a significant improvement (t = 2.85, p = 0.008). No significant change was seen in the SDQ subcategories of conduct (t = 1.01, p = 0.32), hyperactivity (t = 1.30, p = 0.20), peer problems (t =.66, p = 0.51), or in prosocial behavior (t = 2.15, p = 0.039). A significant proportion of the participants did no longer meet the diagnostic threshold for anxiety (p = 0.001) and PTSD (p = 0.021) after completion of the intervention. However, the post-intervention SDQ subcategories and the total SDQ score showed no significant difference as compared with the pre-intervention group.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interventional study reporting promising results from a school-based, teacher-led and culturally sensitive psychological intervention program for refugee children in Turkey. Such protocol-based interventions need to be examined in controlled designs and larger samples so that a well-established intervention can be created and disseminated to provide the psychosocial support for this vulnerable and traumatized population.

ID ADOLESCENCE
AB Background: Individuals with high EI are less likely to require cognitive efforts for solving EI problems. Conversely, individuals who lack the ability of emotional regulation are more likely to be influenced by environmental factors.
   Objective: This article aimed to study the relationship between the Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Tendency to Addiction and compare EI of male and female students. This is an applied, comparative, and correlational study.
   Method: The statistical population consisted of all male and female students of 2nd grade of high school in the academic year of 2014-2015. A total of 380 students (180 male and 180 female) were enrolled as the sample using multi-stage random sampling. The data were collected using two questionnaires: Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) and Addiction Potential Scale (APS). Result: Descriptive statistics were employed. For the hypothesis testing, MANOVA and Pearson correlation were concurrently used. The results showed that a significant difference was found between male and female students in terms of EI and its components (appraisal and expression of emotion, regulation of emotion, and utilization of emotion).
   Discussion: Female students obtained higher EI scores. Thus, individuals who are not capable of controlling their EI skills are more likely to tend to addiction.
   Conclusion: EI and its components have a significant relationship with a tendency to addiction.

The statistical population is all teenage girls in high school's 2nd grade in Asemanabad town in academic year of 2015-2016. We used random sampling to select 30 of them as research's sample which gathered the highest score from questionnaire. The research tool is Gratz and Roemer's difficulties in emotion regulation scale (DERS).Before interventions, a pre-test had been conducted on both groups. After, training sessions had been conducted for trial group in 8 one hour long periods. Post-test was conducted on both groups after the end of sessions. We used covariance for data analysis. The results confirm the effectiveness of anger management training on difficulty of emotion regulation. Anger is of the most fervent emotions which can impose a lot of damages on mental and physical health.

AB For adolescents with gender dysphoria, it has become common to be offered hormonal treatment to either delay or suppress pubertal development and/or to masculinize or feminize the body. At the same time, it has been our clinical impression that the psychological vulnerability of at least some of these youth has been overlooked. Fifty consecutive referrals of adolescents with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) constituted the sample. Information obtained at intake was coded for the presence or absence of 15 psychosocial and psychological vulnerability factors. The mean number of psychosocial/psychological vulnerability factors coded as present was 5.56 (range, 0-13). Over half of the sample had six or more of the vulnerability factors. The number of factors coded as present was significantly correlated with behavioral and emotional problems on the Youth Self-Report Form and the Child Behavior Checklist, but not with demographic variables or IQ. The findings supported the clinical impression that a large percentage of adolescents referred for gender dysphoria have a substantial co-occurring history of psychosocial and psychological vulnerability, thus supporting a proof of principle for the importance of a comprehensive psychologic/psychiatric assessment that goes beyond an evaluation of gender dysphoria per se.

AB Objectives: The aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of bullying victimization among Korean adolescents by sex and age and to investigate the correlates of this phenomenon.
   Methods: Of 3,200 eligible subjects, 2,936 (91.8%) adolescents were recruited from four elementary schools (6th grade, age range: 10-12 years), five middle schools (8th grade, age range: 13-14 years), and three high schools (10th grade, age range: 15-17 years) located in the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, Republic of Korea. This study used a self-administered questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and experiences of bullying victimization and employed the Korean form of the Children's Depression Inventory to evaluate depressive symptoms.
   Results: Of the total sample of 2,936 students, 1,689 were boys (57.5%) and 1,247 were girls (42.5%). The prevalence of bullying victimization by age group was as follows: 10-12 years, 9.5%; 13-14 years, 8.3%; and 15-17 years, 6.4%. A significant difference in the prevalence of bullying victimization was observed by sex (boys: 45.0%, girls: 55.0%). Overall, the prevalence decreased with age. After adjusting for age and sex, bullying victimization was significantly associated with lower socioeconomic status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.67), lower than average academic achievement (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.25-2.50), more depressive symptoms (OR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.38-2.55), and poorer perceived relationship with parents (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.00-2.14).
   Conclusion: Our findings will provide researchers and public health practitioners with data on the prevalence of bullying victimization and help to identify the risk factors for later behavioral and emotional problems.

AB The current paper reviews extant quantitative and qualitative literature into how Non-Suicidal Self-Injury cessation occurs, and individuals' experiences of stopping. Specific search criteria utilizing a PRISMA format were used across 5 databases, which resulted in 454 papers being identified. After utilizing exclusion criteria and then review, nine of the 454 papers identified were retained for extensive synthesis and critique. Results: Results from 8 of the identified papers indicated that both intra and inter personal factors can influence self-injury cessation. These include: family support, self-esteem, emotional regulation, and professional help. Only 1 paper articulated a cessation process, describing it as a procedural event of developing interpersonal strength, then implementing alternative coping strategies. Limitations and implications of the studies are reported, concluding that further research is warranted to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies to ameliorate this growing public health concern.

AB A substantial majority of homeless youth and young adults (HYA) experience abuse prior to and during homelessness. HYA also have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior. This study investigated relationships between traumatic experiences, PTSD symptoms, substance use, and the protective effects of emotion regulation on outcome variables suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Data were drawn from a sample of 398 HYA interviewed at 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles County. A bivariate logistic regression modeling strategy was employed to examine relationships among demographic characteristics and dependent and independent variables. Trauma prior to homelessness and trauma prior to and after homelessness were positively associated with suicidal ideation, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations. PTSD symptoms were positively associated with suicide attempts, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations. Better emotion regulation is associated with reduced odds of suicidal ideation and attempts in HYA and may protect against effects of traumatic experiences. Interventions targeting emotion regulation skills in HYA to reduce suicidality associated with traumatic experiences merit additional investigation.

AB Because emotional and behavioural problems among young adults are an evolving public health concern, it is critical to identify parenting behaviour in family of origin that prevents or exacerbates such problems. Further, it is particularly important to focus on university students in China, a country with rapid growth in university student population and changing dynamics of parenting. In this study, I proposed and tested the impact of multiple dimensions of parenting behaviour (parental warmth, hostility and overprotection) during childhood and adolescent years on behavioural and emotional problems (anxiety, depression and drinking behaviour) among Chinese university students who were entering university and starting their independent living. Using a sample of 545 university students attending a large university in China, results from logistic and multiple linear regression analyses suggested that: (1) fathers' hostility was associated with university students' report of drinking and anxiety, and (2) mothers' overprotection was associated with anxiety and depression. Lack of findings on the effects of parental warmth may suggest cultural variation in expression of parental warmth. Further, the findings revealed some gender differences in parenting behaviour. Other demographics were also included. Implications for cross-cultural comparisons and parenting and university student health interventions were discussed.

AB Alexithymia and low emotion differentiation restrict access to emotional information and increase propensity toward dysregulated and deviant behaviors, such as impulsive aggression. However, mechanisms underlying such effects are largely unknown. This study examined the mediating role of emotion regulation in the relationship between restricted access to emotional information and impulsive aggression. Alexithymic features and emotion differentiation explained 43% of the variance in impulsive aggression; these relationships were fully mediated by emotion-regulation difficulty. Contrary to previously held assumptions, alexithymic features and emotion differentiation were uncorrelated with one another, each limiting the translation of unique emotion information necessary for adaptive emotion and behavior regulation.

AB Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), developed as outpatient treatment for adult women with self-harm spectrum behaviors (SHSB), has been effective in many adult settings, across various diagnoses. DBT was adapted for adolescents (DBT-A) and showed effectiveness in outpatient and hospital settings. Adolescents enter residential treatment with severe behavioral problems and emotional dysregulation; deficits that DBT-A addresses. A year-long treatment using DBT-A (n = 48, 46% male) in an adolescent residential setting with no exclusionary criteria regarding SHSB or diagnosis was examined using a pre-post design. Clinical functioning data was collected at admission and discharge, using Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR), Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II), and DBT-A skills questionnaire. DBT-A demonstrated excellent clinical utility to reduce number of diagnoses from admission (M = 3.13) to discharge (M = 1.33, d = 1.435), and symptom severity, over and above gender and SHSB, independent of primary diagnosis. Regarding perceived utility of DBT-A modules, adolescents were significantly more likely to report using Distress Tolerance skills (71.7%) than other DBT-A skills and to report that all skills will work if used (67.8%) rather than reporting that a particular skill is ineffective.

AB Previous family studies mainly treated parenting behaviour as corresponding to family socialisation, which is in fact a multifaceted concept. In the present study, two family socialisation constructs, family processes and parenting practices, were simultaneously investigated for their relative effects on the adolescent development of internalising and externalising problems. Data for analysis were collected from a sample of 223 Chinese parent-child dyads (mothers = 179, boys = 124; child mean age = 16.7, SD = 2.16), and hierarchical linear regression models were employed to examine the relationships. Results showed that both positive family processes and effective parenting practices were predictive of less internalising and externalising problems in children, but the former was more pronounced than the latter. More importantly, the robust predictive effects of parenting resumed after inclusion of the interaction term of parenting by family processes, which lends support to the conditionality of parenting with the moderating effect of family processes. This indicates that parenting functions are more important in the home environment with low positive family processes, and shows convergence in the family context of highly positive family processes. Implications of the findings for educational and human development practices and future research directions are also discussed. (C) 2017 Universidad de Pais Vasco.

AB Emotion regulation plays an important role in both healthy and problematic adolescent psychological functioning. Emotion regulation tendencies can be assessed with the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ; Hofmann & Kashdan, 2010), but its validity in Dutch speaking adolescents has not been investigated so far. Two methods, namely traditional confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the recently developed exploratory structural equations modeling (ESEM), were compared to examine the dimensional structure of the ASQ in a Flemish adolescent sample (N = 1,601). Although, as expected, the ESEM-model fit the data better than the CFA-model, the fit indices indicated that both models did not have an acceptable fit. With a shortened version of the ASQ, model fit improved substantially, but only the ESEM solution provided a good fit. The ESEM results support the use of the adapted ASQ to effectively assess the affective styles of concealing, adjusting and tolerating in Dutch-speaking adolescents.

AB Background: Many youth initiate opioid misuse with prescription opioids and transition over time to more severe substance-using behaviors, including injection. Trait mindfulness is a potentially protective factor. Objectives: This is a cross-sectional study characterizing a sample of opioid-using youth by level of mindfulness and examines the potential effect modification of emotion regulation on the relationship between mindfulness and progression to injection opioid use. Methods: A convenience sample of 112 youth (ages 14-24) was recruited during an episode of inpatient detoxification and residential treatment for opioid use disorders. We examined emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), mindfulness (Child Acceptance and Mindfulness Measure), and opioid use. We completed multivariable regressions stratified by degree of emotion regulation looking at relationship of mindfulness on time to injection use from age of first prescription opioid. Results: Youth had difficulties in emotion regulation (m = 104.2; SD = 2.41) and low mindfulness (m = 19.1;SD = 0.59). While we found overall that mindfulness was associated with time to progression to injection opioid use, there was significant effect modification. Among youth with high levels of difficulty in emotion regulation, those with high mindfulness trait had quicker progressions to injection (-1.31years; p =.003). In contrast, youth with normal emotion regulation and high mindfulness trait had a slower progression to injection (1.67years; p =.041). Conclusion/Importance: Our study showed a majority of youth presenting with opioid use disorders have impairments in emotion regulation and deficits in trait mindfulness. The relationship between mindfulness and opioid use is impacted by emotion regulation capacity. More research is needed to understand the various facets of mindfulness and how they interact with emotion regulation in youth.

AB Parental conditional regard is a widely used parenting practice to foster desired child behavior in the domains of academic achievement and emotion regulation. This practice involves parents providing more attention and affection than usual when their children enact desired behaviors or attributes and providing less attention and affection than usual when their children do not. However, since parental conditional regard is negatively associated with psychosocial adjustment (e.g., self-esteem and emotion regulation) as well as academic achievement, it is necessary to develop a diagnostic instrument that enables researchers to assess parental conditional regard. In the present study, we tested a German adaptation of the Parental Conditional Regard Scale (PCR; Roth, Assor, Niemiec, Ryan & Deci, 2009) in two samples of German adolescents (N = 144; N = 293; 10-17 years). Results revealed the expected factor structure, excellent internal consistencies, and acceptable retest reliabilities. The German PCR revealed the expected correlations between parental conditional regard and important validity criteria, such as emotion regulation, self-esteem, and school grades. Tests of measurement invariance indicated no differences between boys and girls.

AB This investigation examined preoccupied attachment states of mind as both a risk factor for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and as a mechanism by which prospectively assessed childhood experiences of abuse and neglect predicted the frequency/severity of NSSI behavior up to age 26years in 164 individuals (83 females) who were followed from birth in the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation. Preoccupied (but not dismissing) states of mind regarding both childhood caregivers and adult romantic partners were correlated with more frequent/severe NSSI. Furthermore, preoccupied states of mind regarding caregivers partially accounted for the association between childhood abuse/neglect and NSSI. This work represents a rare prospective test of a developmental psychopathology framework for understanding NSSI behavior, in which atypical caregiving experiences are carried forward through attachment representations of caregivers that reflect behavioral risk.

AB Adolescents involved in the juvenile justice system are prone to more traumatic events than other adolescents, leaving them in danger of developmental difficulties. Trauma exposure is predictive of poor outcomes including mental and physical health issues as well as criminal activity. Current treatment approaches either have a nominal effect on recidivism rates or increase the likelihood of future criminal offenses. This article explores adolescent brain development, the unique difficulties that juvenile justice youth face, and mindfulness meditation as an adjunctive treatment to system-based treatment. Mindfulness meditation may be a way to redress damage to the brain and facilitate healthy brain development, thus impacting prosocial behavior. Practice implications include integrating mindfulness meditation as an important part of rehabilitative efforts with juvenile justice youth.

AB Objective. The present study examines cognitive and emotional problems in mothers being released from incarceration. Design. Participants were 98 mothers who were about to be released or had just been released from incarceration, and 63 comparison mothers from disadvantaged areas with low socioeconomic status, both with young children. Mothers provided self-report data on parenting behaviors, cognitive distortions, depressive symptoms, and socioeconomic difficulties. Results. Mothers being released from incarceration reported less optimal parenting behaviors (i.e., less involvement and poorer monitoring) and higher levels of cognitive distortions and depressive symptoms than comparison mothers. Cognitive distortions and depressive symptoms were related to less optimal reported parenting behaviors. Conclusions. Cognitive distortions, depressive symptoms, and less optimal reported parenting behaviors may be factors in incarcerated and formerly incarcerated mothers, which might put their children at risk, beyond risks associated with low socioeconomic status.

AB In an attempt to support the emotional development and behavioural choices of young students in grades 7-10, a six session therapeutic group programme was devised culminating in a written manual to enable future replication of the programme. This pilot programme was introduced as a once-weekly, morning session aimed at prioritising a student's need for emotional regulation in an attempt to support academic learning outcomes. Specifically, the group programme provided a five-stage understanding of the cycle of anger, with an additional session allocated for case studies and review. This article seeks to describe the pilot intervention - specifically the therapeutic content - such that it can be replicated elsewhere. Informed by cognitive behavioural therapy, attachment theory and systems theory, the programme sought to respond to the similar needs of multiple students within a time efficient and age-appropriate format.

AB Although studied extensively in the field of adolescent mental health, the role of emotion regulation (ER) in the academic functioning of adolescents is not well understood. This study examined the role of ER in adolescents' perceptions of themselves and their learning environments. We compared adolescents with high and low levels of ER on perceptions of school achievement and attitudes towards school and their perception of their parents' academic involvement. Students completed surveys about perceptions of their learning and parental involvement, as well as their ER abilities. Results indicated that students with higher emotion dysregulation endorsed more negative self-perceptions of their own academic abilities, had more negative attitudes towards school, and rated their mothers and fathers as more controlling in relation to their learning. These results demonstrate the importance of ER in the academic context, particularly in the home learning environment.

AB The present study examined associations among parent and child reports of youth's stressful life events (SLEs), perceived stress, and biological measures of stress activity (i.e. cortisol and cardiovascular activity). Examining these aspects of youth stress presents several challenges. Unlike adult studies of individual differences in which information regarding SLEs, perceptions of events, and biological activity are gathered from one individual, assessment of individual differences among children usually involves other informants (e.g. parent). However, parent and child reports of SLEs and the child's psychological response to such events are often discordant. Moreover, examinations of youth perception of stress are hampered by limitations of child cognitive processes, as well as parents' limited knowledge of their child's perception of stress. In a preliminary effort to unscramble the complex effects of youth SLEs and perceived stress in relation to biological response to acute stressors, this study examined 51 boys and girls aged 7-16, with no history of psychopathology or medical concerns. Contrary to hypotheses, findings revealed that compared to actual experiences of stress, perceived stress has greater associations with both cortisol and cardiovascular activity. That is, perceived stress is more biologically salient relative to actual stress. Results also suggest that informant differences may explain some previous inconsistent findings in studies of youth's stress reactivity. The current findings mirror the adult studies that show appraisal and perception of traumatic and stressful events may be more predictive of negative health and mental health outcomes than the severity of the events. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of youth's perceptions of stress on their biological stress reactions and later health outcomes such as clinical disorders.

AB Family violence has been associated with various negative outcomes among children and adolescents. Yet, less is known about how unique forms of physical family violence contribute to externalizing and internalizing behaviors based on a child's developmental stage. Using data from the Illinois Families Study and administrative Child Protective Services data, we explored the relation between 3 types of physical family violence victimization and externalizing and internalizing behaviors among a sample of 2,402 children and adolescents. After including parent and family level covariates in Poisson regressions, we found that a unique form of family violence victimization was associated with increased externalizing behaviors among children at each age group: exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among children ages 3-5, exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling among children ages 6-12, and child physical abuse among adolescents ages 13-18. No form of physical family violence was significantly associated with internalizing behaviors for children in any age group. Including exposure to the child maltreatment of a sibling is crucial when attempting to contextualize children's responses to family violence and providing comprehensive services in an effort to enhance the well-being of all children in a family.

AB This study aimed to identify and rank the personal, family-related, social, and academic correlates of depressive symptoms in first-year college students. A questionnaire that included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was administered to 389 first-year college students (mean age = 18.9; SD = 3.38; 59.4% female). Eight variables contributed uniquely to the variance of depressive symptoms and were, in decreasing order of importance: (1) the absence of personal goals, (2) a high level of anxiety and (3) of dysfunctional thoughts regarding success, (4) a lack of emotional adjustment to college, (5) being female, (6) receiving little warmth and encouragement of autonomy from one's mother and (7) from one's father, and (8) being attracted to members of the same or both sexes. These results suggest that a multimodal intervention is required to support students' mental health.

Research is needed to understand Karamojong children's challenges, adjustment, and resiliency to help guide interventions and policies to improve their lives. Thus, 18 Karamojong 10-16-year-olds (10 girls; M = 13.33 years; SD = 1.81) were recruited from a nongovernmental organization in Tororo District, Uganda, and interviewed about their life events, coping strategies, social support, and hope. Adolescents also were verbally administered questionnaires about their life events and adjustment problems. Participants reported many negative life events (M = 9.28 of 16). The number of negative life events was positively correlated with internalizing, but not with externalizing, problems. Participants described a variety of coping strategies. Most participants received emotional or instrumental social support, and were hopeful about their futures. Hardships were often alcohol-or poverty-related events, whereas hope was often centered on education.

DE late adolescence; family roles; emotional regulation; marital conflict
ID CHILDHOOD; INVENTORY; SECURITY
AB BACKGROUND
   Parentification means distortion of the roles between family members. A child performs adult tasks and responsibilities for his siblings and/or parents. The aim of the study was to extend the knowledge about parentification and its connections with parental conflict as well as strategies of coping with parental conflict in the group of late adolescents who live with their parents or live on their own.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The empirical evidence consisted of the results of 264 volunteer late adolescents. Two questionnaires were used in the study. The first one was the experimental version of the Polish adaptation of Hooper's Parentification Inventory. It is a scale that enables one to assess the intensity of parentification levels that are judged retrospectively by the subject. The second tool was the experimental version of the Polish adaptation of Davies' and Forman's Security in the Interparental Subsystem Scale - Child Report. The scale examines children's reactions to parental conflict.
   RESULTS
   The obtained results suggest that intensity of parental conflict and strategies of coping with it influence parentification characteristics. The connections seem to be different in two adolescent groups - those who still live with their parents and those who decided to live on their own.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Thus, parental conflict may foster tightening of the family bonds and intensify parentification at the same time. On the other hand, in order to separate and break excessive family ties, adolescents may move out of the family house.

AB Although a large number of studies offer consistent and persuasive evidence that exposure to childhood maltreatment and subsequent juvenile offending behaviours are related, relatively few studies have investigated the mechanisms by which maltreatment might increase risk in young offender populations. The aim of this pilot study was to collate data on the key areas of need from 28 young male offenders in secure care in an Australian jurisdiction, with a specific focus on the inter-relationship between scores on self-report measures of maltreatment, trauma, and mental health. The findings provide preliminary evidence that these key constructs are linked to other proximal risk factors for juvenile offending, such as poor anger regulation and antisocial thinking patterns. They offer a rationale for considering the sequelae of maltreatment in the development of service delivery frameworks for young offenders.

AB Introduction. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders that affect social communication and present stereotyped behaviours. They exhibit a wide range of phenotypic variability related with the capacity to use language for expression, cognitive skills and psychiatric comorbidities, among others. Psychiatric comorbidity is very frequent in ASD and in many cases it is multiple. Emotional dysregulation is related with ASD and with other psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Multiple comorbidity associated with ASD is the group that presents a high degree of functional inability, multiple pharmacology and hospital admissions. Emotional dysregulation could be the basis of the multiple comorbidity that exists in ASD and will require its own particular considerations in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment.
   Aims. To review emotional dysregulation, the currently held concept of it and its relationship with ASD.
   Development. This work offers a review of the different definitions of emotional dysregulation, the associated cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms, the clinical presentation when associated to ASD, its role in psychiatric comorbidity and further considerations regarding psychological and pharmacological interventions.
   Conclusions. Emotional dysregulation could be associated to the multiple comorbidity present in persons with ASD, as well as being related with high rates of morbidity, hospital admissions and use of psychopharmaceuticals. Failure to identify and diagnose emotional dysregulation could be linked with low effectiveness and a large number of side effects in the case of comorbidity associated to ASD.

AB Background Emotion regulation difficulties have been associated with depression and anxiety in typically developing individuals. However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists.
   Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted.
   Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences.
   Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study is to map the coping strategies used by childhood cancer survivors during the treatment and also in their current life and to find a relationship between coping strategies and the rate of depressive symptomatology.
   Sample and setting. The research group consists of 65 adolescent childhood cancer survivors (M= 18,29; SD= 2,71). Coping strategies and depression symptoms were assessed through KIDCOPE and CDI (Children's Depression Inventory).
   Hypotheses. Adolescent childhood cancer survivors use significantly more avoidance coping strategies during the treatment. They use significantly more approach coping strategies in long-term remission. Certain coping strategies (e.g. resignation, social support) contribute to lower rate of depressive symptoms.
   Statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman's correlation through SPSS.
   Results. Resignation (avoidant coping) and social support (approach coping) were the most used coping strategies during the treatment in both girls and boys. The use of coping strategies in current life was more steady. Cognitive restructuring seems to be effective strategy both during the treatment and in long-term remission in both girls and boys. In contrast emotion regulation, blaming others, social withdrawal and social isolation used both during the treatment and in long-term remission are associated with more depressive symptoms but only in boys.
   Study limitations. The main study limitation is retrospective information retrieval using questionnaire form several years after treatment that can cause distortion of information by adolescents.

ID EMOTION REGULATION; STRESS; PSYCHOLOGY
AB Music listening promotes adolescents' well-being and relaxation in daily life. Relaxation is linked to affective self-regulation, but little is known about the specific affective processes of musical relaxation. The current study aimed to elaborate the affective dimension of adolescents' musical relaxation, through detailed exploration of the related affect regulation goals, strategies, and induction mechanisms. A qualitative study with 55 adolescents (42 girls, 13 boys), aged 15, was conducted. Participants listened to self-selected relaxation music for 20min, once in a laboratory and once at home, and provided written descriptions of their experience. A total of 110 episode descriptions were analyzed using summative, directed, content analysis for identifying typical patterns and interactions between the underlying concepts. Three major strategies (processing, distraction, induction) and two mechanisms (musical and mental) were identified. Processing was supported by both mechanisms, while distraction and induction predominantly by the musical mechanism. Change from negative to positive mood was particularly realized through musical distraction, while pure positive emotion induction was equally supported by all strategies and mechanisms. The analysis revealed clear patterns of how affect regulation strategies and induction mechanisms interrelate and serve different outcomes as part of adolescents' relaxation. The findings provide conceptual clarification and theoretical grounds for understanding how affective processes function in musical relaxation. The discussion is performed in light of prior research and broader understanding of music as part of adolescents' affective processing and self-regulation.

AB Self-control and patience are character strengths predictive of positive developmental outcomes, but few interventions targeting their growth have been tested in adolescents. Moreover, interventions based on the limited-strength model of self-control have received considerable criticism, but few studies have tested moderation of interventions by motivational variables fundamental to computational and process models of self-control. To correct this deficiency, we tested the ability of three interventionsusing one's nondominant hand, engaging in cognitive reappraisal exercises, and tracking one's scheduleto increase self-control and patience in 355 high school students (mean=16.0 years; 59% female). The nondominant hand and schedule tracking conditions were found to increase self-control, patience, and well-being only when the perceived difficulty was low. Results suggest that the limited-strength model of self-control is insufficient and underscore the explanatory power of computational and process models that account for difficulty. Implications for constructing character interventions for adolescents are discussed.

AB Social-emotional competence may be a protective factor for academic achievement among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students. This study used Fisher's r to Z transformations to test for group differences in the magnitude of relationships between social-emotional competence and achievement. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to determine the variance in academic achievement explained by student race, poverty, and social-emotional competence, and the schoolwide percentage of students by race. Data are from 335 students across 6 schools. This study suggests that promoting social-emotional competence among AI/AN students could be a strategy for reducing disparities in academic achievement and the consequences of these disparities.

AB This study prospectively measured teasing and emotional adjustment before and after ear reconstruction in younger and older children with microtia. Participants with isolated microtia (n = 28) were divided into two groups by age at surgery, with a younger group aged 3-5 years (n = 13) with a mean age of 4.0 (0.71) years at the time of surgery and an older group aged 6-10 years old (n = 15) with a mean age of 7.87 (1.30) years. Children and their parents were interviewed preoperatively and a year after surgery about teasing and emotions about their ear(s). Teasing began between the ages of 2.4-4.8 years. A third of the younger group and all of the older group reported preoperative teasing. Before surgery, the older group reported higher rates of negative emotions about their ear(s) and teasing was correlated for all ages with feeling sad, worried, and mad about their ear(s). After surgery, teasing and negative emotions significantly decreased with increased happiness about their ear(s). Postoperative teasing was correlated with trying to hide their ear(s). There were significant interactions from before to after surgery based on surgery age for frequency of teasing, sadness, and feeling mad, with the older group showing relatively greater change postoperatively. Teasing and negative emotions about their ear(s) decreased for all ages after surgery, with a potential protective factor seen in younger surgery age.

AB Abusive use of video games is associated with negative health consequences, such as musculoskeletal problems, eye disease, or cognitive and emotional problems. In this sense, several studies have shown that an active lifestyle based on sport practice can generate positive health effects that discontinue the consequences of sedentary digital leisure. This descriptive and cross-sectional research was conducted on a sample of 490 university students. The main objective was to determine the relationship between problematic use of video games and motivational climate in sports, using as main instruments the CERV, CHCV, and PMCSQ-2 questionnaires. The results showed that those students who got a higher score on Task Climate and its categories were the participants who presented less pathological problems. By contrast, students who had potential or severe problems, as well as a medium level of use and attraction to video games, got a higher average in Ego Climate, Uneven Recognition, and Rivalry among Members. It is concluded that university students with achievement goals in sports that are oriented to Ego can show more problems associated with the use of video games, mainly because of its pursuit of extrinsic motivations like the feeling of victory, achievement of better performance in comparison with rivals or the quest for new challenges. Therefore, it is vital to promote a sport practice associated with intrinsic motivations in order to avoid sport abandonment and develop a more hedonistic practice to avert sedentary habits.

AB ` We examined aggression differences among nonoffender, onset-offender, and recidivist migrant youth in China using explicit and implicit measures. From 2011 to 2015, data were collected via face-to-face surveys and the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Male migrant youth (N = 227; 106 nonoffenders, 78 onset-offenders, and 43 recidivists) completed the Chinese version of the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and 125 male migrant youth (68 nonoffenders, 31 onset-offenders, and 26 recidivists) performed two IATs assessing implicit attitudes and implicit self-concepts about aggression. The results showed that the IAT was reliable in an Asian context with offenders, and that the onset-offenders demonstrated greater aggression compared with those in the recidivist and nonoffender groups. Our findings suggest that onset-offenders may have more accurate self-awareness than do recidivists and incarceration may influence attitudes toward aggression in a positive way. Such knowledge is important for interventions that target juvenile delinquency.

AB Background: The measurement of emotional awareness structure and its developmental level represents one of the key areas of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology diagnostics in routine clinical practice or in affective neuroscience research. The Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale for Children (LEAS-C) is a unique psychodiagnostic and research tool that is beyond the capabilities of commonly used methods in this area. Aim: The aim of the study is to report first experience with the Czech translation of this scale in our circumstances, to describe the psychological theory behind this tool and to present the Czech LEAS-C adaptation selected psychometric properties. Material and methods: The LEAS-C was translated into the Czech using the forward-backward translation method. Complete data were obtained from 322 adolescents from primary and secondary schools (age: 14.98 +/- 1.49; 172 boys, 150 girls; no difference in age was found, t = -0.951; p > 0.05). Results: Internal consistency analyses of the LEAS showed satisfactory intra-test homogeneity (Total a = 0.76; Self a = 0.70; Others a = 0.66) and its reliability (test-retest:Total r = 0.73; Self r = 0.73; Others r = 0.59); mean value of answers in all LEAS-C items for three dimensions scored was: (Total 31.9 +/- 6.9; Self 28.4 +/- 6.9; Others 23.9 +/- 7.1). A significant difference was found between both boys and girls and between children from schools and colleges (girls and college students achieved higher LEAS-C scores in all three subscales p < 0.01). No association between age and LEAS-C performance was found (Total r = 0.11; p > 0.05; Self r = 0.07; p > 0.05), with the exception of subscale Others (r = 0.17; p<0.01), where an association was found. Conclusions: The Czech adaptation of the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale for Children LEAS-C show adequate psychometric qualities, which allow for their clinical and scientific use. Implications for clinical and research contexts are discussed.

AB Much attention has been focused recently on the deepening crisis in the education system. Researchers have attributed these problems to the school environment. One method for examining this claim is to compare specific emotional and behavior problems among children who attend schools and children who do not. This study examined three aspects of children's emotional worldemotional and behavioral problems, depression, and attachment securityin a group of children attending school and a group of homeschooled children, matched for socioeconomic background and research procedure. The findings indicated a lower level of depression among the homeschooled children; no difference was found between the groups in attachment security. With respect to emotional and behavioral problems, no difference was found in internalizing problems, but more externalizing problems were found among the school-going than the homeschooled children, in 9-10-year-olds and 11-12-year-olds, but not in 6-8-year-olds.

AB Background: This pilot study examined the utility of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as a standardised screening tool for behavioural and psychosocial problems by fire service-based programmes to identify at-risk young firesetters who are in need of further comprehensive multiagency intervention. Method: SDQ scores were obtained from 57 children and adolescents, aged 6-17years, who were referred to the Fire Awareness and Intervention Programme in New Zealand for firesetting behaviour. Scores from firesetters aged 13-17years were compared to those of typically developing New Zealand secondary school students. Results: Overall, young firesetters were at a high risk of clinically significant conduct and hyperactivity/inattention difficulties, and at low risk of clinically significant emotional problems. Cronbach's alphas for most SDQ subscales were acceptable. Conclusions: We recommend that the SDQ be considered by fire service-operated interventions for use as an additional assessment tool for the young firesetting population.Key Practitioner MessagesDue to its financial and emotional cost, deliberate firesetting by children and adolescents is a significant concern for communities.There appears to be significant comorbidity between firesetting and serious antisocial behaviour, and many young firesetters engage in ongoing general offending behaviour.Intervention for child and adolescent firesetters is predominantly provided by fire servicesand typically involves fire safety education.Given the co-morbid behavioural and psychosocial problems present among young firesetters, there is a need for fire service education programmes to use a standardised assessment tool that screens for wider behavioural and psychosocial difficulties to assist in the identification and referral of high-risk young people to appropriate services for further intervention.The SDQ, a free, short and well-validated measure, could be adopted by fire service-operated education programmes to help detect and inform the referral of young firesetters who need more comprehensive multiagency intervention.

AB Background: Recovery high schools (RHS) vary in organization and operating philosophy, but are designed to support the unique needs of students struggling with substance use disorders (SUD). Previous research on youth risk taking behaviors suggests emotion regulation is a key predictor of outcomes. Specifically, the ability to respond in adaptive rather than maladaptive ways is often associated with challenges of impulsivity, poor distress tolerance, and adolescent substance use. Objectives: The current study considers data from RHS students in order to answer research questions concerning impulsivity and emotion regulation of youth working to change their risk trajectories in comparison to group of typically developing youth. Methods: Participants (n = 114) in the study were composed of students enrolled in 3 RHS programs and a comparison group of similar aged youth (15-20years) without an identified SUD. Data collection occurred through an anonymous online survey set of four measures of reactivity and impulsivity, emotion regulation, and parent and peer influence, as well as an online version of the Stroop Inhibitory Control Task. Results: Participants in the three RHS groups reported decreased emotion regulation abilities, increased impulsivity and increased peer influence when compared to the comparison group; differential effects within RHS are presented. Conclusions/Importance: Results are consistent with the extant literature that difficulty regulating emotions is associated with an increased risk for substance abuse and suggests these difficulties persist in early recovery. Results also suggest the need to better understand how different operating philosophies of programs influence student outcomes and the recovery process.

AB The objective of this case study was to describe the neuropsychological rehabilitation of a 16-year-old patient who presented a Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS) following a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhage. The patient presented severe and diffuse cognitive deficits, massive behavioral disorders, and emotion regulation difficulties. The cognitive rehabilitation was performed in the chronic phase (one year after the onset of the hemorrhage) using a transdisciplinary neurobehavioral approach based on the patient's favorite interest (soccer). A significant behavioral and cognitive improvement was observed. The patient became progressively independent in all activities of daily living and was discharged home. The Functional Independence Measure at discharge was 124/126 (vs. 37/126 at entry). The patient was able to complete his schooling despite the mild cognitive and behavioral sequelae. This first description of the use of neurobehavioral therapy in a case of chronic CCAS suggests that (a) major clinical improvement can occur more than one year after the onset of the CCAS, showing the importance of long-term and intensive neurorehabilitation; and (b) when the cerebellum cannot properly play its regulator role in cognition, neuropsychological intervention through a behavioral and cognitive approach can be of great help by acting as an external modulator to help the patient regain control over himself.

AB Child sexual abuse has the potential to cause distress for the victim across the lifespan. Romantic relationships may be particularly difficult for victims of child sexual abuse. This retrospective study examined differences in adult romantic attachment, sexually compulsive behaviors, and emotion regulation by history of child sexual abuse in a large, nonclinical sample. Those with a history of child sexual abuse reported more attachment anxiety in romantic relationships and engaged in more sexually compulsive behaviors. Overall, males displayed more sexually compulsive behaviors than females regardless of history of sexual abuse. Males with a history of sexual abuse displayed the greatest number of sexually compulsive behaviors. Surprisingly, no differences were observed in emotion regulation or attachment avoidant behaviors by history of child sexual abuse. Future research should seek to replicate current findings and examine emotion regulation difficulties experienced as a result of trauma.

AB Sexual abuse is associated with a host of negative repercussions in adolescence. Yet the possible mechanisms linking sexual abuse and negative outcomes are understudied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among self-blame, shame, coping strategies, posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. The sample included 147 sexually abused adolescent girls between 14 and 18 years of age. A total of 66% of girls reached clinical score for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 53% reached clinical score for depressive symptoms. Close to half (46%) reported suicidal thoughts in the past 3 months. Shame was found to partiallymediate the relationship between self-blame and posttraumatic stress disorder. Shame and depressive symptoms were also found to partiallymediate the relationship between self-blame and suicidal ideation. Results suggest that shame is a crucial target in interventions designed for sexually abused adolescent girls.

AB Previous Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies demonstrate that adolescents' daily emotional states are heavily influenced by their immediate social context. However, despite adolescence being a risk period for exposure to daily stressors, research has yet to examine the influence of peers on adolescents' emotional responses to stressors encountered in their daily life. Adolescents (N = 108) from a low-SES school completed ESM reports of their social context, minor stressors and emotions, 5 times a day for 7 days. Based on previous findings that the peer context is experienced as positive and rewarding, we expected being with peers would be associated with lower post-stress negative emotions and higher happiness, compared to being with family or alone. As expected, being with peers after a stressor was associated with lower sadness, worry and jealousy compared to being alone, and lower sadness compared to being with family. Gender differences emerged for the influence of peers on sadness, worry, jealousy and happiness. These findings highlight the salient influence of peers on adolescents' emotional reactivity to stressors as they occur in their natural environment. Findings are discussed in reference to peers as important emotion socialization agents during adolescence and in terms of theories of coping and emotion regulation.

AB Attachment theory and previous research on emotion regulation (ER) suggest that ER will be associated with adult attachment orientation, with the expectation of different associations of attachment avoidance, anxiety, and security with specific ER patterns. In addition, research has shown that the emotion under consideration and the context may matter to patterns of ER and associations between attachment and ER. In the present study, we examined associations between attachment representations, and emotion specific (sadness, worry, and anger) ER among late adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 23 years (M = 19.6, SD = 1.58). In addition, to consider context, participants were randomly assigned to report ER following insecurity priming or no priming. Participants were 383 (181 male, 202 female) students who completed a self-report questionnaire. As expected, multivariate regression results examining all attachment orientations simultaneously showed that attachment anxiety was associated with greater dysregulation (sadness, worry, and anger), but also more anger suppression. In contrast, attachment avoidance was associated with greater suppression (sadness and worry), but also more anger dysregulation. Attachment security was associated with less dysregulation (sadness, worry, and anger), and less sadness and worry suppression. Finally, sadness and anger dysregulation were higher when reported after insecurity priming compared to the standard no prime condition, but few associations between attachment orientations and ER were moderated by condition. The results suggest that individuals' attachment representations are associated with ER, with security a benefit to adaptive ER, and anxiety and avoidance playing different roles in maladaptive ER for different emotions.

AB Attachment theorists have described the parent-child attachment relationship as a foundation for the emergence and development of children's capacity for emotion regulation and coping with stress. The purpose of this review was to summarize the existing research addressing this issue. We identified 23 studies that employed validated assessments of attachment, which were not based on self-report questionnaires, and separated the summary into findings for toddlers/preschool, children, and adolescents. Although most associations were weak and only a minority of the multiple possible associations tested was supported in each study, all studies (but one) reported at least one significant association between attachment and emotion regulation or coping. The evidence pointed to the regulatory and coping problems of toddlers showing signs of ambivalent attachment or the benefits of secure (relative to insecure) attachment for toddlers, children, and adolescents. Toddlers who showed signs of avoidant attachment relied more on self-related regulation (or less social-oriented regulation and coping), but it was not clear whether these responses were maladaptive. There was little information available regarding associations of ambivalent attachment with school-age children's or adolescents' emotion regulation. There were also few studies that assessed disorganized attachment.

AB The neuropeptide S (NPS) system contributes to the pathogenesis of anxiety. The more active T allele of the functional rs324981 variant in the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1) is associated with panic disorder (PD) and distorted cortico-limbic activity during emotion processing in healthy adults and PD patients. This study investigated the influence of NPSR1 genotype on fronto-limbic effective connectivity within the developing brain. Sixty healthy subjects (8-21 years) were examined using an emotional go-nogo task and fMRI. Fronto-limbic connectivity was determined using Dynamic Causal Modeling. In A allele carriers, connectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the right amygdalawas higher in older (>= 14 years) than that in younger (<14 years) probands, whereas TT homozygotes >= 14 years showed a reduction of fronto-limbic connectivity between the MFG and both the amygdala and the insula. Fronto-limbic connectivity varied between NPSR1 genotypes in the developing brain suggesting a risk-increasing effect of the NPSR1T allele for anxiety-related traits via impaired top-down-control of limbic structures emerging during adolescence. Provided robust replication in longitudinal studies, these findings may constitute valuable biomarkers for early targeted prevention of anxiety disorders.

AB This study evaluated stressors and coping strategies in 70 children who are deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) or with auditory processing disorder (APD) attending Grades 5 and 6 of a school for deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Everyday general stressors and more hearing-specific stressors were examined in a hearing-specific modified stress and coping questionnaire. Reports were compared with normative data for hearing children. Regarding everyday general stressors, stress levels for children who are D/HH or with APD did not differ from those of hearing children. Within children with hearing problems, everyday stressors were experienced as more stressful than hearing-specific stressors. For coping strategies, differences between children with hearing problems (D/HH, APD) and hearing children were shown (i. e., problem solving, anger-related emotion regulation). Girls scored higher in seeking social support whereas boys reported higher amounts of media use as a way of coping. Differences regarding stress and coping between children who are D/HH and children with APD were minor; D/HH children reported more social support seeking. Implications for assessment and resource promotion are discussed.

AB The Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically validated therapy for childhood problems. The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may improve outcomes of PCIT in the treatment with parents who have experiential avoidance as an obstacle for applying behavioral techniques and correct contingencies. In this paper the application of PCIT combined with ACT in the case of a 4-year Oppositional Defiant Disorder is described. It was used an AB single case design with repeated measures in follow-up. The intervention lasts 3 months with a total of 11sessions, and follow-up at 8 and 14 months. The intervention with PCIT was effective, disappearing the child's problems and supporting the therapeutic success in long term. But also, adding the ACT components with parents helped that they accepted their emotional problems for applying contingencies, they designed their objectives, and acted according to their values with their son, following properly the treatment guidelines.

AB Objectives. In the face of social maladjustment among adolescents experiencing difficulties in Kinshasa, the coping strategies deployed need to be considered for the effectiveness of interventions in this population. The main objective was to explore the coping strategies adopted by these adolescents according to their psychosocial problems. The secondary objective was to determine the factors associated with the adoption of these coping strategies.
   Method. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Health Zone of Masina II in Kinshasa between May and October 2010. Sixty-six adolescents experiencing difficulties (27 male, 39 female) aged 17.53 +/- 2.33 years having no psychiatric disorders participated in a semi-structured two-phase evaluation. The following measures were used: temperament according to Eysenck, parenting style according to Baumrind, maternal attachment by way of an adult attachment interview adapted for adolescents, and coping strategies according to Spirito's Kidcope. Chi(2) tests or Fisher exact tests were used with P <0.05.
   Results. Emotional resolution was the most commonly exploited coping strategy (56.7%). Coping strategies were associated with each of the psychosocial problems (X-2 = 152.44, df = 45, P <0.0001): distraction was associated with addiction (P = 0.0009), social withdrawal with witchcraft (P = 0.0136), blaming others with antisocial behavior (P = 0.0059), and self-criticism (P = 0.0297) and emotional regulation (P = 0.0130), with early pregnancy and motherhood, social support for street children (P = 0.0024) and resignation towards abuse (P = 0.0019). The adoption of these coping strategies varied according to gender (P < 0.0001), temperament (P = 0.0010), parenting style (P = 0.0119), maternal attachment (P = 0.0265) and assignment of roles (P =0.0107).
   Discussion. By this emotional resolution, which may be inherent in the transition from childhood to adolescence, these adolescents experiencing difficulties were trying to reduce tension rather than solving their psychosocial problems. The specificity of the different dysfunctional coping strategies according to the psychosocial problems was related to certain individual and environmental factors. Coping strategies for psychosocial problems are modes of flight or distancing from internal tension, indicating the potential presence of unmet needs. This could foster a sense of lack of competence underpinning the social maladjustment and psychological distress that deserves to be elucidated.
   Conclusion. Support for adolescents experiencing difficulties should focus on strengthening socialization functions and adaptive resources, both individual and family, through parental guidance and interpersonal psychotherapy adapted to each situation and oriented towards processes of resilience.

AB This exploratory study compared juveniles who sexually offend to nonoffending juveniles in their capacities to behaviorally and neurologically regulate, or reappraise, negative emotions. Participants were 39 juvenile males, including 10 healthy, nonoffending control subjects and 29 juveniles who sexually offend, comprising 12 juveniles who sexually offend with history of child sexual abuse. Participants completed a clinical assessment and a reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale results showed significantly less difficulties in emotion regulation among controls compared to juveniles who sexually offend, but when self-rating reappraisal abilities during the functional magnetic resonance imaging, all groups obtained comparable results. The imaging results showed no significant differences in fronto-temporal regions between controls and juveniles who sexually offend. Differences were found in other regions indicated in cognitive control, working memory, and emotional processing between controls and juveniles who sexually offend as well as between juveniles who sexually offend and those without history of child sexual abuse. Findings suggest that juveniles who sexually offend are capable of emotion regulation.

AB Using a cohort of 310 low-income male adolescents living in an urban community and followed prospectively from 18 months through adolescence (ages 15-18 years), the current study examined whether individual, family, and community risk factors from ages 18 to 42 months were associated with adolescents' violent behavior, as indexed by juvenile petitions. Results of multivariate analyses indicated that although family income was the only factor to discriminate those with no arrest record from those with nonviolent arrests, rejecting parenting, child oppositional behavior, emotion regulation, and minority status during the toddler period contributed unique variance in distinguishing male adolescents arrested for violent behavior compared to those never arrested and those arrested for nonviolent behavior. Implications for prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Research on attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence has typically relied on either unidimensional measures of attachment security (vs. insecurity) or on differentiated measures of attachment anxiety and avoidance. This study addressed the question whether there is a need to add an explicit measure of security when operationalizing parent-child attachment in terms of anxiety and avoidance. Both dimensional (i.e., regression analyses) and person-centered analyses (i.e., cluster analysis) are used in this study (N = 276, 53% boys, mean age = 10.66) to examine the incremental value of a scale for attachment security (in this study, the Security Scale) in addition to a scale for attachment anxiety and avoidance (in this study, the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised-Child version; ECR-RC). The present results suggest that an assessment of anxious and avoidant attachment (using the ECR-RC) may suffice to capture the quality of parent-child attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence.

AB Unintended pregnancy is prevalent in the United States and has been linked to challenges for both mothers and their children over time. However, studies have not yet identified mechanisms through which pregnancy intention is associated with children's outcomes. Identification of mechanisms among families at risk for negative outcomes will inform early clinical intervention. This current study examined the association between mothers' pregnancy plans reported during pregnancy and children's externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and social-emotional competence outcomes at 3years old among an at-risk sample of 682 first-time mothers from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study. Further, this study identified mechanisms in the association that can be targeted in clinical intervention. Mediation analyses revealed that mothers' parenting stress when children were 24months old served as a mechanism in the association between unplanned pregnancy and children's low social-emotional competence at 36months. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed. Specifically, early intervention with mothers experiencing unplanned pregnancies may help to promote healthy outcomes among their children over time. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To conduct international comparisons of parent-adolescent cross-informant agreement in clinical samples, we analyzed ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) for 6,762 clinically referred adolescents ages 11-18 from 7 societies (M=14.5years, SD=2.0years; 51% boys). Using CBCL and YSR data, we asked the following questions: (a) Do parents report more problems for their adolescent children than the adolescents report about themselves? (b) How do cross-informant correlations (rs) for scale scores differ by problem type and by society? (c) How well do parents and adolescents, on average, agree regarding which problems they rate as low, medium, or high? (d) How does within-dyad item agreement vary within and between societies? (e) How do societies vary in dichotomous cross-informant agreement with respect to the deviance status of the adolescents? CBCL and YSR scores were quite similar, with small and inconsistent informant effects across societies. Cross-informant rs averaged .47 across scales and societies. On average, parents and adolescents agreed well regarding which problem items received low, medium, or high ratings (M r=.87). Mean within-dyad item agreement was moderate across all societies, but dyadic agreement varied widely within every society. In most societies, adolescent noncorroboration of parent-reported deviance was more common than parental noncorroboration of adolescent-reported deviance. Overall, somewhat better parent-adolescent agreement and more consistency in agreement patterns across diverse societies were found in these seven clinical samples than in population samples studied using the same methods.

AB This study considered the emotional consequences of weight stigmatization in early adolescence by examining the effects of weight-based peer discrimination across middle school. Sampled across 26 urban middle schools, 5,128 youth (52% girls) with complete body mass index data at sixth or 7th grade were included: 30% Latino, 21% White, 14% East/Southeast Asian, 14% Multiethnic, 12% African American/Black, and 9% from other specific ethnic groups. About one third of the sample reported at least one weight-discrimination incident at 7th grade. Controlling for sixth-grade adjustment, perceptions of weight-based peer discrimination at 7th grade were stronger predictors of body dissatisfaction, social anxiety, and loneliness (and somatic symptoms for girls but not boys) at 8th-grade than 7th-grade body mass index. Moreover, heavier body stature during the 1st year in middle school was associated with increased body dissatisfaction by the end of middle school in part due to weight-related disrespectful, exclusionary, and demeaning treatment by peers. Weight-based peer discrimination helps us understand one of the stigmatizing mechanisms underlying the relation between heavy body stature and the progression of emotional problems in early adolescence.

AB Background: Noncompletion of preoperative bariatric programs is a significant problem among adolescents. Adult studies suggest that psychological factors contribute to noncompletion of preoperative bariatric programs.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between adolescent psychological functioning and completion of the preoperative phase of a bariatric program.
   Setting: The study was conducted at a tertiary care children's hospital affiliated with a university medical center.
   Methods: Seventy-four adolescents and their parents completed an assessment measure of psychological functioning with the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. We compared these scores between adolescents who completed the preoperative phase of the bariatric program and proceeded to surgery (completers) to those who did not (noncompleters) using multivariate analysis of covariance and logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics and baseline body mass index.
   Results: The mean age was 16.0 (1.1) years, most were female (79.8%), and the group was diverse (48.6%, Caucasian; 33.8%, black; 17.6%, other, including Hispanic, Asian, and biracial). Average body mass index was 50.5 (7.6) kg/m(2). Forty-two percent of participants were noncompleters. Noncompleters were reported by parents to have more clinically significant externalizing and internalizing behaviors and fewer adaptive behaviors. Noncompleters self-reported more clinically significant internalizing symptoms, emotional problems, and poor personal adjustment.
   Conclusion: Adolescents who did not complete the preoperative phase of a bariatric surgery program had more clinically significant psychological symptoms across multiple domains compared with those who successfully proceeded to bariatric surgery. Early identification and treatment of psychological symptoms may be important in helping adolescents successfully proceed to surgery. (C) 2017 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

AB Background:Contrary to DSM-5 definition based on recurrence of low grade hypomanic and depressive symptoms, cyclothymia is better defined in a neurodevelopmental perspective as an exaggeration of cyclothymic temperament. Emotional dysregulation with extreme mood instability and reactivity is the core features of the complex symptomatology.
   Method: In the present article, we critically reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of cyclothymia, focusing on the temperamental and neurodevelopmental perspectives.
   Results: Current epidemiological and clinical research showed the high prevalence and the validity of cyclothymia as a distinct form of bipolarity, frequently associated with multiple comorbidities with anxiety, impulse control, substance use, and so called "personality" disorders. Many patients receive correct diagnosis and treatments after many years of illness, when the superposition of complications reduces the possibility of complete remission. A therapeutic model combining the focus on symptomatic presentations with a temperamental perspective seems to represent an effective approach for cyclothymic patients with complex clinical presentations.
   Conclusion: Cyclothymic mood instability is an understudied issue despite the evidence of its clinical relevance. Unresolved issues concern its diagnostic delimitation and the possible relationships with emotional dysregulation observed in other neurodevelopmental disorders. We need to confirm the specificity of the disorder and to improve its recognition in early phase of the life, especially in youth. Early recognition means avoiding unnecessary complications and establishing specific treatments and clinical management since the beginning.

The current study evaluated the core characteristics of developmental maturity by examining the factor structure of this broad concept. Results of an exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor solution of developmental maturity: independent functioning, decision making, emotion regulation, and general cognitive processing. Overall, psychologists across subspecialties did not differ significantly in their ratings of items across the four factors. Findings contribute to a cross-disciplinary, comprehensive, and operational definition of developmental maturity.

AB Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience poor social-emotional adjustment and interactions with peers, but taking care of a family pet may serve as a buffer. This study utilized 81 parent-adolescent dyads to examine how dimensions of pet ownership (responsibility, comfort, companionship) may be associated with social emotional adjustment (depression, loneliness, friendship quality) among adolescents with ASD, as well as how social impairments may influence these relations. Results revealed that adolescents who took more responsibility for their pet exhibited fewer depressive symptoms. Additionally, parents of more socially impaired adolescents reported better friendship quality than less socially impaired adolescents. Findings suggest taking care of a pet may facilitate better social-emotional adjustment among adolescents with ASD. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The efficacy of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) in patients with borderline symptomatology has mainly been shown in female adolescents. However, male adolescents with borderline symptoms are characterized by more aggressive, disruptive, and antisocial behavior. Therefore, the efficacy of the DBT-A has to be investigated in male adolescents. The DBT-A manual was adopted for male adolescents in an inpatient setting. The program has been investigated using a pre-post design in seven male adolescents (on average 14 years of age) with an average of five borderline symptoms according to DSM-IV. Criteria for outcome are symptoms of psychopathology, emotion regulation, aggressive, and self-injurious behavior. After treatment a reduction in aggressive behavior (pre-post effect size d = 1.18) and an improvement in adaptive emotion regulation (d = 0.65) were shown. No improvement could be shown in general symptoms of psychopathology (d = 0.02). The results of these case studies of DBT-A in male adolescents are promising. However, further RCTs with larger sample sizes and a control group will be required.

AB Given the importance of the relationship between executive function (EF) and many aspects of child development including the development of reasoning, emotion regulation, school performance, and wider self-regulation itself research on the development of EF from infancy to the end of adolescence has become one of the scientific priorities of the last decade. Improving our knowledge on the maturative trajectory of EF and the functional weight of different internal and environmental factors, supposed to optimize their efficiency, can only promote a better understanding of EF and its role in the normal development of the child as well as of those at risk of poor outcome either because of neurodevelopmental disorders or psychopathological disorders. This article aims to update the recent literature in this area. It appears that executive function grows very gradually and evolves from a relatively simple and unitary model in young children to a more complex one differentiated, integrated, and tripartite in adolescence.

AB We conducted a study of the clinical presentation and outcome in patients with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aged 15-40 years, and compared this group to an anorexia nervosa (AN) group in a Japanese sample. A retrospective chart review was completed on 245 patients with feeding and eating disorders (FEDs), analyzing prevalence, clinical presentation, psychopathological properties, and outcomes. Using the DSM-5 criteria, 27 (11.0%) out of the 245 patients with a FED met the criteria for ARFID at entry. All patients with ARFID were women. In terms of eating disorder symptoms, all patients with ARFID had restrictive eating related to emotional problems and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. However, none of the ARFID patients reported food avoidance related to sensory characteristics or functional dysphagia. Additionally, none of them exhibited binge eating or purging behaviors, and none of them reported excessive exercise. The ARFID group had a significantly shorter duration of illness, lower rates of admission history, and less severe psychopathology than the AN group. The ARFID group reported significantly better outcome results than the AN group. These results suggest that patients with ARM) in this study were clinically distinct from those with AN and somewhat different from pediatric patients with ARFID in previous studies.

AB Past research supported the importance of parental autonomy support, involvement, and structure for student outcomes. The goal of this study was to test the contribution of these behaviors from mothers and fathers in predicting adolescents' adjustment in school using a multi-informant approach. A sample of 522 adolescents (233 boys, 389 girls), their mothers (n = 535), and fathers (n = 296) participated in the study. Results revealed that parents' self-evaluations explained additional variance in children's school adjustment, over and beyond the contribution of children's evaluation of their parents. Maternal reports on their positive behaviors (autonomy support, involvement, and structure) predicted their child's academic and emotional adjustment while their reported control predicted lower levels of these. Fathers' self-reported positive behaviors predicted academic adjustment while their control predicted lower academic and personal-emotional adjustment. These findings support the importance of multiple assessments of parental behaviors for improving the prediction of adjustment in school.

AB Purpose Transitioning to independence may be problematic for persons with spina bifida (SB). Experiences of young persons with SB may provide insights into this group's needs for support. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate children's and adolescents' experiences of living with SB, their social and emotional adjustment, and their thoughts about becoming independent adults. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with young persons with SB (N=8, age range 10-17 years). Social and emotional problems were assessed using Beck Youth Inventories. The interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Three main themes were found: being a person with SB; everyday living as a person with SB; and preparing for life as an adult with SB. Indications of emotional and social problems were most prominent among participants with milder physical disability. Conclusions The findings indicate that young persons with SB may overestimate their independence. Other potentially problematic areas were lack of motivation, planning and preparedness for becoming independent. Research on transition to independence in this group should consider assistance at an early age in planning and executing strategies for independence. In addition, the potentially difficult situation for young persons with mild SB should be investigated further.
   Implications for rehabilitation
   Children and adolescents with spina bifida might lack the motivation and skills for planning their future and health care programmes should therefore include preparations for life as an adult.
   Clinical assessment of the level of independence should specifically distinguish between the activities they know how to do and what tasks they actually execute independently.Routine follow-ups should include screening for problems with social and emotional adjustment.
   Be aware of a potential condition-severity paradox whereby those with less severe impairment might have an increased risk of developing symptoms of social and emotional problems.

AB Age of onset, callous-unemotional (CU) traits and anger dysregulation have separately been proposed as relevant factors in explaining the heterogeneity of antisocial behaviour (ASB). Taking a dimensional perspective, this study examined the specific contributions and the mutual influences (i.e., interactions) of these three characteristics on specific dimensions of ASB (i.e., criminal behaviours and externalizing symptoms). Assessments were conducted on 536 youths from institutions with the youth psychopathic traits inventory (CU traits), the Massachusetts youth screening instrument-second version (anger dysregulation), the criminology questionnaire (criminal behaviours) and the child behavior checklist (externalizing symptoms), rated by both the youths and their carers. Using Bayes as estimators, the results revealed that the number and frequency of crimes (and, more specifically, damage to property, property offenses and media crimes) were explained by a specific contribution of each factor (age of onset, CU traits and anger dysregulation). Additionally, the interactions between age of onset and CU traits or anger dysregulation were relevant predictors of some types of crimes (i.e., damage to property, property offences and media crimes). Furthermore, when rated by youths, externalizing symptoms were explained by CU traits and anger dysregulation. However, when rated by the carer, anger dysregulation was more important in explaining externalizing symptoms. This study highlights the importance of considering these factors altogether and the value of using a dimensional perspective when examining the structure of ASB in youths. Consequently, future classifications should take into account the mutual account of these characteristics, which were previously studied separately.

AB The current study investigated concurrent and prospective associations between emotion-related constructs and loss of control (LOC) eating in adolescents. Community-based females (N = 588) completed annual self-report assessments of LOC eating, emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and neuroticism from ages 16 to 18 years. Linear regressions and a regression-based multiple mediation model using bootstrapping were computed to examine the relationships among emotion-related constructs and LOC eating frequency. In the concurrent model, age 18 emotional awareness and emotion regulation strategies were associated with age 18 LOC eating, F(6, 416) = 12.11, p < 0.001, accounting for 4.5 % of the variance after controlling for demographics, body mass index, and neuroticism, F change = 10.81, p < 0.001. In the prospective model, age 17 emotional awareness predicted age 18 LOC eating, F(7, 425) = 11.67, p < 0.001, accounting for 1.7 % of unique variance beyond the effects of age 16 LOC eating and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and neuroticism, F change = 4.26, p = 0.015. In the multiple mediation model, age 18 emotion regulation strategies mediated the association between age 17 neuroticism and age 18 LOC eating, indirect effect estimate = 0.003, 95 % confidence interval = 0.001-0.005, after controlling for age 16 LOC eating and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and emotion regulation variables. Results suggest that deficient emotion regulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of LOC eating in adolescence (although effects were small), and may partially explain the well-established prospective relationship between negative emotionality and later LOC eating. Prevention and early intervention programs should seek to improve adaptive coping in at-risk populations.

AB Negative parenting practices are thought to be essential for the development of adolescents' internalizing problems. However, mechanisms linking parental practices to adolescents' internalizing problems remain poorly understood. A potential pathway connecting parental behaviors to internalizing problems could be through adolescent expressive suppression-the tendency to inhibit the observable expression of emotions.This study examined the indirect effects of three individual parenting practices-poor monitoring, inconsistent discipline and use of corporal punishment-on adolescents' internalizing problems through adolescents'regular use of expressive suppression in a sample of 1132 adolescents (10-14 years). Structural Equation Modeling indicated that parenting practices were related both directly and indirectly to adolescents' internalizing problems through their relationship with suppression. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB We used questionnaire data collected at intake from 979 parents and guardians of 6-year-old children to 18-year-old children referred to a private outpatient mental health clinic to build on and extend current views of caregiver strain and its relationship to children's behavioral and emotional problems. First, we offered evidence for the validity of a measure of attachment strain, referring to strains in caregivers' positive feelings towards their child; and second, we assessed whether parent-child interactions might help to account for robust relationships between child problems and caregiver strain identified in prior studies. Findings were consistent with our conceptualization of attachment strain as distinct from but related to dimensions of strain identified in prior research, and as an especially severe, outwardly directed form of subjective strain associated with caring for a child with especially severe problems in behavioral and emotional regulation. Multiple regression analysis showed that child problems and parent-child interactions accounted for 31 to 42 % of the total variance in caregiver strain. Commonality analysis indicated that approximately half of the explained variance in each dimension was "shared." The unique contribution of child problems, however, overshadowed the unique contribution of parent-child interactions in predicting objective and subjective internalized strain whereas the opposite was true for subjective externalized and attachment strain. We suggest that child-problem-focused treatment strategies may be especially helpful in addressing caregivers' objective and subjective internalized strain whereas strategies designed to improve the quality of parent-child interactions may be especially helpful in alleviating caregivers' subjective, outwardly directed experiences of strain.

AB Early alcohol use is associated with multiple negative outcomes later in life, including substance use disorders. Identification of factors related to this very early risk indicator can help inform early prevention efforts. This study prospectively examined the relationship between childhood adversities and early initiation of alcohol use (by age 14) among Puerto Rican youth, the Latino subgroup at highest risk for alcohol use disorders in adulthood. The data come from the Boricua Youth Study, a longitudinal study of Puerto Rican youth in two sites (South Bronx, New York, and the standard metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico). We focus on youth who were ages 10 and older at Wave 1 [M (age at Wave 1) (SE) = 11.64(0.05), N = 1259, 48.85 % females]. Twelve childhood adversities were measured at Wave 1 and include 10 adverse childhood experiences commonly studied and two additional ones (exposure to violence and discrimination) that were deemed relevant for this study's population. Early initiation of alcohol use was determined based on youth report at Waves 1 through 3 (each wave 1 year apart). Cox proportional hazards models showed that, when considered individually, adversities reflecting child maltreatment, parental maladjustment, and sociocultural stressors were related to early initiation of alcohol use. Significant gender interactions were identified for parental emotional problems and exposure to violence, with associations found among girls only. Adversities often co-occurred, and when they were considered jointly, physical and emotional abuse, parental antisocial personality, and exposure to violence had independent associations with early alcohol use, with a stronger influence of exposure to violence in girls compared to boys. The accumulation of adversities, regardless of the specific type of exposure, increased the risk for starting to drink at a young age in a linear way. The associations between childhood adversities and early alcohol use were generally consistent across sociocultural contexts, in spite of differences in the prevalence of exposure to adversity. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting multiple adversities and expanding the notion of adversity to capture the experiences of specific groups more adequately.

AB IMPORTANCE Psychiatric comorbidity complicates clinical care and confounds efforts to elucidate the pathophysiology of commonly occurring symptoms in youths. To our knowledge, few studies have simultaneously assessed the effect of 2 continuously distributed traits on brain-behavior relationships in children with psychopathology.
   OBJECTIVE To determine shared and unique effects of 2 major dimensions of child psychopathology, irritability and anxiety, on neural responses to facial emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study in a large, well-characterized clinical sample at a research clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health. The referred sample included youths ages 8 to 17 years, 93 youths with anxiety, disruptive mood dysregulation, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders and 22 healthy youths.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The child's irritability and anxiety were rated by both parent and child on the Affective Reactivity Index and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, respectively. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural response was measured across the brain during gender labeling of varying intensities of angry, happy, or fearful face emotions. In mixed-effects analyses, the shared and unique effects of irritability and anxiety were tested on amygdala functional connectivity and activation to face emotions.
   RESULTS The mean (SD) age of participants was 13.2 (2.6) years; of the 115 included, 64 were male. Irritability and/or anxiety influenced amygdala connectivity to the prefrontal and temporal cortex. Specifically, irritability and anxiety jointly influenced left amygdala to left medial prefrontal cortex connectivity during face emotion viewing (F-4,F-888 = 9.20; P < .001 for mixed model term). During viewing of intensely angry faces, decreased connectivity was associated with high levels of both anxiety and irritability, whereas increased connectivity was associated with high levels of anxiety but low levels of irritability (Wald chi(2)(1) = 21.3; P < .001 for contrast). Irritability was associated with differences in neural response to face emotions in several areas (F-2,F-888 >= 13.45; all P < .001). This primarily occurred in the ventral visual areas, with a positive association to angry and happy faces relative to fearful faces.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data extend prior work conducted in youths with irritability or anxiety alone and suggest that research may miss important findings if the pathophysiology of irritability and anxiety are studied in isolation. Decreased amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity may mediate emotion dysregulation when very anxious and irritable youth process threat-related faces. Activation in the ventral visual circuitry suggests a mechanism through which signals of social approach (ie, happy and angry expressions) may capture attention in irritable youth.

AB Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pain is associated with specific aspects of academic performance, that is, poorer grades, and with factors critical to an adolescent's academic performance, that is, decreased emotional well-being and attention problems. We hypothesized that the association between pain and school grades is mediated by emotional well-being and attention problems.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we collected data from 2215 pupils, ages 12 to 13 years. Pain (no, occasional, and frequent), emotional well-being, and attention problems were measured with self-rating scales. Dutch, English, and math grades were taken as an index of academic performance.
   Results: Frequent pain in adolescents was associated with poorer grades (Dutch P=0.02 and math P=0.01). Both occasional and frequent pain were associated with reduced emotional well-being (P<0.001) and reduced self-reported attention (P<0.001). However, the association between pain and lower grades disappeared when controlling for emotional well-being and attention.
   Discussion: The present study shows that the association between pain and Dutch adolescents grades is mediated by reduced emotional well-being and attention problems. The association between pain and math grades is mediated by emotional problems. The results suggest that an intervention targeted at pain in adolescents could have a positive effect on their emotional well-being, attention, and school performance.

   COMPETENCE
AB The development of emotion regulation (ER) strategies is a central developmental task in childhood. Especially when children are confronted with problems or stressors, strategies that effectively support the downregulation of negative emotions (e.g., sadness) are important for children's health development. In particular, functional emotion regulation strategies (e.g., active problem-solving, positive reframing) are connected to health and well-being, whereas dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination, withdrawal) are instead connected to emotional and behavioral problems. Despite the fact that many factors are assumed to be involved in the development of ER strategies, the question of which conditions contribute to the acquisition of a repertoire of functional strategies has not been sufficiently investigated to date. Here, the family context, in particular, seems to play a pivotal role in the development of ER. In a tripartite model of familial influence, Morris, Silk, Steinberg, Myers, and Robinson (2007) posit that children learn about ER in three possible ways: (1) observation and modeling, (2) emotion-related parenting practices, and (3) the emotional climate. Although separate pathways of the tripartite model are partially investigated, studies that take variables from more than one pathway into account are rare. Moreover, their moderating and mediating relationships are often neglected. In a study of 98 preschool children at ages 3-6 years (M = 5.20, SD = 0.84, 46.9% female) and one of their parents (M = 37.55, SD = 5.19, 86.7% female), the interplay of selected pathways suggested by the model is supported. In particular, the relation between parents' and children's ER (Pathway 1) and the direct and indirect role of the emotional climate of the family (Pathway 3, defined by positive and negative parenting as well as marital relationship) is investigated. Moreover, the study focuses on the consequences for children's problem behavior. Path analyses show specific effects for each variable of the family climate. In summary, the results indicate a positive relation between parents' and children's (dys-) functional strategies. The relation between parents' and children's functional strategies, however, can be undermined through the presence of a negative emotional climate of the family (e.g., negative parenting, such as punitive parenting behavior), which is in turn connected to a higher score of children's problem behavior. A positive emotional climate of the family (e.g., warm and consistent parenting or positive marital quality), however, neither directly contributes to children's ER or adjustment, nor does it enhance learning ER strategies in the family. Implications for further research and the practical relevance of the results are discussed.

AB Previous research has shown that stressful experiences increase across childhood and adolescence, and has provided evidence for an age-dependent impaired health status. Thereby, the impairment was not restricted to objective health parameters but also for subjective measures, showing an age-related decline in self-reported health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Coping has been found to moderate the stress-strain relationship. In more detail, maladaptive coping was associated with the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Moreover, results regarding gender effects on coping and HrQoL were rather inconsistent. However, there is evidence supporting increased employment of support seeking combined with more frequent application of maladaptive internalizing coping behavior among females. Finally, research has demonstrated decreased HrQoL among girls. The present study was mainly aimed at investigating gender and age effects on coping, self-reported HrQoL, and physical strain. Furthermore, the effects of different coping styles on HrQoL and physical strain were examined. In total, n = 577 German children and adolescents aged from 9 to 16 years were included into this cross-sectional study. Pupils were asked to complete the German Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents in a classroom setting, which measures three coping styles by nine coping strategies. There are two adaptive styles represented by emotion-focused coping (minimization and distraction/recreation) and problem-focused coping (situation control, positive self-instructions, and social support), and a maladaptive coping style consisting of the following strategies: passive avoidance, rumination, resignation, and aggression. In addition, self-reported HrQoL was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-27, and physical strain was measured by three single items. To create different coping styles, types of coping were classified by normative scores as follows: (a) adaptive copers were represented by high adaptive and low maladaptive coping, (b) high-intense copers had high scores in adaptive and maladaptive coping, (c) less-intense copers were characterized by low adaptive and maladaptive coping, and (d) maladaptive copers were represented by low adaptive and high maladaptive coping, respectively. An impaired coping pattern, lower HrQoL, and enhanced physical strain among older age groups and girls was found via twofold multivariate analyses of variances with the between-subject factors gender and grade level. Additionally, explorative analyses of variances yielded higher HrQoL and decreased physical strain among adaptive copers compared with the groups of maladaptive and high-intense copers. Results support that coping and HrQoL should be assessed among children and adolescents to identify risk groups at an early stage. Moreover, application of health-promoting interventions among children tailored to gender and age is suggested. Thus, the development of psychosocial maladjustment could be prevented at an early stage.

AB Mental health symptoms and substance use disorders are clear risk factors for cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence among young people, yet research on cigarette smoking among youths with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders (dual diagnosis) is considerably lacking. We examined smoking history and perspectives regarding smoking, cessation, and mental health and substance use in 97 adolescents and emerging adults (ages 14 to 24) referred to a program for youths with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders in Canada. Results show high rates of cigarette smoking, and modest interest in quitting but little interest in attending formalized programs to assist with cessation. Many participants reported smoking more when mental health was worse; most reported that they frequently smoke cigarettes and use drugs or alcohol concurrently. Current smokers perceived more benefits from cigarette smoking in regulating emotions and ameliorating their mental health symptoms than former smokers. In contrast, perceived detrimental effects of smoking were unrelated to current smoking status. Results suggest a need for integrated treatment that incorporates emotion regulation as part of cessation approaches. Integrating smoking cessation approaches into existing mental health and substance use treatments may be more palatable to adolescents and emerging adults than stand-alone smoking cessation programs.

AB Although the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal has been associated with adaptive outcomes, there is a growing evidence that it may not be adaptive in all contexts. In the present study, adolescents reported their use of habitual reappraisal and their experiences with peer victimisation, a chronic stressor that is associated with reduced well-being in this population. We examined how these variables predicted physiological reactivity (vagal withdrawal and changes in pre-ejection period) during a social stressor (i.e., Trier Social Stress Task). In line with previous research, at high levels of victimisation, habitual reappraisal predicted adaptive physiological reactivity (i.e., greater vagal withdrawal). Conversely, at low levels of victimisation, habitual reappraisal predicted maladaptive physiological reactivity (i.e., blunted vagal withdrawal). These findings were specific to parasympathetic reactivity. They suggest that habitual reappraisal may exert different effects on parasympathetic reactivity depending on the presence of stressors, and highlight the importance of examining the role of contextual factors in determining the adaptiveness of emotion regulation strategies.
