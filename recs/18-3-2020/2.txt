AB This theoretical paper presents a public health approach for promoting self-regulation across development that is based in cross-disciplinary theory and research. The self-regulation promotion model includes three key approaches that are each dependent on the relationship that children and youth have with caregivers: teaching self-regulation skills, building supportive environments, and providing co-regulation. This model extends the science of self-regulation insofar as it: (1) focuses on promoting wellbeing (not only reducing risks) across domains of functioning, (2) addresses self-regulation intervention across childhood and through young adulthood, (3) integrates multiple theories and applies them to intervention in meaningful ways, and (4) identifies specific strategies that can be used in natural developmental contexts and that address the social ecological environment as well as the individual child. We describe seven key principles that support the model including a description of self-regulation processes and implications for promoting self-regulation at each developmental stage. We end with broad implications for intervention, highlighting the relevance of the self-regulation promotion model for practitioners, policy makers, and prevention researchers.

AB Aim" Chronic stress increases disease vulnerability factors including inflammation, a pathological characteristic potentially regulated by the gut microbiota. We checked the association between the gut microbiome and psychosocial stress in children/adolescents and investigated which stress parameter (negative versus positive emotion, self-report versus parental report, events versus emotions, biomarker cortisol versus parasympathetic activity) is the most relevant indicator herein.
   Methods: Gut microbiome sequencing was completed in fecal samples from 93 Belgian 8-16y olds. Stress measures included negative events, negative emotions, emotional problems reported by parents, happiness, hair cortisol and heart rate variability (pnn50 parameter reflecting parasympathetic activity). Alpha diversity, beta diversity and linear discriminant analysis were the unadjusted analyses. Age, sex, socio-economic status, diet, physical activity, sleep and weight status were adjusted for via a redundancy analysis and differential abundance via zero-inflated negative binomial regression.
   Results: High stress as reflected by low pnn50 and more negative events were associated with a lower alpha diversity as indicated by the Simpson index. Happiness and pnn50 showed significant differences between high and low stress groups based on weighted UniFrac distance, and this remained significant after confounder adjustment. Adjusted and unadjusted taxonomic differences were also most pronounced for happiness and pnn50 being associated respectively with 24 OTU (=11.8% of bacterial counts) and 31 OTU (=13.0%). As a general pattern, high stress was associated with lower Firmicutes at the phylum level and higher Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Rhodococcus, Methanobrevibacter and Roseburia but lower Phascolarctobacterium at genus level. Several genera gave conflicting results between different stress measures e.g. Ruminococcaceae UCG014, Tenericutes, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Prevotella 9 and Christensenellaceae R7. Differential results in preadolescents versus adolescents were also evident.
   Conclusion: Even in this young healthy population, stress parameters were cross-sectionally associated with gut microbial composition but this relationship was instrument specific. Positive emotions and parasympathetic activity appeared the strongest parameters and should be integrated in future microbiota projects amongst other stress measures.

AB Although researchers have examined the potential contribution of harsh parenting to child aggression, they have rarely explored how one parent's harsh discipline could interact with warmth by another parent to affect child aggression. We sought to clarify whether the impact of harsh parenting by one parent on child effortful control could be buffered by warmth of the other parent, further reducing the likelihood of child aggression. 867 adolescents were chosen from two public middle schools situated in Jinan, the provincial city in Northern China. Data were gathered with adolescents reporting effortful control, their parents reporting harsh parenting, and their classmates nominating aggressive peers. A moderated mediation model was used to test the mediating and moderating hypotheses. Results indicated that adolescent effortful control partially mediated the relation of harsh fathering to adolescent aggression and completely mediated the relation of harsh mothering to adolescent aggression. Moreover, harsh fathering was only negatively associated with effortful control among adolescents with low maternal warmth and harsh mothering was only negatively associated with effortful control among adolescents with low paternal warmth, thus lowering the risk for aggression. The main conclusion is that harsh parenting by one parent could only indirectly impact on adolescent aggression via the mediator of effortful control only for adolescents with low warmth by the other parent. Our findings add to extant understandings on how different parenting practices by both parents may interact to influence children's aggressive behaviors.

AB Breakthroughs in modern medicine have increased pediatric cancer survival rates throughout the last several decades. Despite enhanced cure rates, a subset of pediatric cancer survivors exhibit life-long psychological side effects. A large body of work has addressed potential mechanisms for secondary symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, impaired emotion regulation and cognitive deficits in adults. Yet, absent from many studies are the ways in which cancer treatment can impact the developing brain. Additionally, it remains less known whether typical neurobiological changes during adolescence and early adulthood may potentially buffer or exacerbate some of the known negative cancer survivorship outcomes. This review highlights genetic, animal, and human neuroimaging research across development. We focus on the neural circuitry associated with aversive learning, which matures throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. We argue that along with other individual differences, the precise timing of oncological treatment insults on such neural circuitry may expose particular vulnerabilities for pediatric cancer patients. We also explore other moderators of treatment outcomes, including genetic polymorphisms and neural mechanisms underlying memory and cognitive control. We discuss how neural maturation extending into young adulthood may also provide a sensitive period for intervention to improve psychological and cognitive outcomes in pediatric cancer survivors.

AB In the United States over one-third of the population, including children and adolescents, are overweight or obese. Despite the prevalence of obesity, few studies have examined how food cravings and the ability to regulate them change throughout development. Here, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining structural brain and behavioral changes associated with regulation of craving across development. In a longitudinal design, individuals ages 6-26 completed two structural scans as well as a behavioral task where they used a cognitive regulatory strategy to decrease the appetitive value of foods. Behaviorally, we found that the ability to regulate craving improved with age. Neurally, improvements in regulatory ability were associated with cortical thinning in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. We also found that models with cortical thickness measurements and age chosen by a lasso-based variable selection method could predict an individual's regulation behavior better than age and other behavioral factors alone. Additionally, when controlling for age, smaller ventral striatal volumes were associated with higher body mass index and predicted greater increases in weight two years later. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for structural brain changes in supporting the ability to resist cravings for appetitive foods across development.

AB Associations between stressful life events (SLEs) and internalizing psychopathology are complex and bidirectional, involving interactions among stressors across development to predict psychopathology (i.e., stress sensitization) and psychopathology predicting greater exposure to SLEs (i.e., stress generation). Although stress sensitization and generation theoretical models inherently focus on within-person effects, most previous research has compared average levels of stress and psychopathology across individuals in a sample (i.e., between-person effects). The present study addressed this gap by investigating stress sensitization and stress generation effects in a multiwave, prospective study of SLEs and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms. Depression, anxiety, and SLE exposure were assessed every 3 months for 2 years (8 waves of data) in a sample of adolescents (n = 382, aged 11 to 15 at baseline). Multilevel modeling revealed within-person stress sensitization effects such that the association between within-person increases in SLEs and depression, but not anxiety, symptoms were stronger among adolescents who experienced higher average levels of SLEs across 2 years. We also observed within-person stress generation effects, such that adolescents reported a greater number of dependent-interpersonal SLEs during time periods after experiencing higher levels of depression at the previous wave than was typical for them. Although no within-person stress generation effects emerged for anxiety. higher overall levels of anxiety predicted greater exposure to dependent-interpersonal SLEs. Our findings extend prior work by demonstrating stress sensitization in predicting depression following normative forms of SLEs and stress generation effects for both depression and anxiety using a multilevel modeling approach. Clinical implications include an individualized approach to interventions.

AB Prior research indicates that visual self-distancing enhances adaptive self-reflection about negative past events (Kross & Ayduk, 2011). However, whether this process is similarly useful when people reflect on anxiety-provoking future negative experiences, and if so, whether a similar set of mechanisms underlie its benefits in this context, is unknown. Here we addressed these questions using a combination of experimental and individual difference methods with adults and adolescents (total N = 2,344). In Studies 1 and 2, spontaneous self-distancing predicted less anxious emotional reactivity among adults and adolescents. This effect was mediated by differences in how vividly participants imagined a future anxiety-provoking event. Study 3 provided causal evidence in an adult sample: Adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective when reflecting on a future stressor led to lower levels of anxiety as well as lower imagery vividness. Consistent with Studies 1 and 2, reductions in imagery vividness mediated the emotion regulatory benefits of self-distancing. A meta-analysis of all three studies further confirmed these findings across samples. Thus, the current studies extend previous research on the benefits of self-distancing to future stressors. In addition, they highlight a novel mechanism for this relation: imagery vividness.

AB This study examined whether adolescents' behavior in a support-seeking context helped to explain associations between increases in mother-adolescent conflict during early adolescence and changes in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. A sample of 194 adolescents aged 12 to 14 (51% female) and their mothers were followed over 1 year. Mother-adolescent pairs participated in a speech task introducing an external social stressor into the parent-child relationship. Using a latent difference score model, adolescents' observed attachment behavior and hostility were compared as potential explanatory processes. Analyses suggest specificity in the spillover process from conflict to adolescent behavior in a nonconflictual parent-child interaction context, with hostility uniquely linking increasing mother-adolescent conflict and externalizing problems, and disruptions in adolescent attachment behavior uniquely explaining the link with internalizing problems.

   RESPONSES
AB Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) have been associated with emotion dysregulation and atypical responses to affective and stressful stimuli. To investigate the psychophysiology involved, we measured changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP; indexing parasympathetic and sympathetic functioning, respectively) in response to stressful- and sadness-eliciting laboratory probes. Our sample included adolescents with a history of depression and STBs (n = 177), adolescents with a history of depression but no history of STBs (n = 47), and healthy controls (n = 175). The outcome of interest was the most severe form of clinician-rated STBs across the subject's lifetime. In partial support of our hypotheses, during the stressful task, adolescents with a history of depression and STBs did not evidence the RSA decrease that was exhibited by controls and displayed greater PEP shortening compared to ever-depressed adolescents with no lifetime STBs. No group differences were found in either RSA or PEP reactivity to the sadness-eliciting stimulus. As expected, severity of STBs was positively correlated with the extent of PEP shortening during the stressful task. The results suggest that adolescents with a history of depression and STBs experience blunted parasympathetic responses to stress along with compensatory efforts. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of STBs among youths and underscore that future studies should examine physiological risk factors for these psychopathological outcomes.

AB The present study reported an exploration of the association between covitality constructs and psychological adjustment-subjective wellbeing, academic achievement, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems-in adolescents. Participants of the study comprised of 547 adolescents, with 51.1% female and 48.9% male, ranging in age from 13 to 19 years (M = 15.57, SD = 1.13). Findings from the study indicated that higher levels of belief-in-others and engaged living were significant predictors of increased subjective wellbeing. Higher levels of belief-in-self, belief-in-others, and engaged living were also found the significant predictors of increased academic achievement. Thereafter, results from the predictive effect of covitality constructs on mental health problems revealed that higher levels of belief-in-self, belief-in-others, and engaged living were significant predictors of decreased internalizing behavior problems, whereas externalizing behavior problems were significantly predicted by belief-in-self and emotional competence in adolescents. What is more, the combined effect of each of the covitality constructs on adolescents' psychological adjustment indicators was greater than the effect of this each positive psychological domain individually. Taken together, these outcomes should contribute to the design of prevention and intervention services in order to promote mental health and wellbeing.

AB There is a large gap in knowledge about the mechanism by which corporal punishment is associated with problem behaviors. The current study addressed this by testing a model involving self-control and school engagement as mediators in a sample of Chinese adolescents. A sample of 505 adolescents completed anonymous questionnaires regarding corporal punishment, self-control, school engagement, and problem behaviors. Structural equation models showed that self-control mediated the association between corporal punishment and school engagement; self-control exerted an indirect effect on problem behaviors via school engagement; furthermore, corporal punishment might impact problem behaviors by the way of self-control and school engagement in sequence, implying the crucial roles of self-control and school engagement as particularly valuable intervention points. The present study contributes to our understanding of key mechanisms underlying the association between corporal punishment and adolescent problem behavior and can be used to guide future intervention development.

AB Maltreatment increases risk for psychopathology in childhood and adulthood, thus identifying mechanisms that influence these associations is necessary for future prevention and intervention. Emotion dysregulation resulting from maltreatment is one potentially powerful mechanism explaining risk for psychopathology. This study tests a conceptual model that distinguishes deprivation and threat as distinct forms of exposure with different pathways to psychopathology. Here we operationalize threat as exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse and deprivation as exposure to neglect. We test the hypothesis that threat and deprivation differentially predict use of avoidant strategies and total regulation. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN study; N = 866), which followed high-risk children from age 4 to 18. At age 6, children and their parents reported on adversity exposure. Case records documented exposure to abuse and neglect. At 18, adolescents reported on regulation strategies and psychopathology. Regression analyses indicated that greater exposure to threat, but not deprivation, predicted greater use of avoidant strategies in adolescence. Moreover, avoidance partially mediated the longitudinal association between exposure to threat in early childhood and symptoms of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence. Results suggest that abuse and neglect differentially predict regulation strategy use and that regulation strategy use predicts psychopathology.

AB While emotional dysregulation is a broad construct, the current paper adopts a narrow approach to facilitate translational neuroscience research on pediatric anxiety. The paper first presents data on an adapted version of the antisaccade task and then integrates these data into a research framework. Data on an adapted version of the antisaccade task were collected in 57 youth, including 35 seeking treatment for an anxiety disorder. Associations were examined between performance on the antisaccade task and (a) age, (b) performance on other cognitive-control tasks (i.e., the stop-signal delay and flanker tasks), and (c) level of anxiety symptoms. Better performance on the antisaccade task occurred in older relative to younger subjects and correlated with better performance on the flanker task. Across the 57 youth, higher levels of anxiety correlated with shorter latency for correct antisaccades. These data can be placed within a three-step framework for translational neuroscience research. In the first step, a narrow index of emotion dysregulation is targeted. In the second step, this narrow index is linked to other correlated indicators of the same underlying narrow latent construct. In the third and final step, associations are examined with clinical outcomes and response to treatment.

AB As early as infancy, caregivers' facial expressions shape children's behaviors, help them regulate their emotions, and encourage or dissuade their interpersonal agency. In childhood and adolescence, proficiencies in producing and decoding facial expressions promote social competence, whereas deficiencies characterize several forms of psychopathology. To date, however, studying facial expressions has been hampered by the labor-intensive, time-consuming nature of human coding. We describe a partial solution: automated facial expression coding (AFEC), which combines computer vision and machine learning to code facial expressions in real time. Although AFEC cannot capture the full complexity of human emotion, it codes positive affect, negative affect, and arousal-core Research Domain Criteria constructs-as accurately as humans, and it characterizes emotion dysregulation with greater specificity than other objective measures such as autonomic responding. We provide an example in which we use AFEC to evaluate emotion dynamics in mother-daughter dyads engaged in conflict. Among other findings, AFEC (a) shows convergent validity with a validated human coding scheme, (b) distinguishes among risk groups, and (c) detects developmental increases in positive dyadic affect correspondence as teen daughters age. Although more research is needed to realize the full potential of AFEC, findings demonstrate its current utility in research on emotion dysregulation.

AB Irritability and anxiety are two common clinical phenotypes that involve high-arousal negative affect states (anger and fear), and that frequently co-occur. Elucidating how these two forms of emotion dysregulation relate to perturbed neurodevelopment may benefit from alternate phenotyping strategies. One such strategy applies a bifactor latent variable approach that can parse shared versus unique mechanisms of these two phenotypes. Here, we aim to replicate and extend this approach and examine associations with neural structure in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth (N = 331; M = 13.57, SD = 2.69 years old; 45.92% male). FreeSurfer was used to extract cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume. The current findings replicated the bifactor model and demonstrate measurement invariance as a function of youth age and sex. There were no associations of youth's factor scores with cortical thickness, surface area, or subcortical volume. However, we found strong convergent and divergent validity between parent-reported irritability and anxiety factors with clinician-rated symptoms and impairment. A general negative affectivity factor was robustly associated with overall functional impairment across symptom domains. Together, these results support the utility of the bifactor model as an alternative phenotyping strategy for irritability and anxiety, which may aid in the development of targeted treatments.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with pervasive social deficits as well as marked emotion dysregulation across the life span. Decreased social motivation accounts in part for social difficulties, but factors moderating its influence are not fully understood. In this paper, we (a) characterize social and emotional functioning among children and adolescents with ASD, (b) explore contributions of social motivation and emotion dysregulation to social skill, and (c) consider biological sex and intellectual functioning as moderators of these associations. In a sample of 2,079 children and adolescents with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection, we document direct effects of social motivation, internalizing symptoms, aggression, attention problems, irritability, and self-injurious behavior on children's social skills. Furthermore, dysregulation in several domains moderated the association between social motivation and social skill, suggesting a blunting effect on social motivation in the context of emotional difficulties. Moreover, when considering only individuals with intellectual skills in the average range or higher, biological sex further moderated these associations. Findings add to our understanding of social-emotional processes in ASD, suggest emotion dysregulation as a target of intervention in the service of social skill improvements, and build on efforts to understand sources of individual difference that contribute to heterogeneity among individuals with ASD.

AB Grounded in self-determination theory's (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2017) organismic perspective, we present a process view of integrative emotion regulation. SDT describes three general types of emotion regulation: integrative emotion regulation, which focuses on emotions as carrying information that is brought to awareness; controlled emotion regulation, which is focused on diminishing emotions through avoidance, suppression, or enforced expression or reappraisal; and amotivated emotion regulation, in which emotions are uncontrolled or dysregulated. We review survey and experimental research contrasting these emotion regulation styles, providing evidence for the benefits of integrative emotion regulation for volitional functioning, personal well-being, and high-quality relationships, and for the costs of controlled emotion regulation and dysregulation. The development of emotion regulation styles is discussed, especially the role of autonomy-supportive parenting in fostering more integrative emotion regulation, and the role of controlling parenting in contributing to controlled or dysregulated emotion processing. Overall, integrative emotion regulation represents a beneficial style of processing emotions, which develops most effectively in a nonjudgmental and autonomy-supportive environment, an issue relevant to both development and psychotherapy.

AB Behavioral Inhibition (BI) is a temperament type that predicts social withdrawal in childhood and anxiety disorders later in life. However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI (N = 23) or non-BI (N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children (N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children (N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.

AB Adverse caregiving, for example, previous institutionalization (PI), is often associated with emotion dysregulation that increases anxiety risk. However, the concept of developmental multifinality predicts heterogeneity in anxiety outcomes. Despite this well-known heterogeneity, more work is needed to identify sources of this heterogeneity and how these sources interact with environmental risk to influence mental health. Here, working memory (WM) was examined during late childhood/adolescence as an intra-individual factor to mitigate the risk for separation anxiety, which is particularly susceptible to caregiving adversities. A modified "object-in-place" task was administered to 110 youths (10-17 years old), with or without a history of PI. The PI youths had elevated separation anxiety scores, which were anticorrelated with morning cortisol levels, yet there were no group differences in WM. PI youths showed significant heterogeneity in separation anxiety symptoms and morning cortisol levels, and WM moderated the link between caregiving and separation anxiety and mediated the association between separation anxiety and morning cortisol in PI youth. Findings suggest that (a) institutional care exerts divergent developmental consequences on separation anxiety versus WM, (b) WM interacts with adversity-related emotion dysregulation, and (c) WM may be a therapeutic target for separation anxiety following early caregiving adversity.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation can take many forms, including increased sensitivity to emotional cues and habitual use of maladaptive cognitive or behavioral regulation strategies. Despite extensive research on emotion regulation and youth adjustment, few studies integrate multiple measures of emotion regulation. The present study evaluated the underlying structure of emotion regulation processes in adolescence using both task- and survey-based measures and determined whether differences in these emotion regulation latent factors mediated the association between peer victimization and internalizing psychopathology. Adolescents aged 16-17 years (n = 287; 55% female; 42% White) recruited in three urban centers in the United States completed baseline and follow-up assessments 4 months apart. Three models of emotion regulation were evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor model fit the data best, including cognitive regulation, behavioral regulation, and emotional reactivity latent factors. Task-based measures did not load onto these latent factors. Difficulties with behavioral regulation mediated the association between peer victimization and depression symptoms, whereas cognitive regulation difficulties mediated the association with anxiety symptoms. Findings point to potential targets for intervention efforts to reduce risk for internalizing problems in adolescents following experiences of peer victimization.

AB Early life stress (ELS) is a risk factor for the development of depression in adolescence; the mediating neurobiological mechanisms, however, are unknown. In this study, we examined in early pubertal youth the associations among ELS, cortisol stress responsivity, and white matter microstructure of the uncinate fasciculus and the fornix, two key frontolimbic tracts; we also tested whether and how these variables predicted depressive symptoms in later puberty. A total of 208 participants (117 females; M age = 11.37 years; M Tanner stage = 2.03) provided data across two or more assessment modalities: ELS; salivary cortisol levels during a psychosocial stress task; diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; and depressive symptoms. In early puberty there were significant associations between higher ELS and decreased cortisol production, and between decreased cortisol production and increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate fasciculus. Further, increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate fasciculus predicted higher depressive symptoms in later puberty, above and beyond earlier symptoms. In post hoc analyses, we found that sex moderated several additional associations. We discuss these findings within a broader conceptual model linking ELS, emotion dysregulation, and depression across the transition through puberty, and contend that brain circuits implicated in the control of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function should be a focus of continued research.

AB Although numerous studies reveal altered respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) among children, adolescents, and adults who exhibit emotion dysregulation, effects of temperamental vulnerability and parental mental health on RSA remain unclear. We evaluated the relationship among emotion regulation, RSA, and RSA reactivity in a pooled sample of 24 vulnerable and 31 resilient adolescents (mean age = 13.69 years; 60% girls), including associations with temperamental vulnerability and parental depressive symptoms. Participants watched a neutral film clip while their resting RSA was recorded, and then completed a reward and frustration task, using an affective Posner paradigm. Temperament and emotion regulation were assessed via self-report and parent report, and parents reported on their own depressive symptoms. Low resting RSA was associated with temperamental negative emotionality, whereas greater RSA reactivity to frustration was associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. No significant relations were found between RSA and parental depressive symptoms. This study elucidates the role of RSA as a biomarker of individual differences in emotion dysregulation and temperamental vulnerability and stresses the importance of considering multiple units of analyses, as well as functional domains, when studying emotional responding and regulation in adolescents.

AB Emotion dysregulation is a risk factor for the development of a variety of psychopathologic outcomes. In children, irritability, or dysregulated negative affect, has been the primary focus, as it predicts later negative outcomes even in very young children. However, dysregulation of positive emotion is increasingly recognized as a contributor to psychopathology. Here we used an exploratory factor analysis and defined four factors of emotion dysregulation: irritability, excitability, sadness, and anhedonia, in the preschool-age psychiatric assessment collected in a sample of 302 children ages 3-5 years enriched for early onset depression. The irritability and excitability factor scores defined in preschoolers predicted later diagnosis of mood and externalizing disorders when controlling for other factor scores, social adversity, maternal history of mood disorders, and externalizing diagnoses at baseline. The preschool excitability factor score predicted emotion lability in late childhood and early adolescence when controlling for other factor scores, social adversity, and maternal history. Both excitability and irritability factor scores in preschoolers predicted global functioning into the teen years and early adolescence, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of positive, as well as negative, affect dysregulation as early as the preschool years in predicting later psychopathology, which deserves both further study and clinical consideration.

AB Though theory suggests that individual differences in neuroticism (a tendency to experience negative emotions) would be associated with altered functioning of the amygdala (which has been linked with emotionality and emotion dysregulation in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), results of functional neuroimaging studies have been contradictory and inconclusive. We aimed to clarify the relationship between neuroticism and three hypothesized neural markers derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging during negative emotion face processing: amygdala activation, amygdala habituation, and amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, each of which plays an important role in the experience and regulation of emotions. We used general linear models to examine the relationship between trait neuroticism and the hypothesized neural markers in a large sample of over 500 young adults. Although neuroticism was not significantly associated with magnitude of amygdala activation or amygdala habituation, it was associated with amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity, which has been implicated in emotion regulation. Results suggest that trait neuroticism may represent a failure in top-down control and regulation of emotional reactions, rather than overactive emotion generation processes, per se. These findings suggest that neuroticism, which has been associated with increased rates of transdiagnostic psychopathology, may represent a failure in the inhibitory neurocircuitry associated with emotion regulation.

AB This study tested whether the association between interparental conflict and adolescent externalizing symptoms was moderated by a polygenic composite indexing low dopamine activity (i.e., 7-repeat allele of DRD4; Val alleles of COMT; 10-repeat variants of DAT1) in a sample of seventh-grade adolescents (Mean age = 13.0 years) and their parents. Using a longitudinal, autoregressive design, observational assessments of interparental conflict at Wave 1 predicted increases in a multi-informant measurement of youth externalizing symptoms 2 years later at Wave 3 only for children who were high on the hypodopaminergic composite. Moderation was expressed in a "for better" or "for worse" form hypothesized by differential susceptibility theory. Thus, children high on the dopaminergic composite experienced more externalizing problems than their peers when faced with more destructive conflicts but also fewer externalizing problems when exposed to more constructive interparental conflicts. Mediated moderation findings indicated that adolescent reports of their emotional insecurity in the interparental relationship partially explained the greater genetic susceptibility experienced by these children. More specifically, the dopamine composite moderated the association between Wave 1 interparental conflict and emotional insecurity 1 year later at Wave 2 in the same "for better" or "for worse" pattern as externalizing symptoms. Adolescent insecurity at Wave 2, in turn, predicted their greater externalizing symptoms 1 year later at Wave 3. Post hoc analyses further revealed that the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene was the primary source of plasticity in the polygenic composite. Results are discussed as to how they advance process-oriented Gene x Environment models of emotion regulation.

AB Exposure to threat increases the risk for internalizing problems in adolescence. Deficits in integrating bodily cues into representations of emotion are thought to contribute to internalizing problems. Given the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating bodily responses and integrating them into representations of emotional states, coordination between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and autonomic nervous system responses may be influenced by past threat exposure with consequences for the emergence of internalizing problems. A sample of 179 Mexican-origin adolescents (88 female) reported on neighborhood and school crime, peer victimization, and discrimination when they were 10-16 years old. At age 17, participants underwent a functional neuroimaging scan during which they viewed pictures of emotional faces while respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses were measured. Adolescents also reported symptoms of internalizing problems. Greater exposure to threats across adolescence was associated with more internalizing problems. Threat exposure was also associated with stronger negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and RSA. Stronger negative ventromedial prefrontal cortex-RSA coupling was associated with fewer internalizing problems. These results suggest the degree of coordinated activity between the brain and parasympathetic nervous system is both enhanced by threat experiences and decreased in adolescents with more internalizing problems.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and complex disorder characterized by instability across many life domains, including interpersonal relations, behavior, and emotions. A core feature and contributor to BPD, emotion dysegulation (ED), consists of deficits in the ability to regulate emotions in a manner that allows the individual to pursue important goals or behave effectively in various contexts. Biosocial developmental models of BPD have emphasized a transaction of environmental conditions (e.g., invalidating environments and adverse childhood experiences) with key genetically linked vulnerabilities (e.g., impulsivity and emotional vulnerability) in the development of ED and BPD. Emerging evidence has begun to highlight the complex, heterotypic pathways to the development of BPD, with key heritable vulnerability factors possibly interacting with aspects of the rearing environment to produce worsening ED and an adolescent trajectory consisting of self-damaging behaviors and eventual BPD. Adults with BPD have shown evidence of a variety of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of ED. As the precursors to the development of ED and BPD have become clearer, prevention and treatment efforts hold great promise for reducing the long-term suffering, functional impairment, and considerable societal costs associated with BPD.

AB The specific strategies that individuals use to regulate their emotions have shown strong associations with various indices of well-being. However, theoretical accounts suggest that strategy use, and the associations between strategy use and well-being, may change across the life span. Attempts have been made to assess whether levels of strategy use, and the association between strategy use and well-being, change across development; however, studies typically do not take into account potential differences in base rates of item endorsement across the life span. Therefore, the current study had two objectives. First, we sought to examine whether relative ER strategy reliance, or the proportional degree to which an individual relies on various ER strategies, varied across three developmental periods: early adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood. Second, we sought to identify whether the associations between relative strategy use and well-being differed significantly across these developmental periods. Results showed that relative reliance on distraction, rumination, relaxation, and suppression differed significantly across age groups. Moreover, results showed that the association between relative use of reappraisal and suppression interacted with age group to predict relationship quality. Relative strategy use and age did not interact significantly to predict anxiety and depressive symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Research linking economic conditions and health often does not consider children's mental health problems, which are the most common and consequential health issues for children and adolescents. We examine the effects of unemployment rates and housing prices on well-validated child and adolescent mental health outcomes and use of special education services for emotional problems in the 2001-2013 National Health Interview Survey. We find that the effects of economic conditions on children's mental health are clinically and economically meaningful; children's mental health outcomes worsen as the economy weakens. The effects of economic conditions on child and adolescent mental health are pervasive, found in almost every subgroup that we examine. The use of special education services for emotional problems also rises when economic conditions worsen. Our analyses of possible mechanisms that link economic conditions to child mental health suggest that parental unemployment cannot fully explain the relationship between economic conditions and child mental health.

AB The present study examines whether mental toughness moderates the relationship between stress and four mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety, burnout, and insomnia). In total, 207 medical students (M-age = 22.04 years, SD = 2.74, 51% male) from Iran took part in this cross-sectional study and completed a series of self-report questionnaires including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Mental Toughness Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey, and the Insomnia Severity Index. The findings show that stress was associated with more frequent health complaints across all outcomes, r =.36 to .72, p <.001, whereas mental toughness was associated with fewer mental health complaints (r = -.39 to - .71, p <.001). Elevated stress was only associated with higher depressive symptoms among students with low mental toughness scores, not among students with high mental toughness scores. Thus, our findings suggest that mental toughness may operate as a stress resilience resource among university students and may constitute a target variable for health interventions aimed at student populations.

AB This study examined whether emotional reactivity was associated with violent juvenile offending in a sample of detained boys (N=198). It was predicted that Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) would reveal a low reactivity group, characterized by symptoms of emotional numbing and callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and a high reactivity group, characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and emotional dysregulation. It was hypothesized that the low reactivity group would have higher rates of violent offending and proactive aggression than the high reactivity group. Contrary to expectations, results indicated that the presence of both emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, but not hyperarousal symptoms alone, were associated with higher rates of violent offending, CU traits, and proactive aggression. Results indicate that the risk of serious aggressive behavior and violent offending may be highest among youth who are easily provoked to respond aggressively (i.e., hyperarousal symptoms) while simultaneously able to maintain emotional detachment (i.e., elevated emotional numbing symptoms and CU traits).

AB Background Retrospective and cross-sectional studies often report associations between childhood gender nonconformity and greater emotional and peer difficulties. This study used the ALSPAC birth cohort to investigate relationships between childhood gender-typed behavior and peer and emotional problems throughout childhood and adolescence. Methods A total of 11,192 participants had at least one measure of parent-rated gender-typed behavior in infancy; 7,049 participants had a measure of child-rated gender-typed behavior at 8.5 years. Separate linear mixed regression models were fitted to assess whether parent-rated and child-rated gender-typed behaviors were associated with emotional and peer problems across childhood and adolescence (6-16 years old). The effect of adding covariates (self-esteem, abuse, bullying, feeling accepted by peers, and feeling different) on these relationships was assessed. Results For boys, more gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with greater subsequent emotional and peer problems in childhood and adolescence. Adjusting for self-esteem, relational bullying victimization, feeling different, or feeling accepted by peers reduced some of these associations. In contrast, for girls, more gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with fewer emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. In girls, self-reported gender-nonconforming behavior was also associated with fewer parent-rated peer problems but parent-rated gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with more parent-rated peer problems; this latter association was partly explained by self-esteem, bullying, and abuse victimization. These associations were statistically significant but small. Conclusions Overall, more female-typical behaviors were generally associated with greater subsequent emotional and peer problems, for both boys and girls. Future studies should investigate factors that reduced these associations, as well as potential negative effects of female-typical behaviors or advantages of male-typical ones. As this was a 14-year longitudinal study, the relationships between gender-role behaviors and emotional/peer problems warrant further research despite the small association sizes.

AB The present study examined associations between effortful control, a trait marker of self-regulation, adaptive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system functioning (as reflected by the cortisol awakening response [CAR]), and concurrent and longitudinal depressive problems, in a sample of preadolescent Latino youth (N = 119, mean age = 11.53 years, 59% girls). We hypothesized that trait readiness for self-regulation (specifically effortful control) could be related to physiological state readiness for self-regulation (as measured using the Cortisol Awakening Response or CAR), and that both may counter depressive problems. We found that youth's CAR was positively associated with effortful control, and negatively with youth depressive problems. Effortful control and youth depressive problems were also negatively associated. Longitudinal relations of CAR and effortful control on depressive problems at T2 were not significant in the structural equation model after controlling for T1 depressive problems, although these variables were significant in the bivariate correlations. Results suggest that both trait regulation and physiological regulation may counter depressive problems in Latino youth.

AB Bullying and victimization are manifest in the peer social world, but have origins in the home. Uncertainty surrounds the mechanisms that convey problems between these settings. The present study describes the indirect transmission of hostility and coercion from parents to adolescent children through emotional dysregulation. In this model, derisive parenting-behaviors that demean or belittle children-fosters dysregulated anger, which precipitates peer difficulties. A total of 1409 participants (48% female; M-age=13.4 years at the outset) were followed across secondary school (Grades 7-9) for three consecutive years. The results indicated that derisive parenting in Grade 7 was associated with increases in adolescent dysregulated anger from Grade 7 to 8, which, in turn, was associated with increases in bullying and victimization from Grade 8 to 9. The findings suggest that parents who are derisive, have children who struggle with emotional regulation and, ultimately, with constructive peer relationships.

AB Objective This is the first pilot study to examine the Australian adaptation of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP), a manualised family intervention recommended internationally in evidence reviews to improve family functioning and child mental health. The study compared two versions (8 vs. 14-session) and longitudinally evaluated outcomes for child emotional and behavioural difficulties, and parental psychological distress. Method Fifty-eight families from disadvantaged primary schools in regional Victoria with children 8-12 years (80.6% of initially enrolled families, 62 parents and 74 children) completed the program and evaluation measures. Measures were repeated at pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up and included the Kessler 6, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and subscales adapted from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children and Communities that Care Youth Survey. Results The program showed significant reductions in child difficulties and parental psychological distress from pre- to post-measurements that were sustained at follow-up. Reductions in parental psychological distress were significantly associated with reductions in child difficulties at follow-up. The 8- and 14-session formats were not found to be significantly different in reducing child difficulties or parental psychological distress. Effect sizes for the Australian version were similar to those reported in previous U.S. trials. Conclusions Findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of an Australian adaptation of the SFP. The current study is unique in identifying similar outcomes for shorter and longer versions of the intervention. It is recommended that the 8-session Australian version is examined in a larger randomised controlled trial where children present with behavioural and emotional problems.

AB The goal of this study was to test the mediating effect of social decision making in the relations of anger and anger control to externalising and internalising problems. A sample of 174 Chinese adolescents (mean age=15.36years) completed self-reports of trait anger, anger control, externalising problems, internalising problems and social decision making, which was operationalized as situational judgement reflecting an individual's ability to interact effectively with parents, teachers and peers. Findings indicated that adolescents' trait anger and anger control were positively related to both externalising and internalising problems. In addition, path analysis revealed that social decision making mediated the relationship between trait anger, anger control and externalising problems. Findings on the mediating effect will be discussed by referencing appraisal tendency theory and response evaluation and decision.

AB ObjectivesInterest in mindfulness practices aimed at children and adolescents in school and clinical contexts has increased. However, little research on the benefits of mindfulness in these age groups has been conducted. In Spanish-speaking countries, this lack of research may be due to the scarcity of reliable and valid instruments for assessing mindfulness in young people. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) in native Spanish-speaking children and adolescents.MethodsTwo thousand one hundred thirteen children and adolescents from Spain (N=490 children; N=629 adolescents) and Chile (N=307 children; N=687 adolescents) were assessed. Factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and measure invariance between countries were examined.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) validated a unidimensional structure (10 items) that fitted the data better than the bidimensional structure both for children and adolescents in both countries. However, the factor loadings of some items were very low in all samples. After eliminating these items, a new, 7-item version of the CAMM proved to be more valid and reliable. The new version correlated negatively with several mental health measures, thereby supporting its construct validity. Also, the measurement invariance test showed that it is comparable between Spain and Chile, which makes transcultural research possible.ConclusionThis study shows that the Spanish version of the CAMM adequately assesses mindfulness in children and adolescents. The CAMM is the first mindfulness evaluation measure for children in Spanish.

AB ObjectivesIncarcerated young men commonly experience problems with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Mindfulness training could help but the evidence is limited. This study developed and piloted an adapted mindfulness-based intervention for this group (n=48).MethodsFeasibility of recruitment, retention, and data collection were assessed, and the effectiveness of mindfulness training measured using validated questionnaires. Twenty-five qualitative interviews were conducted to explore experiences of the course, and barriers and facilitators to taking part.ResultsThe findings indicated that recruitment and retention to mindfulness training groups was a challenge despite trying various adaptive strategies to improve interest, relevance, and acceptability. Quantitative data collection was feasible at baseline and post-course. There were significant improvements following training in impulsivity (effect size [ES] 0.72, 95% CI 0.32-1.11, p=0.001), mental wellbeing (ES 0.50; 95% CI 0.18-0.80; p=0.003), inner resilience (comprehensibility ES 0.35; 95% CI -0.02-0.68; p=0.03), and mindfulness (ES 0.32; 95% CI 0.03-0.60; p=0.03). The majority (70%) of participants reported finding the course uncomfortable or disconcerting at first but if they chose to remain, this changed as they began to experience benefit. The body scan and breathing techniques were reported as being most helpful. Positive experiences included better sleep, less stress, feeling more in control, and improved relationships.ConclusionsDeveloping and delivering mindfulness training for incarcerated young men is feasible and may be beneficial, but recruitment and retention may limit reach. Further studies are required that include a control group.

AB Objective: Bedtime electronic media use and caffeine consumption are risk factors for insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during adolescence, which are in turn risk factors for mental wellbeing. Our study tested the effectiveness of a brief school-based psychoeducative intervention to primarily increase sleep duration, by decreasing bedtime electronic media use and caffeine consumption. Secondary outcomes included improving sleep quality and difficulties, daytime tiredness, and mental wellbeing.
   Method: A pilot cluster-randomised controlled study was conducted involving a 25-min psychoeducative school-based intervention combined with parent information. 352 adolescents from seven schools participated (Intervention Group/IG = 192 students vs. Control Group/CG = 160 students; age: Mean = 15.09 years; SD = 1.65 years; Females = 163). The intervention included information on the importance of sleep and good sleep hygiene habits, particularly emphasizing behavioural rules of avoiding electronic media use at night and evening-time caffeine consumption. A leaflet containing the rules was also sent to parents of IG participants. Baseline and post-intervention sessions were held approximately four weeks apart.
   Results: Multilevel analyses revealed a significant but modest decrease in electronic media use for participants in the IG versus CG, but showed no effect on caffeine consumption or sleep duration. Moreover, the intervention did not impact any secondary outcome.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate the potential effectiveness of a short and easily administrable intervention to decrease electronic media use at night, which may be incorporated into school curricula and standardised for wider use in primary prevention. However, no further benefits of the intervention were found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Major depressive disorder begins to increase in early adolescence and is associated with significant impairment (e.g., suicidality). Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) have been associated with depressive symptoms; however, little research has examined this relation over time beginning in early adolescence. Starting when they were 11-14years old, 246 adolescents (n(boys)=126; n(white)=158) completed self-report questionnaires on their ER at Time 1 and depressive symptoms every year for 2years. Results revealed that overall difficulties in ER (and limited access to ER strategies) at Time 1 predicted depressive symptoms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Gender moderated this relation cross-sectionally, such that higher overall ER difficulties at Time 1 was more strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms for girls than for boys. These findings suggest that depression prevention efforts should promote adaptive ER in early adolescence, particularly for girls, in order to prevent the increases in depressive symptoms seen into middle adolescence.

AB Mental illness is a pressing public health concern, particularly when the onset is during childhood or adolescence. Many youth admitted to hospital-based psychiatric care experience school-related difficulties. The purpose of this report was to explore the associations of academic difficulties, school avoidance and school engagement to total psychological difficulties and emotional problems. Youth completed surveys that included standardized measures of school-related factors and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire while in hospital. Psychiatrists provided the primary diagnosis and diagnosis most responsible for the current admission. In total, 161 patients participated in this study (mean age 15 years, SD 1.4; 75% female). All three school-related variables were significantly associated with emotional problems; however, only school avoidance and academic difficulties were associated with total difficulties. School-related concerns were significantly associated with the severity of mental health symptoms. Patients may benefit from attention to school-related difficulties before discharge from psychiatric care that continues beyond school reintegration.

AB Deficits regulating emotions are a core process underlying both substance use and mental health disorders. Research has focused on identifying one-to-one associations between individual emotion regulation (ER) strategies and mental health symptoms. Consequently, little is known about how patterns of ER relate to a broad range of psychopathology, in treatment seeking young people. Latent class analysis was used to examine patterns of ER strategies and their relationship with symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance use and borderline personality disorder, in a sample of young treatment seekers. Participants were young people (N=306, M=20.8years) accessing youth advocacy and support or mental health services in Australia. Participants recalled an emotionally-arousing event experienced when on their own and indicated their use of 14 possible ER responses in an online questionnaire. Symptoms of mental health and substance use were measured. The LCA identified three distinct classes of ER responses: Ruminators/avoiders (n=76), active regulators (n=81), and low regulators (n=129). The ruminators/avoiders endorsed the most severe symptom picture across all disorders except alcohol use. Within this cohort, distinct patterns of ER responding had unique relationships with symptoms of psychopathology. The deleterious impact of heightened maladaptive ER strategies (rumination and avoidance) in the absence of adaptive strategies was highlighted.

AB The purpose of the study was to analyze the connections between victimization and perpetration of face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying with self-perceived childhood stress and diverse emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) evaluated by parents. Participants were 1,993 students, aged 9-13 years, from the Basque Country (Spain) (49.8% females). The results of the analyses of variance (MANOVA-AN OVA) and correlational analyses showed that: (1) students who had higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had significantly high levels of stress and many EBPs; (2) participants who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization and perpetration of bullying obtained higher scores in all the dimensions of stress, while those who had higher scores in cyberaggression only showed higher school stress; (3) students who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization manifested internalizing and externalizing EBPs, whereas those who had higher scores in perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had fewer internalizing problems; and (4) children who obtained higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had received psychological counseling significantly more frequently in the past year than those who had lower scores in indicators of bullying/cyberbullying. The importance of preventing/intervening in bullying situations to reduce psychopathological problems is emphasized in the discussion.

AB Based on insights from the model of compensatory intemet use and emotion regulation theory, this study aimed to explore two possible mechanisms explaining the reliable association between depressive symptomatology and intemet addiction: procrastination on the internet and flow experiences online. Data were collected from 529 high school students, with a mean age of 15.2 years (SD = 1.30), enrolled in six schools in a metropolitan region of Chile. Voluntary participants completed self-reported measures of internet addiction, depressive symptomatology, procrastination on the interne, and flow experiences online. A three-level hierarchical linear model was calculated to evaluate the potential moderator effect of flow and procrastination on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and internet addiction. Results revealed that procrastination moderated this relationship while flow experiences online did not. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research and clinical practice, highlighting the importance of considering the intentions behind interne usage.

AB This study develops a new version of the problematic Internet use scale suitable for senior elementary school students. It includes six subscales: time management, compulsive Internet use, emotion adjustment influence, interpersonal and academic influence, preferred online social interaction, and daily life influence. This research utilized the survey method to understand the relationship between student backgrounds and their Internet use behaviors, and problematic Internet use. A total of 775 elementary school fifth and sixth graders from northern Taiwan were sampled based on the stratified random sampling method. There were 763 valid surveys. The results indicated that the factors of gender, parents' attitudes towards Internet use, the time when subjects first started to use the Internet, number of hours spent getting online each time on weekdays, number of types of devices used to go online, and Internet activity preferences are significant. Boys have more serious problematic Internet use than girls. Different Internet activities present different risks of triggering problematic Internet use for male and female students. Students whose parents allow them to use the Internet without intervention have more serious problematic Internet use. Students exhibit more serious problematic internet use if they start using the Internet before beginning elementary school. When students use the Internet more and can go online using more types of devices, they tend to have more serious problematic Internet use. This study finds that students preferring Internet activities for recreational entertainment and social interaction have more serious problematic Internet use than students preferring Internet activities as learning tools.

AB Background In primary analyses, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was associated with greater reduction in self-harm during treatment than individual/group supportive therapy (IGST). The objective of this paper was to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents who participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating DBT and IGST. Methods Adolescents (N = 173) were included in the intent-to-treat sample and randomized to receive 6 months of DBT or IGST. Potential baseline predictors and moderators were identified within four categories: demographics, severity markers, parental psychopathology, and psychosocial variables. Primary outcomes were suicide attempts (SA) and nonsuicidal self-injury evaluated at baseline, midtreatment (3 months), and end of treatment (6 months) via the Suicide Attempt and Self-Injury Interview (Psychological Assessment, 18, 2006, 303). For each moderator or predictor, a generalized linear mixed model was conducted to examine main and interactive effects of treatment and the candidate variable on outcomes. Results Adolescents with higher family conflict, more extensive self-harm histories, and more externalizing problems produced on average more reduction on SH frequency from baseline to post-treatment. Adolescents meeting BPD diagnosis were more likely to have high SH frequency at post-treatment. Analyses indicated significant moderation effects for emotion dysregulation on NSSI and SH. DBT was associated with better rates of improvement compared to IGST for adolescents with higher baseline emotion dysregulation and those whose parents reported greater psychopathology and emotion dysregulation. A significant moderation effect for ethnicity on SA over the treatment period was observed, where DBT produced better rate of improvement compared to IGST for Hispanic/Latino individuals. Conclusions These findings may help to inform salient treatment targets and guide treatment planning. Adolescents that have high levels of family conflict, externalizing problems, and increased level of severity markers demonstrated the most change in self-harm behaviors over the course of treatment and benefitted from both treatment interventions. Those with higher levels of emotion dysregulation and parent psychopathology may benefit more from the DBT.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) provides valid and well-established measures of emotional, behavioral, and social problems in children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to verify whether emotional, behavioral, and social problems were modulated by ASD symptom severity, cognitive development, gender, and age by analyzing the CBCL in a large group of children and adolescents with ASD. The results show that around 30% of participants with ASD exhibited internalizing problems and only 6% externalizing problems, with males exhibiting more internalizing problems than females. No correlation was found between CBCL scores and indices of ASD severity. However, higher CBCL Total Problems scores were found in older children and in children with lower cognitive abilities. The detection of behavioral and emotional problems allows children with ASD to undergo specific and individualized treatment that takes into account their psychopathological problems.

AB Communication challenges frequently occur among families and health care providers of children with life-threatening conditions. These obstacles compound concerns related to children's diagnoses and treatment, the family's quality of life, and delivery of care. Developmentally appropriate and validated methods of addressing the communication preferences of families with chronically ill children are limited. This study used six focus groups to determine child and parent preferences and styles of communication centering on new diagnoses and changes in prognosis. Hypothetical situations were used to minimize feelings of self-consciousness among school-aged and adolescent participants. Qualitative analyses (interrater reliability 75%) of child and parent responses revealed 3 categories and 11 subcategories or themes. The category of Characteristics of Communication Exchange included (1) how to tell, (2) who should tell, (3) when to tell, (4) who should be included, and (5) what to tell. The Knowledge and Understanding category included themes of (1) side effects of treatment, (2) what children understand, and (3) questions when being diagnosed. The category of Feelings and Emotions included themes of (1) feelings about changes in prognosis, (2) children's feelings on being informed, and (3) coping and emotional regulation. Results reveal a need for developmentally appropriate, evidence-based education to inform parents on how, what, and when to communicate information concerning their child's disease, as well as instructions around facilitating those discussions. Moreover, a need for professional education and training programs for providers is demonstrated by some parental dissatisfaction with bedside manner and disclosure of information. The data collected from this study lay a foundation for future research in communication as a principal factor in quality of life for pediatric patients and their families.

AB Although there is a robust link between resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a biological marker of emotion regulation, and risk for psychopathology, the factors that may be associated with aberrant RSA development remain unclear. The goal of the current study was to examine the relation between children's resting levels of RSA and neighborhood crime, a macro-level environmental stressor associated with increased risk for multiple forms of psychopathology in youth. The levels of neighborhood crime were obtained using a geocoded neighborhood crime exposure database, allowing for the objective assessment of the likelihood of crime occurring in the child's community. The results indicated that the relation between neighborhood crime and resting RSA differed for girls and boys such that living in a neighborhood with higher risk of exposure to violent crimes was associated with lower RSA for girls, but not boys. These results suggest that living in a higher crime neighborhood is associated with an objective, biologically-based marker of emotion regulation and highlight how neighborhood crime may be specifically associated with risk for girls.

AB Youth violence is a complex and multifactorial issue that has severe health and social consequences. While treatment options exist to treat/reduce violence in at-risk populations such as schizophrenia, there remains limitations in the efficacy of current interventions. Virtual reality (VR) appears to be a unique possibility to expose offenders and to train coping skills in virtual situations that are capable of eliciting aggression-relevant behavior without threatening others. The focus of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of studies using VR to manage violence across several at-risk populations, with a particular emphasis on youth with schizophrenia. Despite the encouraging success of VR applications for the treatment of different mental health problems, no studies have explored the usability of VR to specifically treat violence in patients with schizophrenia. A limited number of studies have focused on violence risk factors in other mental health problems (i.e., emotion regulation in individual suffering from post-traumatic disorders) that may be targeted in treatments to reduce the risk of violence. The preliminary studies using VR as a therapeutic element have shown reductions in anger, improvements in conflict-resolution skills as well as in empathy levels, and decreases in aggression. Possible applications of these interventions in youth with schizophrenia will be discussed.

AB Adolescence is a time of unique sensitivity to socially salient stimuli such as social rewards. This period overlaps with the onset of psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In the current studies, we examined behavioral and neural patterns of dysregulation to social rewards and threats, and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths. In study 1, we used a social Go/NoGo cognitive control task using peer faces to test for age-related behavioral differences in inhibitory failures in adolescents (N = 53, M-age = 13.37 years), and adults (N = 51, M-age = 43.71 years). In study 2, an independent adolescent sample (N = 51, M-age = 13.98 years) completed a similar social Go/NoGo cognitive control task during fMRI. Results show that adolescents had greater inhibitory failures - as measured by false alarm rate - to both social reward and threat cues than adults, and more so to social reward than threat cues. Greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues were associated with greater internalizing symptoms, but were not significantly related to externalizing symptoms. At the neural level, greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues as well as greater internalizing symptoms were both associated with heightened amygdala-ventral striatum connectivity. Our findings indicate that subcortico-subcortical connectivity, which is deemed to occur chronologically earlier and thus necessary for subcortico-cortical circuits, may serve as an early biomarker for emotion dysregulation and a risk factor for internalizing symptoms.

AB Third-party adolescents (those aware of peer conflict as neither aggressors nor victims) can help shape their peers' emotional responses to perceived victimization. Emotion regulation promotes resilience for those who have been victimized, and heightened anger can exacerbate negative outcomes. This study sought to understand how ethnically diverse victimized adolescents described third-party actions that amplified their anger and calmed their emotions-and whether there were gender, racial/ethnic, or school-level patterns. Data were drawn from 264 structured interviews using a multi-method, repeated measures design. Participants were 66 African Americans, 57 European Americans, 64 Mexican Americans, and 77 Native Americans from the Northwest United States. Open- and process-coding identified 16 themes that described third-party actions, and pattern coding provided insight into why particular actions may be perceived as anger-amplifying or calming. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests on action frequencies revealed five actions (e.g., co-ruminating) that were associated with amplifying victims' anger and eight actions (e.g., reassuring) that were associated with calming victims' emotions. Group patterns were examined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Programs and interventions may draw on these qualitative accounts of victimized adolescents' experiences to illustrate how third-party actions might differentially impact peers during or after aggressive incidents.

AB Peer violence in school has become a major issue for schools around the world. The present study examined the impacts of cultural settings and of protective individual attributes on peer bullying and victimization in school. These protective attributes were self-esteem, sense of autonomy, emotional regulation, and individual resilience. Participants were 112 Jewish and 55 Arab Bedouin pupils 10 to 11 years old. It was hypothesized that Jewish pupils would score lower than Bedouin pupils on bullying and on victimization, and will score higher than them on these protective individual attributes. It was also hypothesized that despite these differences, the investigated attributes would correlate with reduced peer violence in both groups. It was hypothesized further that individual resilience will be the major predictor of both bullying and victimization in both groups. Results have generally supported these hypotheses, suggesting alternative ways for curtailing peer aggression in school.

ID INTERVENTIONS
AB An 8-week mindfulness and compassion program was developed for youth at risk for, or already experiencing, psychosis, based on UK national guidelines for developing interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a program description and first hand account of a participant's experience. First, mindfulness skills are taught. Next an emotional regulation model is introduced, to help participants understand how psychotic experiences, anxiety and depression contribute to a heightened threat system, and how compassion can help them. The program contains meditations (e.g. breath practice, compassionate friend) and practices for use in daily life (e.g. STOP practice). The second author found mindfulness allowed her to feel and acknowledge her experience and give her emotions the recognition they needed. Being self-compassionate was a new concept, which at times was challenging but helped her realize her emotions were normal and she could manage difficult emotions using soothing practices. Furthermore, being part of a group helped her realize she was not alone. Mindfulness and compassion skills can be helpful for youth with psychotic experiences. A group program can provide a safe place to share experiences and reduce isolation. An evaluation of the program will be the focus of future papers.

AB Parents are often the first to detect the initial signs of anorexia nervosa (AN) and take necessary measures to ensure that their children receive appropriate treatment. The evaluation of AN in adolescence is complicated by taking into account the tendency to minimize and deny the symptoms by adolescents, and the difficulty of parents in detecting the main symptoms. We compared the adolescent and parent scores on measures of disordered eating at initial presentation. The sample consisted of 62 adolescents diagnosed with AN, who attended an eating disorder children's unit. Adolescents completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40) and their parents the Anorectic Behavior Observation Scale (ABOS). The questionnaire data were collected as part of the routine clinical practice and were obtained from clinical notes. The findings indicate no significant correlations between the EAT-40 and ABOS scores, or between AN subtypes according to parent observation of symptoms. There were significant differences between parents, with mothers reporting higher scores than fathers. This study highlights the importance of psychoeducation for parents on the early signs of AN, in order to improve recognition and diagnosis at initial assessment of their adolescent children in the early phases.

AB Suicidal ideation is a serious mental health concern reported by adolescents. Despite understanding of increased suicidal ideation in patients with eating disorders (EDs) and obesity, few studies have compared how disordered eating (bingeing, vomiting and over exercising) is associated with suicidal ideation in clinical and non-clinical samples of youth across the ED and weight spectrum. The present study aimed to 1) comparatively examine rates of suicidal ideation and disordered eating behaviors in clinical samples of youth with EDs, complex obesity, or from the community, and 2) examine whether disordered eating was associated with suicidal ideation above and beyond age, body mass index, diagnosis, treatment-seeking status, and depressive symptoms in large samples of males vs. females in an attempt to understand whether these behaviors should lead to concern regarding suicidal ideation. Data from charts on treatment-seeking adolescents diagnosed with either an ED (N = 315), severe complex obesity (N = 212), and from the community (N = 3036) were pooled together for comparative purposes. Results showed that suicidal ideation was higher in youth seeking treatment for an ED (50.2%) and obesity (23.7%) as compared to youth from the community (13%). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that vomiting (OR = 1.73 for females, 8.17 for males) and over-exercising (OR = 1.47 for females, 1.68 for males) was significantly associated with suicidal ideation in both males and females. Findings underscore the importance of screening for suicidal ideation in youth who report vomiting or over-exercising despite diagnostic presentation, age, weight, or treatment setting.

AB Although adolescence has been defined as a stage of vulnerability, due to the biopsychosocial changes that happen throughout this developmental stage, it is also one of growth. Some of the core personal competencies that have been identified to promote positive development at this stage while simultaneously preventing risks are: (1) a positive sense of self, (2) self-regulation, (3) decision-making skills, (4) a moral system of belief, and (5) prosocial connectedness. There are many factors and contexts that influence adolescent development. The school climate, for example, has the capacity to promote positive development and life satisfaction, yet on the other hand, it is a context within which different forms of violence, such as bullying, can occur. The principal aim of this study, therefore, is to analyze the influence that bullying has on one's life satisfaction, while taking into account participants' socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., gender and developmental stage), their core personal competencies (i.e., problem solving strategies, empathy, emotional repair, self-esteem, and values), and the school climate. To obtain data, a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted with a sample of 647 Spanish students (53.3% female), ranging in age from preadolescence (10-13 years old; 60.3%) to mid-adolescence (14-18 years old; 39.7%), and belonging to diverse socio-economic contexts (15.3% rural) and schools (32.1% public). After gaining informed consent from both the participants and their parents, students completed the survey voluntarily, and under anonymity. Initially results show that gender, developmental stage, and having been bullied were predictors of participants' levels of life satisfaction. When the core personal competencies were also considered in data analysis process, self-esteem, emotional repair, and social values were those demonstrating significant effects on one's life satisfaction; moreover, being bullied was a significant predictor too. Finally, after taking school climate into account, only this variable as well as self-esteem and emotional repair were significant predictors of life satisfaction: the other assessed variables were no longer found to be significant predictors (i. e., gender, developmental stage, being bullied, and social values). These results have important implications for education objectives, methodologies, and school functioning: school climate, selfesteem and emotional repair seem to be particularly important for promoting student life satisfaction and for preventing the negative consequences associated with being bullied.

AB Background: Some studies have demonstrated the high impact of headache and migraine in several areas of children and adolescents' life. In recent years, there has been an increase in scientific interest in the relationship between migraine and emotional regulation, investigating the possible consequences of emotional dysregulation on physical and mental health. While some studies have been carried out on the relationship between alexithymia and headache or migraine (especially in adults), no data exist on relationship between Theory of Mind (TOM), metacognition, and alexithymia in children and adolescents with migraine.
   Methods: Children with diagnosis of migraine without aura (MWoA) (36 males and 34 females) were compared to a healthy control group (31 males and 39 females). The age range was from 8 to 13 years in both groups. All children completed the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children (AQC) for the assessment of alexithymia levels and the Domain of Social Perception included in the NEPSY-II to evaluate levels of TOM. Metacognitive development was evaluated with Io e La Mia Mente for children aged between 8 and 10 years and with Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children (MCQ-C) for children from 11 to 13.
   Results: There were no differences between children with MWoA and the control group in metacognitive abilities; only in the subscale "Negative Meta Worrying" of MCQ-C girls scored higher than boys, regardless of the group they were part of. Also, in the NEPSY-II subscale there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Children with MWoA scored higher in the AQC subscales "Difficulty Identifying Feelings" and "Difficulty Describing Feelings" than controls. Moreover, children between 8 and 10 years statistically differed from older children in "Difficulty Identifying Feelings" and in Total Score.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that children with MWoA have no metacognitive and TOM problems compared to a healthy group. The experimental group showed higher traits of alexithymia, confirming what suggested by other studies in the literature. Future research will have to focus on migraine with aura and tension-type headache to evaluate any differences with children with MWoA.

AB Objective: Addictive disorders start during adolescence for most individuals, and developmental differences in brain maturation and response to treatments are present. Recent studies in adults have identified associations between addiction treatment response and regional and circuit specific brain dysfunction, suggesting candidate neural treatment targets. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to qualitatively and quantitatively summarize findings from structural and functional neuroimaging studies that examine neural correlates of treatment response in adolescents and young adults with addictive disorders. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies were selected if they included individuals aged 13-26 with a DSM-IV or DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth and Fifth Edition) addictive disorder diagnosis, used neuroimaging, administered a treatment/intervention, and reported within- or between-subject contrasts in brain structure or activity across treatment/intervention and a control condition or brain-behavior correlations with treatment-outcome variables. Quantitative meta-analyses used an activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Results: Out of 3177 citations, 27 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Qualitative analyses revealed anatomical, connectivity, and functional brain-behavior associations with response to addiction interventions across a broad array of cortical and subcortical brain regions and associated networks. Eighteen functional magnetic resonance imaging studies involving 354 participants and 88 brain foci were included in the ALE meta-analysis. Despite significant heterogeneity in study design and methods, six ALE activation clusters localized to the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, and putamen showed consistent brain-behavior associations with treatment-outcome variables. Conclusions: Cortical and subcortical brain regions involved in cognition, emotion regulation, decision-making, reward, and self-reference are associated with treatment response in addicted youth. These results are consistent with findings in the adult literature and suggest overlapping neural treatment targets across developmental stages.

AB BACKGROUND: Researchers document bidirectional pathways linking peripheral inflammation and neural circuitries subserving emotion processing and regulation. To extend this work, we present results from two independent studies examining the relationship between inflammation and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   METHODS: Study 1 involved 90 rural African American young adults, 25 years of age (52% female), and study 2 involved 82 urban African American youths, 13 to 14 years of age (66% female). Both studies measured circulating inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha), and the measures were averaged to form a composite. Study 2 also enumerated classical monocytes, a key leukocyte subpopulation involved in immune-to-brain signaling. All participants completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan.
   RESULTS: Consistent with our prediction, higher scores on the inflammatory composite were associated with lower rsFC within an emotion regulation network in study 1, controlling for sex. Study 2 replicated study 1, showing that higher scores on the inflammatory composite were associated with lower rsFC within the emotion regulation network, controlling for sex, age, and pubertal status, and found a similar pattern for rsFC within a central executive network. Study 2 also found that higher numbers of classical monocytes were associated with lower rsFC within both the emotion regulation and central executive networks. There was no relationship between rsFC in the anterior salience or default mode networks with inflammation in either study.
   CONCLUSIONS: With these findings, we document relationships between peripheral inflammation and rsFC within an emotion regulation and central executive network and replicate these associations with the emotion regulation network across two independent samples.

AB Background: HIV-infected children and adolescents (CA-HIV) face significant mental health challenges related to a broad range of biological and psychosocial factors. Data are scarce on the agreement and discrepancy between caregivers and CA-HIV regarding emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) in CA-HIV.
   Objectives: We determined agreement between self- versus caregiver- reported EBPs and describe factors associated with informant discrepancy among caregiver-youth dyads who participated in the "Mental health among HIV-infected CHildren and Adolescents in KAmpala and Masaka, Uganda" (CHAKA) study.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional sample, caregiver-reported EBPs were assessed with the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 (CASI-5), and self-reported problems were evaluated with the Youth Inventory-4 (YI-4) in 469 adolescents aged 12-17 years and the Child Inventory-4 (CI-4) in 493 children aged 8-11 years. Adolescents were questioned about experiences of HIV stigma. Caregiver psychological distress was assessed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Linear regression models were applied to identify variables associated with discrepancy scores.
   Results: Self-reported emotional problems (EPs) were present in 28.8% of adolescents and 36.9% of children, and 14.5% of adolescents self-reported behavioral problems (BPs). There was only a modest correlation (r <= 0.29) between caregiver- and CA-HIV-reported EBPs, with caregivers reporting more EPs whereas adolescents reported more BPs. Informant discrepancy between adolescents and caregivers for BPs was associated with adolescent age and caregiver's employment and HIV status. Among adolescents, EP discrepancy scores were associated with adolescent's WHO HIV clinical stage, caregiver level of education, and caregivers caring for other children. Among children, EP discrepancy scores were associated with child and caregiver age, caregiver level of education, and caregiver self-rated health status. HIV stigma and caregiver psychological distress were also associated with discrepancy, such that adolescents who experienced HIV stigma rated their EPs as more severe than their caregivers did and caregivers with increased psychological distress rated EBPs as more severe than CA-HIV self-rated.
   Conclusions: EBPs are frequently endorsed by CA-HIV, and agreement between informants is modest. Informant discrepancy is related to unique psychosocial and HIV-related factors. Multi-informant reports enhance the evaluation of CA-HIV and informant discrepancies can provide additional insights into the mental health of CA-HIV.

AB Background and Objectives: Negative cognitive emotion regulation (ER) strategies are particularly important within the framework of anxiety problems amongst youths and how they cope with stressful events. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between both negative and positive ER style and cardiac regulation under stressful conditions. Design: Eighty-nine adolescents (M = 13.31 years, SD = 0.68, 44.94% girls) were exposed to a socially relevant stress induction protocol. Methods: Participants' emotion regulation strategies were assessed and their cardiac function was recorded. Results: A negative ER style predicted heart rate (HR) entropy at the stressful stage after controlling for anxiety scores. In addition, heart rate variability reactivity and recovery and HR entropy recovery were larger (p < .05) in the low negative ER style group (n = 16) than in the high negative ER style group (n = 23). Conclusions: Results suggest that individuals with a highly negative ER style have diminished autonomic flexibility.

AB Many adolescent girls in custody have extensive histories of profound childhood trauma and abuse. They typically come from marginalized communities marked with gang violence. The Art of Yoga Project provides a gender-specific, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive approach to cater to this understudied and underserved population. The Yoga and Creative Arts Curriculum combines yoga, mindfulness, meditation, and art for girls in custody in several Californian counties. The findings are from a mixed methods evaluation of multiple sites over several years. Taken together, we saw an improvement in the self-reported emotional regulation of incarcerated girls. We discuss practical implications for extending this work in other jurisdictions and to other populations.

AB Psychological well-being is a core feature of mental health, and may be defined as including hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure) and eudaimonic (meaning, fulfillment) happiness, as well as resilience (coping, emotion regulation, healthy problem solving). To promote psychological well-being, it is helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms associated with this construct and then develop targeted and effective training programs. In this perspective article, we discuss key components and potential brain-body mechanisms related to psychological well-being and propose mindfulness training as a promising way to improve it. Based on a series of randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies of one form of mindfulness training in adolescents and adults, the integrative body-mind training (IBMT), we use IBMT as an exemplar to provide research evidence of the positive effects of mindfulness training on psychological well-being. We focus on one of the mechanisms by which IBMT enhances psychological well-being-the interaction between mind (mindfulness) and body (bodifulness)-which involves both the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). We also highlight the role of brain self-control networks, including the anterior cingulate cortex/prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC), in improving psychological well-being. We suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising program that promotes the synergistic engagement of mind and body to achieve the goals of enhancing psychological well-being.

AB Introduction: Although the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is one of the most widely used behavioral rating scales among people with developmental disabilities, very few studies have examined the factor structure of the non-English versions.Methods: The construct validity of the Norwegian ABC was examined in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders (N = 339). Diagnoses were obtained from direct interdisciplinary assessments in our neuro-pediatric clinics. Results: In an exploratory factor analysis, 46 of the 58 items (79%) loaded most heavily on four of the five original factors in the English version. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed less-than-optimal fit indices for the five-factor solution. Internal consistency was adequate to excellent for all subscales (alpha range = .76-.95). The ABC showed meaningful overlap and differentiation with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and full scale IQ. There were positive correlations between several of the ABC subscales and diagnoses of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and emotional disorder Conclusion: Satisfactory psychometric properties were found for the ABC, with the exception of the Inappropriate Speech factor, in a mixed sample of higher functioning children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders.

AB Emotional awareness is an important variable for children's and adolescents' social and emotional development. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties (e.g., factor structure, internal consistencies) of scores on the German translation of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (EAQ; Rieffe, Oosterveld, Miers, Meerum Terwogt, & Ly, 2008). Furthermore, to examine the concurrent validity, associations of the six subscales (Differentiating Emotions, Verbal Sharing of Emotions, Not Hiding Emotions, Bodily Unawareness, Attending to Others' Emotions, Analyses of Emotions) with emotion regulation, internalizing and externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior were investigated. Questionnaire data of 1,018 adolescents aged between 11 and 18 were analyzed. The proposed six-factor structure was replicated and internal consistencies were satisfactory. Meaningful associations of the six EAQ subscales with emotion regulation and psychosocial adjustment were found, proving the concurrent validity of this questionnaire. In general, higher emotional awareness was associated with more functional emotion regulation and prosocial behavior, and less dysfunctional emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing problems. Significant gender differences were detected and are discussed. Overall, the findings suggest that the German EAQ is a useful instrument to assess children's and adolescents' emotional awareness.

AB This study investigated the effects of adolescents' attachment security and reflective functioning (RF) (assessed by the adult attachment interview [AAI]) in the prediction of well-being in adulthood. Adolescents (N = 79; M = 14.6 years old; SD = 3.5 years) completed the AAI at Time 1 (T1), which was subsequently coded for inferred attachment experiences, narrative coherence, and RF by three nonoverlapping teams of raters. Participants completed the Psychological General Well-being Index at T1 and 8 years later (Time 2, T2). Analyses showed that (a) both adolescent narrative coherence and RF were significant predictors of almost all indices of well-being at T2 in adulthood; (b) both narrative coherence and RF indirectly linked inferred loving parental care and T2 well-being; (c) when included in the same model, RF was a significant indirect effect linking inferred loving parental care and T2 well-being. These findings contribute to theory in suggesting that both RF and narrative coherence are predictive of subsequent psychological well-being and operate as links between inferred parental care and subsequent adjustment. Possible mechanisms underlying these findings are discussed.

AB The construct validity of the 9-scale version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) parent form was examined in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders (N = 281). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor model separating the inhibitory behavioral control dimension from the emotional control and metacognitive problem-solving dimensions. The Metacognitive factor was also related to a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after controlling for age, gender, IQ, adaptive functioning, and a conventional behavioral rating scale, which included inattention-hyperactivity symptoms. The Emotional Regulation factor was related to a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Correlational analyses indicated that child comorbid emotional and behavioral problems may exacerbate parental BRIEF reporting. Accordingly, when assessing executive function among children with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, the BRIEF should be complemented with assessments of mental health problems.

AB Introduction: Temperament dimensions may be related to executive functions (EF) and may be involved in the expression and maintenance of symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current study aimed to assess whether effortful control (EC) mediates the relationship between EF and inattentive symptoms, and whether surgency (S) and negative affectivity (NA) mediate the relationships between EF and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms in adolescents.Method: Working individually, participants aged between 12 and 16years (N=118; 75 with ADHD) performed tests of cognitive EF (working memory, planning, flexibility, and inhibition), and parents and teachers completed a multi-informant assessment focusing on measures of ADHD symptoms and temperament dimensions (EC, S, and NA).Results: There were significant differences between ADHD and control participants in EF and temperament dimensions. ADHD participants had lower scores than controls in working memory, planning, and inhibition EF; they also had lower scores in EC and higher scores in S and NA. Structural equation modeling indicated differential associations between EC, S, and NA temperament dimensions, and working memory, planning and inhibition EF, and ADHD symptoms. Mediation analysis suggested that EF exerted indirect effects on the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, via EC; higher EF abilities were related to higher levels of EC, which in turn were related to lower scores of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms. S and NA did not mediate relations among EF and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.Conclusion: The findings expand on those of previous studies of the complex relationship between temperament dimensions and EF and confirm the differential association between impairments in some EF, low EC, and the expression of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in adolescents, which may account for the ADHD-control group differences.

AB Objectives: To investigate perfectionism and beliefs about emotions in adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and their parents. Design: Case-control comparing adolescents (age 11-18) with CFS (N = 121), asthma (N = 27) and healthy controls (N = 78) with a 3-month follow up for CFS participants. Main outcome measures: Adolescents: Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, physical functioning, Beliefs about Emotions scale (BES), Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale, Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS). Parents: BES, FMPS, Self-sacrificing scale, Affective styles questionnaire. Results: Adolescents with CFS did not consistently report higher levels of perfectionism and unhelpful beliefs about emotions than adolescents with asthma or healthy adolescents. Mothers' and adolescents' beliefs about emotions and unhelpful perfectionism were significantly associated (p = .007). Linear regression found that neither adolescent perfectionism nor beliefs about emotions accounted for variance in subsequent fatigue or physical functioning. Conclusion: Parental perfectionism and emotion regulation style may contribute to perfectionism in adolescents with CFS. Parental representations could contribute to fatigue maintenance.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) often occurs before age 15, yet the majority of research on risk factors for this dangerous behavior has focused on samples of older participants. Insecure attachment has been previously identified as a risk factor for both NSSI and behavioral problems, and behavioral problems appear to be particularly associated with NSSI among young populations. Redressing the lack of young adolescent NSSI research, the present study uses longitudinal data from a sample of young adolescents to test a model in which insecure attachment acts as a prospective risk factor for NSSI via emotional and behavioral problems. Data on NSSI, child-mother attachment, and emotional and behavioral problems were collected from 559 (41.1% male) Flemish adolescents when they were 13 years old (M = 12.71, SD =0.32), and again 1 year later. Insecure attachment was measured using maternal items on the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Child scale. Psychological adjustment was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. We found that anxious and avoidant attachment were indirectly associated with NSSI through behavioral problems but not through emotional problems. Findings highlight the role of behavioral problems as a risk factor for NSSI in early adolescence, a rarely studied developmental period during which NSSI often first starts. Findings suggest that one possible pathway for the attachment-NSSI association among young adolescents is through behavioral problems. Therapies that improve child-parent attachment may reduce NSSI among young adolescents both directly, and indirectly by improving behavioral problems.

AB Objective: The association between violence exposure and health risk behaviours in South African adolescents, and the moderating role of emotion dysregulation were investigated. Design: A multi-ethnic sample of adolescents (N = 925: boy: 47.3%, girl: 52.7%, M age = 16 years, SD = 1.54) completed a survey. Main outcome measures: Violence exposure across different contexts (home-, school-, community-, political victimisation), emotion dysregulation (inability to regulate sadness and anger) and a composite measure of health risk behaviours (smoking, substance use, risky sexual behaviour) were examined. Results: Boys reported more risk behaviours than girls, t (844) = 5.25, p < 0.001. Direct community victimisation was a predictor for boys' risk behaviours, B = 0.22, p < 0.001. Indirect school victimisation and direct community victimisation were predictors for girls' risk behaviours, B's = 0.19, p's < 0.01. Girls reported higher emotion dysregulation than boys, t (748) = -2.95, p < 0.01. Only for girls, emotion dysregulation moderated the associations of indirect home victimisation, B = 16, p < 0.01, and direct community victimisation, B = 15, p < 0.05, with risk behaviours. Conclusion: Interventions may target emotion regulation skills, particularly for girls, to enhance resilience to the negative effects of violence on behaviours.

AB Victimization has been one of the key research areas in the field of organizational behavior; however, current literature on organizational behavior has not sufficiently discussed the underlying processes that lead to changes in victim's behavior and their life. Proposed framework in this paper discusses long-term effects of victimization in two phases. Phase I elaborates the process through which victimization experiences lead to different emotional responses including anger, fear, and sadness in victimized employees. Phase II discusses the long-run cascading effects of emotions on victim's behavior and health. Overall this study suggests that continuous victimization leads to long-lasting devastating effects on victim's life through development of abusive leadership traits, as well as through destructive effects on their physical and mental health.

AB Adolescents with developmental language disorders (DLDs) and adolescents who are deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) are at greater risk of social emotional problems. These problems may not only be attributed to communication and language problems but, at least in part, to Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits as well. In this mini review, an overview is provided of studies on social emotional functioning and ToM performance in adolescents with DLD and D/HH adolescents. A possible interplay between social emotional functioning and Theory of Mind is discussed. There is empirical evidence for social emotional problems and ToM problems in both adolescents with DLD and D/HH. We hypothesized that language deficits as seen in adolescents with DLD and impoverished exposure to language and communication, as seen in adolescents who are D/HH can explain differences in social emotional functioning and ToM performance. The present mini review provides a possible framework for the relation between ToM and social emotional functioning in adolescents with communication and language problems, which is mediated by their limited linguistic ability or restricted language exposure and gives suggestions for future research.

AB Because emotional and behavioral problems during young adulthood are an evolving public health concern, it is important to identify parenting behavior in the family of origin that prevents or exacerbates such problems. Therefore, we tested the impact of a unique parenting behavior - indulgent parenting - on emotional and behavioral problems through effects on self-regulation skills among college students, who face increasing developmental demands and challenges independent of parents. Using a sample of 459 college students, results from structural equation modeling suggested that (1) parental indulgence was positively associated with college students' emotional and behavioral problems and (2) self-regulation mediated the association between parental indulgence and emotional and behavioral outcomes. Further, the findings revealed some perceived gender differences. Implications for parenting and young adult health interventions were discussed.

AB Cyber victimization research reveals various personal and contextual correlations and negative consequences associated with this experience. Despite increasing attention on cyber victimization, few studies have examined such experiences among ethnic minority adolescents. The purpose of the present study was to examine the moderating effect of ethnicity in the longitudinal associations among cyber victimization, school-belongingness, and psychological consequences (i.e., depression, loneliness, anxiety). These associations were investigated among 416 Latinx and white adolescents (46% female; M age = 13.89, SD = 0.41) from one middle school in the United States. They answered questionnaires on cyber victimization, school belongingness, depression, loneliness, and anxiety in the 7th grade (Time 1). One year later, in the 8th grade (Time 2), they completed questionnaires on depression, loneliness, and anxiety. Low levels of school-belongingness strengthened the positive relationships between cyber victimization and Time 2 depression and anxiety, especially among Latinx adolescents. The positive association between cyber victimization and Time 2 loneliness was strengthened for low levels of school-belongingness for all adolescents. These findings may indicate that cyber victimization threatens adolescents' school-belongingness, which has implications for their emotional adjustment. Such findings underscore the importance of considering diverse populations when examining cyber victimization.

AB Aim Previous studies suggest that Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) is feasible and may improve anxiety and emotion regulation in youth with anxiety disorders at-risk for bipolar disorder. However, controlled studies are warranted to replicate and extend these findings. Methods In the current study, 24 youth with anxiety disorders who have at least one parent with bipolar disorder participated in a MBCT-C treatment period (n = 24; M-age = 13.6, 75% girls, 79% White) with a subset also participating in a prior psychoeducation waitlist control period (n = 19 M-age = 13.8, 68% girls, 84% White). Participants in both the waitlist and MBCT-C periods completed independently-rated symptom scales at each time point. Participants in the waitlist period received educational materials 12 weeks prior to the beginning of MBCT-C. Results There were significantly greater improvements in overall clinical severity in the MBCT-C period compared to the waitlist period, but not in clinician- and child-rated anxiety, emotion regulation or mindfulness. However, increases in mindfulness were associated with improvements in anxiety and emotion regulation in the MBCT-C period, but not the waitlist period. Conclusions Findings suggest that MBCT-C may be effective for improving overall clinical severity in youth with anxiety disorders who are at-risk for bipolar disorder. However, waitlist controlled designs may inflate effect sizes so interpret with caution. Larger studies utilizing prospective randomized controlled designs are warranted.

AB Background: Youth homelessness is a substantial issue, and many youths experiencing homelessness have mental health issues as both a cause and consequence of homelessness. These youths face many barriers to receiving traditional mental health services, and as a result, only a few youths experiencing homelessness receive any form of mental health care.
   Objective: This project aimed to develop and determine the feasibility and acceptability of engaging young adults (ie, individuals aged 18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in a remotely delivered mental health intervention. This intervention provided brief emotional support and coping skills, drawing from cognitive behavioral principles as an introduction into psychosocial support. The intervention was piloted in a homeless shelter network.
   Methods: A total of 35 young adults experiencing homelessness participated in a single-arm feasibility pilot trial. Participants received a mobile phone, a service and data plan, and 1 month of support from a coach consisting of up to 3 brief phone sessions, text messaging, and mobile mental health apps. We evaluated feasibility by looking at completion of sessions as well as the overall program and acceptability with satisfaction ratings. We also collected clinical symptoms at baseline and the end of the 1-month support period. We used validity items to identify participants who might be responding inappropriately and thus only report satisfaction ratings and clinical outcomes from valid responses.
   Results: Most participants (20/35, 57%) completed all 3 of their phone sessions, with an average of 2.09 sessions (SD 1.22) completed by each participant. Participants sent an average of 15.06 text messages (SD 12.62) and received an average of 19.34 messages (SD 12.70). We found higher rates of satisfaction among the participants with valid responses, with 100% (23/23) of such participants indicating that they would recommend participation to someone else and 52% (12/23) reporting that they were very or extremely satisfied with their participation. We found very little change from pre- to posttreatment on measures of depression (d=0.27), post-traumatic stress disorder (d=0.17), and emotion regulation (d=0.10).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it was feasible to engage homeless young adults in mental health services in this technology-based intervention with high rates of satisfaction. We did not find changes in clinical outcomes; however, we had a small sample size and a brief intervention. Technology might be an important avenue to reach young adults experiencing homelessness, but additional work could explore proper interventions to deliver with such a platform.

AB Although family-school engagement is important across child and adolescent development, most research, programs, and policies have focused primarily on elementary students and contexts. The current study extends beyond elementary settings by exploring the unique and shared contributions of developmental context on family-school engagement (i.e., across and within elementary- and middle-school settings). Data were drawn from two randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of teacher training in universal classroom-management practices. Participants included 3,174 students and 207 teachers across 21 elementary and middle schools in the Midwest. Using hierarchical linear modeling, results revealed that family-school engagement was significantly higher in elementary than in middle schools. Student-level characteristics (i.e., identifying as White, participation in the free/reduced-price lunch program, and having lower levels of disruptive behavior) were also associated with higher levels of family-school engagement. In addition, student characteristics (i.e., race/ethnicity and level of disruptive behavior) moderated the relations between family-school engagement and developmental context. Regardless of developmental context, family-school engagement predicted positive end-of-year behavioral outcomes (i.e., increases in youth prosocial skills and decreases in youth concentration problems, disruptive behaviors, and emotional dysregulation). Last, moderation analyses revealed that these effects of family-school engagement were especially pronounced in middle school for concentration problems and emotional dysregulation. Overall, findings provide further support for the value of family-school engagement across development in fostering positive youth outcomes. However, it is evident that more steps must be taken to ensure family-school engagement practices are developed to support the unique needs of middle-school students and contexts.

AB BACKGROUND: The human brain remains highly plastic for a protracted developmental period. Thus, although early caregiving adversities that alter amygdala development can result in enduring emotion regulation difficulties, these trajectories should respond to subsequent enriched caregiving. Exposure to high-quality parenting can regulate (i.e., decrease) children's amygdala reactivity, a process that, over the long term, is hypothesized to enhance emotion regulation. We tested the hypothesis that even following adversity, the parent-child relationship would be associated with decreases in amygdala reactivity to parent cues, which would in turn predict lower future anxiety.
   METHODS: Participants were 102 children (6-10 years of age) and adolescents (11-17 years of age), for whom data were collected at one or two time points and who either had experienced institutional care before adoption (n = 45) or had lived always with their biological parents (comparison; n = 57). We examined how amygdala reactivity to visual cues of the parent at time 1 predicted longitudinal change (from time 1 to time 2) in parent-reported child anxiety across 3 years.
   RESULTS: At time 1, on average, amygdala reactivity decrements to parent cues were not seen in children who had received institutional care but were seen in children in the comparison group. However, some children who previously experienced institutional care did show decreased amygdala reactivity to parent cues (similar to 40%), which was associated with greater child-reported feelings of security with their parent. Amygdala decreases at time 1 were followed by steeper anxiety reductions from time 1 to time 2 (i.e., 3 years).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a neurobiological mechanism by which the parent-child relationship can increase resilience, even in children at significant risk for anxiety symptoms.

AB Juveniles are overrepresented among arson offenders, though previous research has been mixed in identifying key risk factors differentiating juvenile firesetters from youth who do not light unsanctioned fires. The current meta-analysis examined all published and available unpublished research over a 30-year period, examining risk and protective factors associated with youth firesetting. Control groups comprised youth living in the community, forensic samples, and clinic referred youth. Across 39 independent samples with 22,292 juveniles, fire specific variables yielded the strongest differentiation between firesetters and non-firesetters, particularly history of fire involvement and fire interest. Juvenile firesetters had significantly more extensive histories of problematic behaviours, experienced adverse familial events, elevated rates of emotional dysregulation, and greater prevalence of mental health disorders compared to youth not involved in firesetting. Protective factors were less often identified for firesetters compared to non-firesetters. The findings highlight juvenile firesetters often experience multiple problems, magnified by a history of interest and involvement in firesetting. Hence, interventions with juvenile firesetters need to target multiple problem areas while assisting youth to redirecting interests towards non-antisocial pursuits. Caution is noted in interpreting the findings, with significant heterogeneity identified for most effect sizes across studies.

AB Introduction: Adolescents experience enhanced social sensitivity and biopsychosocial changes that can be challenging. Much remains unknown about the effect of psychological characteristics and peer relationships on adolescents' physiological responses to stress, due in part to methodological limitations.
   Methods: To test how adolescents' peer relationships and psychological characteristics are associated with their physiological and psychological response to stress, we administered the Group Public Speaking Task for Adolescents (GPST-A) to 54 adolescents (n = 40 girls; Mage = 16.6 years) in two high schools in the United States. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA), and positive and negative affect were measured six times. Relationships among group members were measured, resulting in whole-network data. State and trait rumination, five factors of coping, and emotional reappraisal and suppression were measured along with symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Results: Greater levels of negative evaluation and victimization among group members were associated with a steeper increase and decline in the negative affect response, yet not associated with the physiological response to stress. Greater positive affect was associated with decreased cortisol reactivity, whereas negative affect was associated with steeper cortisol and sAA reactivity. Rumination, disengagement coping, and depression symptoms were related to the physiological response to stress.
   Conclusions: The GPST-A is feasible to administer in a school context with adolescents to collect both physiological and psychological stress responses. Findings from the present study suggest peer relationships are important for understanding adolescents' psychological response to stressors while psychological characteristics are important for adolescents' physiological response to stress.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a structured mindfulness group intervention program targeting deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) in a sample of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Seventy-two children aged 7 to 12 years with ADHD were randomized into 2 groups (mindfulness and control). The dysregulation profile was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Attention/Anxiety-Depression/Aggression scales. Results: Children with ADHD who received mindfulness-based group therapy showed lower levels of DESR after treatment, with a reduction in CBCL dysregulation profile (F (1,63) 5 4.81; p = 0.032). All ADHD symptoms showed a moderately significant positive correlation with DESR (p < 0.01). Children with combined-type showed higher levels of DESR than children with inattentive-type (p = 0.018); however, no statistically significant changes were observed in the combined-type after mindfulness treatment. Conclusion: This study suggests that mindfulness in the form of structured group therapy might be clinically relevant in treating children with ADHD and thus make an impact on the overall clinical outcome, regardless of the ADHD subtype.

AB External suspension from school is a common disciplinary practice in traditionally English-speaking countries. Few studies have sought student perceptions of school suspension, as well as measures of problem behaviours and emotional problems, and known factors that influence the development of antisocial behaviour, to examine associations between these variables. Three hundred and four adolescents, aged 12-17 years, from five schools in southern Australia completed a self-report questionnaire that asked about behavioural and mental health problems, and risk and protective factors known to be associated with suspension. Seventy-four of the participants had been previously suspended from school at least once. Having been previously suspended was associated with a greater level of problem behaviours and emotions, poor family management, low school commitment, reduced supportive teacher relationships, and interactions with antisocial peers. School suspension appears likely to be applied to students who lack the ability to self-regulate their behaviours and emotional problems in the classroom. By excluding students from school, pre-existing behavioural problems may be exacerbated by diminishing school protective factors and increasing exposure to known risk factors. Adolescents most at risk of being suspended would benefit from alternative school behaviour management policies and procedures that maintain the school as a protective factor.

AB Emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, are a relevant co-morbidity in severe asthma. Anxiety and depression may also be common in the parents of asthmatic adolescents. The current study evaluated anxious and depressive symptoms in 40 adolescents suffering from severe asthma, and in their parents, before and after 1 year of treatment, tailored according to validated asthma guidelines. We used the HADS (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) questionnaire for the adolescents, and HADS, STAY (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) questionnaires for their parents. We also considered the grade of asthma severity before and after 1 year of treatment. The current study demonstrated that anxiety and depression are common in both the adolescents suffering from severe asthma and their parents. Anxious and depressive symptoms were correlated between adolescents and their parents. Asthma treatment improved the asthma severity in almost all adolescents. However, the parental anxiety and depression remained unchanged at the end of the asthma treatment. Thus, a psychological assessment could be included in the adolescent severe asthma work-up, involving both the adolescents and their parents.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been found to be associated with poor emotion regulation. Aims: The goal of this study was to examine the association of multidimensional cognitive emotion regulation strategies with NSSI among adolescents and compare the different patterns of NSSI. Method: A sample of 594 high-school students (54.4% boys; mean age = 14.96 years), from five regional schools across Israel, were assessed for five facets of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance, refocus on planning, positive refocusing, putting into perspective, and positive reappraisal) and NSSI behaviors using validated scales. Participants were allocated into three groups: repetitive NSSI (more than six occasions of NSSI; 7.1%), occasional NSSI (at least one incident but less than six; 8.3%), and no NSSI (84.6%). Results: Analysis of covariance, controlling for gender and depression symptoms, revealed that students with NSSI reported higher levels of acceptance, but lower levels of refocus on planning and putting into perspective. Limitations: The study used a cross-sectional design, which was a limitation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that particular cognitive emotion regulation strategies differ substantially in their relationship with NSSI. Adolescents who focus on planning and putting stressful situations into perspective may have increased resilience, whereas adolescents who are accepting of negative events that have happened may be more prone to maladaptive coping behaviors.

AB Adolescence and emerging adulthood are both stages in which romantic relationships play a key role in development and can be a source of both well-being and negative outcomes. However, the limited number of studies prior to adulthood, along with the multiplicity of variables involved in the romantic context and the considerable ambiguity surrounding the construct of well-being, make it difficult to reach conclusions about the relationship between the two phenomena. This systematic review synthesizes the results produced into this topic over the last three decades. A total of 112 studies were included, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. On the one hand, these works revealed the terminological heterogeneity in research on well-being and the way the absence of symptoms of illness are commonly used to measure it, while on the other hand, they also showed that romantic relationships can be an important source of well-being for both adolescents and emerging adults. The findings underline the importance of providing a better definition of well-being, as well as to attribute greater value to the significance of romantic relationships. Devoting greater empirical, educational, and community efforts to romantic development in the stages leading up to adulthood are considered necessary actions in promoting the well-being of young people.

AB This study aims to examine the association of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) with emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) among adolescents and the degree to which this association is stronger for more ACE. In addition, we assessed whether socioeconomic position (SEP) modifies the association of ACE with EBP. We obtained data from 341 adolescents aged 10-16 (mean age = 13.14 years; 44.0% boys), the baseline of a cohort study. We measured EBP with the strengths and difficulties questionnaire and socioeconomic position (SEP) with self-reported financial status. We used generalized linear models to analyze the association between ACE (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3 and more) and EBP, and the modifying effect of SEP. Adolescents with 1-2 ACE (regression coefficient: 0.19; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.32) and with 3 ACE and over (0.35; 0.17-0.54) reported more overall problems compared with adolescents without ACE. Moreover, adolescents with 1-2 ACE (0.16; -0.01-0.32, and 0.16; 0.03-0.29) and with 3 and over ACE (0.33; 0.10-0.56, and 0.28; 0.09-0.47) reported more emotional problems and behavioral problems, respectively. The interactions of SEP with ACE were not significant. ACE are related to EBP among adolescents, with a clear dose-response association, and this association similarly holds for all SEP categories.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) affects 15% to 20% of adolescents-disproportionately girls-and is a strong predictor of eventual suicide attempts and suicide. Many girls now initiate NSSI before age 10. These early starters exhibit greater frequency of NSSI, use more diverse methods, and are hospitalized more often than later starters, yet there are no empirically supported prevention programs for preadolescents. Obstacles to prevention include ascertaining who is sufficiently vulnerable and specifying mechanistic intervention targets. Recent research indicates that (a) preadolescent girls with ADHD who are also maltreated are at alarming risk for NSSI and suicide attempts by adolescence and (b) the conjoint effects of these vulnerabilities are sufficiently potent for targeted prevention. Research also indicates that existing interventions are effective in altering child- and family-level mechanisms of NSSI. These interventions alter neurobiological markers of vulnerability, which can be used as proximal efficacy signals of prevention response without waiting for NSSI and suicide attempts to emerge.

AB Children and adolescents with developmental language disorder (DLD) are, overall, vulnerable to difficulties in emotional adjustment and in peer relations. However, previous research has shown that different subgroups follow different trajectories in respect to the quality of peer relations. Less is known about the trajectories of emotional development. We consider here the possibility that development in these two domains is interrelated: that is, the trajectories of emotional and peer problems will proceed in parallel. We conducted longitudinal joint trajectories analyses of emotional and peer relations in a sample of young people identified as having DLD at the age of 7 years and seen at intervals up to 16 years. Potential influences on joint trajectory group membership were examined. Findings revealed five distinct joint trajectories. Emotional and peer difficulties do occur together from childhood to adolescence for just over half of the sample, but not all. The variables most clearly associated with group membership were pragmatic language ability, prosociality and parental mental health. This is the first study to examine joint longitudinal trajectories of emotional and peer difficulties in individuals with DLD. We demonstrate that development in individuals with DLD is heterogeneous and identify three key variables associated with personal and social adjustment from childhood to adolescence. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Children growing up in poverty are vulnerable to negative changes in the developing brain; however, these outcomes vary widely. We tested the hypothesis that receipt of supportive parenting would offset the association between living in poverty during adolescence and the connectivity of neural networks that support cognition and emotion regulation during young adulthood. In a sample of African American youths (N = 119) living in the rural South, poverty status and receipt of supportive parenting were assessed when youths were 11 to 13 and 16 to 18 years old. At age 25, resting-state functional connectivity of the central-executive and emotion-regulation neural networks was assessed using functional MRI. The results revealed that more years spent living in poverty presaged less connectivity in both neural networks among young adults who received low levels of supportive parenting but not among those who received high levels of such parenting.

AB Adolescents with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD) experience difficulties with socio-emotional adjustment, including compromised friendships, feelings of loneliness, and depression. Using a sample of 127 adolescents with HFASD and their parents, this study is first to examine: (1) relations between organized activity (OA) involvement and adjustment and (2) whether these relations were moderated by social impairment and executive functions. Results indicated that greater intensity, breadth, and academic OA involvement were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. OA intensity was also associated with less loneliness. For adolescents with better emotional control, greater intensity was associated with better friendship quality. Results suggest that for adolescents with HFASD, more involvement in OA is associated with better socio-emotional adjustment even after accounting for risk factors.

AB Research on emotion regulation in East Asian children and adolescents is limited. One obstacle hindering the development of emotion regulation for East Asian children and adolescents is the lack of a culturally sensitive measure. To fill this gap, we have developed and validated the Emotional Cultivation Scale using samples of Taiwanese children and adolescents. In Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis (n = 341) identified two factors: Cultivating Emotion Strategies and Understanding Emotion Connotations. A confirmatory factor analysis (n = 358) confirmed this two-factor structure. Coefficient alpha s were .69 to .88 for Emotional Cultivation. Convergent validity was evidenced by positive associations with cognitive reappraisal and cognitive flexibility. Discriminant validity was supported by a nonsignificant association with suppression. Concurrent validity was revealed by positive associations with positive affect, basic psychological need satisfaction, gratitude, responsiveness from teachers, responsiveness from parents, and academic self-efficacy. Incremental validity was evidenced by the finding that emotional cultivation significantly accounted for an additional 2 to 20% of the variance in predicting cognitive flexibility, positive affect, basic psychological need satisfaction, gratitude, responsiveness from teachers, responsiveness from parents, and academic self-efficacy above and beyond cognitive reappraisal and suppression. Results from the multigroup analysis further indicated factor loading invariance and validity invariance between boys and girls and between elementary and middle schools. The factor structure was cross-validated by a clinical sample of Taiwanese children and adolescents (N = 161) and their parents in Study 2 (N = 159). The counseling implications were discussed.

AB Objective: To investigate whether food insecurity affects child body mass index (BMI) through parental feeding demandingness and/or responsiveness and dietary quality 18 months later among low-income Hispanic preschoolers.
   Design: Secondary analysis of data at baseline and 18 months afterward.
   Setting: Houston, TX.
   Participants: Hispanic parent-preschooler dyads (n = 137).
   Variables: Food insecurity (6-item Household Food Security Survey), child BMI (BMI z-score), child dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index), and parental feeding demandingness and responsiveness (Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire).
   Analysis: Ordinary least-squares regression models and 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate effects.
   Results: Controlling for baseline child BMI, maternal acculturation, and maternal BMI, total indirect effects of food insecurity on child BMI through feeding demandingness, responsiveness, and subsequent child dietary quality were estimated to be 0.001 (95% bias-controlled bootstrap CI, -0.01 to 0.01). Confidence intervals for all indirect pathways straddled 0. As food insecurity worsened, child dietary quality 18 months after baseline improved (c = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.41-1.71).
   Conclusions and Implications: Food insecurity had no influence on child BMI through feeding demandingness/responsiveness and/or child dietary quality. Additional research is needed to examine why food insecurity had a protective effect on dietary quality 18 months later. This finding suggests the adoption of coping mechanisms.

AB The goal of the present study was to empirically examine different conceptual mechanisms previously postulated to underlie the development of social avoidance in childhood. Participants were N=601 children (321 boys, 280 girls) attending elementary schools (M-age=10.21years) and middle schools (M-age=12.77years) in Shanghai, P.R. China. Measures of motivations for social withdrawal (shyness, unsociability, social avoidance) and socio-emotional adjustment were collected using self-reports and peer nominations at two time-points separated by 9months. Results from cross-lagged panel analyses indicated that: (1) social avoidance and symptoms of social anxiety were not reciprocally related over time; (2) Time 1 social avoidance predicted incremental change in Time 2 peer problems (whereas Time 1 peer problems did not predict incremental change in Time 2 social avoidance); and (3) Time 1 symptoms of depression significantly predicted incremental change in Time 2 social avoidance (whereas Time 1 social avoidance did not predict incremental change in Time 2 symptoms of depression). These results provide evidence in support of depressive symptoms (but not symptoms of social anxiety or peer problems) as a salient predictor of social avoidance. Results are discussed in terms of the development and implications of social avoidance in Chinese culture.

AB Developmental theory on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; e.g., self-cutting without lethal intent) underscores that stressful life experiences may lead to heightened risk for NSSI, potentially by undermining individuals' emotion coping capacities. Given that the transition to university is often accompanied by new stressors for emerging adults, it is possible that stressors experienced during the university years may lead to heightened susceptibility for NSSI during this developmental period. Cross-sectional research supports a positive association between stressful experiences and NSSI among students; however, longitudinal research is needed to examine the direction of effects and explore potential mediating factors (i.e., emotion dysregulation). In the present study, university students (N=1132; 70.5% female; mage=19.11) reported on their stressful experiences in university, difficulties in emotion regulation, and NSSI each year for three consecutive years. Path analysis revealed a bidirectional association between stressful experiences and NSSI. Increased stressful experiences predicted increased risk for NSSI through emotion dysregulation, and NSSI predicted increased stressful experiences through emotion dysregulation. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the processes through which NSSI may be initiated and maintained, as well as elucidate the impacts of NSSI on emotion regulation and stressful life experiences in university.

AB Objective: To examine a conceptual model of familial pathways to past-year polyvictimization. mediated by depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and emotional dysregulation for a large, national sample of sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA). Method: An online survey was completed by 1,177 SGMA (14-19 years old) who were enrolled in middle or high school. Latent class analysis was used to identify family classes based on family experiences of homoitranspositive microaffirmations. homo/transnegative microaggressions, violence, and nonviolent adversity. A single-indicator path model within a structural equation framework was used to examine pathways to polyvictimization. Results: A five-class solution based on these family-level indicators had the best fit: (a) high violence and adversity, (b) low microaffirming, high microaggressing, (c) high microaffirming with mean levels of violence and adversity, (d) high microaffirming, low microaggressing, and (e) baseline (i.e., below the mean on all family indicators). The path model explained 40.6% of polyvictimization variance. Direct pathways to polyvictimization were observed for three family classes (high violence and adversity; low microaffirming. high microaggressing: and high microaffirming with mean levels of violence and adversity). Higher levels of posttraumatic stress were the primary indirect pathway from these three family classes to a greater likelihood of past-year polyvictimization. Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress was the primary mechanism bridging family experiences of microaggressions, violence, and nonviolent adversity to polyvictimization. Addressing trauma symptoms related to these family experiences through school-based health services may have a beneficial impact on SGMA's risk for polyvictimization.

AB PurposeAfter treatment, pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) face emotional and behavioral challenges, perhaps due to tumor or treatment-related changes in brain structures involved in emotion regulation, including those with fronto-limbic connections. We hypothesized that relative to healthy controls (HCs), PBTS would exhibit greater difficulties with behavior and emotional functioning, and display reduced mean fractional anisotropy (mFA) in white matter tracts with fronto-limbic connections including the cingulum bundle (CB), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus(IFOF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF). We further predicted that mFA would account for variance in the relationship between group and emotional/behavioral outcome.MethodsEleven 8-16year old PBTS and 14 HCs underwent MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter microstructure. Tractography quantified mFA of selected tracts. Parents rated children's emotional and behavioral functioning.ResultsCompared to HCs, caregivers of PBTS reported poorer behavioral regulation and greater internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Relative to HCs, PBTS had lower mFA within the bilateral CB, IFOF, and UF (ds=0.59-1.15). Across groups, several medium-to-large correlations linked tract mFA and increased internalizing, externalizing, and poor behavioral regulation. Tract mFA also accounted for significant variance in the group-outcome association.ConclusionsReduced mFA in fronto-limbic associated tracts may be associated with reduced behavioral regulation following pediatric brain tumor. PBTS with treatment known to impact white matter may be most susceptible. Research with larger, longitudinal samples should clarify this relationship, allow for multiple mediators across time, and consider factors like tumor and treatment type.

AB Background: Maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment affect parenting and have consequences for a child's social-emotional development. Adolescent mothers have a higher frequency of a history of maltreatment than adult mothers. However few studies have analyzed the interactions between adolescent mothers with a history of childhood maltreatment and their infants.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment on mother-infant emotion regulation at infant 3 months, considering both infant and mother individual emotion regulation and their mutual regulation.
   Participants: Participants were 63 adolescent and young adult mother-infant dyads recruited at a hospital.
   Methods: The mothers were administered the Adult Attachment Interview to evaluate reflective functioning and attachment and the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse was used to evaluate maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment. Mother-infant interactions were coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver Engagement Phases.
   Results: Dyads with mothers with childhood maltreatment (vs dyads with mothers with no maltreatment) spent more time in negative emotional mutual regulation (p = .009) and less time in positive and neutral mutual emotion regulation (p = .019). Cumulative maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment were associated positively with mother and infant negative states at individual and dyadic level and with the AAI scales of Passivity and Unresolved Trauma (p < .05). The effect of cumulative maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment on mother infant emotion regulation was direct and not mediated by maternal attachment and reflective function.
   Conclusions: Maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment increase the risk connected to early motherhood, affecting mother-infant emotion regulation.

AB Insomnia is prevalent in adolescents. Although several insomnia scales/questionnaires are available to assess insomnia symptoms and severity for adults, no insomnia scale has been specifically developed for adolescents. This study assessed the psychometric properties of the Youth Self-Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS) in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. The YSIS consists of 8 items assessing insomnia symptoms, perceived sleep quality and insufficiency, and impaired daytime functioning. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. A sample of 11,626 adolescents in China completed the YSIS and a structured questionnaire to assess sleep duration, sleep problems, hypnotic use, and behavioral/emotional problems. A subsample of 242 adolescents completed retest questionnaire 2weeks later. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. The YSIS score ranged from 8 to 40 (M=19.1, SD=6.2). Internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.80 and 2-week test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.82. Both EFA and CFA yielded 2 dominant factors defined as insomnia symptoms (3 items) and daytime distress or impairment (5 items). The YSIS score was significantly correlated with short nocturnal sleep duration, depression, hypnotic use, sleep disordered breathing problems, restless legs syndrome, and daytime sleepiness. Similar results were obtained between male and female adolescents. The YSIS appears to be a simple, reliable and valid scale for assessing insomnia severity in adolescents. Further research is warranted to assess its psychometric properties with clinical samples and non-Chinese adolescents.

AB Emotion regulation impairments are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder and are believed to often underlie commonly seen problems with aggression, depression, and anxiety. The Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement program was developed to reduce emotion regulation impairment and thereby improve behavioral disturbance, via mindfulness. Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement consists of a 16-week individual therapy treatment targeting emotion regulation impairments among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. We describe the conceptual framework and development of the program and present data on feasibility and preliminary efficacy from a pilot trial. The Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement manual was developed using a participatory action framework, based on emotion regulation research specific to autism spectrum disorder and input from individuals with autism spectrum disorder, therapists, and parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement was piloted in a two-site open trial with 20 participants with autism spectrum disorder (12-17 years old, confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, IQ > 80).Outcome data support program feasibility and acceptability to participants, as well as significant improvement in emotion regulation impairments and related concerns.Findings offer preliminary support for both the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of the Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement program.

AB Background Psychotic experiences (PEs) such as paranoia and hallucinations, and negative symptoms (NS) such as anhedonia and flat affect are common in adolescence. Psychotic experiences and negative symptoms (PENS) increase risk for later psychiatric outcomes, particularly when they persist. The extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the stability of PENS in mid-to-late adolescence is unknown. Methods Using the Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) twice across similar to 9 months in adolescence, N = 1,448 twin pairs [M = 16.32 (0.68)] reported experiences of paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, grandiosity and anhedonia, and their parents reported on a range of NS. Individuals were split into low-scoring, decreasing, increasing and persistent groups for each subscale. Frequencies and mean differences in distress, depression traits and emotional problems were investigated across groups. Longitudinal structural equation modelling was used to estimate the aetiological components underlying the stability of PENS. Results Phenotypic stability was moderate for all PENS (r = .59-.69). Persistent PENS across 9 months were associated with greater levels of distress (V = 0.15-0.46, for PEs only), depression traits (d = 0.47-1.67, except grandiosity) and emotional problems (d = 0.47-1.47, except grandiosity and anhedonia) at baseline compared to groups with transitory or low levels of PENS. At both ages PENS were heritable and influenced by shared and nonshared environment. Genetic influences contributed 38%-62% and shared environment contributed 13%-33% to the stability of PENS. Nonshared environment contributed 34%-41% (12% for parent-rated NS). There was strong overlap of genetic and shared environmental influences across time, and lower overlap for nonshared environment. Imperfect stability of PENS was at least partly due to nonshared environmental influences. Conclusions When adolescent PENS persist over time, they are often characterized by more distress, and higher levels of other psychopathology. Both genetic and environmental effects influence stability of PENS.

AB Although childhood violence by any person is negative for children, little is known about whether violence by different family members is linked differently to problems in young adulthood, as family relationships might play different roles in children's individual development. In this study, we examine parent and sibling violence and associations with emotional and behavioral problems, directly and indirectly via peer victimization. We used retrospective reports from 347 young adults (aged 20-24) who all reported childhood family physical violence, and we performed a path analysis using Mplus. The results showed that participants who had been victimized by a sibling only or by both a sibling and parent were more likely to report peer victimization than were participants who had been victimized by parents only. Peer victimization was, in turn, linked to more aggression, criminality, and anxiety. Theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to explore whether several subgroups of athletes representing distinct emotional trajectories emerged from the person-centred analyses for a wide variety of positive and negative sport emotions (anger, anxiety, sadness, confidence, happiness, harmony, love and vitality). The present study also focused on the determinants of the emotional dynamics exploring whether athletes reporting distinct scores of emotional intelligence (EI) and emotional regulation (ER) at time 1 (T1) belonged to distinct trajectories. Design: A longitudinal three-wave measurement design (beginning, middle, and end of a competitive season) was used in the present study. Method: A sample of 325 adolescent athletes evolving in intensive training centres completed three self-reported questionnaires. Results: Results of latent class growth analyses (LCGA) demonstrated four trajectories for love and confidence, three trajectories for anger, harmony, happiness, sadness, and vitality, and two trajectories for anxiety. Furthermore, the likelihood of belonging to emotional trajectories was significantly influenced by EI and ER scores for love, confidence, anger, harmony, happiness, sadness and vitality. Conclusions: LCGA results highlighted the young athlete heterogeneity in longitudinal sport emotions and the predictive effects of ER and EI on their emotional trajectories. These results could be used to help coaches and sport psychologists to identify athletes at risk of developing dysfunctional emotional trajectories across the competitive season. Moreover, this study suggested potential benefits of EI and ER-centred interventions to help young elite athletes to experience adaptive emotional trajectories. Finally, these results highlighted that the heterogeneity in sport emotions must be accounted for in future research.

AB Although depressive disorders are among the most common disorders in youth, highly efficacious treatments for childhood affective disorders are lacking. There is significant need to better understand the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of depression in youth so that treatments can be targeted at optimal mechanisms. The aim of the current paper was to synthesize research on cognitive and neurobiological factors associated with youth depression, guided by De Raedt and Koster's model (2010) for vulnerability to depression in adults. Consistent with model predictions, there is evidence that attentional impairments are greatest in the context of negative information, relative to positive or neutral information, and some evidence that attentional deficits are associated with rumination in depressed youth. However, we found little evidence for the model's assumption that attentional bias is an etiological and maintenance factor for depression. There are several other model predictions that require additional study as current data are lacking. Overall, De Raedt and Koster's (2010) integrative cognitive and biological framework has tremendous potential to move the field forward in understanding the development of depression in youth. Additional longitudinal studies incorporating measures across biological and cognitive levels of analysis are needed.

AB Social relationships are of vital importance for children's and adolescents' development, and disruptions in these relationships can have serious implications. Such disruptions play a central role in both loneliness and social anxiety. Although both phenomena are closely related, they have largely been studied separately, and important questions have remained unanswered concerning how both go together within and across time. Multilevel meta-analyses were performed on 102 cross-sectional studies, published between 1981 and 2016, including 41,776 participants (39% males) with a mean age of 15.59 years. Longitudinal associations were examined in 10 studies, including 3,995 participants (46% males), using a novel technique that enables the examination of such associations even when these were not reported in the original empirical studies. Results indicated a strong, positive cross-sectional association between loneliness and social anxiety symptoms. This associations did not systematically differ in strength across childhood and adolescence. Moreover, results showed that loneliness and social anxiety symptoms were reciprocally associated over time. To conclude, loneliness and social anxiety symptoms are positively associated both within and across time, and across childhood and adolescence. Breaking this vicious cycle is of great importance, as both phenomena may be associated with profound problems in multiple domains of youth development. Moreover, failing to pay attention to both loneliness and social anxiety symptoms might substantially reduce the effectiveness of intervention programs focusing on either of the two.

DT Article
DE Gender-role attitudes; Adolescence; Quantitative; Mental health
ID MASCULINITY; IDEOLOGY
AB Purpose: There is evidence that traditional gender-role attitudes are associated with poor mental health outcomes in adults; however, few studies have examined associations among adolescents. We sought to test associations between gender-role attitudes and mental health among Australian adolescents.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, a nationally representative Australian study. Participants were 3,059 adolescents with complete data for Waves 5-6 (years 2012-2014, aged 12/13 and 14/15 years). Analyses were stratified by sex and controlled for parental education, household income, area socioeconomic position, ethnicity, religiousness, and household type. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to test associations.
   Results: Egalitarian gender-role attitudes were associated with fewer conduct problems for adolescent males (beta-.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] -.08 to .00; p = .048) and females (beta-.06, 95% CI -.11 to -.01; p = .014), and for females, less hyperactivity (beta-.15, 95% CI -.20 to -.09; p < .001), better prosocial behavior (beta.08, 95% CI .03 to .13; p = .003), and better overall mental health (beta-.27, 95% CI -.43 to -.11, p = .001). There were no associations for peer problems or emotional problems. Associations were more apparent for females than for males, and analyses using adolescent- and teacher-reported mental health supported the main findings.
   Conclusions: Egalitarian gender-role attitudes among adolescents are associated with better outcomes on some dimensions of adolescent mental health, suggesting that establishing egalitarian gender attitudes in adolescence could help impart mental health benefits among this population group.

AB The constant influx of refugees, including many unaccompanied minors, fuels the search for appropriate, tow-threshold, brief psychological interventions. Many refugees have suffered severe psychological trauma, thus calling for appropriate psychosocial intervention programs. Existing approaches largely focus on adults and those few that target adolescents are not adapted to unaccompanied minors who have an elevated risk for trauma-related symptomatology due to low levels of social support. The present pilot study evaluates the effectiveness of a brief, six-session, preventive resilience training for unaccompanied refugee minors. The program was offered to all residents of a refugee camp (no inclusion criteria). Participants (N = 55) were male minors from Afghanistan aged 14-17 years. Participants were randomized to either a wait-list control group or intervention groups. The intervention featured psychoeducation, development of personal and cultural resources, and emotion regulation strategies. Intervention groups were supported by translators. Symptoms of trauma-related disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder. depression, anxiety) were measured before (T1) and after (T2) intervention on validated and reliable screening instruments (Process of Recognition and Orientation of Torture victims in European Countries - PROTECT; Refugee Health Screener - RHS-15) as well as on several single-item questions including general well-being. Furthermore, interviews collected qualitative data from participants, group instructors, translators, and caretakers. Data from the interviews supported the overall success of the intervention in improving several fields of psychological functioning. Furthermore, the intervention group reported that their general well-being had increased across the intervention period on a postintervention period questionnaire. No such improvement was reported in the control group. PROTECT and RHS-15 data revealed a relatively high intensity of trauma-related symptoms in the whole sample. Contrary to expectations, there were no significant decreases in the PROTECT and RHS-15 measures, neither in the intervention nor the control group. This null result might be due to low statistical power. the nonindicative selection procedure, the group format, or the relatively short intervention duration. It is also plausible that an improvement of these symptoms requires a more trauma-focused intervention and/or an individual setting. Thus, the preventive resilience training described here can be seen as a stabilization program in that it seems to improve general functioning and well-being. As such it might also help in building a bridge toward more selective and intense, trauma-focused interventions. Study limitations include the small group sizes, the lack of a follow-up investigation (due to cross-over design), the restriction to only male participants, and the reliance on self-report data that may be subjective to social desirability effects.

AB The current study examined emerging adults' gender identity and its link with several gender-related and social outcomes, by using a novel dual-identity approach that was originally developed in children. Dutch emerging adults between 18 and 25 years old (N = 318, M-age = 21.73, SD = 2.02; 51% female) indicated their similarity to the own-gender group and the other-gender group to assess gender identity. They completed questionnaires assessing gender-typed behavior (internalized sexualization, toughness, emotional stoicism) and attitudes (i.e., sexism); friendship efficacy and ability; and social-emotional adjustment. Cluster analysis on the gender-identity items revealed four gender-identity types: (a) feeling similar to one's own gender, but not to the other gender (Own-GS); (b) feeling similar to both one's own and the other gender (Both-GS); (c) feeling dissimilar to one's own gender (Low-Own-GS); and (d) feeling similar to neither gender (Low-GS). Own-GS and Low-GS adults were most gender-typed in their behavior and showed sexist attitudes. Both-GS adults felt efficacious and were highly able to relate to both genders, whereas the other groups felt efficacious and were able to relate to only one gender (Own-GS, Low-Own-GS), or to neither gender (Low-GS). Low-Own-GS and Low-GS were least well-adjusted social-emotionally. Findings suggest that identifying with one's own gender is helpful for certain aspects of social-emotional adjustment but that also identifying with the other gender provides the advantage of flexible social and interpersonal skills and egalitarian gender attitudes.

AB Objectives: Internalizing mental health issues co-occur with pediatric chronic pain at high rates and are linked to worse pain and functioning. Although the field has prioritized anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, little is known about co-occurring depression and chronic pain in youth, despite its high prevalence. The purpose of this narrative review was to examine the existing literature on the co-occurrence of pediatric chronic pain and depressive disorders and symptoms and propose a conceptual model of mutual maintenance to guide future research. Methods: The literature from both fields of pediatric pain and developmental psychology were searched to review the evidence for the co-occurrence of pediatric chronic pain and depression. Conceptual models of co-occurring mental health issues and chronic pain, as well as child depression, were reviewed. From both literatures, we provide evidence for a number of proposed child, parent, and neurobiological factors that may serve to mutually maintain both conditions over time. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a conceptual model of mutual maintenance and highlight several areas for future research in this area. Results: Evidence was found for the prevalence of depression in pediatric chronic pain as well as the co-occurrence of both conditions. The key mutually maintaining factors identified and proposed included neurobiological, intrapersonal (eg, cognitive biases, sleep disturbances, emotion regulation, and behavioral inactivation), and interpersonal (eg, parent mental health and pain, genes, and parenting) factors. Discussion: Given the dearth of research on mutual maintenance in this area, this review and conceptual model could drive future research in this area.

AB Sensation seeking and emotion dysregulation have been identified as contributing factors for consequences associated with cannabis use, although findings have been mixed. The study seeks to clarify relations between sensation seeking, emotion dysregulation, and cannabis-related consequences. Cannabis users (N = 2,128) were assessed for facets of sensation seeking, emotion dysregulation, and cannabis-related consequences. Results revealed a positive association between risk seeking and cannabis-related consequences, as well as between emotion dysregulation and cannabis-related consequences. A negative association was observed between experience seeking and cannabis-related consequences. An interaction was found between emotion dysregulation and risk seeking. Risk seeking appears to be a risk factor for cannabis-related consequences at lower levels of emotion dysregulation. At high levels, the effect of emotion dysregulation superseded that of risk seeking. These findings have implications for the prioritization of clinical concerns in individuals seeking treatment for problematic cannabis use.

AB ObjectiveThe current study explored longitudinal family conflict predictors of adolescent depressive symptoms occurring during middle childhood.MethodsWe tested the mediating effects of mother-child and father-child conflict when children were in 6th grade on the relation between interparental conflict when children were in 5th grade and adolescent depressive symptoms when children were in 9th grade in a sample of 601 families enrolled in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development.ResultsFathers' reports of interparental conflict at 5th grade were related to greater mother-child and father-child conflict at 6th grade, and mothers' reports of interparental conflict at 5th grade were related to greater mother-child conflict at 6th grade. Further, greater mother-child conflict at 6th grade was related to greater adolescent depressive symptoms at 9th grade.ConclusionResults highlight the importance of understanding family system processes that unfold over time in predicting adolescent depressive symptoms.

AB Substance-naive offspring from high-density alcohol use disorder (AUD) families exhibit altered subcortical brain volumes structurally and altered executive-functioning and emotion-processing functionally, compared with their peers. However, there is a dearth of literature exploring alterations of cortical thickness (CTh) in this population. T1-weighted structural brain MRI was acquired in 75 substance-naive male offspring of treatment-seeking early onset (<25 years) AUD patients with high familial loading of AUDs (>= 2 affected relatives) (FHP) and 65 age-matched substance-naive male controls with negative family history from the community. Surface-based CTh reconstruction was done using FreeSurfer. Univariate general linear models were implemented at each vertex using SurfStat, controlling for age (linear and quadratic effects), and head size, to examine the main effect of familial AUD risk on CTh and its relationship with externalizing symptom score (ESS). A Johnson-Neyman procedure revealed that the main effect of familial AUD risk on CTh was seen during adolescence, where the FHP group had thicker cortices involving bilateral precentral gyri, left caudal middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral temporo-parietal junction, left inferior-frontal gyrus and right inferior-temporal gyrus. Thicker cortices in left MFG and inferior-parietal lobule were also associated with greater ESS within both groups. More importantly, these group differences diminished with age by young adulthood. Familial AUD risk is associated with age-related differences in maturation of several higher order association cortices that are critical to ongoing development in executive function, emotion regulation and social cognition during adolescence. Early supportive intervention for a delay in alcohol initiation during this critical phase may be crucial for this at-risk population.

ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; REAPPRAISAL; ADOLESCENCE; INTERVIEWS; MEMORY; YES; AGE
AB Emotion regulation (ER) flexibility involves switching between ER strategies to manage negative emotions, but the conditions under which children select a specific strategy or switch strategies are unclear. In prior work, adults who are instructed to use certain ER strategies have been shown to switch strategies more often and to favor emotional disengagement strategies such as distraction when negative emotions are more intense. This experimental study examined the developmental origins of ER strategy use patterns that support flexible ER. Children (N=181; 4-11 years of age; 91 girls) received no ER instructions (control) or were instructed to implement a specific cognitive strategy (distraction or reappraisal) while watching a negative emotional film. They self-reported their emotions multiple times and were later interviewed using open and close-ended questions about the ER strategies they used while watching the film. Results revealed that children described instructed strategies as well as other uninstructed strategies. Distraction was described more often when children reported negative emotion, suggesting early-emerging awareness of the utility of disengagement strategies for managing negative feelings. Reporting strategies consistent with instructions and descriptions of strategy switching were more common with felt negative emotion, but only for children who received specific ER instructions. The pattern of results was stronger for direct questions, suggesting that reliance on open-ended questioning about ER strategy use might not reveal the full extent of children's capabilities. Children's flexible ER strategy use emerges early, is related to intrapersonal aspects of emotion development, and should be considered in instructed ER paradigms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Early adolescence is a period of development of emotional competence, but also of increasing vulnerability for the onset of depressive symptoms. While literature underscored that empathy promotes social relationships and psychological well-being over the life course, the possible role of high empathy levels as a risk factor for depression has been under investigated, especially among early adolescents. Moreover, although parenting practices are known to influence both empathy and depression in adolescence, few studies investigated if parenting moderates the relationship between empathy and depression. Therefore, the aims of the study were: (1) to investigate the relationships between affective and cognitive empathy and depression; (2) to investigate the moderating role of perceived paternal and maternal support on the associations between affective and cognitive empathy and depression; (3) to examine if the relationships among affective and cognitive empathy, maternal and paternal support and depression vary as a function of early adolescents' gender. The study involved 386 Italian students aged between 12 and 14 (M age = 13, SD = 0.3, 47.9% girls) who completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire, including measures of cognitive and affective empathy, paternal and maternal support and depression. Results showed that with a mean level of affective and cognitive empathy, higher maternal support was related to lower depression for girls, whereas higher paternal support was related to lower depression for both boys and girls. Both maternal and paternal support moderated the relation between empathy and depression. In particular, maternal support moderated the non-linear relation between affective empathy and depression and the relation was further moderated by early adolescents' gender: boys with low affective empathy reported lower depression in a context of high maternal support. Paternal support moderated the linear relation between cognitive empathy and depression, independently of early adolescents' gender: boys and girls with high cognitive empathy reported higher depression in a context of low paternal support. The results of the study suggested that high empathy might be a risk factor for depression during early adolescence and mothers and fathers have a differential moderating role in relation to the affective and cognitive dimensions of empathy, also in relation to early adolescents' gender.

AB Introduction
   Research has recently focused on the relationships between working memory, negative affect (e.g., general anxiety, depressive symptoms) and personal assets (e.g., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency), and their influence on mathematics and reading literacy. Although these variables have been amply explored, previous research has usually considered each of these aspects in isolation.
   Method
   In the present study, 143 schoolchildren in sixth to eighth grade were tested on general anxiety, depressive symptoms, working memory, self-concept (academic and competence scales), ego-resiliency, and mathematics and reading literacy.
   Results
   Variance partitioning showed that all predictors, i.e., working memory, negative affect (i.e., general anxiety and depressive symptoms), and personal assets (i.e., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency) explained a unique and shared portion of the variance in mathematics and reading literacy.
   Conclusions
   Our findings point to the importance of investigating the relationship between these factors. Underlying implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Our understanding of the phenomenon of health anxiety in children and adolescents has expanded considerably in recent years. The role emotion regulation may play in the etiology of health anxiety has yet to be explored. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between self-reported health anxiety, emotion regulation, and associated constructs in children and adolescents. The sample was comprised of 79 children and adolescents between the ages of 7 to 15 years (mean age = 10.89 years; SD = 2.11). Participants completed a series of measures examining health anxiety, emotion regulation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression. Statistically significant associations were not observed between health anxiety and emotion regulation; however, some statistically significant associations were demonstrated between anxiety sensitivity and depression and emotion regulation. Statistically significant associations were observed between health anxiety and anxiety sensitivity. This investigation contributes to a more complete understanding of the factors that may or may not contribute to the etiology of health anxiety in children and adolescents. Our findings may be employed to develop evidence-based assessments and interventions for children and adolescents with elevated health anxiety.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) is a common and highly impairing psychiatric disorder that usually emerges in childhood or adolescence and is characterized by severe antisocial and aggressive behaviour. It frequently co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and often leads to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. CD affects similar to 3% of school-aged children and is twice as prevalent in males than in females. This disorder can be subtyped according to age at onset (childhood-onset versus adolescent-onset) and the presence or absence of callous-unemotional traits (deficits in empathy and guilt). The aetiology of CD is complex, with contributions of both genetic and environmental risk factors and different forms of interplay among the two (gene-environment interaction and correlation). In addition, CD is associated with neurocognitive impairments; smaller grey matter volume in limbic regions such as the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex, and functional abnormalities in overlapping brain circuits responsible for emotion processing, emotion regulation and reinforcement-based decision-making have been reported. Lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic reactivity to stress has also been reported. Management of CD primarily involves parent-based or family-based psychosocial interventions, although stimulants and atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used, especially in individuals with comorbid ADHD.

ID SELF-REPORT; GAMES; METAANALYSIS
AB Objective: To carry out and investigate the effectiveness of an emotional intelligence (EI) training based on the EI ability model, using videogames as experience-based learning tools to increase EI abilities in adolescents. Materials and Methods: A pre-/post-test/follow-up quasi-experimental design was used with an experimental and a control group (121 adolescents, 15.7% boys, mean age of 14.1 years). The training called "EmotivaMente" consisted of eight sessions lasting 1.5 hours each, conducted with six first-year classes of two Italian senior high schools. Data on emotional competences were collected at baseline, at the end of the training and 3 months later. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Students who participated in the EI training reported an improvement in the evaluation and expression of emotions in relation to the self (own emotions) compared with the control group, immediately after the training, but this difference did not persist at the follow-up (3 months later). Furthermore, EmotivaMente found an increase in the use of cognitive revaluation as a strategy of emotion regulation in the experimental group over time. Conclusions: EmotivaMente helped adolescents to improve emotional skills. Results confirmed that videogames can be useful to promote EI in adolescents at school, if integrated with a guided and assisted framework. Implication of the findings and recommendations for future research are made.

AB Objective/Background Rates of overweight/obesity and insufficient/delayed sleep are high among adolescents and are also unique risk factors for mood/behavior difficulties. This study aimed to evaluate relationships between sleep/circadian health and mood/behavior in a cohort of adolescents with overweight/obesity. Participants Twenty-two adolescents (16.4 +/- 1.1 years) with overweight/obesity attending high school completed in the study. Methods Participants completed one week of home sleep monitoring (actigraphy), questionnaires assessing chronotype (diurnal preference; Morningness/Eveningness Scale for Children) and mood/behavior (Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire), and had in-laboratory salivary melatonin sampling on a Thursday or Friday during the academic year. Results Linear regressions revealed later weekday bedtime and shorter weekday time in bed and sleep duration were associated with worse mood/behavior scores. Shorter duration of melatonin secretion and greater "eveningness" were also associated with worse mood/behavior scores. Conclusions Short and late sleep, shorter melatonin secretion, and eveningness chronotype are associated with worse mood/behavior symptoms in a cohort of adolescents with overweight/obesity. Clinicians should assess for both sleep and mood/behavior symptoms and further research is needed to evaluate the impact of improved sleep on mood/behavior in adolescents with overweight/obesity.

AB Parenting is a dynamic process, influenced by socio-cultural factors. It is an important contributing factor to child development and childhood psychopathology. Research investigating association between parenting styles and child outcome are limited in India. This paper aims to review studies conducted in West and in India in order to study cultural differences in parenting styles and its outcome. We found that despite hypothesized cultural differences between the West and India, the effect of parenting styles on children appear to be similar across culture, and culture did not serve as a moderator for parenting style and child outcome. An Authoritative parenting styles was associated with better outcome than authoritarian and neglectful/uninvolved parenting style in both Western countries and in India. Findings on indulgent/permissive parenting style were mixed in both Western countries and in India. The article discusses cultural shift in the parenting styles, and its implications for the future.

AB Background: Children who are severely dysregulated experience a range of concurrent and long-term impairments and psychopathology and are particularly at-risk for mood and anxiety disorders. The Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) may be useful in identifying children who are highly dysregulated, which could facilitate early intervention.
   Methods: We examined the prevalence, gender differences, parent-teacher agreement, and concurrent validity of two categorical definitions of the CBCL-DP in 348 children ages 6-12 who were clinic-referred for assessment and treatment because of disruptive behavior.
   Results: Rates of the CBCL-DP were 3 times higher when a less stringent versus a more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used (46.8% vs. 15.2%). Girls were more likely than boys to meet criteria for the CBCL-DP when the more stringent definition was used. Parent-teacher agreement was low, particularly when the more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used. Children with the CBCL-DP were rated by their parents, but not their teachers, as more impaired than other children, regardless of the definition of the CBCL-DP used, and even when compared to children with clinically elevated scores on other CBCL subscales.
   Limitations: Our cross-sectional data did not allow us to examine the predictive validity of the CBCL-DP, informant effects may have inflated associations between CBCL-DP and parent-rated impairment, and teacher ratings were missing for many children.
   Conclusions: Our findings support other reports that provide evidence that the CBCL-DP may identify a particularly symptomatic and impaired group of children with disruptive behavior, as rated by their parents.

AB Background: The present study examined the real-world effectiveness of a transdiagnostic prevention program, Super Skills for Life (SSL), among children with emotional problems in regular school settings. SSL is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), behavioral activation, and social skills training.
   Methods: Participants were 205 children, aged 8-12 years, who were referred by their teachers as having significant emotional problems. All the children completed measures of emotional and behavioral problems and self-esteem, both before and after participating in SSL, and at six months after the intervention. The children's parents and class teachers also completed a questionnaire that measures children's general difficulties and positive attributes. Children also gave a 2-minute speech task in front of the video in sessions 1 and 8.
   Results: There was agreement among self, parent, and teacher report, showing significant decreases of emotional symptoms from pretest to posttest and pretest to follow-up. Main effect of gender was significant for anxiety symptoms, emotional symptoms peer problems, and prosocial behavior. Video analysis of the 2-minute speech task showed significant improvement in length of eye gaze, vocal quality, length of speech, manifestation of comfort, and conversational flow. However, hypothesized increases in self-esteem did not act as a mediator of change in pre- to post-anxiety symptoms or social phobia subscale scores.
   Limitations: The present study used an open clinical trial design.
   Conclusions: This study provides initial support for the effectiveness of the manual-guided CBT for emotional problems in regular school settings when delivered by school services staff.

AB Background: Suicide among postpartum women is a new and emerging issue in developed countries. However, little is known about the combined effect of risk factors on self-harm ideation, although various risk factors have been found. The aim of this study is to examine the combined effect of maternal adverse childhood experiences and maternal age on self-harm ideation among postpartum women.
   Methods: The study comprised a cross-sectional study of 8074 mothers participating in a 3-month health checkup between September 2013 and August 2014 in City A, Prefecture A, Japan. Main outcome was self-harm ideation assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), item 10. Possible risk factors were maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), maternal characteristics, relationship with husband/partner (e.g., feelings when pregnancy was confirmed), household characteristics, child characteristics (e.g., age, sex, birth weight), and postpartum characteristics, and postpartum depression status other than self-harm ideation.
   Results: Postpartum women with 3 or more ACEs and younger age ( < 25 years old) were 10.3 times more likely than those with no ACEs and older age to have self-harm ideation (95%CI = 5.3-20.2). This combined effect was also found in first-time mothers (OR = 7.6, 95%CI = 3.2-17.9).
   Limitations: Study limitations are excluding an item on sexual abuse which is one of the ACEs, recall bias and information bias.
   Conclusions: Postpartum women with 3 or more ACEs and who were younger than 25 years old were at a high risk for self-harm ideation. Providing prevention strategies aimed at mothers with multiple risk factors, especially younger age and ACEs, is warranted.

AB Previous research has identified experiential avoidance (EA) as related to a host of adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as borderline personality disorder, suggesting that it is a crosscutting factor for adolescent psychopathology. It remains unclear whether EA differs among adolescents with BPD compared to adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and healthy adolescents. The aims of this study were to 1) examine EA in adolescents with BPD compared to non-BPD inpatient adolescents and healthy adolescents, and 2) to evaluate whether EA has a unique relationship to borderline pathology over and above internalizing and externalizing. Self-report measures of BPD features, EA, and psychopathology were completed by 692 adolescents (64.5% female, M-age= 15.20). This sample included a group of psychiatric inpatient youth (n = 197 BPD; n = 403 non-BPD) and a group of healthy adolescents (n = 92). Results revealed that EA differed significantly across all three groups, with the highest level of EA evidenced in adolescents who had BPD. Furthermore, there was a significant, unique association between BPD symptoms and EA over afnd above internalizing and externalizing pathology. These findings pinpoint EA as an important risk marker and possible target of prevention or intervention for adolescent BPD.

AB Mindfulness has been widely linked with psychological well-being in general population. There are emerging studies supporting the relationship between adolescents' mindfulness and their mental health. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness may influence adolescents' psychological distress have only recently been explored, and more related research is still needed. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents' dispositional mindfulness and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The mediating variables were also explored in perspective of two common emotion regulation theories, which were measured through Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). DERS has been used as a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation difficulties. ERQ is also widely accepted to measure the emotion regulation process including dimensions of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Measures assessing mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological distress were administered to 1067 adolescents in mainland China. The results confirmed that adolescents' dispositional mindfulness was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. DERS, especially the sub-dimensions of Acceptance and Strategies, significantly mediated the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Whereas, ERQ including subscales of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression exerted limited mediating effect. These findings provided insights for the potential underlying mechanism between adolescents' mindfulness and psychological distress, demonstrating that DERS might be more pervasive than ERQ. Further research was suggested to explore other mediating variables underlying mindfulness and psychological distress among adolescents and develop mindfulness-based programs to improve adolescents' mindfulness and emotion regulation ability.

AB BackgroundAdolescence is a period of elevated stress sensitivity, which places adolescents at increased risk of developing mental health problems such as burnout, depression, anxiety, and externalizing problems. Early intervention of psychological needs and low-threshold care addressing such needs may prevent this dysfunctional development. Schools may provide an important environment to identify and address psychological needs. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of low-threshold school-based skills-training programs promoting the mental health of adolescents and to examine moderators of the effectiveness.MethodsA Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of two school-based skills-training programs aiming to promote mental health by improving either skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills. A multi-informant (i.e., students, parents, and trainers) and multi-method (i.e., questionnaires and physiological measurements) approach will be used to assess program targets (skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills), direct program outcomes (performance or social anxiety) and mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, internalizing and externalizing problems, self-esteem and well-being), as well as specific moderators (i.e., student, parent and program characteristics, social support, perfectionism, stressful life events, perceived parental pressure, positive parenting behavior, treatment alliance and program integrity).DiscussionThe current study will provide information on the effectiveness of school-based skills-training programs. It is of crucial importance that the school environment can provide students with effective, low-threshold intervention programs to promote adolescents' daily functioning and well-being and prevent the emergence of mental health problems that negatively affect school performance.Trial registrationDutch Trial Register number NL7438.

AB Background
   Somatic symptoms and related disorders (SSD) are prevalent phenomena in the health-care system. Disturbances in emotion regulation (ER) are commonly observed in patients suffering from SSD.
   Objectives
   This review aimed to examine ER processes that characterize SSD by a systematic analysis of the available empirical studies.
   Data sources
   PsycINFO and PubMed databases for the articles published between January 1985 and June 2018.
   Search terms
   "emotion/al regulation" or "affect regulation" and various forms of SSD.
   Study eligibility criteria
   Empirical studies that a) assigned adolescent or adult patients suffering from SSD based on a clinical diagnosis, and b) examined the relationship between ER and SSD, were included.
   Study synthesis methods
   A tabular summary of the articles was generated according to study characteristics, study quality, variables, and findings. The findings were organized based on ER variables used in the articles and diagnoses of SSD, which were then re-organized under the main constituents of ER (attention, body, and knowledge).
   Results
   The findings of the 64 articles largely supported the association between SSD and disturbances in ER, which are usually shared by different diagnoses of SSD. The results indicate that patients show a reduced engagement with cognitive content of emotions. On the other hand, bodily constituents of ER seem to depict an over-reactive pattern. Similarly, the patients tend to encounter difficulties in flexibly disengaging their (spontaneous) attention from emotional material.
   Limitations
   There is a scarcity of longitudinal designs, randomized controlled trials, experiments, and diary studies suited to investigate the short-and long-term causal relationship between ER and SSD. Symptoms of SSD and measures to assess emotion regulation are heterogeneous.
   Conclusions and implications
   Assessment of ER processes is potentially useful to understand SSD and for treatment planning. Furthermore, a concurrent investigation of the dynamic interaction of the ER modalities promises insights for better understanding of the role of ER in development, course, and maintenance of SSD.

AB Background: The psychological well-being of parents and children is compromised in families characterized by greater parenting stress. As parental mindfulness is associated with lower parenting stress, a growing number of studies have investigated whether mindfulness interventions can improve outcomes for families. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions for parents, in reducing parenting stress and improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Methods: A literature search for peer-reviewed articles and dissertations was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in the PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses databases. Studies were included if they reported on a mindfulness-based intervention delivered in person to parents with the primary aim of reducing parenting stress or improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Results: Twenty-five independent studies were included in the review. Eighteen studies used a single group design and six were randomized controlled trials. Within-groups, meta-analysis indicated a small, post-intervention reduction in parenting stress (g = 0.34), growing to a moderate reduction at 2 month follow-up (g = 0.53). Overall, there was a small improvement in youth outcomes (g = 0.27). Neither youth age or clinical status, nor time in mindfulness training, moderated parenting stress or overall youth outcome effects. Youth outcomes were not moderated by intervention group attendees. Change in parenting stress predicted change in youth externalizing and cognitive effects, but not internalizing effects. In controlled studies, parenting stress reduced more in mindfulness groups than control groups (g = 0.44). Overall, risk of bias was assessed as serious.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions for parents may reduce parenting stress and improve youth psychological functioning. While improvements in youth externalizing and cognitive outcomes may be explained by reductions in parenting stress, it appears that other parenting factors may contribute to improvements in youth internalizing outcomes. Methodological weaknesses in the reviewed literature prevent firm conclusions from being drawn regarding effectiveness. Future research should address these methodological issues before mindfulness interventions for parents are recommended as an effective treatment option for parents or their children.

AB BackgroundMentalization Based Therapy (MBT) has yielded promising outcomes for reducing self-harm, although to date only one study has reported MBT's effectiveness for adolescents (Rossouw and Fonagy, J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 51:1304-1313, 2012) wherein the treatment protocol consisted of an intensive programme of individual and family therapy. We sought to investigate an adaptation of the adult MBT introductory manual in a group format for adolescents.MethodsThe present study is a randomised controlled single blind feasibility trial that aims to (1) adapt the original explicit MBT introductory group manual for an adolescent population (MBT-Ai) and to (2) assess the feasibility of a trial of MBT-Ai through examination of consent rates, attendance, attrition and self-harm. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine change over time in independent and dependent variables between groups, and multi level models (MLM) were conducted to examine key predictors in relation to change over time with self-report self-harm and emergency department presentation for harm as the primary outcome variables.ResultsFifty-three young people consented to participate and were randomised to MBT-Ai + TAU or TAU alone. Five participants withdrew from the trial. Trial procedures seemed appropriate and safe, with acceptable group attendance. Self-reported self-harm and emergency department presentation for self-harm significantly decreased over time in both groups, though there were no between group differences. Social anxiety, emotion regulation, and borderline traits also significantly decreased over time in both groups. Mentalization emerged as a significant predictor of change over time in self reported self harm and hospital presentation for self-harm.ConclusionsIt was feasible to carry out an RCT of MBT-Ai for adolescents already attending NHS CAMHS who have recently self-harmed. Our data gave signals that suggested a relatively brief group-based MBT-Ai intervention may be a promising intervention with potential for service implementation. Future research should consider the appropriate format, dosage and intensity of MBT for the adolescent population.Trial registrationNCT02771691; Trial Registration Date: 25/04/2016.

AB The objective of the present study was to analyze the extent to which violent peer behavior and victimization, both traditional and cybernetic, and predict certain indicators of psychological maladjustment in adolescents, such as self-concept, satisfaction with life, feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, social anxiety, empathy, and emotional intelligence. Participants in the study were 1318 adolescents of both sexes, aged between 11 and 18 years and enrolled in Compulsory Secondary Education schools. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The results indicated that the victims generally present greater maladjustment than the aggressors. Both victims and cybervictims showed a greater decrease in all the dimensions of self-concept, compared with aggressors and cyberaggressors. However, the two types of aggressors showed a higher likelihood of presenting low levels of empathy. Feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, and degree of life satisfaction was more probable to be present in all groups of aggressors and victims. Finally, with regard to emotional intelligence, victims had a higher probability of obtaining low scores in all the dimensions of this construct; this was the case for traditional aggressors only in the dimension of emotion regulation. These results contribute to our understanding of the consequences of harassment in the adaptation of the students involved, with relevant practical implications.

AB Background and aims: Clinicians and researchers are increasingly interested in investigating excessive use of video gaming recently named Internet gaming disorder (IGD). As is the case with extensively researched adolescent problem behaviors such as substance use disorder, several studies associate IGD with the young person's family environment and the parent-adolescent relationship in particular. Evidence-based treatments for a range of adolescent clinical problems including behavioral addictions demonstrate efficacy, the capacity for transdiagnostic adaptation, and lasting impact. However, less attention has been paid to developing and testing science-based interventions for IGD, and at present most tested interventions for IGD have been individual treatments (cognitive behavioral therapy). Methods: This article presents the rationale for a systemic conceptualization of IGD and a therapeutic approach that targets multiple units or subsystems. The IGD treatment program is based on the science-supported multidimensional family therapy approach (MDFT). Following treatment development work, the MDFT approach has been adapted for IGD. Results: The article discusses recurring individual and family-based clinical themes and therapeutic responses in the MDFT-IGD clinical model, which tailors interventions for individuals and subsystems within the young person's family. Discussion and conclusions: Basic science developmental research can inform conceptualization of IGD and a systemic logic model of intervention and change. This paper aims to expand treatment theorizing and intervention approaches for practitioners working with frequently life-altering behaviors of excessive Internet gaming. We operationalize this aim by addressing the question of why and how parents should be involved in youth IGD treatment.

AB Purpose The principal objective of this study was to determine whether insecure attachment leads to narcissistic entitlement/proactive criminal thinking versus cognitive impulsivity/reactive criminal thinking. It was predicted that insecure attachment would predict narcissistic entitlement but not cognitive impulsivity and that this effect would be mediated by peer delinquency.
   Methods Participants were 1700 (868 boys, 832 girls) members of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Child-mother attachment was assessed with a Q-sort completed by the child's mother when the child was 3 years old. Attachment sorts were organized into a latent factor score and correlated with measures of adolescent-reported narcissistic entitlement and cognitive impulsivity at age 15.
   Results Findings from a linear regression analysis revealed that insecure attachment at age 3 predicted narcissistic entitlement but not cognitive impulsivity at age 15, controlling for the effects of race, gender, household income, family structure, maternal bonding, peer delinquency, and participant delinquency. A second analysis showed that maternal ratings of peer delinquency when the child was 9 years old mediated the relationship between age 3 insecure attachment and age 15 narcissistic entitlement.
   Conclusions The current results suggest that insecure attachment is directly and indirectly (via delinquent peer associations) linked to narcissistic entitlement, a facet of proactive criminal thinking.

AB Violence exposure increases teens' risk for emotion dysregulation, anxiety, depression, and aggression towards peers. Teens of color are disproportionately more likely to be exposed to violence and less likely to receive mental health services. Community after-school programs can help reduce disparities by offering opportunities for skills development and mental health promotion to mitigate risk associated with violence exposure. The present study explores the promise of a parks-based after-school paid internship program for black and Latinx teens with weekly, group-based enrichment to promote educational attainment, job skills, and health behaviors. University and park administrators collaborated to design a program comprised of paid work (10 hr/week at US$9.05/hr) and weekly 2 hr enrichment (e.g., job skills, meditation, and sleep health psychoeducation). The sample includes 38 youth (n = 38; 15-17 years old [M = 16.26, SD = .73]; 42.1 per cent female; 95.2 per cent non-Latinx black, 4.8 per cent Latinx white). Data analyses include pre-/post-measures of violent and nonviolent adversity, emotion regulation, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy to manage peer conflict. There were no significant changes from Time 1 (T1) to Time 2 (T2) in teen-reported cognitive reappraisal, emotion suppression, anxiety, depression, or self-efficacy to resolve peer conflict. Teens with more violence exposure at T1 reported significant reductions in anxiety at T2. Teens with more overall adversity reported significant reductions in anxiety and improvements in self-efficacy to resolve peer conflict. Findings indicate that after-school programs infused with poly-strengths programming can benefit diverse teens at high risk for violence exposure.

AB Objective: Emotion regulation difficulties (ERD) such as anger, irritability and frustration intolerance leading to severe functional losses may be observed in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this study was to compare children and adults diagnosed with ADHD and a healthy control group in terms of emotion regulation characteristics and to examine factors potentially associated with ERD.
   Methods: The study was performed with 72 children/adults aged 6-18 diagnosed with ADHD based on DSM-V diagnostic criteria at the Namik Kemal University Medical School of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Polyclinic, Turkey, and 30 healthy controls. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), a semi-structured interview form, was used to determine comorbidities. ERD scores (ERD=attention+anxiety/depression+aggression sub scales) were determined using the Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Mean ERD scores were 189.45 +/- 19.33 in the ADHD group and 164.13 +/- 9.94 in the healthy control group. A significant difference was determined in ERD scores between the two groups (p<0.001**). When the ADHD group was evaluated in terms of clinical characteristics, comorbid psychiatric disorders were not associated with ERD, but combined type ADHD characteristics emerged as significant predictors for ERD (p=0.011*).
   Conclusions: The results of this research revealed significantly greater ERD in individuals diagnosed with ADHD compared to healthy controls, and that combined type ADHD is a predictor for ERD. Since ERD accompanying ADHD lead to greater function loss in the individual and are associated with persistence of the disorder in adulthood, these are important clinical characteristics also requiring evaluation during the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.

AB Background: Mental health in adolescents has become a major public health issue. This study examined school experiences in relation to mental health (emotional problems and conduct problems) from early to middle adolescence.
   Methods: This longitudinal 3-year follow up study used data from the Swedish Study of Health in School Children in Umea. Analyses were conducted in 1379 participants that were attending grade six in 2003 or 2006 (age 12 years). KIDSCREEN-52 was used to assess school experiences and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for emotional and conduct problems. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA and multiple linear regressions.
   Results: Positive school experiences decreased while emotional and conduct problem scores increased from grades six to nine. Positive school experiences were negatively associated with emotional and conduct problem scores and contributed to the explanation of mental health scores in middle adolescence after controlling for background factors. When baseline mental health problem scores were taken into account the association with early school experiences disappeared (except for conduct problems in boys). However, incorporating concurrent school experiences in the analysis increased the levels of explanation for emotional and conduct problem scores further. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that school experiences are linked to emotional and conduct problems. That link may be stronger for conduct problems. In addition, the association of school experiences in early adolescence with later mental health may be overridden by concurrent school experiences in middle adolescence.

AB Schools are increasingly being identified as ideal settings for early intervention for anxiety and other mental health challenges; however, questions remain about whether individuals who require the most assistance will receive it in more universally applied intervention programs. This study compared targeted and universal delivery approaches of a social and emotional learning intervention for anxiety, using a mixed-methods approach. 66 upper primary aged children (50.9% male) completed a brief mindfulness-based group program, with 46 students in the universal group. The remaining participants (n = 20) were part of the targeted group, selected because they were deemed 'at risk' of social and emotional maladjustment. Significant improvements in mean anxiety scores were found for the targeted group and a subset of the universal group, who reported elevated anxiety pre-program, but not for the universal group as a whole. Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews indicated positive experiences from both methods of delivery. These results indicate that a universal delivery is appropriate for social and emotional learning programs, providing opportunities for the greatest number of students, while also supporting those students who were experiencing more significant levels of anxiety.

AB Adolescence represents one of the most crucial periods of human brain development. This unique neurodevelopmental window involves a complex interplay of synaptic re-modelling, the establishing of cortical and sub-cortical emotional processing and cognitive neural circuits along with a greater propensity for engaging in risky behaviours and experimentation with illicit drugs. A growing body of both clinical and pre-clinical evidence has demonstrated that exposure to cannabis, and more specifically, Lambda-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, can strongly increase the likelihood of developing serious neuropsychiatric disorders in later life. Adolescent THC exposure is linked to long-term cognitive impairments, emotional dysregulation, mood disorders and increased vulnerability to schizophrenia. The interplay between adolescent THC exposure and mental health risks have been linked to a wide array of underlying neurobiological pathologies, including structural and morphological alterations in brain circuits linked to cognitive function and emotional regulation. Despite this growing body of data, there remains considerable confusion and misinformation regarding how and why adolescent cannabis use can ultimately increase these psychopathological risk factors. Nevertheless, the confluence of clinical and pre-clinical neuroscience research related to these questions is finally providing much needed insight into the relative risks and identifying useful biomarkers that may ultimately allow us to establish more reliable criteria and guidelines for safer cannabis access and help mitigate these risks to mental health.

AB Evidence suggests that the timing of sleep (chronotype) impacts mental health in young people, but previous studies have not accounted for sleep duration or school start time in this association, or examined a broad range of mental outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between chronotype and mental health in a representative sample of adolescents from the 2014 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey (29,635 students, 362 schools). We examined positive and negative aspects of mental health, using scores for emotional problems (range 0-33), emotional well-being (0-22), behavioural problems (0-28) and prosocial behaviours (0-25). We estimated chronotype using the time of mid-sleep on weekends and examined the associations using multilevel regressions, adjusted for sleep duration, school start time, individual, family and geographic characteristics. The average time of mid-sleep (chronotype) was 04:11hr. An hour delay in mid-sleep time was associated with more emotional problems (0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.23, 0.45] point higher score), more behavioural problems (2.0% [95% confidence interval 1.4%, 2.6%] higher score), less emotional well-being (0.19 [95% confidence interval 0.09, 0.20] point lower score), and fewer prosocial behaviours (0.18 [95% confidence interval 0.08, 0.29] point lower score). A later chronotype was associated with poorer mental health, independent of sleep duration and school start time, and across internalizing and externalizing mental health domains. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this association. The timing of sleep, and not just its duration, may be an additional consideration for youth mental health.

SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Introduction Improving mental healthcare for adolescents is a global policy priority. Despite demands for community-based services, many adolescents require more intensive interventions, such as an inpatient admission. This is typically at a point of crisis, often accompanied by intense emotional dysregulation, impairment of coping function and impulsivity. However, limited evidence exists on how best to support this group while they are in inpatient care, aside from pharmacological treatments which have a limited role in adolescents. Little is known about the models of care (MoC) offered in inpatient units, whether adolescents perceive these as helpful and the perspectives of caregivers and clinicians. Here, we describe a protocol which aims to explore and evaluate an inpatient MoC.
   Methods and analysis We designed a longitudinal, mixed-methods, case study. The population consists of adolescents, caregivers and clinicians at a single inpatient unit in Melbourne, Australia. Standardised outcome measures, including semi-structured interviews, will be administered to adolescents at three time-points, T1 (admission), T2 (discharge) and T3 (6 months post discharge). Caregivers will also be interviewed at T1, T2 and T3. Clinicians will be interviewed once. The measures include: Life Problems Inventory, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Youth Self-Report. Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents will be collected at T1 and T2. Quantitative analysis will include descriptive statistics and paired t-tests summarising adolescents admitted to the unit, clinical characteristics and longitudinal data on symptomatology. Qualitative data will be analysed using both thematic and trajectory analysis. Data collection began in May 2017 and will cease with T3 interviews by October 2018.

AB Purpose Victimization by peers is known to have a detrimental effect on emotional and educational adjustment. Yet, there is also a sparser research literature on the potential negative effects of peer victimization on physical health. Our purpose was to draw from meta-analyses and studies of peer victimization and physical health (including psychosomatic symptoms, sleep, and body weight) to highlight key findings and future directions in the area. We also briefly summarize research findings that associate peer victimization with stress physiology. Method Narrative research summary. Results Peer victimization is associated with poorer physical health among youth, including more somatic complaints (e.g., health concerns, pain) and disrupted sleep. Also, victimized youth are at more risk than other youth for increasing weight problems. These effects seem to be both immediate and long-term, with associations found into later adolescence and even adulthood. Conclusion Future directions for research are proposed that take a biopsychosocial perspective, by integrating the domains of physiology, mental health, and physical health, in order to test holistic models that better illuminate the negative effects of peer victimization. Additionally, future research should continue to address potential mechanisms, such as neurophysiological reactions and recovery from stressful events.

AB Background The relationship between emotion regulation deficits and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is well established. Many studies have documented the strong relationship between NSSI and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The relationship between emotion regulation deficits and suicide is less understood, but recent studies indicate a moderate association. This study aimed to examine the relationship between emotion regulation deficits, NSSI behavior, and suicide ideation in an unselected community sample of adolescents. It was expected that NSSI history would moderate the relationship between emotion regulation and future suicide ideation. Methods Data were collected from 367 unselected, community adolescents (mean age = 13). Self-report questionnaires assessed NSSI behavior, emotion regulation deficits, and suicide ideation at two time points, 6 months apart. Results After controlling for suicide ideation at baseline, emotion regulation deficits (experiential avoidance and interoceptive deficits) significantly predicted suicide ideation severity at follow-up, and interactions with NSSI engagement showed support for moderation. Conclusions Results of this study provide insight into the mechanisms of these relationships and have significant clinical implications for the identification of adolescents at risk for suicide behaviors.

AB Introduction The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between resilience and suicidal ideation, with coping strategies regarded as a mediator. Methods A total of 422 Hong Kong undergraduate students were recruited with convenience sampling. Results Simple linear regression was used to verify the negative relationship between resilience and suicidal ideation (P < 0.001). The results revealed that two out of four tested mediation models were accepted, with the coping strategies of approach and reappraisal acting as mediators (P < 0.001); the other two models were rejected when the coping strategies of emotional regulation and avoidance were the mediators. Regression analysis was performed to explore the effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation in terms of the reappraisal coping strategy and the approach coping strategy, and the results indicated that the reappraisal coping strategy had greater effects than the approach coping strategy. Discussion Overall, the results of this study confirmed previous findings in the literature that resilience can alleviate the degree of suicidal ideation. Additionally, these results suggest further implications that adopting the approach and reappraisal coping strategies might make significant contributions to reducing the number of suicidal cases in society.

AB Existing literature has demonstrated an association between higher adolescent religiousness and lower risk-taking via higher self-regulation. This study sought to elucidate the roles of emotion regulation and executive function as parallel mediators in the link between religiousness and risk-taking in a sample of 167 adolescents (mean age = 14.13 years, 52% male, 82% White at Time 1). Longitudinal results across three waves utilizing structural equation modeling indicated higher religiousness was associated with higher emotion regulation, whereas religiousness was not associated with executive function. Subsequently, higher emotion regulation and executive function were associated with lower risk-taking. Emotion regulation mediated the association between religiousness and risk-taking. The findings highlight religiousness as a contextual protective factor for adolescents.

AB Childhood exposure to parental threatening behaviors places adolescents at greater risk for depression. However, the association between parental threatening behaviors and depressive symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient youth, and potential factors that exacerbate the harmful effects of such parenting, have remained unexplored. One factor that may contribute to depression is low emotional clarity, which is characterized by difficulties recognizing and understanding ones emotions. The current investigation examined the interactive effects of childhood exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and emotional clarity deficits in relation to depressive symptoms among inpatient psychiatric youth who had been exposed to a potentially traumatic event (i.e., exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence). Participants (N = 50, M-age = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51, range 12-17) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, childhood exposure to maternal threatening behavior, and depressive symptoms. A significant interaction was found between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and deficits in emotional clarity in relation to depressive symptom severity. Greater exposure to maternal threatening behaviors was related to more severe depressive symptoms, yet only among children with greater deficits in emotional clarity. Findings underscore the need for interventions that target emotional clarity among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threats.

AB Objectives The purpose of the study is to explore the prevalence and predictors of not engaged in education, employment or training (NEET) status in a multicultural young adult population in Northern Norway.
   Design and setting The longitudinal design link a self-reported survey (2003-2005) with an objective registry linkage follow-up 8-10 years later.
   Participants Of all 5877 tenth graders (aged 15-16 years) in Northern Norway, 83% of the total age cohort from all 87 municipalities participated in the baseline survey. The follow-up studies consisted of 3987 consent giving adolescents (68%), were 365 (9.2%) reported indigenous Sami ethnicity.
   Outcome measures Youth NEET at the age of 23-25 years.
   Methods Explanatory variables were sociodemographic factors (gender, ethnicity, residency, parental education), mental health problems and musculoskeletal pain in adolescence. Outcome variable characterised as NEET-status was defined by no educational engagement, long-term recipient of sickness benefit, medical and non-medical benefit receipt or long-term unemployment.
   Results NEET-status in young adulthood was significantly higher among females (20.9%) than among males (16.2%). Ethnic differences occurred as being NEET among Sami males was significantly higher than among non-Sami males, 23.0% and 15.2% respectively. Minority Sami females experienced NEET-status to a lower degree (16.6%) than non-Sami females (20.8%). Among females adolescent peer problems (adjusted OR=1.09) and hyperactivity problems (adjusted OR=1.10) were associated with later NEET-status. Peer problems (adjusted OR=1.23), conduct problems (adjusted OR=1.17) and musculoskeletal problems (adjusted OR=1.15) in male adolescents were associated with later NEET-status, whereas emotional problems among males predicted significantly less later NEET-status (adjusted OR=0.88). We found lower parental education to be significantly associated with being NEET-later in young adults (females: adjusted OR=2.11, males: adjusted OR=3.22).
   Conclusions To address the disengagement of education and work, particular emphasis must be placed on supporting young people struggling with mental and physical health problems.

AB Children with familial risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) have elevated risk for developing depression as adolescents. Here, we investigated longitudinally whether resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) could predict the onset of MDD. In this pilot study, we followed a group of never-depressed children with familial risk for MDD and a group of age-matched controls without familial risk who had undergone an MRI study at 8-14 years of age. Participants were reassessed 3-4 years later with diagnostic interviews. We first investigated group differences in RSFC from regions in the emotion regulation, cognitive control, and default mode networks in the children who later developed MDD (converted), the children who did not develop MDD (nonconverted), and the control group. We then built a prediction model based on baseline RSFC that was independent of the group differences to classify the individuals who later developed MDD. Compared with the nonconverted group, the converted group exhibited hypoconnectivity between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and between left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The nonconverted group exhibited higher sgACC-IPL connectivity than did both the converted and control groups, suggesting a possible resilience factor to MDD. Classification between converted and nonconverted individuals based on baseline RSFC yielded high predictive accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity that was superior to classification based on baseline clinical rating scales. Intrinsic brain connectivity measured in healthy children with familial risk for depression has the potential to predict MDD onset, and it can be a useful neuromarker in early identification of children for preventive treatment.

AB The present study investigated whether specific trait mindfulness facets indirectly influenced state negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and physiological hyperarousal (PH) through state rumination and state experiential avoidance. Participants (n = 360, 68% female) rated trait mindfulness facets, then completed an interview task about life experiences intended to elicit state NA, PA, and PH. After the interview task, participants completed measures of state NA, PA, and PH, and state measures of rumination and experiential avoidance. Indirect effect results indicated that the relationships between Nonjudge, Nonreact, and Describe, and each of the state tripartite components indirectly flowed through state rumination. Further, there was a significant indirect effect of Nonjudge and Actaware on each of the three state tripartite components through experiential avoidance. Overall, strengthening the mindfulness skills of Nonjudge, Nonreact, Describe, and Actaware may have positive downstream effects via reducing reliance on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as rumination or experiential avoidance.

AB Although anger tends to lead to aggressive behavior, the underlying processes that moderate this relationship are largely unknown. Our aim with this study was to explore the relationship between adolescents' online anger and cyber aggression and the moderating effect of seeking online social support. Participants were 509 Chinese adolescents who completed anonymous questionnaires about seeking social support, online anger, and online aggression. Cyber aggression had a significant negative correlation with seeking social support and a significant positive correlation with online anger. This direct association between online anger and cyber aggression was moderated by seeking social support online, such that the positive relationship between online anger and cyber aggression was significant only among adolescents low in seeking online social support. These results suggest that seeking online social support can mitigate cyber aggression among adolescents in the context of mild online anger.

AB The family environment in childhood has a strong effect on mental health outcomes throughout life. This effect is thought to depend at least in part on modifications of neurodevelopment trajectories. In this exploratory study, we sought to investigate whether a feasible resting-state fMRI metric of local spontaneous oscillatory neural activity, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), is associated with the levels of children's family coherence and conflict. Moreover, we sought to further explore whether spontaneous activity in the brain areas influenced by family environment would also be associated with a mental health outcome, namely the incidence of behavioral and emotional problems. Resting-state fMRI data from 655 children and adolescents (6-15years old) were examined. The quality of the family environment was found to be positively correlated with fALFF in the left temporal pole and negatively correlated with fALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex. Remarkably, increased fALFF in the temporal pole was associated with a lower incidence of behavioral and emotional problems, whereas increased fALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with a higher incidence.

AB Background: Typically, we try to protect our own bodies and this is supported by internal representations that specify one's body identity, spatial parameters, and bodily sensations, but in self-harm the body becomes the target. First acts of self-harm are typically reported in adolescence. At this age, the body also becomes more salient to one's self-concept. It may be possible that disturbances in representations of one's own body and its sensations contribute to self-harm.
   Methods: To investigate these links, we conducted a systematic review critically examining the potential role of body representation and sensation disturbances in self-harm (non-suicidal or suicidal) in adolescents and young adults (12-25 years).
   Results: The search strategy identified 64 studies (275,183 participants) and overall, young people engaging in self-harm reported greater levels of body dissatisfaction, body disownership, and deficits in the experience and evaluation of bodily sensations compared to non-injuring control groups; however, there was subscale variability and gender differences.
   Conclusion: Our results emphasise the strong link between body representations and self-protection, as well as a need for investigating self-harm interventions that take body image and awareness into account.

AB Flourishing is an indicator of positive mental health and is important for children's development and well-being. We used variables from the National Survey of Children's Health 2016 as indicators of flourishing (difficulty making friends, is bullied, bullies others, shares ideas with family, argues, finishes tasks, does all homework, shows curiosity, stays calm, and cares about doing well in school) to compare differences in parent perceptions of their children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We anticipate that these findings will help identify intervention targets to support the well-being of individuals with ASD. Children between 6 and 17 years of age, without intellectual disability, brain injury, cerebral palsy, or Down syndrome were included. Total participants were 34,171 controls (male/female = 17,116/17,155) and 812 with ASD (male/female = 668/144). Factor analysis resulted in three-factor structures (social competence, behavioral control, and school motivation) with good model fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.08, comparative fit index = 0.92, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.89). The multivariate regression model and propensity score with inverse probability of treatment weighting (PS-IPTW) method revealed that children with ASD had lower scores in the social competence and behavioral control factors compared to the control group (all P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the school motivation factor between the two groups (P > 0.05) in both multivariate regression model and PS-IPTW method. Findings suggest that social competence and behavioral control are indicators of flourishing and are important intervention targets to increase flourishing among children with ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 952-966. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Flourishing is an indicator of positive mental health and is important for children's development and well-being. We used variables from The National Survey of Children's Health 2016 to examine differences in parent perceptions of the indicators of flourishing (difficulty making friends, is bullied, bullies others, shares ideas with family, argues, finishes tasks, does all homework, shows curiosity, stays calm, and cares about doing well in school) between children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We anticipate that this information will help to identify therapeutic targets to support the well-being of individuals with ASD. Children between 6 and 17 years old, without intellectual disability (ID), brain injury (BI), cerebral palsy (CP), or Down syndrome (DS) were included. From the total (N = 50,212), we excluded children under age 6 (n = 14,494), those who once, but do not currently have ASD (n = 81), and those with ID (n = 432), BI (n = 170), CP (n = 35), and DS (n = 17), resulting in 34,983 records used. Total participants, age 6-17 years, were 34,171 controls (male/female = 17,116/17,155) and 812 with ASD (male/female = 668/144). Factor analysis resulted in the identification of three flourishing categories among the indicator variables (social competence, behavioral control, and school motivation). Children with ASD had lower scores in the social competence and behavioral control factors compared to the control group. However, there were no significant differences in the school motivation factor between the two groups.
   Findings suggest that social competence and behavioral control are indicators of flourishing and are important intervention targets to increase flourishing among children with ASD.

AB Although past research has provided important information about the relationship between attachment and mental health during the period of adolescence, the role of intervening variables in this association has been neglected. The aim of the present study was to illuminate the association between adolescents' secure attachment to parents and mental health, i.e., emotion regulation and depression, and to focus on the mediating role of language use operationalized by the gap between experience and language. Three-hundred seventy-four adolescents (220 females, 154 males) participated in the study. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results provided support for the intervening role of language use and it was further shown that the relationship between language use and depression is mediated by emotion regulation. Language use and emotion regulation are potential mediators between attachment to parents and depression. The effects of problematic attachment experiences on attachment might be intervened by focusing on language use of adolescents, which in turn could improve insight.

AB VR-based paradigms could substantially increase the ecological validity of various psychological research topics as VR allows for submerging into real-life experiences under controlled laboratory conditions. In particular, in the field of mnemonic research, concerns have been raised that laboratory memory differs significantly from real-life autobiographical memory. Our study aimed to assess the immersive qualities of VR not only upon application but -more importantly- during the retrieval of the virtual experiences subsequent to a VR session. We presented participants with either a 360 degrees VR or a 2D video of a motorcycle ride followed by an unannounced recognition memory task 48h later. Increased retrieval success and delayed reaction times in the VR group indicate that immersive VR experiences become part of an extensive autobiographical associative network, whereas the conventional video experience remains an isolated episodic event.

TI Danish norms for the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
SO DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; CHILDREN; VERSION
AB INTRODUCTION: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief well-validated psychometric instrument for assessment of developmental, behavioural and emotional problems in children and adolescents. Versions of the questionnaire covering the 2-17-year age range are answered by parents and by pedagogues or teachers. Also, a self-report version can be used from the age of 11 years. The SDQ is well-accepted by informants and is increasingly preferred both internationally and in Denmark for research and evaluation purposes. The questionnaire is also well-suited for clinical use, especially in the primary sector. However, no comprehensive set of Danish norms has been available before this study.
   METHODS: Data from an extensive survey in a Danish municipality was used to generate national norms for SDQ scores. These norms were compared with British and Nordic population data.
   RESULTS: Across informants, threshold values show some variation with age and often differ between sexes. Therefore, norms are provided both with and without gender stratification. Similarities as well as differences were found between the Danish norms and materials from other countries. The differences may, to some extent, be attributable to methodological issues.
   CONCLUSION: We expect that the availability of Danish SDQ norms will further stimulate the use of the instrument.

AB Introduction. The short Prefrontal Symptoms Inventory (PSI-20) is a questionnaire that investigates symptoms of prefrontal malfunctioning in daily life. It has been shown to have good psychometric properties and has been applied in the general population and clinical samples from Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries.
   Aims. To normalise and standardise the PSI-20 in a broad sample of subjects of all ages in a Spanish population.
   Subjects and methods. The PSI-20 was administered to 4704 subjects: in one sample made up of 2474 subjects from the Spanish general population, over 18 years of age, and in another consisting of 2230 school-age subjects (15-17 years old), representative of the population of Madrid.
   Results. The effect of the interaction of sex, age and level of education on the scores was observed, although the effect of level of education was low. As expected, the adolescents, still undergoing their process of maturation, obtained higher scores on all the subscales and the questionnaire as a whole. Females scored significantly higher on symptoms of poor emotional control, and males achieved higher scores on symptoms of poor control over social behaviour. Tables were developed differentiated by sex and for those above and below 18 years of age.
   Conclusion. The data presented allow us to interpret the scores obtained in the PSI-20 in the Spanish population, including subjects under 18 and adults.

AB ObjectiveTo evaluate the factors associated with body dissatisfaction among the Lebanese population, including sociodemographic characteristics, self-esteem, stress, anxiety, depression, emotional regulation, emotional eating and the adult attachment style.MethodsThis cross-sectional study, conducted between January and May 2018, enrolled 811 adult participants from all districts of Lebanon. The body dissatisfaction subscale of the eating disorder inventory version 2 (EDI-2) was used to measure body disturbance.ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 27.5911.76 years, with 66.5% females. The final model of the regression analysis showed that a higher binge eating score (Beta=0.202), being married (Beta=1.233), having a family history of eating disorders (Beta=1.933), higher BMI (Beta=0.076), dieting to lose weight (past 30days) (Beta=2.345), receiving comments from the family (Beta=2.234) and pressure from TV/magazines to lose weight (Beta=1.320), vomiting or taking laxatives to lose weight (past 30days) (Beta=1.861), higher depression (Beta=0.103) and higher perceived stress (Beta=0.107) were associated with a higher body dissatisfaction score. However, higher self-esteem (Beta=-0.246), increased physical activity (Beta=-0.022) and being divorced (Beta=-4.226) were significantly associated with a lower body dissatisfaction score.ConclusionA significant association was found in this current study between the main variables: depression, self-esteem, social anxiety, eating disorders, family and television pressure and body image dissatisfaction.Level of evidenceLevelV, cross-sectional descriptive study.

AB PurposeTo investigate the relationship between selected disordered eating behaviors and self-reported sexual minority status (gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure) among a representative sample of high school adolescents.MethodsThe 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored Connecticut Youth Risk Behavior Survey was utilized (N=2242). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses, separated by gender, examined sexual minority adolescents (gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure) and selected eating behaviors. Analyses adjusted for race, age, cigarette use, binge drinking, organized school activity participation, body mass index (BMI), and depression.ResultsGay males were significantly more likely to report exercising or eating less to lose weight in the unadjusted models (p<0.05) and fasting, vomiting, and taking diet pills in both adjusted (p<0.05) and unadjusted models (p<0.01) when compared to the referent heterosexual males. Bisexual females were significantly more likely to report fasting, vomiting, and taking diet pills in the unadjusted model (p<0.05) when compared to the referent heterosexual females and significantly less likely to report exercising or eating less to lose weight in the adjusted models (p<0.05).ConclusionsAlthough additional studies are needed owing to small sample sizes, preliminary findings support previous research suggesting that high school-aged sexual minority youth subgroups are a priority target population for increased efforts to prevent disordered eating.

AB Background: Over the past several years there has been considerable interest in the relation between emotion dysregulation and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), particularly given that rates of NSSI have been increasing and NSSI is a critical risk factor for suicidal behavior. To date, however, no synthesis of empirical findings exists.
   Methods: The present study presents a comprehensive meta-analytic review of the literature on the association between NSSI and emotion dysregulation. A total of 48 publications, including 49 independent samples, were included in this analysis.
   Results: Overall, a significant association was found between emotion dysregulation and NSSI (pooled OR = 3.03 [95% CI = 2.56-3.59]). This association was reduced but remained significant (OR = 2.40 [95% CI = 2.01-2.86]) after adjustment for publication bias. Emotion dysregulation subscales most strongly associated with NSSI included limited access to regulation strategies, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, and difficulties engaging goal-directed behavior. Lack of emotional awareness/clarity and cognitive aspects of dysregulation yielded weaker, yet significant, positive associations with NSSI.
   Conclusions: Findings support the notion that greater emotion dysregulation is associated with higher risk for NSSI among individuals across settings, regardless of age or sex. Furthermore, findings reveal facets of dysregulation that may have unique implications for NSSI. This meta-analysis highlights the importance of better understanding emotion dysregulation as a treatment target for preventing NSSI. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated early adolescents' psychophysiological response to a school-related stressor (SRS) as indexed by heart rate variability and examined the unique and interactive effects of heart rate variability and temperament on academic achievement. A total of 91 seventh graders watched an SRS video-clip while their heart rate variability was registered. Temperament and grades were also assessed. Heart rate variability decreased from baseline while watching the video-clip, indicating the activation of a stress response, and returned to basal level when recovering. Regression analyses revealed that among youth with an inhibited temperament, higher heart rate variability in the poststressor phase was related to better performance, whereas socially outgoing students performed well regardless of their recovery rate. These are among the first data to report on the link between early adolescents' parasympathetic self-regulatory activity in response to an SRS, temperamental profiles, and academic functioning. Implications for theory and educational practice are discussed.

AB The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of an emotional skills intervention on behavioral and emotional competence, as well as on communication for children with autism in China. Eight children (seven boys and one girl), aged 7 to 8, participated in this study. We used a pre and posttest group design. The intervention consisted of 10 group sessions and four individual sessions. Each group session had two or three children. The intervention curriculum consisted of emotion recognition, emotion recognition within context, self-expression of emotions, seeking help when encountering problems, and techniques for emotion regulation. Results indicated that the intervention significantly improved children's emotional skills, behavioral and emotional competence, and communication. The potential implications of this study for elementary children with autism in China are also discussed.

AB Research has established links between youth firesetting and general antisocial behavior. The current study sought to better understand these links by identifying fire-specific and general risk factors for offending from a national sample of children and adolescent firesetters (N = 1,790), from a New Zealand Fire Service intervention program, up to 10 years after intervention. Most (62%) had committed an offense post-intervention, primarily moderate or severe offending. Only 5% had committed an arson offense post-intervention. Nearly all measures of victimization, psychosocial/emotional problems, previous conduct problem behavior, and child-welfare history were associated with post-intervention offending and/or offending severity. Pre-intervention offending and being older (aged 12+ years) at intervention were the major independent risk factors for offending. A protective factor was firesetting having occurred at home. Findings highlight young firesetters' broad patterns of pervasive antisocial behavior and multiple adverse family, environmental, and individual factors that accompany and contribute to wide-ranging, non-fire-related offending.

AB The Good Behavior Game (GBG, Barrish, Saunders, & Wolf, 1969) and the PATHS Curriculum (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies; Greenberg, Kusche, Cook, & Quamma, 1995) represent 2 universal, elementary school, preventive interventions which have been shown in large-scale, randomized controlled trials to have an immediate and beneficial impact (GBG, Dolan et al., 1993; PATHS, Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group [CPPRG], 1999) on aggressive/disruptive and off-task behavior. Importantly, both risk behaviors are strong predictors of antisocial behavior, drug abuse, and low educational and occupational attainment in adolescence and young adulthood (Kellam et al., 2008). What has yet to be explored within a randomized controlled trial is whether the combination of these interventions would yield significantly greater impact on aggressive/disruptive and off-task behavior than the GBG alone. One reason for expecting additive if not synergistic effects as a result of combining the two interventions is that the GBG, by increasing attention to task and reducing disruptive behavior in the classroom, may facilitate the acquisition of the emotion regulation, social problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills taught in PATHS. To that end, a group randomized, effectiveness trial was carried out, wherein 27 schools were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions, (a) the PAX GBG Alone (Embry, Staatemeier, Richardson, Lauger, & Mitich, 2003), (b) PATHS to PAX (that is, the PAX GBG + PATHS), or (c) a standard setting (control) condition. Classroom observations and teacher ratings of student behavior were carried out at pretest and 6 months later at posttest. Limited evidence of the superiority of the combined approach was found and potential reasons why and future directions are discussed.

AB Objective: This study aimed to characterize parenting behaviors of mothers of adolescent daughters who engage in repetitive self-inflicted injury (SII) and to test hypothesized associations between parenting behaviors and adolescent psychopathology. Method: Participants were mothers and their 14- to 18-year-old daughters (N = 51 dyads), including 24 (47%) adolescents with a history of SII and 27 (53%) with no history of SII. Dyads completed questionnaires assessing perceived maternal validation and invalidation and participated in face-to-face interactions, which were later rated for parenting behaviors. Results: The two groups did not significantly differ on validation and invalidation across all informants and methods of assessment. For the sample as a whole, adolescent perceptions of maternal parenting behaviors interacted to predict adolescent psychopathology. In particular, adolescent perceptions of high maternal invalidation in interaction with perceptions of low validation were associated with higher levels of self-reported borderline pathology and externalizing problems and mother-reported adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusions: We failed to find support for the hypothesized parenting deficits in mothers of female adolescents engaging in SII. Adolescent perceptions of their mothers' high levels of invalidation and low levels of validation were associated with higher levels of adolescent psychopathology.

AB Obesity is a public health problem and is especially important among young women. The objective of this study was to compare the body experience, food habits and emotional regulation among young women with and without obesity. The study had a qualitative approach, was exploratory in scope and had a descriptive-analytical design. To describe the sample, the Multidimensional Body Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) was used to measure body image, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) to assess emotional intake, and the Derogatis Symptom Checklist (SCL-90), which measures psychological symptoms. In-depth interviews were conducted, which were analyzed using Grounded Theory's open theory. The results indicated that both groups showed dissatisfaction with the shape and weight of their bodies, with women with obesity reporting perceived body limitations. Women with obesity reported regulating negative emotions through food. Non-obese participants reported healthy habits, such as physical activity and a balanced diet, and in both groups, body care and personal aesthetics were valued, although only non-obese participants reported effective care behaviors.

AB Purpose: Adolescent mental health problems are a public health issue in Hong Kong and a review of the situation can have implications for intervention and prevention. This paper aims to review the available prevalence rates of mental health problems among adolescents in Hong Kong and examines the correlates of these conditions through a positive youth development (PYD) framework. Methods: Local studies published in English between January 1995 and September 2017 were searched in ERIC, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, and PubMed. Data were selected and extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was the prevalence or the scores of mental health problems among adolescents. The secondary outcome was the correlates associated with the problems identified in the studies. Results: Twenty-three studies were identified. The prevalence of depression was between 0.55% and 2.2% (three studies), whereas the prevalence for anxiety (one study) and generalized anxiety disorder (two studies) were 6.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Comparatively higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of general mental health among Hong Kong adolescents than adolescents in other regions. The protective factors examined in these studies were categorized into PYD constructs, namely: cognitive competence, behavioral competence, emotional competence, resilience, and bonding with family, which were associated with better mental health. Conclusions: This review contends that future mental health research and intervention for adolescents should focus more on PYD constructs and family factors.

AB Empathy, which is the ability to feel concern for and to understand others' feelings, is thought to develop in high quality relationships with parent and peers, but also to facilitate the quality of these relationships. While a wide literature has addressed this aspect, the heterogeneity of primary studies, in which different indicators of relationship quality (e.g., support, conflict) and empathy (i.e., affective and cognitive) have been examined, makes it difficult to draw conclusive answers. Therefore, it remained ambiguous how parent-child and peer relationship quality are associated with adolescents' empathy. In order to increase the understanding of these associations, a multilevel meta-analysis was performed, which allowed for including multiple effect sizes from each study. By a systematic literate search, 70 eligible studies were found that provided 390 effect sizes from 75 independent samples. The results showed a small positive correlation between parent-child relationship quality and empathy, and a small-to-moderate positive correlation between peer relationship quality and empathy, which was significantly stronger than the correlation with parent-child relationship quality. Hence, the meta-analytic results indicate that adolescents with higher quality relationships, especially with peers, indeed tend to show more concern for and understanding of others' emotions than adolescents with lower quality relationships. Moreover, the moderation analyses showed stronger correlations for the positive dimension of relationship quality than for the negative dimension, and stronger correlations for composite scores of affective and cognitive empathy than for separate scores of the empathy dimensions. However, no differences in correlations were found between the affective and cognitive empathy dimension, and no moderation effects were found for gender and age. Thus, this meta-analysis demonstrates robust positive associations between parent-child and peer relationship quality and empathy in adolescence, implying that good empathic abilities may be a protective factor for experiencing poor relationships.

ID INTERNET USE; METACOGNITIONS; DYSREGULATION; ADOLESCENTS
AB Research evidence suggests that problematic Facebook use (PFU) affects large numbers of people worldwide. A variety of studies have investigated the relationship between PFU and psychological dysfunction, revealing that negative mood and cognitive self-regulation are common among problematic Facebook users. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of craving, emotion regulation and desire thinking in predicting PFU. An online survey was administered to 750 participants (M-age=23.38years; SDage=5.72). Correlation analyses indicated that all predictor variables were positively associated with PFU. Path analysis showed that imaginal prefiguration was associated with craving, which, in turn, was associated with verbal prefiguration that was directly linked to PFU, beyond the direct effect of emotion regulation. These findings provide further support for the importance of desire thinking in predicting problematic behaviours. Desire thinking and emotion regulation should be considered in the modification of problematic Facebook use.

AB The Trier Social Stress Test for children (TSST-C) adapted from TSST is one of the most commonly used laboratory paradigms for investigating the effects of stress on cognitive, affective and physiological responses in children and adolescents. Considering that laboratory procedures generate a significant amount of stress to children and adolescents, even in the absence of a stress paradigm, it is important to validate TSST-C against an inactive control condition in which the stress components were absent. Using a randomized design, we tested an inactive control condition, which replaced the TSST-C with a benign video clip (nature scenes viewed while standing), thus removing the stress associated components of the TSST-C. Eighty-eight youth between the ages of 10 and 17 years were randomly assigned to complete the TSST-C or the Inactive Control (IC). Subjective anxiety rating, salivary cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were collected at eight time points. Subjects in the Inactive Control condition showed no significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and decreased anxiety rating and salivary cortisol level throughout the study. Subjects in the stress condition (TSST-C) showed increased anxiety ratings, salivary cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate immediately following TSST-C stress induction. Our findings validated that the TSST-C induced a systemic stress response, and that the Inactive Control can be a promising standardized control condition for the TSST-C and a tool for future psychobiological research. Our results also showed that anxiety reactivity decreased with age while HR reactivity increased with age. Cortisol reactivity did not fall in a linear relationship with age but rather via a quadratic curve, suggesting the mid-age adolescents had the highest cortisol responses to stress compared to their younger and older peers, potentially due to a dual factor of pubertal development and self-control and emotion regulation capacity.

AB Attenuated cortisol secretion has been linked to traumatic experiences and the developmental psychopathology. Unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) form a highly vulnerable group in this context, usually exposed to multiple and severe traumatic experiences and characterized by a high, comorbid symptom-load. Here, we provide a first investigation in URM seeking to elucidate associations between long-term cortisol output, assessed through hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), lifetime traumatic events and psychological symptoms. Ninety-one male URM from Syria and Afghanistan (mean age = 17.4 years), living in group homes of the Child Protection Services in Leipzig, Germany, were examined. HCC were measured from scalp-near 3 cm hair segments and data on LTE, PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms as well as emotional and conduct problems assessed. Results revealed HCC to be negatively related to lifetime traumatic events (total number, trauma types). In addition, a tentative finding of a positive association between HCC and emotional problems emerged. Results are discussed with regard to their relevance for HCC as a biomarker of the long-term endocrine consequences of chronic adversity and trauma exposure.

AB Background: While autistic temper tantrums during preschool age are a common challenging behavior, it is unknown whether they are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those arising in other neurodevelopmental conditions.
   Method: Tantrum frequency, duration, triggering factors, behavioral components, parental responses and parental perception of their impact on functioning were collected in 48 autistic spectrum (AS) preschoolers and in 47 preschoolers with other neurodevelopmental conditions, aged from 2 to 5 years.
   Results: The AS group had more frequent tantrums with no identifiable triggers, a higher proportion of tantrums triggered by communication problems and in the context of demands, and their parents were more likely to give in to their demands in response to tantrums. No other group differences in terms of frequency, duration, perceived impact, triggers, modulators and behaviors were found.
   Conclusion: This study did not find an increased frequency of tantrums at a preschool age in youth with and without an AS diagnosis. Further research should now consider if autistic tantrums differ from that of typically developing peers.

AB This study tested the theoretical assertion that anger and sympathy would be differentially associated with hot-blooded reactive and cold-blooded proactive aggression in an ethnically diverse community sample of 4- and 8-year-olds from Canada (N=300; n=150 in each age group; 50% female). We conducted structured interviews with children to elicit their self-reported anger in response to social conflicts (anger reactivity), ability to effectively manage feelings of frustration (anger regulation), and the degree to which they felt concern for others in need (sympathy). Caregivers completed questionnaires assessing the degree to which children engaged in reactive and proactive overt aggression. Across ages, dysregulated anger was more strongly associated with reactive aggression, whereas lower sympathy was more strongly linked to proactive aggression. Anger reactivity did not predict children's aggressive behavior, with one exception: lower anger reactivity in 8-year-old males was associated with higher levels of proactive aggression. These findings support the hypotheses that anger and sympathy are differentially involved in reactive and proactive aggression, and that these distinct affective correlates are evident by the preschool years.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is widely used to assess behavioral and emotional problems in youth. The CBCL Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-Oriented Anxiety Problems subscale (CBCL-AP) was developed for the identification of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Using data from 298 youth aged 6- to 18, the CBCL-AP scale was examined to determine its ability to differentially predict, via Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, the presence of (a) generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), (b) separation anxiety disorder (SAD), (c) specific phobia (SPPH), or (d) the presence of any of these disorders. Independent Evaluators (IEs) administered the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-C/P) to determine the presence of an anxiety disorder. The ability of the CBCL-AP to predict to anxiety disorders was compared to the ability of the CBCL Anxious/Depressed (CBCL-A/D) scale and the seven empirically derived CBCL syndrome subscales and five DSM-Oriented subscales to predict anxiety disorder diagnoses. Results revealed that CBCL-AP scores significantly predicted all diagnoses. CBCL-A/D scores significantly predicted SAD (AUC = 0.67), GAD (AUC = 0.69), and the presence of any of the three disorders (AUC = 0.72), but not the presence of SPPH (AUC = 0.52). Although the CBCL-AP scale may not be a substitute for extensive diagnostics, it has demonstrated utility as an instrument for assessing anxiety and can serve to identify anxious youth in need of mental health services.

AB Objective: To investigate the effect of alexithymic personality characteristics, and associated mental problems on somatization in adolescents. Methods: This research was conducted on 773 students (49% female, n=376; 51% male, n=397) aged between 11 and 17. The students were recruited from two state schools in Istanbul. DSM-5 Level 2 Somatic Symptom Scale Child Form, 20 item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) self-report form were used as measures. The mean scores of the scales between female and male groups were compared with independent sample t test. The correlations between the scales were analyzed with Pearson's product moment correlation test. The predictability of total scores of TAS-20 and SDQ, and SDQ subscale scores on somatization scores was evaluated with multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The somatization scores of females were higher than males, significantly. Somatization scores were positively correlated with alexithymia, SDQ total scores, emotional problems, behavior problems, inattention/hyperactivity, and peer relation problems scores, significantly. The results of regression analysis indicated that alexithymia, emotional problems, behavior problems and age significantly predict the somatization levels. Conclusion: It is suggested that therapeutic interventions aiming to improve of emotional identification and expressions may help us to increase the success of somatization treatment in adolescents. Additionally, focusing on emotional problems such as depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety levels, and behavioral problems may also increase the success of treatment.

AB Research provides strong evidence that the symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) are comprised of at least two dimensions: irritability and defiance. Given that these two dimensions have distinct etiologies and long-term risk profiles, they may also warrant different treatment approaches. In particular, impaired emotion regulation plays a central role in the irritable dimension of ODD. As such, this subgroup of youth and their families may benefit from greater consideration of and attention to emotion-focused strategies than is standard in traditional Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) approaches. In support of this hypothesis, this review will (1) examine the etiological models guiding the theoretical approach to standard BPT; (2) evaluate theory and research on emotion socialization broadly and its role in the etiology and maintenance of irritability in children with BDs; (3) propose an emotion socialization-based etiological model for the irritable dimension of child oppositionality; and (4) argue for the use of emotion-focused parent training in the treatment of such youth. Clinical implications, gaps in the current state of the literature, and future directions for research will also be discussed.

AB Introduction: Self-compassion, a trait that involves responding to one's difficulties with care and concern, may offer unique stress coping benefits during the challenges of adolescence.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data from a large adolescent sample within two U.S. school settings (N = 1057; 65% female; 68% white; mean age 14.7 years) to examine whether self-compassion buffers the impact of perceived stress on internalizing symptoms, and secondarily, if these relationships differ by gender.
   Results: Regression analysis revealed self-compassion is inversely related to internalizing symptoms. Moreover, the relationship between stress and depression and anxiety symptoms differed by level of self-compassion. This moderation effect was similar between genders for depressive symptoms, but slightly greater in males compared to females for anxiety.
   Conclusions: These results add to our understanding of self-compassion as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy with potential benefits for youth experiencing stress. Further research is needed to confirm if moderation effects for anxiety differ by gender.

AB This paper presents the translation, adaptation and validation of a broadly used scale to measure emotion regulation strategies (i.e. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Children and Adolescents -ERQ-CA; Gullone & Taffe, 2012) in a sample of early adolescents. The 10-item scale was applied to a sample of 248 adolescents (128 boys) aged 13 to 14 years. Semi-confirmatory factor analysis supported the original two-factor structure: Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression (SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .96). These two factors demonstrate adequate internal consistency and evidence for convergent validity with other scales that refer to emotional intelligence, affect, and behavior. Thus, Cognitive Reappraisal scores were associated with higher self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect and personal adjustment (ps < .05). Conversely, Expressive Suppression scores were associated with lower self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect, and personal adjustment (ps < .01), with higher scores on negative affect, school and clinical maladjustment (ps < .01), as well as stress and depression symptoms (ps < .001). Overall, these findings suggest that the questionnaire may be a useful and reliable instrument for the assessment of emotion regulation strategies in early adolescents for future research in Spanish speaking countries.

AB The goal of this study was to evaluate a complex multiple mediation model linking parental support, homework self-efficacy, emotion regulation strategies (i.e. cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and homework emotions among Chinese children. Participants were 832 fourth and fifth grade students attending public primary schools in urban China. Measures of parental support, homework self-efficacy, emotion regulation strategies, and homework emotions were collected using self-report assessments. Results from multiple mediation analyses demonstrated that parental support indirectly predicted homework emotions through its positive associations with homework self-efficacy and cognitive reappraisal strategy. However, homework self-efficacy and expressive suppression strategy did not mediate the relation between parental support and homework emotions. Results are discussed with regard to the roles of homework self-efficacy and emotion regulation strategies in the links between parental support and children's homework emotions. Educational implications are also considered.

AB The present study examined the potential moderating role respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) plays in the relationship between parental marital conflict and adolescents' internalizing problems. To examine this issue, data were collected from 330 adolescents (13-14 years, 182 boys). The Chinese version of the Achenbach Youth Self-Report-2001 and the Chinese version of the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict were used to assess the adolescents' internalizing problems and their perceptions of parental marital conflict. To obtain RSA data, electrocardiogram monitoring was performed on the adolescents at baseline and during a series of stress tasks (watching a film clip depicting marital conflict, a mental arithmetic task, and a speech task). The results indicated that baseline RSA and RSA reactivity to the film clip moderated the relationship between parental marital conflict and internalizing problems in early adolescents. The moderating effect of baseline RSA supported the BSCT hypothesis. Specifically, adolescents with low baseline RSA have both the highest and lowest levels of internalizing problems, depending on the level of marital conflict. In contrast, adolescents with high levels of baseline RSA have moderate levels in internalizing problems, regardless of the level of marital conflict they experience. Similarly, high marital conflict was related to internalizing problems for adolescents with less RSA suppression or RSA augmentation but not for those with greater RSA suppression. This effect was specific to stress related to marital conflict, as RSA reactivity to the mental arithmetic task and speech task did not moderate the relationship between marital conflict and internalizing problems. These findings suggest that certain profile of parasympathetic nervous activity is a risk factor for internalizing problems particularly for those who experience high-conflict environments.

AB The study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) addresses variables related to three core symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, it has been suggested that in recent years emotional difficulties and subsequent social challenges have not received sufficient attention. This study had two objectives: (1) to compare the performance of participants (age range: 8-14 years) on facial emotion recognition tasks using the Affect Recognition subtest of the Children Neuropsychological Battery II; and (2) to assess the perceptions of family members in relation to variables associated with emotional problems, difficulty in regulating emotions, and anger management using the Spanish Assessment System for Children and Adolescents. Assessments were conducted before and after applying an emotion regulation intervention designed for this study. Following the intervention, there was a significant decrease in scores associated with emotional regulation, and an improvement in the identification of affect on facial recognition tasks. The results suggest that despite ADHD children and adolescents having social and emotional deficits secondary to the core symptom triad, emotional regulation in this group can be improved by the application of socio-emotional intervention programs.

AB Introduction: For parents who have experienced childhood maltreatment, parenting an adolescent may trigger memories of abuse or neglect, intensifying parent-adolescent conflict. This paper extends an earlier report of outcomes from a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Tuning Relationships with Music (TM), an intervention for parent-adolescent dyads where parents have a trauma history and dyads are experiencing conflict, in order to look systemically at dyads' emotion regulation during their musical representation of nonverbal conflict interaction (NCI). Method: The RCT randomly allocated 26 parent-adolescent dyads into intervention or control conditions, and analysed dyads' self-report and observation measures completed at baseline and 4-month post-baseline follow-up. Aims of the current paper were (1) to examine relationships between parents' trauma history, parent-adolescent conflict, parents' reactivity and responsiveness, and dyads' emotion regulation, consistency and predictability during NCI; and (2) whether a systemic music intervention focused on nonverbal communication (NVC) and emotion regulation would change the dynamics of dyads' relational conflict. Results: Higher parents' childhood betrayal trauma and adolescent-reported conflict scores were correlated with predictable NVC sequences whilst dyads were emotionally dysregulated, and parents' reactivity was correlated with dyads' inconsistent NVC during NCI. Post-intervention dyads were more emotionally regulated, consistent and predictable during NCI, reported lower levels of conflict and showed increased parent emotional responsiveness and reduced reactivity. Discussion: Findings indicate that where parents have experienced childhood maltreatment, conflictual parent-adolescent dyads may benefit from intervention focusing on skills that promote emotionally regulated, predictable and consistent NVC during conflict interactions. Trials with a larger sample are warranted.

AB Previous work on the contribution of family environments to adolescent emotion dysregulation has tended to focus on broad parenting characteristics (such as warmth); however, it is possible that day-to-day variability in parenting may also relate to emotion dysregulation. The current study sought to test whether inconsistency in the quality of daily parent-youth interactions related to multiple indices of emotion dysregulation in adolescents. Two-hundred-twenty-two adolescents (ages 13-16; 53% female) participated with one parent. Adolescents completed 14-days of diary reporting on the quality of interactions with their parent (negative/neutral/positive) and their emotion dysregulation experiences for each day. Analyses reveal that, beyond the effects of average interaction quality, adolescents with greater variability in the quality of their interactions with their parent reported greater average emotion dysregulation across the days of diary recording and demonstrated greater variability in their ratings of daily emotion dysregulation. Findings were not accounted for by parental warmth or hostility, parent-reported trait-level emotion regulation, or day-level associations between study variables. In these ways, greater variability - and not merely greater negativity - during interactions between parents and adolescents was related to adolescent emotion dysregulation, suggesting that consistency in parent-adolescent relationships may be an important dimension of psychosocial risk to consider within families.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate whether childhood levels of parental warmth buffer the relationship between parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression and behavioural and emotional adjustment (violent offending, substance use, depression and anxiety) among adolescent boys and girls. Data were drawn from a large self-report school survey conducted among 9th graders in Lower Saxony, Germany (n = 7423). Controlling for socio-demographic factors and risk-seeking, results showed that parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression were related to increased externalizing and internalizing behaviour, while parental warmth was related to decreased anxiety and depression. Perceived parental warmth during childhood buffered effects of parent-to-child verbal aggression on later violent offending. More specifically, the strongest relationship between parent-to-child verbal aggression and externalizing behaviour was found in individuals with low parental warmth. Child and parent gender did not qualify the moderating effect of warmth. Results underscore the need for programmes and policies that promote stable family environments particularly marked by the absence of parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression.

AB Introduction: The amygdala is a brain structure involved in emotional regulation. Studies have shown that larger amygdala volumes are associated with behavioral disorders. Prenatal maternal depression is associated with structural changes in the amygdala, which in turn, is predictive of an increase in behavioral problems. Girls may be particularly vulnerable. However, it is not known whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), or which aspect of the maternal stress experience (i.e., objective hardship, subjective distress, and cognitive appraisal), influences amygdala volumes. Nor is it known whether amygdala volumes mediate the effect of PNMS on behavioral problems in girls and boys.
   Aims: To assess whether aspects of PNMS are associated with amygdala volume, to determine whether timing of exposure moderates the effect, and to test whether amygdala volume mediates the association between PNMS and internalizing and externalizing problems in 111/2 year old children exposed in utero, to varying levels of disaster-related PNMS.
   Methods: Bilateral amygdala volumes (AGV) and total brain volume (TBV) were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging, from 35 boys and 33 girls whose mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. The mothers' disaster-related stress was assessed in June 1998. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at 111/2 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Hierarchical regression analyses and mediation analyses were conducted on boys and girls separately, controlling for perinatal and postnatal factors.
   Results: In boys, subjective distress was associated with larger right AGV/TBV when mothers where exposed during late pregnancy, which in turn explained higher levels of externalizing behavior. However, when adjusting for postnatal factors, the effect was no longer significant. In girls, later gestational exposure to the ice storm was associated with larger AGV/TBV, but here, higher levels of objective PNMS were associated with more externalizing problems, which was, in part, mediated by larger AGV/TBV. No effects were detected on internalizing behaviors.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the effects of PNMS on amygdala development and externalizing symptoms, as assessed in boys and girls in early adolescence, can be influenced by the timing of the stress in pregnancy, and the particular aspect of the mother's stress experience.

AB Disruptions in fronto-limbic circuitry have been reported in adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD), yet it is unknown whether dynamic functional neurophysiology is similarly altered in adolescents with high levels of BPD traits. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an implicit perception of emotional faces task, this study investigated task-dependent functional connectivity of eight a priori regions of interest implicated in emotional processing, in 16 females with and without BPD traits. An underconnected network of areas was observed in the BPD-trait group during implicit angry face perception - an effect absent for happy faces. This hyposynchronous fronto-limbic circuit included connections among bilateral amygdalae and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and additional regions implicated in emotion processing. These preliminary, novel results extend existing findings in adults with a diagnosis of BPD, and suggest that disrupted neurophysiological circuitry underlies maladaptive perception of threatening emotional expressions in others, manifests around a key milestone in neurodevelopement, and might contribute to the emotional dysregulation and difficulties with interpersonal relationships commonly found in adolescents high in BPD traits.

AB Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has been a controversial entity with various opinions about its clinical relevance as an independent mental disorder. This debate has also included discussions about the relationships between problematic gaming, various psychiatric disorders, and personality traits and dimensions. This paper outlines a developmental-theory based model of Internet gaming misuse inspired by the treatment of two adolescent inpatients. The two clinical vignettes illustrate distinct developmental pathways: an "internalized pathway" via the development of social anxiety, emotional and behavioral avoidance; and an "externalized pathway" with a low level of emotional regulation strategies and impulsivity. In both clinical cases, attachment issues played a key role to understand the specific associations of risk and maintaining factors for IGD, and gaming behaviors may be seen as specific forms of maladaptive self-regulatory strategies for these two youths. These clinical observations support the assumption that gaming use problematic in adolescents should be viewed with a developmental approach, including key aspects of emotional development that represent significant targets for therapeutic interventions.

AB Student athletes experience multiple stressors relating to both their sporting and academic commitments. Individual differences play a significant role in how well student athletes cope with the demands they face. When assessing individual differences in stress reactivity, there are a lack of valid alternatives to costly and time-consuming lab-based physiological methods (e.g., cortisol sampling, cardiac variables). This paper aims to further validate a self-report measure of adolescent athletes' individual differences in perceived stress reactivity, by comparing to a psycho-physiological measure of emotion regulation (heart-rate variability) assessed during a socially evaluated cold pressor test. 30 student athletes and 31 student non-athletes completed a measure of perceived stress reactivity and took part in the socially evaluated cold pressor test while their heart-rate variability was assessed, along with their self-reported appraisals of stress, pain, and unpleasantness experienced during the procedure. Controlling for gender and athleticism, individual differences in perceived stress reactivity showed no associations with tonic or phasic levels of heart-rate variability. However, perceived stress reactivity was associated with levels of self-reported stress, pain, and unpleasantness experienced during the socially evaluated cold pressor test. These findings therefore suggest that perceived stress reactivity is associated with cognitive responses to stress (i.e., stress appraisals). However, further research is needed to confirm its relationship with physiological measures and responses. This further adds to the understanding of perceived stress reactivity, and validity of the perceived stress reactivity scale for adolescent athletes.

LA English
DT Article
ID CHILD; PREVALENCE; POPULATION
AB Background: Positive parenting and enabling socio-demography, engenders good conduct in adolescence. Balanced parental demandingness and emotional responsiveness, deployed by authoritative parents, supports adolescents? mental health. Parental emotional responsiveness deters peer-pressured risky behaviours; while parental negligence, permissiveness, or demandingness encourages mental health problems. This is especially in the context of unfavourable socio-demographic setting. Aim: We aimed to evaluate parenting styles and socio-demographic factors associated with adolescents? mental health. Method: A cross-sectional multistage study was conducted with 286 in-school adolescents in Ibadan, Nigeria. Data were collected with questionnaires. The questionnaires evaluated socio-demography, mental health, and perceived parenting styles using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ) and Scale of Parenting Styles (SPS) questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 21. Results: Some of the adolescents in this study, experienced peer problems (4.9%), conduct problems (9.4%), hyperactivity problems (0.7%), emotional problems (14.3%), and they lacked pro-social behaviours (11.1%). In comparison to adolescents who perceived fathers as authoritative, adolescents who perceived fathers as less demanding experienced emotional (p = 0.01) and peer (p = 0.02) problems. Perceived maternal negligence and authoritarian parenting was associated with more peer problems (1.5?2.3 and 1.3?2.2) in comparison to perceived maternal authoritative style (0.6?1.5). Most adolescents from lower social class experienced conduct (88.8%; p = 0.07) and emotional problems (73.2%; p = 0.20). Conclusion: Competent parenting style and socio-economic resources supports resilience to mental health problems in adolescents.

AB The current review provides an evidence base update of psychosocial treatments for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in youth. A systematic search was conducted of 2 major scientific databases (PsycInfo and PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to June 2018. The search identified 26 RCTs examining interventions for SITBs in youth: 17 were included in the 2015 review and 9 trials were new to this update. The biggest change since the prior review was the evaluation of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) as the first Level 1: Well-established intervention for reducing deliberate self-harm (composite of nonsuicidal and suicidal self-injury) and suicide ideation in youth and Level 2: Probably efficacious for reducing nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide attempts. Five other interventions were rated as Level 2: Probably efficacious for reducing SITBs in youth, with the new addition of Integrated Family Therapy. This evidence base update indicates that there are a few promising treatments for reducing SITBs in youth. Efficacious interventions typically include a significant family or parent training component as well as skills training (e.g., emotion regulation skills). Aside from DBT-A, few treatments have been examined in more than one RCT. Given that replication by independent research groups is needed to evaluate an intervention as Well-established, future research should focus on replicating the five promising interventions currently evaluated as Probably efficacious. In addition, an important future direction is to develop brief efficacious interventions that may be scalable to reach large numbers of youth.

AB The current study tested whether emotion dysregulation predicts suicidal ideation over the course of 6 months. Community members (N = 298) with elevated suicide risk completed a clinical interview and self-report questionnaires at baseline and month-6 follow-up appointments. Elevated general emotion dysregulation but not subscales significantly predicted increases in suicidal ideation at month-6 follow-up after accounting for initial suicidal ideation, treatment condition, and negative affectivity. Furthermore, general emotion dysregulation as well as lack of awareness and lack of clarity subscales were significantly associated with prior suicide attempts at baseline after accounting for negative affectivity. Findings support the establishment of emotion dysregulation as a risk factor for suicidal ideation and provide evidence for a role in suicide attempts. Findings call for the development of interventions targeting emotion dysregulation in effectively predicting and preventing suicidality.

AB Background: Research has demonstrated that problem behavior has been associated with substance use, but knowledge is lacking on such associations in a low-income country like Nepal. Aims: This study aimed to find associations between emotional and behavioral problems and substance use among Nepalese adolescents. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the end of 2011, with participants from three schools in the Province 4 of Nepal. We selected 408 adolescents aged 12 to 18 (mean 15.2 years, 54% boys) at one urban and two rural schools. The data were collected using the Youth Self-Report and Adolescents' Substance Use Measurement. Results: Higher scores on withdrawn/depressed symptoms, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent or aggressive behavior or internalizing or externalizing problems were associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol or other substances. In the broadband scales, only internalizing problems predicted the use of intoxicants. Higher scores for attention problems predicted the use of tobacco, any intoxicants, and high-risk user. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that problem behavior among Nepalese adolescents was associated with substance use. Future studies should explore the association between problem behavior and substance use, including causal factors, so that risky behavior among Nepalese adolescents can be prevented.

AB Exploratory mediation analysis via regularization, or XMed, is a recently developed technique that allows one to identify potential mediators of a process of interest. However, as currently implemented, it can only be applied to continuous outcomes. We extend this method to allow application to dichotomous outcomes, including both mediators and dependent variables. Simulation results show that XMed can achieve the same sensitivity as more conventional methods for mediation analysis such as the Sobel test, percentile bootstrap, and bias-corrected bootstrap, but in general requires only half the sample size to do so. We demonstrate the implementation of this approach using an illustrative example examining the relationship between youth behavioral/emotional problems and alcohol use.

AB Over 50% of people diagnosed with a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, will meet criteria for a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This dual disorder often starts during youth and leads to significant societal costs, including lower employability rates, more hospitalizations, and higher risk of homelessness and of suicide attempts when compared to those with a serious mental illness without substance misuse. Moreover, many individuals presenting with comorbid disorders also present with other psychological difficulties as well, such as personality disorders or anxiety and depression, also known as complex comorbid disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments that focus on core difficulties found in people with complex dual disorders, such as emotional regulation, are direly needed. Emotional regulation skills can help reduce distress related to psychotic symptoms and maintain abstinence in substance use disorders. New technologies in the field of communications have developed considerably over the past decade and have the potential to improve access to such treatments, a major problem in many health care settings. As such, this paper aims at: presenting core difficulties present in many individuals with dual disorders, reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the use of mobile applications in mental health and addictions, and presenting the development and potential of a new application for emotional regulation for people with dual disorders.

AB BackgroundChildren and adolescents with HIV/AIDS are more likely to have emotional and behavioral problems than the general population. This can result in a continuing negative influence on the quality of life, school performance, immunity and co-morbidity of children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS.ObjectiveTo assess the prevalence and associated factors of Emotional and Behavioral Problems among children and adolescents on Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy in the public hospitals of West Gojjam Zone, Amhara regional state of Ethiopia.MethodsAn institutional based cross sectional study was conducted by screening 411 children and adolescents for emotional and behavioral problems using Pediatric Symptomatology Check List (PSCL). Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were fitted to identify factors associated with Emotional and Behavioral Problems. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the level of significance.ResultOut of the total 411 participants, 43.6% were screened positive for Emotional and Behavioral Problems. Lower age (AOR=5.33, 95%CI: 2.56-11.04), having non-kin care giver (AOR=4.64, 95%CI: 1.20-17.90), parental loss (AOR=2.15, 95%CI: 1.03-4.49), non self -disclosure of HIV sero status (AOR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.16-3.41) and having distressed care giver (AOR=1.64, 95%CI: 1.04-2.57) had statistically significant association with EBPs.ConclusionThe prevalence of Emotional and Behavioral Problems is high among children and adolescents on HAART. Lower age, care giver's mental distress, non-self disclosure status, having non-kin care giver and parental loss were variables significantly associated with EBPs. This demonstrates a need for the integration of Mental Health and Psycho Social Support (MHPSS) service with HIV/AIDS care.

AB In structural neuroimaging studies, reduced cerebral cortical thickness in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions is frequently interpreted as reflecting an impaired ability to downregulate neuronal activity in the amygdalae. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted in order to test this conjecture. We examine the extent to which amygdalar reactivity is associated with cortical thickness in a population-based sample of adolescents. Data were obtained from the IMAGEN study, which includes 2,223 adolescents. While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants passively viewed video clips of a face that started from a neutral expression and progressively turned angry, or, instead, turned to a second neutral expression. Left and right amygdala ROIs were used to extract mean BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast for all subjects. T1-weighted images were processed through the CIVET pipeline (version 2.1.0). In variable-centered analyses, local cortical thickness was regressed against amygdalar reactivity using first and second-order linear models. In a follow-up person-centered analysis, we defined a "high reactive" group of participants based on mean amygdalar BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast. Between-group differences in cortical thickness were examined ("high reactive" versus all other participants). A significant association was revealed between the continuous measure of amygdalar reactivity and bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortical thickness in a second-order linear model (p < 0.05, corrected). The "high reactive" group, in comparison to all other participants, possessed reduced cortical thickness in bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, bilateral anterior temporal cortices, left caudal middle temporal gyrus, and the left inferior and middle frontal gyri (p < 0.05, corrected). Results are consistent with non-human primate studies, and provide empirical support for an association between reduced prefrontal cortical thickness and amygdalar reactivity. Future research will likely benefit from investigating the degree to which psychopathology qualifies relations between prefrontal cortical structure and amygdalar reactivity.

AB Growing interest in understanding the role of students' social- emotional competence for school success necessitates valid measures for large-scale use. We provide validity evidence for the 40-item Washoe County School District Social-Emotional Competency Assessment (WCSD-SECA), a student self-report measure that came from a researcher-practitioner partnership. The WCSD's social and emotional learning standards, which detail when and at what grade students are expected to express different competencies, contributed to hypotheses about the social- emotional competency levels targeted by the WCSD-SECA items. Across two survey years, Rasch analyses showed that the empirical item ordering aligned with the expected ordering to varying degrees, that items better targeted students at low to middle competency levels, and that some items showed differential item functioning across grades and gender/ race- ethnicity. Future research can use similar methods to theorize and test how items array along latent competency dimensions in general and for particular subgroups. Especially when accomplished within a researcher-practitioner partnership, such efforts can mutually inform district social and emotional learning standards, helping document student progress in a locally and practically relevant way. By making the WCSD-SECA items freely available, we make it easy for researchers and practitioners to complete future refinements and adaptations.

AB Objective The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP). Methods Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes >=.20 considered meaningful. Results At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.

AB Objective Parents of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience distress and worries, which may negatively impact their parenting behaviors. The current study investigates parental mindfulness (i.e., an enhanced attention to and awareness of current experiences or present reality) as a resilience mechanism. Using a daily diary approach, the predictive role of parental mindfulness for daily diabetes-related worries was examined, its impact upon protective parenting behaviors, and its buffering role in the relationship between daily worries and protective parenting behaviors. Methods Participants were 56 parents of 40 children with T1D (2-12 years). Trait mindfulness was assessed with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Subsequently, parents completed a diary for 14 consecutive days, assessing parental worries about hypo-and hyperglycemia and general and diabetes-specific parental protective behavior. Results Multilevel analyses showed that parental diabetes-related worries fluctuated substantially across days and positively predicted daily protective behavior. Higher levels of parental mindfulness predicted less daily worries about hypoglycemia and lower engagement in general protective behavior and hypoglycemia avoidance behavior. In addition, the relationship between worries about hyperglycemia and general protective behavior was moderated by parental mindfulness. Conclusions The present findings highlight the importance of daily parental worries in explaining parental protective behaviors on a daily basis. Mindfulness emerged as a promising resilience factor in parents of children with T1D, resulting in less daily worries and protective parenting. These results have important clinical implications and point to the promising role of mindfulness interventions in this context.

LA English
DT Article
DE mental illness; cost; youth; Alberta
AB Objective: To measure the provincial government cost of mental health-related activities for youth ages 12 to 17 in Alberta in 2014 to 2015.
   Methods: The target population was Alberta youth ages 12 to 17 (the federal justice definition) who received or were funded for mental health-related or complementary services from Alberta Health Services, Alberta Health, Alberta Human Services, Alberta Justice and Solicitor General, and Alberta Education (public schools). Data on services and expenditures were obtained from each source for the target youth population.
   Results: Costs for mental health-related services for all ministries were $175 million for 27,169 youth who used mental health services as defined by Policy Wise, $6460 per youth. Public school special education supplements for youth with emotional problems was the largest group, amounting to 30% of all costs. Other prominent sources of expenditures were hospital inpatient mental health services (18%), community mental health services (11%), physician mental health services (10%), and secure services with treatment requiring judicial approval (9%).
   Conclusion: Economists in several countries have developed countrywide measures of mental health expenditures and have used these to generate national benchmarks for mental health spending. We have estimated spending for Alberta provincial mental health and addiction services for a distinct and highly vulnerable group. This measure can be used to develop measures and benchmarks for other provinces, which will be valuable policy indicators.

AB This perspective describes the contribution of the prefrontal cortex to the symptoms of depression in adolescents and specifically the processing of positive and negative information. We also discuss how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity and connectivity during tasks and at rest might be a biomarker for risk for depression onset in adolescents. We include some of our recent work examining not only the anticipation and consummation of positive and negative stimuli, but also effort to gain positive and avoid negative stimuli in adolescents with depression. We find, using region of interest analyses, that the PFC is blunted in those with depression compared to controls across the different phases but in a larger sample the PFC is blunted in the anticipatory phase of the study only. Taken together, in adolescents with depression there is evidence for dysfunctional PFC activity across different studies and tasks. However, the data are limited with small sample sizes and inconsistent findings. Larger longitudinal studies with more detailed assessments of symptoms across the spectrum are needed to further evaluate the role of the PFC in adolescent depression.

AB Background Children in low-income and middleincome countries (LMICs) who remain in school have better health and employment outcomes. South Africa, like many LMICs, has a secondary school completion rate under 50%, leaving room for improvement if we can identify factors that affect educational attainment. This is the first longitudinal study to examine the effects of childhood mental health and cognitions on educational outcomes in LMIC. Methods Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Cognitive Triad Inventory for Children (CTI-C), we assessed the psychological functioning and cognition of children aged 10-12 in rural South Africa. We linked that data with measures of educational progress collected 5 years later and examined associations between educational progress and (1) behavioural and emotional problems and (2) cognitive interpretations, adjusting for possible confounders. Results Educational data were available for 443 individuals. 92% (n=408) of individuals had advanced three or fewer grades in 7 years. Having more positive cognitions (CTIC-C) was positively associated with progressing at least three grade levels (adjusted OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.79). There was no evidence for an association between emotional and behavioural problems (SDQ) and educational progress (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11). Conclusion If children in LMICs can develop more positive perspectives, they may be able to stay in school longer. Cognitions can be modified, and future studies should test interventions that work to improve cognition in childhood, guided, for example, by principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy.

AB Purpose: To examine the cross-lagged associations between delinquency (nonviolent and violent), depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence and to test the moderating effect of sex and family socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods: Participants (n=1,515) were from a birth cohort in the Canadian province of Quebec. Autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses were used to examine the associations between delinquency (nonviolent and violent), depression and anxiety symptoms from ages 15 to 17 years, while taking into account conduct and emotional problems at ages 10-12 years.
   Results: Findings suggest that delinquency (violent delinquency especially) and depression symptoms may develop according to a spiraling model, such that conduct problems in childhood give rise to depression symptoms in mid-adolescence, which in turn, contribute to more delinquent acts at the end of adolescence. Family SES, but not sex, had a moderating effect on the paths. We found that anxiety symptoms at age 15 years were associated with nonviolent delinquency at age 17 years when family SES was low, and that violent delinquency at age 15 years was associated with anxiety symptoms at age 17 years when family SES was high.
   Conclusions: Delinquency and emotional problems do not develop independently from each other; both dimensions should be examined simultaneously.

AB In recent years, as gender violence has become more visible in Spain, so sensitivity to the needs of children exposed to this violence has increased. However, interventions usually focus on psychosocial rehabilitation of women rather than their children. The aim of this work is to analyse the behavioural and emotional problems of a sample of children living in shelters with their mothers after having suffered gender violence. The Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) was used to analyse the behavioural and emotional problems of 46 children aged between six and sixteen (M = 11.15; SD = 2.6) living in shelters. An ad hoc Likert questionnaire was also designed to gather information about these children's school adaptation. Behavioural and emotional problems were detected in most of the minors, as well as difficulties in academic performance and school adaptation. A relationship between behavioural and emotional problems and school adjustment was also observed. These results reflect the need for greater attention to the difficulties of children exposed to gender violence and show the importance of the educational sphere for early detection and support of these difficulties.

AB Objective: Demographic characteristics like the level of education, job position or the distribution of age in families have a significant impact on the development of children. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the commonalities and differences of foster family samples, recruited for research, with the general population. Method: The data at hand are part of the "GROW&TREAT" project that examines the development of foster children in comparison to children who live with their biological families. Results: Differences were found in comparison to the data of the German Census Bureau for the foster family sample and the biological sample for parental education, apportionment of parental employment, and familial net income. Concerning the direct sample group comparison, differences could be observed in terms of age gap between (foster) mother and child and parental education. Furthermore, the representativeness of the foster family sample was analyzed based on reports of participating youth welfare services. Conclusions: The examined sample seems to be representative for foster family samples in research contexts. The consequences of these differences on potential research results and recruitment characteristics were further discussed.

   GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MALTREATMENT; DEPRESSION; ABUSE; VOLUME; CA3;
   PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Objective: Mood disorders are more common among girls and typically emerge during adolescence. The precise reasons for this are unknown, but among the many mechanisms implicated are stress-induced hippocampal structural changes during this developmental stage. The hippocampus is a complex structure comprised of subfields that develop differentially and respond variably to stress and childhood adversity, both of which are risk factors for mood disorders. To better understand vulnerability to mood disorders, we investigated a cohort of adolescent girls and determined volumetric changes in their hippocampal subfields to elucidate the potential effects of childhood trauma. Methods: Of the 229 participants, 201 girls (aged 12-17 years) fulfilled our analysis inclusion criteria. Of these, 76 had been exposed to higher emotional trauma (emotional abuse or neglect). The girls underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans, and hippocampal subfield volumes were measured using FreeSurfer. We compared hippocampal subfield volumes in those exposed to higher emotional trauma and those exposed to minimal emotional trauma, at three time-points of adolescent development: early (12-13 years), mid (14-15 years) and late (16-17 years). Results: Mid-adolescent girls exposed to higher emotional trauma had significantly smaller left CA3 volumes than minimal emotional trauma girls (p = 0.028). Within the minimal emotional trauma group, mid-adolescents had significantly larger left CA3 volumes than early (p = 0.034) and late (p = 0.036) adolescents. Within the higher emotional trauma group, early adolescents had significantly larger left CA3 volumes than late adolescents (p = 0.036). Conclusion: In our exploratory study, we observed higher emotional trauma-induced volume changes in the left CA3 hippocampal subfield, which varied depending on age, and may ultimately produce deficits in behavioural, cognitive and emotional processes. We propose that these changes (1) may provide a mechanism through which vulnerability to mood disorders may be increased in adolescent girls, and (2) may signal the best times to implement targeted prevention interventions.

AB Child maltreatment is a major cause of pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous studies have not investigated potential differences in network architecture in maltreated youth with PTSD and those resilient to PTSD. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging brain scans at 3 T were completed in maltreated youth with PTSD (n = 31), without PTSD (n = 32), and nonmaltreated controls (n = 57). Structural covariance network architecture was derived from between-subject intraregional correlations in measures of cortical thickness in 148 cortical regions (nodes). Interregional positive partial correlations controlling for demographic variables were assessed, and those correlations that exceeded specified thresholds constituted connections in cortical brain networks. Four measures of network centrality characterized topology, and the importance of cortical regions (nodes) within the network architecture were calculated for each group. Permutation testing and principle component analysis method were employed to calculate between-group differences. Principle component analysis is a methodological improvement to methods used in previous brain structural covariance network studies. Differences in centrality were observed between groups. Larger centrality was found in maltreated youth with PTSD in the right posterior cingulate cortex; smaller centrality was detected in the right inferior frontal cortex compared to youth resilient to PTSD and controls, demonstrating network characteristics unique to pediatric maltreatment-related PTSD. Larger centrality was detected in right frontal pole in maltreated youth resilient to PTSD compared to youth with PTSD and controls, demonstrating structural covariance network differences in youth resilience to PTSD following maltreatment. Smaller centrality was found in the left posterior cingulate cortex and in the right inferior frontal cortex in maltreated youth compared to controls, demonstrating attributes of structural covariance network topology that is unique to experiencing maltreatment. This work is the first to identify cortical thickness-based structural covariance network differences between maltreated youth with and without PTSD. We demonstrated network differences in both networks unique to maltreated youth with PTSD and those resilient to PTSD. The networks identified are important for the successful attainment of age-appropriate social cognition, attention, emotional processing, and inhibitory control. Our findings in maltreated youth with PTSD versus those without PTSD suggest vulnerability mechanisms for developing PTSD.

AB While many psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk for suicidal behaviors (SB) in children and adolescents, a few studies have explored the role of clinical symptoms based on a dimensional approach. Irritability is seen as a marker, a general psychopathology, and a symptom of both externalizing and internalizing disorders. In this review, we are interested in determining whether and how irritability can predict SB in youth. First, we reviewed consistencies and variation in the literature linking irritability to suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA). Second, based on the available models, we proposed specific mechanistic pathways, whereby irritability may modulate the risk for SB. Irritability has been found associated with SB both in cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies. The relation is consistent in different settings (i.e., general population and clinical settings) and across psychiatric disorders. The association is reduced but persists after adjusting for psychiatric disorder, including depression. On one hand, irritability constitutes a risk factor for SI via the onset of internalized disorder. On the other hand, irritable youth may be more prone to attempt suicide when experiencing SI. The measures for irritability were heterogeneous. A limited number of studies were designed to explore the role of mediators and/or moderators. Recognizing irritability in children and adolescents is a key issue with regards to suicide prevention.

AB The adolescent with oral cleft must deal with the process of body changing and the psychological implications caused by morphological, functional, and esthetic impairments of the cleft itself. This study aimed to evaluate whether the cleft lip and palate types affects health-related quality of life of adolescents through Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Fifty-seven adolescents (29 males and 28 females; mean age 15 years and 11 months +/- 1 year and 2 months) were divided into 2 groups: Group 1-single cleft-unilateral or bilateral CL or CP; Group 2-complex cleft-unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate. The participants filled in SF-36 questionnaire to verify their functional, physical, and mental well-being profile. Spearman test assessed SF-36 scores correlation with age. Mann-Whitney U test verified the differences between genders and cleft types. Linear regression models were used to analyze confounding factors (age and gender). P was set at <0.05. The different SF-36 domains weakly correlated with age, ranging from -0.07 (P = 0.60) for the social aspects and 0.31 (P = 0.02) for general health. Females had statistically lower SF36 scores than males in the domains Bodily pain (P = 0.02), Vitality (P<0.001), and Mental Health (P<0.001). G1 showed lower scores in the domains Limitations due to Emotional Problems (P = 0.008) and Mental Health (P = 0.036). However, when the confounding factors (age and gender) were analyzed, the oral cleft type did not affect health-related quality of life (P> 0.05). Considering the age and gender, the cleft lip and palate types did not affect the health-related quality of life of adolescents.

AB Older adolescence represents a critical period of brain development whereby the prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher level thinking and emotional regulation, is under construction. During this period, the brain is wired to underestimate risk and overestimate pleasure, which primes young people towards risky, pleasure-oriented experiences. Substance use during this time can hinder brain maturation and lead to development related disorders. However, young people are the most likely to drink at risky quantities, use cannabis, MDMA and cocaine in the previous 12 months than any other age group. Despite this, there are no validated, age-appropriate prevention programs targeting school leavers, which leaves a group of young people to navigate a landscape where drug use is the most common, without formal support. Drug and alcohol prevention programs should be developed for this age group that combine features of universal prevention programs and targeted intervention programs to support the wider range of drug use behaviours relevant to this older audience. This article outlines potential evidence-based strategies that programs could focus on in the future.

AB Background/Objectives: According to existing evidence, parental educational practices and social anxiety are to some degree connected. However, the possibility that this relationship is an indirect one and is mediated by individual factors such as self-esteem or emotional regulation has not yet been explored. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the relationship between maternal and paternal educational practices and social anxiety, and test both the direct and the indirect pathways. Method: The representative sample consisted of 2,060 Andalusian students (47.7% girls, M-age = 14.34) who filled in various self-reports. Results: The structural equation models confirmed that a direct relationship, with a low effect size, exists between parental educational practices and social anxiety and that there is also an indirect relationship, mediated by negative self-esteem and emotional suppression (the emotional regulation strategy), which accounted here for 49.1% of the variance in social anxiety. Conclusions: Parental education practices seem to act as a family asset which either promotes or hinders the development of basic attitudes and competencies such as self-esteem or emotional regulation and, by doing this, either encourages or prevents the emergence of problems such as social anxiety.

ID PTSD
AB IMPORTANCE Despite the high prevalence, evidence-based treatments for abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescents have rarely been studied.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy (D-CPT) is more effective than a wait-list condition with treatment advice (WL/TA) among adolescents with PTSD related to childhood abuse.
   DESIGN, SETTING; AND PARTICIPANTS This rater-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (stratified by center) enrolled treatment-seeking adolescents and young adults (aged 14-21 years) with childhood abuse-related PTSD at 3 university outpatient clinics in Germany from July 2013 to June 2015, with the last follow-up interview conducted by May 2016. Of 194 patients, 88 were eligible for randomization.
   INTERVENTIONS Participants received D-CPT or WL/TA. Cognitive processing therapy was enhanced by a motivational and alliance-building phase, by including emotion regulation and consideration of typical developmental tasks, and by higher session frequency in the trauma-focused core CPT phase. In WL/TA, participants received treatment advice with respective recommendations of clinicians and were offered D-CPT after 7 months.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All outcomes were assessed before treatment (baseline), approximately 8 weeks after the start of treatment, after the end of treatment (posttreatment), and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed in clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for DSM-W [CAPS-CA]). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptoms, behavior problems, and dissociation.
   RESULTS The 88 participants (75 [85%] female) had a mean age of 18.1years (95% Cl, 17.6-18.6 years). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 44 participants receiving D-CPT (39 [89%] female) demonstrated greater improvement than the 44 WL/TA participants (36 [82%] female) in terms of PTSD severity (mean CAPS-CA scores, 24.7 [95% Cl, 16.6-32.7] vs 47.5 [95% Cl, 37.9-57.1]; Hedges g = 0.90). This difference was maintained through the follow-up (mean CAPS-CA scores, 25.9 [95% Cl, 16.2-35.6] vs 47.3 [95% Cl, 37.8-56.8]; Hedges g = 0.80). Treatment success was greatest during the trauma-focused core phase. The D-CPT participants also showed greater and stable improvement in all secondary outcomes, with between-groups effect sizes ranging from 0.65 to 1.08 at the posttreatment assessment (eg, for borderline symptoms, 14.1 [95% Cl, 8.0-20.2] vs 32.0 [95% Cl, 23.8-40.2]; Hedges g = 0.91).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD benefited more from D-CPT than from WL/TA. Treatment success was stable at the follow-up and generalized to borderline symptoms and other comorbidities.

AB Objectives: This study aims to investigate the impact of a therapeutic horse riding (HR) intervention and an audiovisual (AV) intervention comprising exposure to equine rhythm and motion on developmental parameters of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). Design: The study design was a pretest/post-test. Settings/Location: The study took place in three locations across Ireland-St. Michael's Boys School in Mervue, Co Galway, The Hunt Museum in Limerick City, Co. Limerick, and Fettercairn Youth Horse Project in Tallaght, Co. Dublin. Subjects: Eighty-three children (6-14 years) with a primary diagnosis of DCD. Interventions: Children meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into three groups: HR, AV, and a control (C) group. Those in the intervention groups participated in eight 30 min HR lessons or AV screening sessions. Outcome measures: A Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI) measured signs of depression. A Childhood Behavior CheckList (CBCL) determined any behavioral and emotional problems, while a Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) assessed the presence and extent of any social impairment. A GAITRite system provided an overall Functional Ambulation Performance (FAP) score (an automatic accumulated score of gait parameters, including gait speed, symmetry, distance, cadence, tension, support, and velocity), which was used to evaluate gait improvements. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a main effect of time on all variables. Bonferroni post hoc tests revealed that these effects were due to significant improvements in both HR and AV groups for CDI, CBCL, and SRS, and significant improvements in the HR group only for FAP. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence to support the value of an equine AV perception intervention at improving developmental parameters in children with DCD and provides additional support for the benefits of therapeutic HR on social, emotional, behavioral, and gait variables in these children.

AB Although the way children/adolescents regulate their emotions (e.g., by eating) may be related to their parents' emotion regulation abilities and parenting practices, little is known about how these parental variables are associated with children/adolescents' emotional eating, particularly when children/adolescents have overweight/obesity. This study explores whether mothers' difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) are associated with emotional eating in children/adolescents with overweight/obesity through mindful parenting skills and children/adolescents' depressive symptoms. The sample includes 379 mother-child/adolescent dyads recruited in public schools and in nutrition outpatient services of pediatric hospitals. Mothers completed self-report measures of DER and mindful parenting, and children/adolescents completed measures of depressive symptoms and emotional eating. Higher levels of mothers' DER were associated with higher levels of children/adolescents' depressive symptoms through lower levels of mindful parenting (indirect effect=0.09, p=0.002, 95% CI [0.03, 0.15]), and higher levels of mindful parenting were associated with lower levels of children/adolescents' emotional eating through lower levels of children/adolescents' depressive symptoms (indirect effect=-0.07, p=0.002, 95% CI [-.12, -.02]). The model was invariant across dyads recruited in schools and in hospitals and across children and adolescents. This study highlights the role of mothers' DER (particularly, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, and lack of emotional awareness) and of mindful parenting (particularly, listening with full attention, emotional awareness of the child, and self-regulation in parenting) on children/adolescents' depressive symptoms and emotional eating. Mothers' emotion regulation and mindful parenting should be further investigated in the pediatric obesity field.

AB Background: Psychological stress and poor sleep are associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, which are thought to be mediated in part by alterations in immune processes. However, the molecular bases of links among stress, sleep, and immune processes are not completely understood, particularly during adolescence when sensitivity to stress and problems with sleep tend to increase. In the current study, we investigated whether various stressors (daily stress, major life events, perceived stress), sleep indices (duration, efficiency), and their interactions (e.g., moderating effects) are associated with expression of genes bearing response elements for transcription factors that regulate inflammatory and anti-viral processes.
   Method: Eighty-seven late adolescents completed daily checklists of their social experiences across a 15-day period and reported on their major life events during the previous year. They also completed actigraphy-based assessments of sleep quality and duration during 8 consecutive nights. An average of 5.5 months later, participants reported on their global perceptions of stress during the previous month and provided blood samples for genome-wide expression profiling of mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
   Results: Higher levels of daily interpersonal stress and shorter sleep duration were associated with upregulation of inflammation-related genes bearing response elements for proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Shorter sleep duration was also linked to downregulation of antiviral-related genes bearing response elements for interferon response factors (IRFs). Lastly, there was a significant interaction between daily stress and shorter sleep duration, such that the association between daily stress and inflammation-related gene expression was exacerbated in the context of shorter sleep duration. Results were independent of sex, ethnicity, parent education, body mass index, and smoking and alcohol history.
   Conclusion: Everyday interpersonal stress and shortened sleep can be consequential for upstream NF-kappa B signaling pathways relevant to inflammatory processes during late adolescence. Notably, the occurrence of both may lead to even greater activation of NF-kappa B signaling.

AB Emotional feeding is an interpersonal emotion regulation strategy wherein people provide food to others as a means of influencing the recipient's emotional response. Parental emotional feeding has been linked to higher levels of emotional eating in children and adolescents using cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective designs; however, there is little research on emotional feeding as a developmental risk factor for emotional eating and binge-eating behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. This Idea Worth Researching article explores the rationale for studying emotional feeding as a lifespan construct and its potential implications for understanding eating disorder pathology. Specifically, it offers suggestions for examining emotional feeding as a predictor of emotional eating and binge-eating behavior across the lifespan, assessing potential intergenerational transmission pathways, and researching similarities in feeding styles and emotional eating across a variety of relationships beyond the parent-child dyad.

AB Objective Eating disordered (ED) behaviors (i.e., binge eating, compensatory behaviors, restrictive eating) and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; intentional and nonsuicidal self-harm) are highly comorbid and share several similarities, including consequent pain and physical damage. However, whereas NSSI is considered direct self-harm, ED behaviors are considered indirect self-harm. These distinctions stem from theoretical understanding that NSSI is enacted to cause physical harm in the moment, whereas ED behaviors are enacted for other reasons, with consequent physical harm occurring downstream of the behaviors. We sought to build on these theoretically informed classifications by assessing a range of self-harming intentions across NSSI and ED behaviors. Method Study recruitment was conducted via online forums. After screening for inclusion criteria, 151 adults reported on their intent to and knowledge of causing physical harm in the short- and long-term and suicide and death related cognitions and intentions when engaging in NSSI and specific ED behaviors. Results Participants reported engaging in ED and NSSI behaviors with intent to hurt themselves physically in the moment and long-term, alongside thoughts of suicide, and with some hope and knowledge of dying sooner due to these behaviors. Distinctions across behaviors also emerged. Participants reported greater intent to cause physical harm in the moment via NSSI and in the long-run via restrictive eating. NSSI and restrictive eating were associated with stronger endorsement of most suicide and death-related intentions than binge eating or compensatory behaviors. Conclusions Findings shed light on classification of self-harming behaviors, casting doubt that firm boundaries differentiate direct and indirectly self-harming behaviors.

AB In the current study, we compared emotion regulation abilities between post-institutionalized (PI; N = 124) and never-institutionalized non-adopted (NA; N = 172) children and adolescents (7-15 years). We assessed cortisol reactivity and coded emotion regulation during the speech portion of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-M). Parents reported on their children's social, academic, and behavioral adjustment. Results suggest that emotion regulation abilities increased with age, but this increase was greater for NA than PI youth. With regard to cortisol, piecewise growth modeling revealed that at higher levels of emotion regulation PI youth had greater baseline values (after a period of time allowing for acclimation to the laboratory) and had steeper recovery slopes than NA youth. There was also a main effect of emotion regulation on the reactivity slope suggesting that for both groups, as emotion regulation increased, the cortisol reactivity slope decreased. Finally, greater emotion regulation predicted fewer internalizing behavior problems for PI youth but not for NA youth.

AB This study assessed adolescent respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity while watching a bullying film clip from Boyz'n the Hood. We emphasized the importance of considering measurement context of RSA and examined whether RSA reactivity moderated the links between environmental factors (i.e., neighborhood violence, parental psychological control, and parental acceptance) and adolescent social adjustment. Data were collected from 57 adolescents and their primary caregivers. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration data were obtained from adolescents. Results indicated that neighborhood violence was positively associated with aggressive behavior but only among adolescents showing RSA augmentation, not suppression. Among youth displaying RSA suppression, parental acceptance was positively linked to prosocial behavior. We propose that, in the specific context of watching a bullying film clip, RSA suppression may relate to physiological regulation of emotion, which may differentially influence adolescents' responses to socialization.

AB The challenges involved in engaging young people who have a parent with a mental illness in research and in programs are well documented. Social networking sites provide a potentially useful medium to include at-risk youths and their families by removing some accessibility barriers that may prevent engagement and connection with individuals whose parents or family members have a mental illness. This paper examines how social networking sites can be used to recruit youths and/or their families and engage them in research. Applying a case study analysis, the implications of using social media as a tool for recruitment and data collection and the ethical considerations and limitations will be discussed. Results tentatively indicate that social networking sites may be an effective method to engage young people of parents with a mental illness. The study argues for more informed use of social platforms for the translation and dissemination of research and intervention prevention. Overall, this paper will contribute to public mental health practice through guidelines and policy about social media research with at-risk young people and their families.

AB Parental emotion socialization plays a role in the development of adolescents' emotion regulation and is associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms. Most research has focused on parental socialization of negative affect. The scarce research on parental socialization of positive affect (PA) shows that parental downgrading responses to adolescents' PA are associated with concurrent adolescent depression. The aims of the present study were to examine longitudinal associations of both maternal and paternal responses to adolescents' PA with how adolescents regulate their PA (i.e., dampening and enhancing) and with adolescents' general depressive symptoms and anhedonia. We also considered associations in the opposite direction from adolescent regulatory responses and symptoms to parental responses. In a two-wave study (1-year interval), 635 adolescents from Grade seven completed questionnaires. Cross-sectionally, maternal and paternal responses to adolescents' PA were associated with concurrent adolescents' PA regulation as well as adolescents' depressive and anhedonic symptoms. Longitudinally, low maternal and paternal enhancing responses to adolescents' PA predicted relative increases in anhedonic symptoms and relative decreases in adolescent enhancing over time. Low maternal enhancing was also predictive of relative increases in depressive symptoms. The present study points to bidirectionality of relations as adolescents' level of depressive symptoms predicted maternal and paternal responses.

AB An emerging body of research shows that parental socialization of positive affect (PA) is implicated in youth functioning, although most evidence comes from Western countries. In this study, focusing on adolescent girls in India, we examined associations among reports of parents' responses to adolescent PA, adolescent PA regulation, and adolescent depression. A total of 238 adolescent girls (13-18 years) and one of their parents (54% mothers) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires at the beginning of the school year (time 1) and five months later (time 2). At the bivariate level, parents' dampening and adolescent girls' dampening responses were each associated concurrently with adolescent depression at time 1. However, there were no significant direct associations between time 1 parents' dampening or enhancing responses and time 2 adolescent girls' depression (after controlling for time 1 depression). Using half-longitudinal models, a significant indirect effect was found from parental dampening of PA to increased adolescent depression via adolescent girls' own increased dampening. No indirect effect was found from parental enhancing to adolescent depression via adolescent girls' increased positive rumination. These findings are the first to demonstrate the relevance of PA socialization for girls in a non-Western culture.

AB Maternal socialization of positive affect (PA) is linked to children's regulation of positive and negative emotions and the development of psychopathology. However, few studies have examined multiple types of emotion socialization as related to children's PA regulation and depressive symptoms. The current study examined how mothers' socialization of children's PA regulation was related to children's PA regulation, and if children's PA regulation mediated the association between maternal socialization and children's depressive symptoms. Ninety-six mother-child dyads (children aged 7-12) completed questionnaires and a five-minute discussion about a positive event the child previously experienced; 76 dyads completed surveys again five months later. Partial correlations, controlling for child age and gender, indicated associations between maternal PA socialization and child PA regulation. Moderated mediation models suggested that maternal modeling of savoring predicted Time 2 child depressive symptoms via children's own savoring, which was moderated by Time 1 depressive symptoms. The moderated path indicated that only for children who reported higher depressive symptoms at Time 1, higher levels of savoring predicted lower depressive symptoms at Time 2. These results underscore the importance of examining multiple types of PA socialization and child PA regulation to predict children's depressive symptoms longitudinally.

AB In this study we investigated the effects of seeking versus avoiding proximity to mother on children's emotional recovery from a stressor. Sixty children 9-12 years underwent a moodinduction procedure and were randomly assigned to seek proximity from or avoid an image of their mothers. The effect of this manipulation on children's self-reported negative emotions, skin conductance and heart rate variability (respiratory sinus arhythmia) was assessed. Higher levels of attachment anxiety were linked to more self-reported sadness when children had to avoid mother, but no evidence for such an effect was found on a physiological level. For avoidant attachment, a similar pattern of results emerged, but both for self-reported sadness and skin conductance.

AB Background The population of left-behind children is growing rapidly in China in recent years. Without parents' company, left-behind children may develop severe emotional problems, which can trigger extreme behaviours such as self-harm and suicide. Previous literature suggests that mindfulness-based intervention could effectively alleviate a variety of sufferings such as anxiety and suicide ideation. The current study sought to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention on suicide ideation among left-behind children in China. Methods This study investigated the effects of an 8-week mindfulness training programme on suicide ideation of left-behind children in China. Forty-nine left-behind children completed a pretest and posttest on mindfulness level, social anxiety, self-esteem, and suicide ideation, with 21 in the mindfulness training group and 28 in the waitlist control group. Results Adjusting for pretest differences analyses of covariance found that, compared with waitlist control group, the mindfulness training group showed a significant improvement in mindfulness level and decreases in social anxiety and suicide ideation after the 8-week mindfulness training. Conclusion The findings from this study support that the use of mindfulness-based intervention can effectively reduce the suicide ideation and social anxiety of left-behind children in China.

AB Past research has reported that college students use alcohol to manage their negative affective experiences. However, this finding is somewhat mixed in mood induction studies, and it is also unclear which students are most vulnerable to drinking for these reasons. The current study examined the roles of child/adolescent trauma exposure with emphasis on early sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties on college students' alcohol-related tension reduction expectancies during a mood induction paradigm. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimentally induced negative or neutral mood condition with questionnaire batteries completed pre-and postinduction. Primary results were based on participants reporting exposure to at least one traumatic event (n = 134). Findings indicated that participants in the negative compared to the neutral mood condition reported heightened tension reduction expectancies; this was particularly salient as exposure to child/adolescent sexual abuse increased. A trend (p = .08) suggested that tension reduction expectancies were higher for participants in the negative mood condition, as reports of sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties increased, and after accounting for posttraumatic stress symptoms. Tension reduction expectancies as a risk factor for problem drinking following trauma exposure are discussed, and further, indications that risk for problem drinking following sexual abuse is associated with difficulties managing typical, rather than extreme levels of negative affect are emphasized. Clinical implications include the potential modification of brief alcohol interventions.

AB As the negative outcomes of harsh parenting for child development have been gradually revealed, researchers become increasingly interested in the mechanisms through which harsh parenting affects child development. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of child moral disengagement and the moderating role of negative parental attribution in the relation of harsh parenting to child aggression. A sample of 397 Chinese adolescents aged from 12 to 16 years (227 boys and 170 girls, Mage = 13.98) with their parents were recruited as participants from two public schools situated in rural areas of Shandong province in China. Data were gathered from parents reporting on their harsh parenting and negative parental attribution, adolescents reporting on their moral disengagement, and peers nominating out aggressive children. Results indicated that harsh parenting was both directly and indirectly associated with adolescent aggression via adolescent moral disengagement. Negative parental attribution was found to moderate the indirect relation of harsh parenting to adolescent aggression via moral disengagement. Specifically, harsh parenting was only significantly associated with moral disengagement for adolescents with high levels of moral disengagement was more likely to induce aggression among adolescents with high levels of negative parental attribution (bsimple = of harsh parenting to adolescent aggression, adolescent moral disengagement could mediate the association between harsh parenting and aggressive behaviors for adolescents with high levels of negative parental attribution.

AB Objective:The current study examined the impact of an activity-based mindfulness treatment on EEG indices of attention in youth with ADHD aged 11 to 17 years compared with a waitlist control group. Method: Pre- and post-treatment, EEG was recorded as participants completed a single-point focus rest task and two active attention tasks. Theta power, beta power, and theta/beta ratio (TBR) were calculated during each task. Results: A significant group by time by task interaction was found that indicated significant improvement in attentional ability, indexed by decreased TBR, for the treatment group but not controls. Conclusion: Findings support the benefit of mindfulness treatment for enhancing attentional control in youth with ADHD and extend the literature by providing evidence of these gains at a neural level. Findings also offer methodological support for the use of active attention tasks when examining mindfulness-related attentional gains in youth with ADHD. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a large-group, time-limited Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) adaptation for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and externalizing behavior problems (EBP).
   Methods Participants included parents of 37 preschoolers (M-age=4.80, 87% Male, 73% Hispanic/Latino) with ASD and comorbid EBP. Parents reported on their positive and negative parenting practices and parenting stress at a pre-and-post treatment assessment as well as at a 6-month follow-up assessment. Positive and negative parenting skills were observed and coded during a parent-child interaction. Additionally, parents were objectively assessed on their knowledge of principles learned in treatment at pre-and-post-treatment.
   Results The treatment was delivered with a high level of fidelity and was well received and attended by families. At post-treatment, parents reported improved parenting stress and parenting practices. Parents were also rated as engaging in more positive parenting skills and less negative parenting skills during play. Lastly, parents increased their knowledge of principles presented in treatment. Improvements in positive parenting practices were also maintained at a 6-month follow-up assessment.
   Conclusions Findings highlight the initial efficacy and transdiagnostic nature of group PCIT for improving outcomes for children with ASD and comorbid EBP.

AB The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C) is an intervention for children aged 7 to 13 targeting high negative emotion, emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation deficits common across emotional disorders. Our objective was to collect pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on the efficacy of the UP-C, comparing UP-C with an active, anxiety-focused intervention. Participants were 47 children with at least one primary anxiety disorder; approximately one half had elevated depression symptoms. Participants received either UP-C or the anxiety-focused control treatment. No condition-related differences were found with respect to diagnostic remission and anxiety symptoms. However, differences in favor of UP-C were observed with respect to treatment response at follow-up, depression symptoms, sadness dysregulation, and cognitive reappraisal. Results provide preliminary evidence that the UP-C may be at least as efficacious in treating anxiety as well-supported anxiety-specific treatment protocols and may produce greater gains in certain emotion reactivity and regulation variables.

AB Immigrant youth delinquency may be associated with developmental, familial, social, and immigration-specific factors; however, scarce studies have examined the perspectives of both parents and their children as to the reasons for involvement in delinquent behavior. This study examines the extent to which immigration-related stressors may be associated with delinquent behavior of immigrant adolescents from the Former Soviet Union in Israel, from the perspectives of both young people and their parents. In-depth interviews with 10 male delinquent immigrant mid-late adolescents, aged 16 to 21 years, and their parents (eight mothers and two fathers) were conducted (N = 20). Phenomenological analysis highlighted the immigration experience as a hidden matrix within which dynamics associated with delinquency evolved. These dynamics involved situational factors (age, financial hardships, and social norms related to child-rearing), social factors (peer pressure and wish to be socially accepted), familial factors (stress experienced by the family, parental unavailability, and insufficient parental capabilities), and personality factors (sensation-seeking, desire for self-direction, emotion dysregulation, weak character, and inborn inclination to problematic behavior). While few participants directly address the immigration process, it can be considered the backdrop or matrix within which these factors are evolving. Implications for prevention on personal, familial, and society levels are discussed.

AB This study examined group differences by grade (fifth graders in elementary school and sixth graders in middle school) and gender in academic (behavioral and emotional engagement, academic self-concept, and worry) and socio-emotional adjustment (self-esteem, social satisfaction, social self-concept, and worry). Self-report data were collected from 1,003 students in the fall and spring of the school year (51.2% female, 36.7% Black, 47.2% White, 7.5% Hispanic, 5.7% Asian, 3% Other). Grade differences were null or favored fifth graders for academic adjustment. Grade differences were null or favored sixth graders for socio-emotional adjustment. Gender differences were null or favored girls for academic and socio-emotional adjustment; however, girls reported more worry in both domains. Change over time generally disfavored girls leading to the emergence of, or increases in, gender gaps by spring. The discussion considers early adolescent development and the need for continued attention to middle school reform regarding academic adjustment and gender differences.

AB This study focused on the correlation among teachers' caring behavior, cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression and problem behaviors in adolescents and tested whether cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression mediate between teachers' caring behavior and problem behaviors in adolescents. Participants were 570 Chinese middle school students who reported measures of teachers' caring behavior, problem behaviors and strategies of emotion regulation. Structural equation modeling and bootstrap mediation tests were used. The results showed that teachers' caring behavior significantly negatively predicted problem behaviors in adolescents. Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression were found to play a mediating role between teachers' caring and problem behaviors in adolescents.

AB Rejection sensitivity is associated with social-emotional maladjustment in both childhood and adulthood. However, less is known about the etiology of rejection sensitivity. The present study tests an etiological model for rejection sensitivity using a high-risk sample (N = 227) with prospective data from infancy (i.e., 12 months) to adolescence (i.e., eighth grade). Evidence for social learning and attachment theories was demonstrated. In particular, family and parenting factors, such as family conflict and maternal harshness, were predictive of rejection sensitivity in adolescence. Implications for intervention and prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Suicide is the leading cause of death for incarcerated youth, and up to half of all juveniles in confinement experience suicidal ideation in addition to other psychopathology, including psychopathic personality features. Unfortunately, limited research has investigated the psychopathy-suicidality link among juvenile delinquents and using newer psychopathy measures. Based upon a statewide population of incarcerated juvenile offenders, we found that psychopathy was a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts, but the latter relationship was attenuated by lifetime depression diagnosis. In addition, certain affective psychopathic features such as Stress Immunity conferred protection against suicidality, whereas behavioral and lifestyle components including Carefree Nonplanfulness, Blame Externalization, and Rebellious Nonconformity were positively linked to suicidal thoughts among the youth offenders. As these risk factors are routinely screened for in juvenile justice settings, this study's findings have considerable implications to applied practice and prevention among juvenile justice involved youth.

AB The amygdala is critically involved in processing emotion. Through bidirectional connections, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is hypothesized to influence amygdala reactivity. However, research that elucidates the nature of amygdala-PFC interactions - through mapping amygdala-prefrontal tracts, quantifying variability among tracts, and linking this variability to amygdala activation - is lacking. Using probabilistic tractography to map amygdala-prefrontal white matter connectivity in 142 adolescents, the present study found that white matter connectivity was greater between the amygdala and the subgenual cingulate, orbitofrontal (OFC), and dorsomedial (dmPFC) prefrontal regions than with the dorsal cingulate and dorsolateral regions. Then, using a machine-learning regression, we found that greater amygdala-PFC white matter connectivity was related to attenuated amygdala reactivity. This effect was driven by amygdala white matter connectivity with the dmPFC and OFC, supporting implicit emotion processing theories which highlight the critical role of these regions in amygdala regulation. This study is among the first to map and compare specific amygdala-prefrontal white matter tracts and to relate variability in connectivity to amygdala activation, particularly among a large sample of adolescents from a well-sampled study. By examining the association between specific amygdala-PFC tracts and amygdala activation, the present study provides novel insight into the nature of this emotion-based circuit.

AB Sexual harassment-unwanted sexual comments, advances, or behaviors-and sexual violence are still prevalent worldwide, leading to a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional problems among those being harassed. In particular, youth in care are at risk of becoming perpetrators (and victims) of sexual harassment. However, in general, there are very few interventions targeting this at-risk group, and no such programs exist in the Netherlands. To this end, a group intervention program-Make a Move-targeting determinants of sexual harassment was developed. This program was implemented and evaluated among boys (N = 177) in Dutch residential youth care (20 institutions). A pre-test, post-test, and 6-month follow-up design including an intervention and a waiting list control group with randomized assignment of institutions (cluster randomized trial) was used to measure the effects of the intervention on determinants of sexual harassment. Multilevel (mixed) regression analysis with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (alpha = .005) showed no significant effects of Make a Move on determinants of sexual harassment (ps > .03, Cohen's ds < .44). Results are discussed in light of a three-way explanatory model focusing on intervention content, evaluation, and implementation as potential explanations for not finding any measurable intervention effects.

AB Explanatory theoretical models have proposed an association between problematic online gaming and abilities or strategies in alleviating distress or negative emotions in times of stress as proximal non-gaming-related personality factors. However, there is little research that has targeted how emotion regulation relates to problematic online gaming-especially during adolescence when gaming behavior is most prevalent. In emotion regulation research, there has been a particular emphasis on rumination because it is strongly associated with overall psychopathology. However, it is unknown whether this putatively maladaptive strategy relates to problematic online gaming and whether it is a gender-dependent association. Consequently, the present study examined how emotion regulation strategies, and particularly rumination, related to problem gaming and tested whether gender moderated this relationship in adolescents. In a national representative adolescent sample, 46.9% of the participants (N = 1,646) reported online gaming in the past 12 months and provided information on problematic gaming, and it was these data that were used for further analysis. Their data concerning problematic online gaming and emotion regulation strategies were analyzed, including rumination along with other putatively maladaptive (e.g., catastrophizing) and adaptive (e.g., positive reappraisal) strategies, while controlling for age, gender, and game genre preference. Results of linear regression analyses showed that all the putatively maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (including self-blame, other blame, catastrophizing, and rumination) were positively related to problematic online gaming. Positive reappraisal proved to be a protective factor; it was inversely related to problematic online gaming. In addition, the relationship between rumination and online gaming was moderated by gender (i.e., the relationship was stronger among boys). Based on the results, it is argued that emotion regulation is a useful framework to study problematic online gaming. The present study highlighted that the relative predictive value of rumination for problematic online gaming varied for boys and girls, suggesting that trait rumination might be a gender-specific vulnerability factor for problematic online gaming, but this requires further investigation and replication.

AB This study aimed to examine which specific emotion processes influence self-inflicted injury: basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia, baseline negative emotional intensity, emotional reactivity, or emotion regulation deficits. Self-injuring individuals with borderline personality disorder (N = 22) reported their lifetime self-injury frequency. Basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baseline skin conductance responses measurements were collected. Participants then either reacted as they usually would (i.e., emotional reactivity), or utilized mindfulness- or distraction-based strategies (i.e., emotion regulation), in response to negative images while self-reported negative emotion and skin conductance were monitored. Higher basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baseline emotional intensity predicted higher lifetime self-injury frequency. Chronic, resting emotion processes may be more important targets for reducing self-injury compared to labile, acute emotion processes.

AB In rural China, left-behind children are likely to suffer chronic loneliness. Research has identified a variety of factors that may be associated with loneliness among these children. A meta-analysis is needed to address the empirical inconsistencies and examine the strength of relations between different factors and loneliness. The current meta-analysis included 51 studies on predictors of loneliness published from 2008 to 2017. Results showed that one individual factor (social anxiety) is a key risk factor for loneliness, whereas eight individual (older age, self-esteem, resilience, extroversion) and contextual factors (family functioning, parent-child relationship, peer relationship, social support) serve as protective factors in predicting loneliness. In addition, boys were more likely to feel lonely than girls. Findings and implications of this study were discussed.

AB Background: Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) typically demonstrate profound executive function (EF) deficits that interfere with learning, socialization, and emotion regulation. We completed the first large, non-pharmacological controlled trial for FXS, designed to evaluate the efficacy of Cogmed, a computer/tablet-based working memory (WM) training program.
   Methods: The study was a randomized, blinded, parallel two-arm controlled trial in 100 children and adolescents with FXS (63 male, 37 female; 15.28 +/- 3.36 yrs.). Participants were randomized equally to adaptive (difficulty level adjusted to performance) or non-adaptive (control) Cogmed training. Participants were assessed at home using objective measures of WM (primary outcome) and EF at baseline, following 20-25 caregiver-supported sessions over 5-6 weeks, and at follow-up 3 months after cessation of training. Parents and teachers provided ratings of WM, attention, and EF.
   Results: The WM composite and selective domains of EF (distractibility, cognitive flexibility), as well as parent- and teacher-reported attention and EF, significantly improved across the full study sample, with many changes maintained at follow-up. However, comparisons of improvement between adaptive and non-adaptive control conditions did not differ, showing that progressively challenging the WM system by expanding span length did not provide added benefit overall.
   Conclusions: Further experimental comparisons are needed before Cogmed working memory training can be considered empirically validated for children with FXS, forming the basis of treatment recommendation. However, given that prior studies show no significant changes on these measures in FXS without treatment, that improvements were maintained for 3 months, and that blinded teachers reported improvements in the classroom, the modest benefits seen in both adaptive and non-adaptive groups overall are unlikely to be attributable to placebo or practice effects alone. Future analyses examining inter-individual differences (e.g., baseline capacity, training efficiency, co-morbidity, training environment, characteristics of training aide) may help to link this intervention to outcomes and potential transfer effects.

AB Background: College students are at increased risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) and sexual risk behaviors (SRB). Although students with a history of SITB appear to be more prone to SRB, the mechanisms linking these risk behaviors remain largely unexplored. Previous research points to emotional control (EC), defined as one's awareness and adaptability of emotions, as a potential mechanism explaining the relationship between SITB and SRB.1
   Methods: Data included 722 college students attending two different universities in the northeast and southeast regions of the United States. Multiple group structural equation models were fit to estimate the direct and indirect effects of history of SITB (suicidal ideation, attempt, and nonsuicidal self-injury) and EC on SRB jointly across men and women.
   Results: Findings supported indirect relationships between SITB and SRB through dysregulated EC, with type of SITB and patterns of SRB differing between men and women. For women, history of suicidal ideation and nonsuicidal self-injury were indirectly related to increased SRB through dysregulated EC. For men, history of suicidal ideation showed an indirect relationship on SRB through EC.
   Limitations: Although this study employed random sampling,limitations include a cross-sectional design, which does not allow for causal inference, and reliance on self-report assessment data.
   Conclusions: College students with a history of SITB who experience dysregulated EC may be more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. Clinicians working with college students should concomitantly consider suicide and self-injury with SRB and consider interventions to improve EC.

   RELIABILITY; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a major, trans-diagnostic mental health problem among adolescents. Alexithymia has been identified as a developmental risk factor for NSSI. Research on how alexithymia relates to the neurobiology of automatic emotion processing is only beginning to emerge. This study evaluates the relationship between alexithymic features and neural responses to automatic processing of emotional content in adolescents with NSSI.
   Methods: 25 female adolescents (ages 13-21) with a history of repeated engagement in NSSI completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a task in which participants were exposed to masked emotions.
   Results: One facet of alexithymia, limited internal emotion awareness or externally-oriented thinking (EOT), was related to differential reactivity to masked emotional faces in clusters in the right supramarginal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus. Follow-up assessment of regional reactivity revealed that greater EOT is associated with lower activation to masked happy faces but higher activation to masked fearful faces. Other facets of alexithymia did not show relationships with reactivity to masked emotional faces.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional and small sample that only includes females, which may attenuate generalizability of findings.
   Conclusions: We report neural correlates of multiple facets of alexithymia in adolescents with NSSI. Among adolescents who self-harm, those with higher levels of EOT may be less alert to subtle positively-valenced emotion cues. For this subset of adolescents with NSSI, interventions designed to enhance mental representation of emotional responses and attention to positive emotions may be appropriate.

AB Rumination is an involuntary cognitive process theorized to prolong arousal and inhibit proper emotion regulation. Most available research has examined individual differences in cognitive dispositions to ruminate about stress as a risk marker for psychopathology and other health problems. This intensive longitudinal study extended previous research by examining day-to-day associations of rumination about stress with objectively-measured actigraph-based sleep and diurnal salivary cortisol activity. Sixty-one healthy participants (M-age = 20.91) completed up to five ecological momentary assessments (EMA) each day and wore actigraph wristwatches for eight days (N = 488). On three of these days, participants provided five saliva samples assayed for cortisol (N = 910). On average, greater daily stress levels were associated with shorter sleep duration and higher waking cortisol levels. In day-to-day analyses, greater daily stress levels, when combined with ruminating about daily stress more than usual, was associated with higher waking cortisol levels the following morning. Ruminating more than usual about daily stress, in the context of low-stress days, was also associated with flatter diurnal cortisol slopes the next day. These findings highlight the potential influences of daily stress, and rumination about stress, on sleep and diurnal cortisol activity - two important markers of health and well-being.

TI Age-Related Differences in the Late Positive Potential during Emotion
   Regulation between Adolescents and Adults

AB The late positive potential (LPP) has been well documented in predicting the effect of emotion regulation in previous developmental literature. However, few studies have examined age-related changes in emotion regulation from adolescence to adulthood using this biomarker. To test this, Reactivity and Regulation-Image Task was used to test 18 young adolescents and 22 adults to examine the modulation of LPP during emotion regulation. Results revealed that (a) on the behavioral level, adults reported higher intensity of emotional experience than adolescents when they were asked to use up-regulation. Down-regulation showed no age effect for self-reported rating; (b) adolescents showed higher amplitudes of LPP than adults when using different regulatory strategies in all windows; (c) In late time window, regulation effect was larger when using up-regulation strategy than down-regulation strategy for adolescents, while the difference between the two strategies was negligible for adults. (d) In early time window, reactivity effect was larger in negative conditions than in positive conditions for adolescents, while the difference between the two conditions was again negligible for adults. Differences in the amplitudes and time courses of LPP during emotion regulation between adolescents and adults suggested that age-related changes in emotion regulation may occur during adolescence.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of childhood psychopathologies in Turkey.
   Method: A nation-wide, randomly selected, representative population of 5830 children (6-13 years-old) enrolled as a 2nd,3rd or 4th grade student in 30 cities were evaluated for presence of a psychiatric or mental disorder by a Sociodemographic Form, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), and DSM-IV-Based Screening Scale for Disruptive Behavior Disorders in Children and Adolescents scales. Impairment criterion was assessed via a 3 point-Likert scale by the parent and the teacher independently.
   Results: Overall prevalence of any psychopathology was 37.6% without impairment criterion, and 17.1% with impairment criterion. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by anxiety (19.5% and 16.7% without impairment, 12.4% and 5.3% with impairment, respectively). Lower education level and presence of a physical or psychiatric problem of the parents were independent predictors of any psychopathology of the offspring.
   Conclusion: This is the largest and most comprehensive epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of psychopathologies in children and adolescents in Turkey. Our results partly higher than, and partly comparable to previous national and international studies. It also contributes to the literature by determining the independent predictors of psychopathologies in this age group.

AB Objectives: Attachment insecurity may be more pronounced among young gay and bisexual men (YGBM). Further, attachment insecurity is associated with dysregulated patterns of emotion regulation, which can lead to depression. However, pathways linking attachment insecurity to depression are underexplored among YGBM. Methods: This study used pilot data from N = 67 YGBM to examine if emotion dysregulation mediated the association between attachment insecurity and depression. Results: Results supported the study hypotheses. Attachment insecurity was associated with emotion dysregulation, which was associated with depression. Conclusion: Findings provide preliminary evidence that emotion regulation training may be a useful approach for addressing depression among YGBM.

AB Childhood maltreatment is associated with risk for suicidal ideation later in life, yet more research is needed on the indirect effects and bioregulatory protective factors in this association. The present study aimed to investigate the indirect influence of childhood maltreatment on suicidal ideation in emerging adulthood via level of self-esteem, and examine the moderating role of heart rate variability (HRV; a proxy for emotion regulation) in this indirect association. The study included a sample of 167 non-metropolitan emerging adults (M-age = 21.17, 55.8% female) of low-socioeconomic status (low-SES). HRV data were obained using an electrocardigram, whereas childhood maltreatment, suicidal ideation, and self-esteem data were obtained via self-report. Childhood maltreatment was indirectly associated with suicidal ideation via reduced self-esteem. HRV buffered this indirect association. Childhood maltreatment poses a risk for the development of suicidal ideation. Interventions that bolster self-esteem and emotion regulation may reduce suicide risk for emerging adults with a history of childhood maltreatment.

AB Depression is associated with increased emotional response to stress. This is especially the case during the developmental period of adolescence. Cognitive reappraisal is an effective emotion regulation strategy that has been shown to reduce the impact of emotional response on psychopathology. However, less is known about whether cognitive reappraisal impacts the relationship between depressive symptoms and emotional responses, and whether its effects are specific to emotional reactivity or emotional recovery. The current study examined whether cognitive reappraisal moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms and trait or state measures of emotional reactivity and recovery. A community sample of 127 adolescents (M-age = 15.28; 49% female, 47% Caucasian), at an age of risk for depression, completed self-report measures of trait emotional responding and depressive symptoms. In addition, they completed an in vivo social stress task and were assessed on state emotional reactivity and recovery from the stressor. Findings suggested that cognitive reappraisal was associated with an attenuated impact of depressive symptoms on trait and state emotional recovery. These results provide evidence that cognitive reappraisal may be an effective strategy for improving some aspects of emotional responding in relation to depressive symptoms among adolescents.

AB Research on implementation of school-based transdiagnostic interventions, conducted by personnel from the municipal services is limited. We investigated facilitators and barriers regarding implementation of EMOTION, an intervention targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in children 8-12 years. Trained health- and childcare professionals completed one questionnaire before (N = 63) and a separate questionnaire after running an EMOTION group (N = 66). Twelve of the group leaders were interviewed to provide additional information regarding implementation. Results indicated that factors such as a perceived need for the intervention and positive attitudes from the group leaders facilitated implementation. Hindering factors were related to time constraints, workload, unsupportive leaders, and lack of cooperation from the schools. Allocating resources to implementation specifically could promote future use of the program.

AB Assessing anger regulation via self-reports is fraught with problems, especially among children. Behavioral observation provides an ecologically valid alternative for measuring anger regulation. The present study uses data from two waves of a longitudinal study to present a behavioral observation approach for measuring anger regulation in middle childhood. At T1, 599 children from Germany (6-10 years old) were observed during an anger eliciting task, and the use of anger regulation strategies was coded. At T2, 3 years later, the observation was repeated with an age-appropriate version of the same task. Partial metric measurement invariance over time demonstrated the structural equivalence of the two versions. Maladaptive anger regulation between the two time points showed moderate stability. Validity was established by showing correlations with aggressive behavior, peer problems, and conduct problems (concurrent and predictive criterion validity). The study presents an ecologically valid and economic approach to assessing anger regulation strategies in situ.

AB Dispositional Mindfulness (DM) is the awareness of the thoughts and feelings in the present moment. DM in children and adolescents has been related to mechanisms of change in mindfulness-based interventions, which have shown significant mediation relationships with mental health outcomes (for instance, lower social anxiety, depression symptoms, or perceived stress). However, the assessment of DM among children and adolescents is being unsatisfactory due cultural biases and/or reliability issues. In this study, we examined the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) in a sample of 687 children and adolescents between 8 and 16 years old. Although the CAMM has been validated in English, Portuguese, Italian, and Catalonian versions, until now no data has been reported in a Spanish context. Results showed that the best CAMM factor structure was constituted by five items from the original version (1, 4, 7, 8, and 9). These items defined dispositional mindfulness. The rest of the items (2, 3, 5, 6, and 10) were eliminated from the Spanish final version. The analyses revealed good reliability and internal consistency for the Spanish version of the CAMM. As we expected, the confirmatory factor analysis showed the unidimensional structure of the CAMM.

SO JOURNAL OF INDIAN ASSOCIATION FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH

DT Article
DE Emotion regulation; temperament; parental emotions; socialization;
   goodness-of-fit
ID BOYS; BEHAVIOR; MOTHERS
AB Background: Socialization processes are among the many influences which affect the development of individual differences in emotion regulation, along with biological predispositions and inclinations. Through this study, an attempt is being made to see how temperament, conceptualized as a biological construct and emotion socialization, an environmental variable, interact together and how they influence the use of specific emotion regulation strategies by the children. The study looked at exploring patterns of emotion socialization by parents, the temperament of children, emotion regulation by children and the interaction between these three variables.
   Method: The study was conducted on a sample of 52 children aged between 10-12 years and their parents taken from a private school in Delhi. Data was collected using three questionnaires. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) was administered to the children to assess their use of two emotion regulation strategies - Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression. The Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES) was used to assess parental responses to children's expression of negative emotions and the School age temperament inventory (SATI) was used to assess the temperament of the children on four dimensions. Both these questionnaires were filled up by the parents. The data was analysed quantitatively using descriptive data, correlations, t-tests and regression analysis.
   Results: Emotion regulation was not significantly related to emotion socialization by parents or with temperament. Multiple regression also did not find a significant predictive value. However, significant correlations were found between specific temperamental characteristics of the child and the use of parental responses to the child's negative emotions.
   Conclusion: The study emphasized the need for studying emotion socialization as a comprehensive construct and understanding the relationship between temperament of the child and emotion socialization practices within a goodness-of-fit model. The findings have implications for looking at the unique cultural context within which the processes of emotion socialization and emotion regulation are embedded to foster more efficacious and customized interventions in the field of child development and mental health.

AB Objective To determine the efficacy in improving pain and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of an online self-management program for adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
   Methods Youth ages 12-18 years with JIA were recruited from 10 rheumatology clinics across the United States and randomized to complete an online self-management program (n=144) or an online disease education program (n=145). Participants in the self-management group worked through multimedia-based modules comprising psychoeducation, training in cognitive-behavioral coping skills and stress management, and other self-management topics over a 12-week period. Participants in the control group viewed a series of preselected quality educational websites about JIA over the same interval. Online content for both groups was made available in English and Spanish to facilitate inclusion of Hispanic participants. Blinded assessment of main outcomes (pain intensity, pain interference, and HRQOL) and process outcomes (disease knowledge, self-efficacy, pain coping, and emotional adjustment) occurred at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6- and 12-month postrandomization follow-up visits.
   Results Participants on average demonstrated significant improvements over the study period in the main outcomes, with no significant group differences in the degree of improvement. Effect sizes for these improvements were small. The amount of improvement in self-efficacy, emotional avoidance coping, disease knowledge, and emotional functioning in part predicted improvement in pain and HRQOL outcomes.
   Conclusions Primarily self-directed online self-management training and online disease education comparably and modestly improve pain and HRQOL in youth with JIA.

AB Background: The rapid advancement in media technology has radically changed the way we learn and interact with one another. Games, with their engaging and interactive approach, hold promise in the delivery of knowledge and building of skills. This has potential in child and adolescent mental health work, where the lack of insight and motivation for therapy are major barriers to treatment. However, research on the use of serious games in mental health interventions for children and adolescents is still in its infancy.
   Objective: This study adds to the research on serious games in mental health interventions through the development and evaluation of RegnaTales, a series of 6 mobile apps designed to help children and adolescents manage anger. We examined the usability and playability of RegnaTales, as well as children's aggression levels before and after the game play.
   Methods: A total of 72 children aged between 6 and 12 years were recruited for the study. Thirty-five participants had a clinical diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), whereas 37 were typically developing (TD) children. Each child played 1 of the 6 RegnaTales apps for approximately 50 min before completing the Playability and Usability Questionnaire The Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire was completed before and after the game play.
   Results: The overall results showed high levels of enjoyment and playability. TD children and children with DBD had similar experienced fun and perceived playability scores on all 6 mobile apps. All 6 mobile apps garnered comparable experienced fun and perceived playability scores. Furthermore, 42% (5/12) to 67% (8/12) of the children indicated that they would like to play the games again. Importantly, children felt that they acquired skills in anger management, were motivated to use them in their daily lives, and felt confident that the skills would help them better manage their anger. Children reported significantly lower reactive aggression after playing the mobile apps Rage Raver (P=.001), Abaddon (P=.008), and RegnaTools (P=.03). These apps focused on the psychoeducation of the link between thoughts and emotions, as well as equipping the participants with various emotion regulation strategies such as relaxation and cognitive restructuring.
   Conclusions: This study presents evidence to support RegnaTales as a feasible serious game. The preliminary findings associated with reduction in reactive aggression, coupled with future research to further establish its efficacy, could warrant RegnaTales as a potential intervention for anger issues among clinical and community populations.

AB Mental illnesses originate early in life, governed by environmental and genetic factors. Because parents are a dominant source of signals to the developing child, parental signals - beginning with maternal signals in utero are primary contributors to children's mental health. Existing literature on maternal signals has focused almost exclusively on their quality and valence (e.g. maternal depression, sensitivity). Here we identify a novel dimension of maternal signals: their patterns and especially their predictability/unpredictability, as an important determinant of children's neurodevelopment. We find that unpredictable maternal mood and behavior presage risk for child and adolescent psychopathology. In experimental models, fragmented/unpredictable maternal care patterns directly induce aberrant synaptic connectivity and disturbed maturation of cognitive and emotional brain circuits, with commensurate memory problems and anhedonia-like behaviors. Together, our findings across species demonstrate that patterns of maternal signals influence brain circuit maturation, promoting resilience or vulnerability to mental illness.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the measurement invariance of the Chinese version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA; Gullone and Taffe (Psychological Assessment, 24(2), 409-417, 2011)) across gender. A total of 1388 Chinese adolescents (48.1% males), ranging in age from 11 to 16 years (M = 12.9, SD = 1.09) were recruited from four Chinese middle schools and completed the ERQ-CA. The Cronbach's values, omega coefficients, and item-total correlations for the two subscales of the ERQ-CA indicated adequate internal consistency reliability. The results of confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group confirmatory factor analysis revealed that all configural, metric, scalar, and partial strict invariance models provided acceptable fit to the data. The result of latent means analysis demonstrated statistically non-significant differences between boys and girls. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the ERQ-CA displays appropriate measurement invariance across gender for Chinese youth of ages 11 to 16.

AB Purpose: Teacher ratings were used to compare children with developmental language disorders (DLD) and their typically developing peers on 2 subtypes of social withdrawal (shyness and unsociability). Measurement invariance analysis was utilized to determine if teachers rated the 2 groups using the same underlying construct for each of the rating scale items that have been designed to assess withdrawn behavior.
   Method: The Teacher Behavior Rating Scale (TBRS; C. H. Hart & Robinson, 1996) was administered to the teachers of 173 children with DLD and 182 typically developing children (age range: 5; 0-12; 11 years; months) to compare 2 subtypes of withdrawal, shyness and unsociability. Measurement invariance analysis was used to establish an appropriate basis for comparing the latent group means and other structural parameters, and partial invariance models were used to compare the groups.
   Results: For the TBRS, shyness and unsociability were measured by 4 and 5 items, respectively. The measurement invariance analysis indicated that classroom teachers approached 1 item on each of these scales using a different underlying construct when rating the 2 groups of children. Taking this into account, the groups were compared. Teachers rated children with DLD as significantly more withdrawn on both shyness and unsociability in comparison with typically developing children. Age and gender were not significant factors.
   Conclusions: When conducting assessments, it should not be assumed that teachers or other raters approach even commonly used rating scale items using the same underlying perception for typically developing children and children with disorders. However, the analysis of invariant items on the TBRS reconfirmed that children with DLD are at risk for social withdrawal as operationalized by assessments of both shyness and unsociability.

AB Emotion regulation skills develop substantially across adolescence, a period characterized by emotional challenges and developing regulatory neural circuitry. Adolescence is also a risk period for the new onset of anxiety and depressive disorders, psychopathologies which have long been associated with disruptions in regulation of positive and negative emotions. This paper reviews the current understanding of the role of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescent anxiety and depression, describing findings from self-report, behavioral, peripheral psychophysiological, and neural measures. Self-report studies robustly identified associations between emotion dysregulation and adolescent anxiety and depression. Findings from behavioral and psychophysiological studies are mixed, with some suggestion of specific impairments in reappraisal in anxiety. Results from neuroimaging studies broadly implicate altered functioning of amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitries, although again, findings are mixed regarding specific patterns of altered neural functioning. Future work may benefit from focusing on designs that contrast effects of specific regulatory strategies, and isolate changes in emotional regulation from emotional reactivity. Approaches to improve treatments based on empirical evidence of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescents are also discussed. Future intervention studies might consider training and measurement of specific strategies in adolescents to better understand the role of emotion regulation as a treatment mechanism.

AB The main purpose of the current study was to investigate the predictive role of emotion regulation strategies on depression and psychosomatic symptoms in adolescents. The secondary purpose was to examine the predictive role of some demographic variables on depression and psychosomatic symptoms. The participants for this study comprised 319 high school students [G=155 (48.6%), B=164 (51.4%)], attending three high schools from 9th to 11th grade, and representing different socioeconomic levels in Diyarbakr city center. A Personal Data Form was used to gather data regarding demographic variables. The Turkish version the Children's Depression Inventory, Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire, and Psychosomatic Subscale of Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale were the instruments of the study. Standard regression analysis revealed that academic achievement and grade level were significant predictors of depressive symptoms, while academic achievement and gender variables had predictive power for psychosomatic symptoms. Moreover, hierarchical regression analysis indicated that all emotion regulation strategies played a predictive role in depression, while internal dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and external dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies were significant predictors of psychosomatic symptoms. Taking into consideration that the research findings revealed that emotion regulation strategies played a predictive role on both depression and psychosomatic symptoms, assisting adolescents to develop functional emotion regulation strategies may improve the mental health quality of adolescents.

AB This study examines the correlates of authoritative (warmth and strictness), indulgent (warmth but not strictness), authoritarian (strictness but not warmth), and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness) parenting with short- and long-term socialization outcomes in adolescents and adults, with and without poor school performance during adolescence. Short- and long-term socialization outcomes were captured by multidimensional self-esteem (academic/professional, emotional, and family), psychological maturity (self-competence, social competence, and empathy), and emotional maladjustment (nervousness, emotional instability, and hostility). Participants (1195 female and 874 male) consisted of a community sample of adolescents (n = 602), young adults (n = 610), middle-aged adults (n = 469) and older adults (n = 388). Design was a 4 x 3 x 2 x 4 MANOVA (parenting style x school performance x sex x age). Results indicated that the relationship between parenting styles and children's socialization outcomes does not vary as a function of school performance. The link between parenting styles and socialization outcomes shares a common short- and long- term pattern in adolescents and adults: Indulgent parenting was related to equal or even better socialization outcomes than authoritative parenting, whereas authoritarian and neglectful styles were associated with the worst socialization outcomes.

AB The present study focuses on analyzing the relationship between the parental acceptance-rejection perceived by adolescents and emotional instability from the early stages of adolescence. Special attention will be paid to potential differences between mothers and fathers. A total of 1181 students, aged 11-17, took part in the study. We used the factor of emotional instability in the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ-NA) and an affect scale (EA-H) to measure parental acceptance-rejection. The analyses performed show a clear association between emotional instability with maternal/paternal criticism and rejection. Specifically, maternal criticism and rejection in early adolescence and paternal criticism and rejection in middle adolescence were associated with emotional instability, confirming the association between children's and adolescents' emotional adjustment and family dynamics. This study makes interesting contributions to understanding paternal and maternal rejection during the different stages of adolescence. These differences should be incorporated into the research on parental influence and its role in the development of personality among adolescents.

AB The aim of this paper is to describe a school-based universal intervention (the Tilly's Life Center "I Am Me" program) to promote emotional competence and social-emotional skills in adolescents. We present results of a mixed-methods program evaluation conducted in public schools in Southern California. In Study 1, sixteen students (grades 10-12) participated in focus groups after twelve weeks of intervention. In Study 2, fifty-four students (grades 9-10) participated in either the universal intervention program (I Am Me) or a no-intervention comparison group for thirty-six weeks. We conducted focus groups with 50 adolescents in the I Am Me program and used quantitative methods to measure self-esteem and perceived stress at four time points for both groups in Study 2. Descriptive data suggested improvements in self-esteem and perceived stress among individuals participating in the I Am Me group. Thematic analysis of focus group data indicated that participants perceived improvement in key areas of emotional development, including: emotional competence (understanding, expressing, and regulating emotions), self-regulation, self-esteem, and social skills. Moreover, participants perceived the intervention as relevant and as having a positive lifelong impact on their development. Further research is needed to empirically validate these outcomes using a randomized experimental design.

AB Objective Self-esteem and self-consciousness are important determinants of behaviors. This study aimed to explore the relationship between self-esteem and self-consciousness in adolescents using the eye-tracking measurement.
   Methods Fifty-five adolescents with high self-esteem and 58 adolescents with low self-esteem participated in self-consciousness-related eye-tracking experiments of selecting happy, disgusted, and angry facial emotions while recognizing one's own usual expressions and the others' usual expressions toward oneself.
   Results When recognizing one's own, adolescents with high self-esteem showed significantly more selection counts and longer fixation time for 'happy' than adolescents with low self-esteem. When recognizing the others', adolescents with low self-esteem showed significantly more selection counts and longer fixation time for 'disgusted' and 'angry' than adolescents with high self-esteem.
   Conclusion These suggest higher self-esteem is connected to more positive identification of one's usual expressions and others' usual expressions toward oneself. There is a close relationship among low self-esteem, suppressing positive emotions, decreased psychological adjustment, and increased negative emotions.

AB Young adults' concerns and coping strategies related to their face-to-face interactions with their grandparents/great-grandparents with dementia were explored through the lens of a solidarity-conflict conceptual framework. Participants indicated concerns about their inability to maintain the relational connection, not knowing what to say or how to behave, their lack of perspective-taking skills and emotion-regulation strategies, interacting with an ever-changing other, as well as concerns about other co-participants in the interaction. Participants' coping strategies were driven by two interaction motives: maintaining solidarity (e.g., desire to maintain and improve the interaction with the grandparent by seeking the other's company, loving the other, and maintaining the other's personhood) and dealing with conflict (e.g., dealing with self-focused concerns about lack of skills and knowledge by engaging in substitute avenues for communication and down-regulating negative affect). Implications for improving interactions between young adults and their grandparents/great-grandparents with dementia are discussed.

AB Young people are presenting to specialist gender services in higher numbers than before and many with significant psychosocial difficulties. Negative experiences of stigma, difficult peer relationships and discrimination exacerbate distress and psychological difficulties, negatively impacting wellbeing and resilience. Social support is advocated as a means of supporting young people with diverse gender identifications, such as through peer support groups. This article describes the establishment of a young persons' group in 2011 within the United Kingdom's Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), for those attending the service as a means of enabling their coping with difficult experiences and facilitating their wellbeing and resilience through effective social support. The group was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures and has subsequently run each year. Now in its sixth year, the authors reflect on their learning and experiences.

AB Background: Little is known about how social and cultural variants interact with gender identity development. This article aims to identify the ethnicities of children and young people referred to the United Kingdom's national Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), and compare the ethnicity data with the UK child population and referrals to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Methods: GIDS referrals made between April 2012 and April 2015 for children and young people were retrieved. Ethnicity data were obtained by the '16 + 1' ethnicity list. Chi-square and t-tests were performed on the demographics. Results: Less than 10% of the 995 referrals at GIDS were from Black and minority ethnic (BME) groups - an underrepresentation as compared with both the national population and CAMHS figures. No significant differences in ethnic representation were found between the demographic birth-assigned sexes, across age groups, or year of referral. Conclusions: Hypotheses proposed for this underrepresentation take into account both the potential barriers to accessing services and the possibility of cross-cultural variations in the conceptualisations of gender, gender roles and gender diversity. Ethnicity, culture and religion, and their overlapping relationship with gender need further exploration.

AB Gender is a fast-evolving and topical field which is often the centre of attention in the media and in public policy debates. The current cultural and social climate provides possibilities for young people to express themselves. Gender diverse young people are not only developing new ways of describing gender, but they are also shaping what is required of clinical interventions. Emerging cultural, social and clinical trends, such as increases in referrals, shifts in sex ratio and diversification in gender identification, illustrate that gender diverse individuals are not a homogeneous group. How do evolving concepts of gender impact the clinical care of gender diverse young people presenting to specialist gender clinics today?

AB Introduction: There are potential long-term psychosocial effects of experiencing peer victimization during adolescence, including: internalizing symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and risks behaviors such as substance use. While social-emotional theories of development note associations between deficits in emotion competencies and peer victimization in childhood, these associations are less established among adolescent samples. Identifying which inadequacies in emotional competence place particular adolescents at risk for peer victimization may provide insight into the developmental pathways leading to unfavorable outcomes.
   Methods: The current study examined the relation between emotional competence and overt peer victimization among adolescents. Adolescents living in a mid-sized urban city in the southeastern region of the United States (N = 357; Mage = 12.14 years, 92% African American) reported their emotional awareness and reluctance to express emotion at baseline. Two years later, adolescents reported their regulation of anger and caregivers reported on adolescents' global emotion regulation. Adolescents also reported on occurrences of overt peer victimization during the previous 30 days at baseline and during the two-year follow up.
   Results: Our hypothesized model fit the data adequately. Greater emotion awareness was associated with higher scores on caregiver-rated emotion regulation and adolescent-rated anger regulation two years later, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Further, greater expressive reluctance was associated with greater anger regulation, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Patterns of associations did not vary by sex or age.
   Conclusions: The present study extends models of social-emotional development and peer interactions into the development age stage of adolescence.

AB Educational neuroscience is an interdisciplinary research field that seeks to translate research findings on neural mechanisms of learning to educational practice and policy and to understand the effects of education on the brain. Neuroscience and education can interact directly, by virtue of considering the brain as a biological organ that needs to be in the optimal condition to learn ('brain health'); or indirectly, as neuroscience shapes psychological theory and psychology influences education. In this article, we trace the origins of educational neuroscience, its main areas of research activity and the principal challenges it faces as a translational field. We consider how a pure psychology approach that ignores neuroscience is at risk of being misleading for educators. We address the major criticisms of the field comprising, respectively, a priori arguments against the relevance of neuroscience to education, reservations with the current practical operation of the field and doubts about the viability of neuroscience methods for diagnosing disorders or predicting individual differences. We consider future prospects of the field and ethical issues it raises. Finally, we discuss the challenge of responding to the (welcome) desire of education policymakers to include neuroscience evidence in their policymaking, while ensuring recommendations do not exceed the limitations of current basic science.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with deficits in response inhibition, response execution, and emotion regulation. However, the nature of the associations among these deficits remains unclear. Thus, this study examines these associations using a multi-method design. One hundred sixty-six children (aged 5-13years; 66.3% male; 75 with ADHD) completed two conditions (i.e., neutral and fear) of an emotional go/no-go task. Parasympathetic-based regulation was indexed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and sympathetic-based reactivity was indexed via cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP). Overall, children exhibited more difficulty with response execution (i.e., more omission errors, fewer correct go responses) and less difficulty with response inhibition (i.e., fewer commission errors, more correct no-go responses) during the fear condition than the neutral condition. Children with ADHD displayed more difficulty with response execution during the fear condition compared to typically developing youth. Additionally, children with ADHD displayed parasympathetic-based dysregulation (i.e., RSA increase from baseline) and reduced sympathetic-based reactivity (i.e., PEP lengthening) compared to typically developing youth across task conditions. In sum, children with ADHD demonstrate greater difficulty with response execution during emotionally salient contexts, as well as parasympathetic-based emotion dysregulation. Future work should examine these associations longitudinally with the aim of predicting impairment and treatment response in youth with ADHD.

AB Emotion network density describes the degree of interdependence among emotion states across time. Higher density is theorized to reflect rigidity in emotion functioning and has been associated with depression in adult samples. This paper extended research on emotion networks to adolescents and examined associations between emotion network density and: 1) emotion regulation and 2) symptoms of depression. Data from a daily diary study (t=21days) of adolescents (N=151; 61.59% female; mean age=14.60 years) were used to construct emotion network density scores. Emotion regulation was measured using The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form (DERS-SF). Depression was measured using the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-Short Version (RCADS-SV). Associations between emotion network density and DERS-SF were examined through Pearson correlations. Multiple regression analyses examined associations between emotion network density and depression. Emotion network density was not associated with the DERS-SF. Follow-up analyses showed that it was positively associated with non-acceptance of emotions (a subscale of the DERS-SF). Emotion network density was positively associated with RCADS-SV depression. Non-acceptance of emotions may encourage the spread of emotion across time and states given that a feature of non-acceptance is to have secondary emotional responses to one's emotions. Emotion networks that are self-predictive may be a risk factor for adolescent depression.

AB Children with autism incur trauma and have increased vulnerabilities for experiencing trauma. This paper summarizes the current literature in the study of trauma in typically developing children and those with autism. A treatment model for children with autism, drawing on components from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), trauma-focused CBT, and CBT to teach emotion regulation and treat anxiety in children with autism is suggested. Components include: (a) Functional Behavior Assessment; (b) behavior plans and behavioral skills training; (c) teaching emotion regulation; (d) exposure therapy; (e) cognitive restructuring; (f) parent and child support between sessions; (g) safety plan; and (h) programming for generalization and maintenance. Future research should establish evidence-based treatment of trauma in this population by evaluating the modified treatment package.

DE Out of home care; Disordered eating; Attachment; Youth
ID DISORDER SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; FOOD
AB Children living in Out-of-Home Care (OoHC) are thought to be especially vulnerable to developing problematic eating behaviours due to their likelihood of having insecure attachment styles and emotion regulation deficits. Despite this increased risk, our understanding of problematic eating among children in OoHC is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to; (1) Explore the rate of problematic eating behaviours among children living in OoHC, specifically residential and foster care; (2) Investigate how carers manage problematic eating and (3) Understand carers' perceptions of the role of attachment and emotion regulation in relation to problematic eating in OoHC. Semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and surveys were conducted with residential care staff (n = 36) and foster carers (n = 8) in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed for themes, and frequency data from the survey were generated. Residential and foster carers reported that approximately 38% of the children in their care displayed problematic eating behaviours at a clinical level. Both residential and foster carers commonly understood these behaviours as a function of the child's experiences of food deprivation and limited access to healthy foods prior to entering care which, they believe, has contributed to problems with regulating food intake and/or willingness to try new foods. Carers also commonly reported that the children in their care struggle to form attachments or regulate their emotions, which impacts carers ability to manage problematic eating. It is recommended that future interventions prioritise educating community service organisations (CSOs), responsible for delivering OoHC, to better recognise and address problematic eating behaviours. This will enable CSOs to train their residential and foster carers about how best to respond to and manage problematic eating behaviours.

AB To investigate trajectories of behavior, attention, social and emotional problems to early adulthood in extremely preterm survivors compared to a term-born comparison group. Longitudinal analysis of a prospective, population-based cohort of 315 surviving infants born<26 completed weeks of gestation recruited at birth in 1995, from the UK/Republic of Ireland, and a term-born comparison group recruited at age 6. The parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was completed at age 6, 11, 16 and 19years. The Total Behavioral Difficulties Score was 4.81 points higher in extremely preterm individuals compared to their term-born peers over the period (95% CI 3.76-5.87, p<0.001) and trajectories were stable in both groups. The impact of difficulties on home life, friendships, school or work and/or leisure activities was greater in the EPT group (RR 4.28, 95% CI 2.89-6.35, p<0.001), and hyperactivity/inattention and peer problems accounted for the largest differences. A clinically significant behavioral screen at age 2.5 was associated with a higher Total Behavioral Difficulties Score from 6years onwards in extremely preterm participants (Mean difference 6.90, 95% CI 5.01-8.70, p<0.0.01), as was moderate/severe cognitive impairment at last assessment (Mean difference: 4.27, 95% CI 2.76-5.77, p<0.001). Attention, social and emotional problems in extremely preterm individuals persist into early adulthood with significant impact on daily life. A positive behavioral screen in infancy and moderate/severe cognitive impairment are associated with early adult outcomes.

AB The present study was organized around 2 main objectives: first, to analyze emotional intelligence (EI) both in aggressors and victims of school violence, considering 3 dimensions of EI-emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotion regulation-and second, to analyze empathy in aggressors and victims of school violence, taking into consideration 2 dimensions-cognitive and affective empathy. Participants were 1,318 Spanish adolescents, aged between 11 and 17 years (47% boys) enrolled in 4 secondary schools, and who completed self-report measures. Analyses of variance were conducted to analyze the data. The results indicated that, regarding EI, victims of school violence scored significantly higher in the dimension of emotional attention, but significantly lower in emotional clarity and emotion regulation; aggressors showed differences only in emotion regulation, with significantly lower scores. With regard to empathy, victims showed less empathetic joy, a subdimension of affective empathy, which indicated that they are, at the moment, unable to feel happiness for others' successes; aggressors obtained lower scores both in cognitive and affective empathy. These results underscore the importance of managing emotions in the main school violence roles in adolescent students and help us to understand differences between aggressors and victims in the managing of affect.

AB To date, several gene-by-environment (GxE) meta-analyses have been conducted to provide cumulative GxE evidence from previous inconsistent empirical studies; however, these meta-analyses have mainly focused on the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). The present study aimed to conduct the first meta-analysis that tested whether and how an important dopaminergic genethe catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene contributed to differences in child and adolescent environmental sensitivity. A total of 22 studies with 20,528 participants involving in various developmental outcomes (e.g., externalizing problems, emotional problems, cognitive development and social behaviors) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled effect size of environment-outcome associations in the Met-allele carriers (r=0.11, 95% CI=[0.07, 0.15], p<.001) did not significantly differ from that in the Val/Val homozygotes (r=0.14, 95% CI=[0.08, 0.20], p<0.001) (Q(contrast) (1)=0.37, p=0.54). The aggregated Liptak-Stouffer Z-score that combined the p-values of the COMT-environment interaction yield a nonsignificant result (p=0.52). Moreover, outcome domain, sample age, ethnicity and assessment methods for the environment and the outcome did not moderate the effect sizes. Thus far, the COMT Val158Met polymorphism fails to explain the differences in sensitivity to environment. Future studies might incorporate more factors, such as polygenic effects of genetic pathways, epigenetics (EpiG) processing and sexual dimorphism, into the COMT-environment interaction equation.

AB The task of identity development, which involves distinguishing who one is, and defining and articulating this to others, is a challenging developmental task for most youth. This is made even more challenging when one considers that there are multiple domains of identity development. In the current study, Australia adolescents (N=336; aged 12-15 years, 46% male) reported their identity status commitment, exploration and reconsideration across two different domains (education and friendship). Cluster analysis was used to evaluate patterns of identity formation within and across domains, and the internalizing symptoms (low self-worth, emotion dysregulation, depressive and anxiety symptoms) and identity disturbance of clusters of youth with different identity status patterns were compared. Results revealed five clusters of committed explorers, committed non-explorers, committed reconsiders, uninvolved, and friend identifiers. Cluster comparisons revealed that, across self-worth, emotion dysregulation and identity disturbance, adolescents in the friend identifiers cluster, who reported high commitment to friendship identity and lower commitment to educational identity relative to their peers, fared worse than adolescents reporting higher than average commitment across both domains, and those reporting high reconsideration in both domains. These findings suggest that the benefit of identity commitment for emotional adjustment may depend somewhat on the domain under investigation, and that evaluating the junction and divergence of different identity domains might identify additional adolescents who are experiencing symptoms of maladjustment.

AB Girls are more likely to engage in rumination, associated with the development of mental health problems, as well as report higher levels of friendship quality, hypothesized to protect against these disorders. The current study examined whether co-rumination may drive simultaneous increases in rumination and changes in friendship quality among adolescents. The project included 360 participants (43% boys), ages 9.8 to 15.8 years, and analyses revealed that co-rumination mediated the link between female sex and both rumination and negative friendship quality. There was also a bidirectional relation between co-rumination and positive friendship quality. These findings highlight several pathways by which co-rumination mediates the relation between sex and both maladaptive (i.e. rumination, negative friendship quality) and adaptive (i.e. positive friendship quality) outcomes.

AB The daily emotional experiences of adolescents are dynamic, vary significantly across individuals, and are crucial to their psychological adjustment, warranting a need to identify factors that promote adaptive affective responses to stressors and attenuated affective instability. The objective of this study, therefore, was to examine protective factors linked to individual differences in daily affective reactivity and instability utilizing a daily diary design in a national sample of 100 U.S. adolescents (13-17 years; 40% girls; 79% White). Adolescents completed a baseline survey and then 14 daily online surveys. Better mother-adolescent communication predicted lower negative affect reactivity, whereas greater use of problem-focused coping strategies predicted higher positive affect reactivity. Greater trait resilience and instrumental support seeking predicted lower negative affect instability. Conversely, more emotional support seeking predicted higher negative affect instability. No factors were associated with positive affect instability, and father-adolescent communication was unrelated to daily affective reactivity and instability. The findings implicate specific protective factors associated with distinct aspects of affective reactivity and instability.

AB Objectives. The aim of the present study was to investigate psychiatric symptoms in adolescents diagnosed as having chronic gastritis, and to evaluate family functioning.
   Methods. The population consisted of adolescents who were diagnosed endoscopically and histopathologically as having chronic gastritis without additional chronic disease. The anxiety levels, depression levels, and emotional and behavioral symptoms of the adolescents were measured using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Family functioning was evaluated using the Family Assessment Device (FAD).
   Results. Fifty eight adolescents were included to study. According to the SDQ subscale results, adolescents with gastritis had more problems in emotional, hyperactivity, and peer relations areas, but the results in conduct problems and prosocial behaviors were normal. Levels of all subscales of Family Assessment Device were higher than 2, showing problems in family functioning.
   Conclusions. This study suggests that adolescents with chronic gastritis experience more difficulties in peer relations and family functioning, and they express more emotional problems.

AB PurposeSubthreshold binge-eating disorder (BED) symptoms can lead to additive physical and psychological health challenges and may put youth at risk for developing BED during the early adulthood. We examined the implementation of a condensed dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills intervention for subthreshold binge-eating behaviors in adolescents.MethodsFifteen 14-18years old participated in a 10-week DBT skills group, which experientially introduced mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness skills in the context of emotionally driven overeating behaviors. Adolescents and caregivers completed measures of emotional eating and binge-eating behaviors at baseline and post-intervention, including the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and Emotional Eating Scale for Children and Adolescents. Eleven participants were retained at 3-month follow-up.ResultsDescriptive statistics were compared at all three time points. Results suggested a reduction in emotional eating and binge-eating behaviors based on youth self-report and caregiver report. Acceptability ratings of the treatment were high among participants completing the intervention.ConclusionsUsing DBT skills to target emotionally driven overeating behaviors in youth may be useful in the treatment of subthreshold BED behaviors and potentially deter future development of full-criteria BED.Level of evidenceLevel IV, uncontrolled pilot trial.

AB Objective: Adolescence is a time of increased susceptibility to environmental stress and mood disorders, and girls are particularly at risk. Genes interacting with the environment (G x E) are implicated in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, hippocampal volume changes and risk or resilience to mood disorders. In this study, we assessed the effects of stress system G x E interactions on hippocampal volumes and cortisol secretion in adolescent girls. Methods: We recruited 229 girls aged 12-18 years, and scans were obtained from 202 girls. Of these, 76 had been exposed to higher emotional trauma (abuse or neglect). Hippocampal volumes were measured using Freesurfer and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Saliva samples were collected for measurement of cortisol levels and genotyping of stress system genes: FKBP5, NR3C1 (both N = 194) and NR3C2 (N = 193). Results: Among girls with the 'G' allelic variant of the NR3C1 gene, those who had been exposed to higher emotional trauma had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes (N = 44; mean = 4069.58 mm(3), standard deviation = 376.99) than girls who had been exposed to minimal emotional trauma with the same allelic variant (N = 69; mean = 4222.34 mm(3), standard deviation = 366.74). Conclusion: In healthy adolescents, interactions between emotional trauma and the 'protective' NR3C1 'GG' variant seem to induce reductions in left hippocampal volumes. These G x E interactions suggest that vulnerability to mood disorders is perhaps driven by reduced 'protection' that may be specific to emotional trauma. This novel but preliminary evidence has implications for targeted prevention of mood disorders and prospective multimodal neuroimaging and longitudinal studies are now needed to investigate this possibility.

AB Diario della Salute [My Health Diary] is a school-based program designed to enhance the subjective well-being and health of 12- to 13-year-old students. We hypothesized that providing students with the social and emotional skills to fulfill their potential and deal with common developmental tasks of adolescence (e.g., onset of puberty, identity development, increased responsibilities and academic demands) would result in improved well-being and health. The program comprises five standardized interactive lessons concerning common psychosocial and health issues in adolescence, and two narrative booklets addressed to both students and their parents. We evaluated the effectiveness of the program in terms of the students' subjective well-being, aggressive behavior, and health behavior. Using a quasi-experimental study design, schools in the intervention group implemented the full program and those in the comparison group received their regular curriculum. We administered measures of the study's objectives both before and after program implementation. Statistical analyses accounted for within-school clustering, potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding, and pre-implementation levels of these measures. We sampled 62 schools and allocated 2630 students to either an intervention or comparison group. Sociodemographic characteristics and baseline outcomes were balanced across study groups. Unexpectedly, respondents in the intervention group had 0.38 greater mean adjusted score of the WHO/Europe Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Symptom Checklist instrument than respondents in the comparison group, indicating a reduction in subjective well-being. We did not observe any program effects on aggressive and health behaviors. The apparent reduction in subjective well-being reflected by an increased perception of psychosomatic complaints is suggestive of either increased emotional competence or, potentially, iatrogenic program effects. While greater emotional competence is positively associated with well-being over the course of life, the program in its present form should not be disseminated due to the possibility of adverse unintended effects.

AB The short version of the Big Five Inventory for Children and Adolescents (BR-K KJ) is a German-language self-assessment questionnaire for evaluating extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience in children and adolescents. The questionnaire was developed based on a sample of 267 children and adolescents aged 9- 16 years (M = 11.77, SD = 2.08; 52% girls) and includes 26 items. The internal consistency analyses, retest reliabilities, and intercorrelations are indicative of the reliability of the procedure. It also proves to be valid: (a) The 5-factor structure was confirmed in an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as in an exploratory structural equation model (ESEM), (b) the convergent and discriminant validity were supported, (c) the relationships of the Big Five with relevant external criteria such as age and gender as well as (d) the criterion validity with respect to a clinical sample were demonstrated. Hence, the BFI-K KJ provides an economic, reliable, and valid method for assessing the Big Five personality factors in children and adolescents.

AB Neuronal circuits within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediate higher cognitive functions and emotional regulation that are disrupted in psychiatric disorders. The PFC undergoes significant maturation during adolescence, a period when cannabis use in humans has been linked to subsequent vulnerability to psychiatric disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia. Here, we investigated in a rat model the effects of adolescent exposure to Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive component of cannabis, on the morphological architecture and transcriptional profile of layer III pyramidal neurons-using cell type- and layer-specific high-resolution microscopy, laser capture microdissection and next-generation RNA-sequencing. The results confirmed known normal expansions in basal dendritic arborization and dendritic spine pruning during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood that were accompanied by differential expression of gene networks associated with neurodevelopment in control animals. In contrast, THC exposure disrupted the normal developmental process by inducing premature pruning of dendritic spines and allostatic atrophy of dendritic arborization in early adulthood. Surprisingly, there was minimal overlap of the developmental transcriptomes between THC- and vehicle-exposed rats. THC altered functional gene networks related to cell morphogenesis, dendritic development, and cytoskeleton organization. Marked developmental network disturbances were evident for epigenetic regulators with enhanced co-expression of chromatin- and dendrite-related genes in THC-treated animals. Dysregulated PFC co-expression networks common to both the THC-treated animals and patients with schizophrenia were enriched for cytoskeletal and neurite development. Overall, adolescent THC exposure altered the morphological and transcriptional trajectory of PFC pyramidal neurons, which could enhance vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.

AB Background: Research suggests that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, but the findings were mixed.
   Method: We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of ADHD on vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV). PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, were searched for case-control or cohort studies reporting measures of vagally-mediated HRV, after a task demand, among individuals with ADHD relative to healthy subjects.
   Results: Thirteen articles comprising a total of 869 patients with ADHD and 909 healthy participants were included. As compared to controls, ADHD patients had reduced vagally-mediated HRV, corresponding to a small effect size (Hedge's g = 0.20; CI 95% 0.01 to 0.40). Heterogeneity was high (Q (18) = 76.59, p < 0.001; I-2 = 77%). There was some evidence of small study effects. Task type, respiration rate assessment and associated comorbid disorders were statistically significant moderators.
   Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for the associations between ADHD and autonomic dysregulation. Future studies addressing HRV reactivity are needed.

AB ObjectivesThis study had two major aims: (1) to explore the relationship between sleep related difficulties and behavioral and emotional problems in young children, and (2) to identify predictors of child fear and problematic sleep behaviors.MethodsSixty-eight children (34 boys), ages 4-6 years (M=4.9, SD=0.9) who experienced nighttime fears and who co-slept with their parents were evaluated using parental reports of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems, sleep difficulties and related anxiety, as well as child and parental reports of fear.ResultsChild-reported fear was significantly predicted by internalizing problems when controlling for other variables whereas parent-reported fear was primarily related to child endorsed fears on a preschool fear questionnaire when controlling for the other variables. In contrast, sleep-related problems were primarily related to externalizing behavior problems whereas the number of nights slept alone was primarily related to separation anxiety on a preschool anxiety questionnaire.ConclusionsFindings from the present study point to the multiplicity of factors that account for nighttime fears and sleep difficulties in young children. Child fear and separation anxiety were related to co-sleeping. Moreover, internalizing symptoms in young children predicted child fear whereas, externalizing symptoms predicted sleep problems. Based on the reciprocal relationship between emotional/behavior problems and sleep, frequent co-sleeping and nighttime fears might serve as a risk and/or maintaining factor of disrupted sleep practices. When treating nighttime fears in young children, co-sleeping should be targeted for intervention as well.

AB This review updates previous similar papers published in JFT in 2000, 2009 and 2014. It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews, narrative literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with common mental health problems and other difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training, or parent implemented behavioural programmes. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multimodal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; recovery from child abuse and neglect; conduct problems, emotional problems, eating disorders, somatic problems, and first episode psychosis.

AB Background: Nearly a third of adults report childhood trauma in their youth and approximately 700,000 cases of child maltreatment were reported in 2016. Both history of childhood trauma and current trauma symptoms in adults are linked to child maltreatment, although many trauma-exposed individuals are warm and nurturing parents. Identifying resiliency factors in adults with risk factors for harsh parenting may illuminate new pathways to sensitive parenting. Mindfulness is reported to improve trauma and mental health symptoms but the relationship between mindfulness, trauma, and child abuse potential is not yet understood.
   Objective: This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between mindfulness, childhood trauma experiences, trauma symptoms and child abuse potential.
   Participants and setting: Our participants were 102 expectant parents recruiting from obstetric clinics and agencies Detroit, MI (58.8% African American, 27.5% Caucasian).
   Method: Bivariate correlations were examined using validated, self-report questionnaires. Significant variables were included in a hierarchical linear regression to identify predicting factors that contribute to child abuse potential scores.
   Results: Significant correlations between child abuse potential with current trauma symptoms (r = .53, p < .01) and mindfulness (r = - .32, p < .01) were found, but no link with past childhood trauma experiences and child abuse potential were identified. The model significantly predicts child abuse potential (Delta R-2 = .10, F(5, 96), = 12.48, p < .001). Trauma symptoms (B = .09, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI] [ - .40, - .07]) and mindfulness nonreactivity (B = - .24, p < .01, 95% CI[.05, .14]) predicted higher potential for child abuse scores.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest increased mindfulness, especially nonreactivity to one's own thoughts, may be an important factor to protect against child abuse potential. Interventions to increase parental mindfulness may reduce child abuse potential and improve child well-being, but further mechanistic research is needed to determine this.

AB While adolescence is a critical stage of development marked by heightened bottom-up emotional reactivity and immature top-down regulatory control, research on emotion regulation has relatively neglected middle childhood to adolescence years. This may be attributed to the limited number and scope of age-appropriate, reliable, and valid measures of emotion regulation. This study examines the confirmatory factor analytic structure and measurement invariance of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), a 10-item self-report measure designed to measure habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, across a 1-year time interval in school samples of adolescents. Results indicate low test-retest reliability but high to acceptable internal consistency over a 1-year time period. The two-factor model has an approximate but close fit to the data collected, which is consistent with underlying theoretical framework and prior empirical findings. Tests of measurement equivalence support strong invariance, indicating that there were no statistically significant differences in factor means, variances, and correlations over a 1-year interval.

AB The current study examined the association between adolescent emotional competence, operationalized and measured at both the individual and the school levels, and gang membership. The study involved a sample of 12,040 students (51.4% females; mean = 16.9 years) participating in the biennial state department of education coordinated California Healthy Kids Survey, which assesses a range of adolescent health-related behaviors. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that higher levels of individual emotional competence were associated with a lower likelihood of identifying as a gang member. Moreover, a stronger negative association between emotional competence and identifying as a gang member was found when emotional competence was operationalized at the school level. Implications include the role of schools in promoting emotional regulation, empathy, and behavioral regulation of their entire student body as part of an overall strategy to reduce individual student's attraction to gangs.

AB Childhood and adolescent experiences have undergone a major transition in interaction with digital technologies since the advent of smartphones. Following a needs assessment study, adolescent online uses and motivations for social networking site use were explored. Six focus groups (comprising 42 adolescent students of secondary schools in the UK) were recruited. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Six motivational themes emerged from the analysis, reflecting interactivity and need for control of content and relationships, exhibiting the dynamic nature of engagement with social networking sites: (i) symbiotic relationship with peers online via social media and smartphone attachment, (ii) digital omnipresence related to the need for control and loss of control, (iii) emotional regulation and enhancement, (iv) idealization versus normalization of self and others, (v) peer comparison and ego validation, and (vi) functionality- facilitation of communication functions. These findings offer an understanding of the key drivers of normative adolescent social media behaviour that go beyond the theoretical associations with Uses and Gratifications Theory and Self-Determination Theory, suggesting an additional alternative motivational factor for social media use, that of need to control relationships, content, presentation and impressions. This need may be underlying FoMO and nomophobia and could therefore be responsible for increasing engagement or compulsive use. These findings shed light on cognitive-emotive aspects that may be implicated in problematic use and may inform interventions targeting excessive or problematic screen time and specific social media use aspects that merit scientific attention.

AB The inclusion of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in mainstream environments, especially mainstream classrooms, is critically impeded by their difficulties in self-regulating their emotions. Albeit new technologies have shown tremendous emulation in the field of ASD, solutions to assist individuals with ASD in emotion regulation appear very limited. This paper addresses this critical challenge through the design and evaluation of a tablet-based application dedicated to supporting adolescents with ASD in self-regulating their emotions in mainstream inclusive classrooms. This system relies on well-proven (paper-based) emotion-regulation interventions reported by special-education teachers and families through a participatory design. The experiment included 14 adolescents with ASD (as well as 19 adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities) using the application during three months in mainstream schools. We compared these two groups with another group of 15 adolescents with ASD who were not equipped with our application. Usability performance as well as efficacy performance (emotion regulation outcomes) have been investigated in situ. We showed that 1) our system is autonomously and successfully used in mainstream classrooms, 2) it is also an efficient support for adolescents with ASD to self-regulate their emotions. This paper demonstrates that emotion regulation of adolescents with ASD can be supported within mainstream classrooms through an assistive technology, in order to improve both behaviors and sociocognitive processes linked with core features of ASD. Moreover, it provides insights of a methodology suited to mainstream classrooms, building on previous research addressing specialized settings.

AB Background
   Mental health problems are common among adolescents. Proper screening and rehabilitation could improve adolescents' function at the present time and in the future. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the associated familial factors among high school students.
   Materials and Methods
   The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 630 high school students (315 boys and 315 girls) aged 13-17 years in Jahrom, Iran. The participants were selected using random cluster sampling. The data were collected using the self-report version of strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), and were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 16.0.
   Results: The results showed that 22.38% of the students had total difficulty (14.9% of boys, and 29.8% of girls). The highest prevalence was related to peer relationship problems (23%) followed by conduct problems (18.1%), hyperactivity (11.1%), pro-social behaviors (6.3%), and emotional problems (5.7%). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68-3.66) increased the odds; while grade 9 (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.32-0.83), and number of siblings (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.99) decreased the odds of mental health problems (p<0.05).
   Conclusion
   According to the results, the prevalence of behavioral disorders was relatively high among the students. The number of sibling, being girl and being in nine grade significantly contributed to the prevalence of behavioral disorders. In order to reduce these disorders, familial intervention and educational programs are recommended to be designed and implemented to prevent and treat behavioral disorders among students.

AB Distraction can reduce adults' memory for emotion-eliciting information, whereas reappraisal can preserve or enhance it. Yet, when given instructions to use specific emotion regulation (ER) strategies, adults report using other strategies too. The consequences of non-instructed strategy use within instructed ER paradigms are rarely examined. We investigated how both instructed and non-instructed but reported strategies related to memory for emotional information in childhood. Older (N = 69; 8- to 10-year-olds; 24 girls) and younger (N = 65; 5- to 7-year-olds; 35 girls) children received instructions to use cognitive distraction, reappraisal, or do nothing (control) before and after viewing a negative emotional film clip. Children were later interviewed about what they remembered about the film, and reported the ER strategies they used during it. Memory did not vary across instructed ER strategy conditions, and reported strategies did not relate to memory differently for older and younger children. Consistent with adult work, reported cognitive distraction related to poorer memory. Different reappraisal types were reported, but only situation-focused reappraisal was linked to better memory. In sum, children's reported cognitive distraction and reappraisal strategies related to memory for emotional information differently. Thus, ER strategies divergently relate to what children remember about their emotional experiences.

AB Accumulating research document the needs of intervention towards mental health problems in early childhood. The general child health surveillance offers opportunities for early detection of mental health vulnerability, conditioned the availability of feasible and validated measures. The Copenhagen Infant Mental Health Questionnaire, CIMHQ, was developed to be feasible for community health nurses and comprehensive regarding the range of mental health problems seen in infancy. Previous testing of the CIMHQ has documented feasibility and face validity. The aim was to investigate the construct validity of the general population measure by using the Rasch measurement models, and to explore the differential functioning of the CIMHQ relative to a number of characteristics of the infants, local independence of items, and possible latent classes of infants. CIMHQ was tested in 2,973 infants from the general population, aged 9-10 months. The infants were assessed by community health nurses at home visits, in the period from March 2011 to December 2013. Rasch measurement models were used to investigate the construct validity of the CIMHQ. Analyses showed an overall construct valid scale of mental health problems, consisting of seven valid subscales of specific problems concerning eating, sleep, emotional reactions, attention, motor activity, communication, and language, respectively. The CIMHQ fitted a graphical loglinear Rasch model without differential item function. Analyses of local homogeneity identified two latent classes of infants. A simple model with almost no local dependency between items is proposed for infants with few problems, whereas a more complicated model characterizes infants with more problems. The measure CIMHQ differentiates between infants from the general population with few and more mental health problems, and between subgroups of problems that potentially can be targets of preventive intervention.

AB Caffeine and tobacco smoke are among the most frequently self-administered licit psychoactive drugs in the world. Both drugs affect anxiety levels, however, little is known on the impact of the dual exposure in the adolescent brain, the period during which smoking begins. Considering that anxiety is a relevant factor for smoking maintenance and relapse, we investigated the effects of lifelong exposure to caffeine on anxiety levels of Swiss mice exposed to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Caffeine was administrated during all prenatal and postnatal life (CAF, 0.1 g/1 to drink). From postnatal day 30-45, animals were exposed to tobacco smoke (SMK, whole body exposure, 8 h/day) generated from research cigarettes type 3R4F (nicotine = 0.73 mg/per cigarette). Four groups were analyzed: (1) CAF + SMK exposure; (2) SMK exposure; (3) CAF exposure; (4) Control. Anxiety levels were assessed in the elevated plus maze at the end of smoke exposure (PN45), at short- (PN55) and long-term (PN75) withdrawal. Caffeine exposure reduced decision making time (time in center of maze) during adolescence (PN45 and PN55). In addition, caffeine increased anxiety-like behavior during long-term tobacco smoke withdrawal. The present study provides experimental evidence that caffeine and tobacco smoke during adolescence interact resulting in emotional dysregulation during tobacco smoke withdrawal. Particularly, increased anxiety-like behavior during long-term withdrawal in CAF + SMK animals demonstrates late-emergent effects. In this sense, our data suggest that lifelong caffeine exposure may be an important factor in tobacco relapse.

AB Background: Alexithymia, a relatively stable personality trait characterized by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and externally oriented thinking, has been linked to both substance use disorders and eating disorders. In nonclinical samples, alexithymia is associated with heavier consumption of alcohol and caffeine. Both are psychoactive drugs, but unlike most drugs they are typically consumed in the context of palatable and calorie-rich products. Objectives: Given the association of alexithymia with disordered eating, the present study evaluated the hypothesis that heavier consumption of caffeine by those with high levels of alexithymia may be motivated by the palatable and caloric aspects of common caffeine products rather than by drug-seeking. Methods: There were 224 participants aged 17-63 years who completed instruments assessing demographics, alexithymia, emotional eating, caffeine consumption, alcohol consumption, negative moods, and reward sensitivity. Results: As predicted, alexithymia was positively related to emotional eating as well as consumption of caffeine and alcohol, and alexithymia was a significant predictor of caffeine intake in regression models. However, there was no indication of mediation by emotional eating. Conclusions: Alexithymia is characterized by deficient emotion regulation and negative moods, hence use of drugs and/or foods to regulate emotions, combined with poor interoceptive awareness, may account for excessive consumption of drugs or foods as alternative emotion regulation strategies in those with high levels of this trait.

AB Uncovering brain-behavior mechanisms is the ultimate goal of neuroscience. A formidable amount of discoveries has been made in the past 50 years, but the very essence of brain-behavior mechanisms still escapes us. The recent exploitation of machine learning (ML) tools in neuroscience opens new avenues for illuminating these mechanisms. A key advantage of ML is to enable the treatment of large data, combing highly complex processes. This essay provides a glimpse of how ML tools could test a heuristic neural systems model of motivated behavior, the triadic neural systems model, which was designed to understand behavioral transitions in adolescence. This essay previews analytic strategies, using fictitious examples, to demonstrate the potential power of ML to decrypt the neural networks of motivated behavior, generically and across development. Of note, our intent is not to provide a tutorial for these analyses nor a pipeline. The ultimate objective is to relate, as simply as possible, how complex neuroscience constructs can benefit from ML methods for validation and further discovery. By extension, the present work provides a guide that can serve to query the mechanisms underlying the contributions of prefrontal circuits to emotion regulation. The target audience concerns mainly clinical neuroscientists. As a caveat, this broad approach leaves gaps, for which references to comprehensive publications are provided.

AB Delayed diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) is common. However, diagnostic validity may be enhanced using reliable neurobiological markers for BD. Degree centrality (DC) is one such potential marker that enables researchers to visualize neuronal network abnormalities in the early stages of some neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we measured resting-state DC abnormalities and cognitive deficits in order to identify early neurobiological markers for BD. We recruited 23 patients with BD who had recently experienced manic episodes (duration of illness <2 years) and 46 matched healthy controls. Our findings indicated that patients with BD exhibited DC abnormalities in frontal areas, temporal areas, the right postcentral gyrus, and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that psychomotor speed indicators were associated with DC in the superior temporal and inferior temporal gyri, while attention indicators were associated with DC in the inferior temporal gyrus, in patients with early BD. Our findings suggest that DC abnormalities in neural emotion regulation circuits are present in patients with early BD, and that correlations between attention/psychomotor speed deficits and temporal DC abnormalities may represent early markers of BD.

AB Mobile phone has experienced a significant increase in popularity among adolescents in recent years. Findings indicate dependence on mobile phone is related to poor parent-child relationship. However, previous research on mobile phone dependence (MPD) is scant and mainly focus on adult samples. In this view, the present study investigated the association between parental attachment and MPD as well as its influence mechanism, in sample of adolescents in rural China. Data were collected from three middle schools in rural areas of Jiangxi and Hubei Province (N = 693, 46.46% female, M-age = 14.88, SD = 1.77). Participants completed the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the twenty-item Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20), the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale (MPAI). Among the results, parental attachment negatively predicted MPD and alexithyrnia were exerting partial mediation effect between parental attachment and MPD. Further, mindfulness acted as moderator of the relationship between alexithymia and MPD: The negative impact of alexithymia on MPD was weakened under the condition of high level of mindfulness. Knowledge of this mechanism could be useful for understanding adolescents' MPD in terms of the interaction of multiple factors.

AB Background: Children with acquired brain injury (ABI) present with high rates of psychological disorders commonly accompanied by deficits in hot and cold executive functions (EFs). Impairments in EFs have been reported to precede mental health problems. Moreover, children who are vulnerable to developing mental health problems in adulthood frequently present with a dysregulation profile in childhood, characterized by impairments in cognitive, behavioral and emotional regulation. Objective: To identify profiles of behaviors associated with impairment in hot and cold EFs and compare injury factors, environmental stressors and dysregulation profile between them. Methods: A latent profile analysis was conducted with 77 children with ABI aged between 6 and 12. Injury factors, child IQ, environmental stressors and the dysregulation profile were compared between these behavioral profiles. Logistic regressions were conducted to predict profile membership. Results: Two profiles were identified: Profile M, with mild deficits (1-2 SD above the mean) in working memory and social skills, and profile C, presenting clinically significant deficits (2-3 SD above the mean) in shift, initiate, working memory, planning and social skills and mild deficits in inhibit, emotional control and task monitor. Proximal environmental stressors (dysfunctional parenting practices, parental stress, parent's executive dysfunction, anxiety-trait, and depressive symptoms) and dysregulation symptoms predicted profile membership, whereas injury factors, child IQ and distal environmental stressors did not. Conclusion: Following ABI, children with profile C are at risk of mental health problems and present with more proximal stressors. The dysregulation profile may be useful as a proxy for risk for later mental health problems in children with ABI.

AB Anxiety disorders that develop in adolescence represent a significant burden and are particularly challenging to treat, due in no small part to the high occurrence of relapse in this age group following exposure therapy. This pattern of persistent fear is preserved across species; relative to those younger and older, adolescents consistently show poorer extinction, a key process underpinning exposure therapy. This suggests that the neural processes underlying fear extinction are temporarily but profoundly compromised during adolescence. The formation, retrieval, and modification of fear- and extinction-associated memories are regulated by a forebrain network consisting of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the amygdala, and the hippocampus. These regions undergo robust maturational changes in early life, with unique alterations in structure and function occurring throughout adolescence. In this review, we focus primarily on two of these regions-the PFC and the amygdala-and discuss how changes in plasticity, synaptic transmission, inhibition/excitation, and connectivity (including modulation by hippocampal afferents to the PFC) may contribute to transient deficits in extinction retention. We end with a brief consideration of how exposure to stress during this adolescent window of vulnerability can permanently disrupt neurodevelopment, leading to lasting impairments in pathways of emotional regulation.

AB The current study analyzed how trait emotional intelligence (trait El) mediates the relationship between self-esteem and state anxiety and trait anxiety. The sample was composed of 153 undergraduate students from the University of Cadiz, Spain (71.9% women and 28.1% men). Students completed measures of self-esteem, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and trait E1. Mediation analyses were completed with three trait E1 dimensions (EA, emotional attention; EC, emotional clarity; and MR, mood repair) as mediating variables, self-esteem as the independent variable, and state anxiety and trait anxiety as the dependent ones. Our results confirmed that self-esteem scores explained and predicted both, state and trait anxiety values (13% for state and 21% for trait anxiety). This explanatory capacity is increased by 8% when accounting for all trait El dimensions. Considering state anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted through the increases in the levels of both, self-esteem and MR. Regarding trait anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted, in addition to an increment of self-esteem and MR values, by an increase of EC and a decrease of EA. Conversely, indirect effects revealed that higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse MR, which in turn would enhance both state and trait anxiety levels. Moreover, regarding trait anxiety higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse EC, therefore increasing trait anxiety levels. As shown, the negative association found between self-esteem and EA becomes a key element. The effect of self-esteem on EA and the influence that the latter had on EC and MR exerts an indirect mediated effect with the power to invert the influence that self-esteem wields on both types of anxiety. In this sense, the apparent protective role of self-esteem changed, turning into a risk factor that promotes higher anxiety values.

AB Despite major research interest regarding gender differences in emotion regulation, it is still not clear whether men and women differ in their basic capacity to implement specific emotion regulation strategies, as opposed to indications of the habitual use of these strategies in self-reports. Similarly, little is known on how such basic capacities relate to indices of well-being in both sexes. This study took a novel approach by investigating gender differences in the capacity for generating cognitive reappraisals in adverse situations in a sample of 67 female and 59 male students, using a maximum performance test of the inventiveness in generating reappraisals. Participants' self-perceived efficacy in emotion regulation was additionally assessed. Analyses showed that men and women did not differ in their basic capacity to generate alternative appraisals for anxiety-eliciting scenarios, suggesting similar functional cognitive mechanisms in the implementation of this strategy. Yet, higher cognitive reappraisal capacity predicted fewer depressive daily-life experiences in men only. These findings suggest that in the case of cognitive reappraisal, benefits for well-being in women might depend on a more complex combination of basic ability, habits, and efficacy-beliefs, along with the use of other emotion regulation strategies. The results of this study may have useful implications for psychotherapy research and practice.

AB The relationship between childhood trauma and dissociative experiences is widely acknowledged. However, the association between emotion regulation difficulties (ERD), anxiety/depression and dissociation in adolescents and young adults with cumulative maltreatment (CM) remains unclear. The present study examined the role of ERD at both intrapersonal and interpersonal levels and anxiety/depression symptoms in the development of psychoform or somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. We assessed 58 participants with CM and 55 participants without childhood trauma history between the age of 12 and 22 years old. Participants completed self-reports of ERD, anxiety/depression, psychoform dissociation and somatoform dissociation. The results revealed that adolescents and young adults exposed to CM displayed high levels of psychoform and somatoform dissociation, ERD and anxiety/depression symptoms. It was also found that intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD predicted psychoform dissociation, whereas anxiety/depression predicted somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. Intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD and anxiety/depression are therapy targets for clinical interventions in adolescents and young adults with CM and dissociative symptoms.

AB Personal resiliency refers to individual attributes that are related to the process of successfully adapting to the environment in the face of adverse conditions, also known as resilience. Emotion regulation is increasingly found as a core component in mental health and found to modulate individual differences in the management of emotional responses. The Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA; Prince-Embury, 2006, 2007) were designed to systematically identify and quantify core personal qualities of resiliency in youth, and includes Sense of Mastery scale (MAS), Sense of Relatedness scale (REL), and Emotional Reactivity (REA) scale. The following study was first conducted to confirm the Three-Factor model of Personal Resiliency in a Norwegian student sample using factor analytic procedures. Secondly and the main purpose of the study, was to investigate if personal resiliency is associated with self-reported measures related to emotion regulation, and with resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation capacity. A revised scale adapted to the Norwegian sample was developed. Results indicate that protective indices related to personal resiliency are associated with both selfreported adaptive emotion regulation and outcome, and partly related to high capacity for emotion regulation indicated by vmHRV. Risk related to personal vulnerability was associated with maladaptive emotion regulation and outcome, but was not associated with emotion regulation capacity. Together the findings provide supporting evidence of both self-reported and psychophysiological correlates between emotion regulatory processes and personal resiliency indicated by RSCA.

AB Trait Emotional intelligence (Trait El) can be understood as a personality trait related to individual differences in recognition, processing, and the regulation of emotionally charged information. Trait El has been considered a variable of great importance in determining psychosocial adjustment. However, most research on Trait El has focused on adult and adolescent populations, while very few studies have explored its influence on children. The aim of this study was to analyze possible pathways into psychosocial adjustment in children by examining the combined effects of Trait El and emotional and social problems. It also aimed to assess the possible mediating role of gender in this relationship. A total of 268 Spanish children participated in this study, ranging in age from 8 to 12 years (mean age = 10.09, SD = 1.32, 45.10% male). Selected measures were applied through a web-based survey called DetectaWeb. The regression and mediation/moderation analyses confirmed that psychosocial adjustment in children was determined by Trait El directly and by emotional and social problems in an indirect way. Together, the three variables explained 46% of the variance in psychosocial adjustment, although Trait El was the most powerful predictor (44%), demonstrating incremental validity over and above social and emotional problems. In addition, gender was shown to be a moderating variable between Trait El and psychosocial adjustment; for girls specifically, lower Trait El scores were a determinant of lower levels of psychosocial adjustment, regardless of emotional and social problems. It can be concluded that the identified pathways provide keys for emotional education interventions aimed at promoting psychosocial adjustment, well-being, and good mental health among children. Our findings support the buffer role of Trait El against maladjustment risk in children, but more clearly in girls.

AB According to attachment theory, attachment representations influence emotion regulation (ER) across the life-span. However, research into attachment-related ER in adolescence is still scarce. The aim of this study was to assess attachment-related ER using a multimodal approach, relying on behavioral and neurophysiological parameters. Attachment styles in eighty-one adolescents were assessed with the Attachment Style Interview (ASI). A distress-then-comfort paradigm based on visual stimuli (the Besancon Affective Picture Set-Adolescents) was employed to "activate" then "deactivate" the attachment system. Gaze and neurophysiological parameters of ER strategies were assessed using eye-tracking synchronized with a physiological device.
   During the first phase "distress exposure", attachment style was associated with the early stage of distress processing indexed by first fixation duration. Withdrawn adolescents fixated distress pictures less than other groups. Fearful adolescents showed a longer first fixation duration than withdrawn adolescents.
   During the following phase, "comfort-seeking", all groups initially fixed joy-complicity and comfort pictures earlier than neutral pictures, except for withdrawn adolescents, who fixated comfort pictures later than neutral pictures. Additionally, withdrawn adolescents explored comfort pictures less than enmeshed adolescents. Enmeshed adolescents explored neutral pictures less than comfort and joy-complicity pictures.
   Concerning neurophysiological parameters, first fixation duration correlated positively with Skin Conductance Response (SCR) rise time in fearful adolescents, while glance count correlated negatively with SCR latency in withdrawn adolescents. This study provides an innovative and objective evaluation of behavioral and neurophysiological parameters for attachment-related ER in adolescents, with a temporal resolution. These parameters constitute potential biomarkers that could contribute to our understanding of ER differences in insecure adolescents.

AB Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents is a major public health concern and a common problem in clinical practise. The aim of this study was to examine different aspects of NSSI in a high-risk adolescent sample in clinical practise in association with personality disorders, symptoms, and coping skills to enhance the understanding of NSSI and improve treatment interventions.
   Methods: In a sample of 140 adolescent inpatients treated for personality disorders, assessments were performed pre-treatment and post-treatment using a questionnaire on NSSI developed for clinical practise, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM personality disorders, the Symptom Check List 90, and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.
   Results: NSSI was common (66.4%) among the inpatient adolescents. Of those without NSSI behaviour (n = 47), 10 (21.3%) started NSSI during treatment. NSSI was related to number of personality disorders and not to one specific. Participants who experienced NSSI (n = 93) reported significantly more symptoms and the negative coping strategy self-blame. They scored lower on the positive coping strategies of refocusing and reappraisal.
   Conclusion: NSSI in adolescent clinical practise is common, not exclusive to borderline personality disorder and could be contagious. Reducing self-blame and enhancing positive refocusing and positive reappraisal seem important treatment targets.

AB Preterm birth is associated with a higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental deficits. Indeed, preterm children are at increased risk for cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional difficulties. There is currently an increasing interest in introducing music intervention in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care. Several studies have shown short-term beneficial effects. A recent study has shown that listening to a familiar music (heard daily during the NICU stay) enhanced preterm infants' functional connectivity between auditory cortices and subcortical brain regions at term-equivalent age. However, the long-term effects of music listening in the NICUs have never been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate at 12 and 24 months the effects of music listening in the NICU on cognitive and emotional development in preterm children by comparing them to a preterm control group with no previous music exposure and to a full-term group. Participants were 44 children (17 full-term and 27 preterm). Preterm children were randomized to either music intervention or control condition (without music). The preterm-music group regularly listened to music from 33 weeks postconceptional age until hospital discharge or term-equivalent age. At 12 months, children were evaluated on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition, then with 4 episodes of the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (assessing expressions of joy, anger, and fear, and sustained attention). At 24 months, the children were evaluated with the same tests, and with 3 additional episodes of the Effortful Control Battery (assessing inhibition). Results showed that the scores of preterm children, music and control, differed from those of full-term children for fear reactivity at 12 months of age and for anger reactivity at 24 months of age. Interestingly, these significant differences were less important between the preterm-music and the full-term groups than between the preterm-control and the full-term groups. The present study provides preliminary, but promising, scientific findings on the beneficial long-term effects of music listening in the NICU on neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm children, and more specifically on emotion mechanisms at 12 and 24 months of age.

AB Background: Cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) have been shown to moderate the influence of War Experiences (WE) on mental health problems. Aims: This study assessed the influence of WE and use of specific CERS on mental health problems among war-affected youth in Northern Uganda. Methods: Five hundred and thirty-nine participants in an ongoing war-affected youth study (WAYS) were assessed by locally developed measures. CERS were measured by Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Multiple regressions were used to assess independent effects of gender, WE, and CERS on mental problems and their potential interaction. Results: Gender, WE and all CERS except positive refocussing and reappraisal had significant independent main effects on symptoms of depression while only WE, self-blame and blaming others had significant main effects on conduct problems. The interaction terms of WE and coping strategies of rumination, catastrophizing, and self-blame significantly predicted symptoms of depression/anxiety while only the interaction between WE and blaming others predicted conduct problems. In contrast, putting into perspective and planning negatively predicted symptoms of depression/anxiety. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce mental health problems should target coping strategies, especially adaptive strategies to youth in many post-conflict settings in Africa.

AB BackgroundDifficulties with delaying gratification, coping with frustration, and regulating emotions are significant predictors of aggression and behavioural and interpersonal problems early in life and mental health disorders during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Mental health problems generate a high burden of disease in society in general, and there is a significant treatment gap, especially among economically vulnerable populations. Prevention strategies appear to be the more recommendable options, mainly if these interventions can be implemented early in life and at low cost. Few preventive interventions aiming to increase resilience in the face of adversity have been rigorously evaluated among Chilean preschoolers. Substantial international evidence indicates that strengthening basic psychological skills, such as emotion regulation and social problem-solving, can reduce the incidence of mental pathology and improve various academic indicators. The curriculum of the Interpersonal Cognitive Problem-Solving Programme, also known as I Can Problem Solve (ICPS), is focussed on the development of the cognitive process and children's social problem-solving skills. ICPS is effective at increasing prosocial behaviours and reducing aggressive behaviour among preschoolers. ICPS provides children with the skills to think about how to solve problems using sequenced games, discussion, and group-interaction techniques focussed on listening to, and observing, others, promoting empathy and alternative and consequential thinking. The aims of this study are (1) to develop a culturally appropriate version of the ICPS programme and (2) to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted version of ICPS among vulnerable schools in Santiago, Chile, conducting a pilot randomised controlled trial with three arms: (1) the ICPS programme delivered by an internal early teacher, (2) the ICPS programme delivered by an external early teacher, and (3) a control group.Methods and designThis is a pilot, three-armed randomised controlled trial of the adapted version of ICPS with an enrolment target of 80 preschoolers attending four schools per arm. Children in both intervention groups will receive the ICPS programme: 59 sessions of 20min each delivered three times a week by trained internal or external early teachers over 5-6months. Internal teachers are part of the school staff, and external teachers are facilitators hired by the research team to go to schools and deliver the intervention during a normal school day, working together with the early teacher present in the classroom. The intervention consists of games using pictures, puppets, and simple role-playing techniques to facilitate the learning process. Cognitive regulation, emotion recognition, social-problem-solving skills, and psychological functioning will be measured at baseline and after the intervention.DiscussionNo previous studies in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries have been conducted to explore the acceptability and feasibility of ICPS to provide information to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on a larger scale.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03383172.

AB The primary concern of this study is to address parenting stress and adolescents' behavioral and emotional problems through an attachment based parenting intervention (Connect parents group) for parents of adolescents, in particular to test whether this intervention led to reduced levels of parenting stress, and adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. 44 parents (33 mothers and 11 fathers; M=50.4, SD=4.9) of adolescents (M=15 years, SD=1.4) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: An attachment based intervention group (Connect), or a wait-list control group. They were assessed before and immediately after the ten-week intervention. Outcome measures were self-reported parenting stress, and multi-informant assessments of adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. Compared to the control group, parents completing the Connect program reported significant reductions in their adolescents' externalizing behavior problems at treatment completion. Mediation model showed that, among parents completing the Connect program reductions in parental stress were mediated through decreases in adolescents' externalizing behavior problems. Decrease in adolescents' externalizing behavioral problems affected parental stress experienced in caring. These preliminary results underscore the importance of helping parents of adolescents to reduce levels of parenting stress through effective interventions able to curtail adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. Furthermore, they provide additional evidence for the effectiveness of the Connect program and offer insights into the potential mechanisms that underlie change.

AB Smartphone use is widespread globally, including in Indonesia. The excessive use and ubiquity of smartphone technology raise concerns on addiction and its effects on mental and emotional development of adolescents. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between smartphone addiction and mental-emotional disorders in early adolescents aged 11-12 years old in several primary schools in Bandung City and Sumedang District. This study was performed October to December 2018. This was a cross-sectional study using convenient sampling technic with unpaired categorical data for subject selection. Subjects were assessed with the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version (SAS-SV) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) which were self-administered by subjects. Subjects were classified into low level and high level smartphone user groups. Data were analyzed using chi square test. Out of 206 subjects, only 178 met the inclusion criteria with 44.9% (n=80) and 55.10% (n=98) were in high-and low-level of smartphone addiction. The percentage of mental and emotional problems based on SDQ that was included in the normal, borderline, and abnormal category was 60.7, 21.9, 17.4, respectively. Those with high-level smartphone addiction had mental and emotional problems with 1.425 prevalence ratio and CI95% 1.141-1.779. In conclusion, there is correlation between smartphone addiction on mental emotional problems of early adolescent.

AB Objective: Current knowledge regarding the intersection of psychiatric disorders and crime in the United States is limited to psychiatric, forensic, and youth samples. This study presents nationally representative data on the relationship of DSM-5 psychiatric disorders, comorbid substance and mental health disorders, and multimorbidity (number of disorders) with criminal behavior and justice involvement among non-institutionalized US adults.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave III (NESARC-III; 2012-2013; N = 36,309). Logistic regressions were used to examine the association of specific disorders (eg, mood, anxiety, eating, posttraumatic stress, substance use), comorbid substance use and mental health disorders, and multimorbidity with lifetime criminal behavior, incarceration experience, and past-12-month general, alcohol-related, and drug-related legal problems.
   Results: Overall, 28.5% of participants reported a history of criminal behavior, 11.4% reported a history of incarceration, 1.8% reported current general legal problems, 0.8% reported current alcohol-related legal problems, and 2.7% reported current drug-related legal problems. The presence of any disorder was associated with a 4 to 5 times increased risk of crime outcomes. Drug use disorders were associated with the highest risk of lifetime crime (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.8; 95% CI, 6.1-7.6) and incarceration (AOR = 4.7; 95% CI, 4.1-5.3) and current legal problems (AOR = 3.3; 95% CI, 2.6-4.2). Multimorbidity and comorbid substance use and mental health disorders were associated with additional risk. Controlling for antisocial personality disorder did not change the findings.
   Conclusions: Community adults with substance use disorders, comorbid substance use and mental health disorders, and increasing multimorbidity are most at risk of crime and justice involvement, highlighting the importance of community-based addiction treatment.

LA English
DT Article

   OUTCOMES; FAMILY
AB Adverse parenting practices, including child maltreatment, interfere with children's adjustment and life outcomes. In this article, Ronald Prinz describes the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, designed to improve parenting population-wide.
   Prinz offers four main reasons to take a population approach. First, official records grossly underestimate the extent of problematic parenting. Second, communities need to normalize involvement in parenting support programs rather than singling out or stigmatizing parents. Third, a population approach could have many benefits, such as preventing behavioral and emotional problems in early childhood, encouraging greater school readiness, and reducing the risk of problems during adolescence. Fourth, compared to strategies that target a narrow segment of parents and children, a population approach may create a climate of positive social contagion for positive parenting.
   Triple P-a multitiered system of programs with varying intensity levels, delivery formats, and specialized variants-aims to increase the number of parents who have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to raise their children well; to decrease the number of children who develop behavioral and emotional problems; and to reduce the number of children maltreated by their parents. Prinz outlines the origins and guiding principles of Triple P, describes the program model, and explains the conceptual framework for the multitiered approach to prevention. He then summarizes the evidence for this approach, emphasizing population studies that have tested the full Triple P system. He also discusses such critical issues as implementation and quality assurance, benefits versus costs, and significant obstacles to adopting a population strategy for parenting support.

AB Purpose of review
   Since the last review of Williams syndrome in Current Opinion (2001) there have been many advances in knowledge about the cognitive, social and psychological impairments that characterize the disorder. The present review focuses on current research in these areas.
   Recent findings
   Williams syndrome is associated with a wide range of cognitive, linguistic, social and other difficulties. When young, these deficits may appear relatively mild - for example, many children are highly sociable and talkative - but with age the impact of these difficulties becomes more evident. Thus, inappropriate social behaviours can significantly increase the risk of social exclusion and vulnerability to abuse. Their superficially good speech can lead to educational and other services failing to understand the true extent of impairments or the need for specialist support. Mental health problems, especially related to anxiety, often become an increasing challenge from adolescence onwards.
   Summary
   The core difficulties associated with Williams syndrome have a cascading effect on many areas of development over time. However, specialist provision is rare and intervention trials are almost nonexistent. Longitudinal research is needed to identify factors associated with cognitive, social and emotional problems and to develop more effective ways of minimizing and treating difficulties.

   About one in 650-1000 children is born with an extra X or Y chromosome, referred to as sex chromosome trisomies (SCTs). Studying SCTs may uncover unique insights in neurodevelopmental pathways underlying the risk for neurobehavioral problems and psychopathology. There is also a clinical need for more knowledge about the phenotype of SCT with the recent introduction of noninvasive prenatal screening.

   The reviewed studies illustrate an increased vulnerability for psychopathology such as (symptoms of) autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression and, to a lesser degree, psychotic disorders. Although traditionally the primary focus has been on language and learning problems, recent research suggests that impairments in executive functioning, social cognition and emotion regulation may also be key factors underlying the risk for neurobehavioral problems.
   Summary
   The research field of SCT is in need of a more longitudinal perspective to identify early markers of ` at risk' development, and to assess the effectiveness of early interventions. Neurocognitive markers that signal compromised neurodevelopment may prove to be helpful in this. Variability in the SCT phenotype provides a unique opportunity to identify not only genetic but also environmental factors that shape neurodevelopmental outcome, calling for studies focused on understanding individual differences.

AB Although alcohol, tobacco and cannabis are the most prevalent drugs used by adolescents, gambling is a growing concern due to its increasing popularity. To date there have been few studies exploring the existing patterns of concurrent use of drugs and gambling in adolescents. This study aims to identify subpopulations of adolescents using different substances and gambling activities, to explore gender differences and to examine impulsivity as a predictor of class membership. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 22 high-schools, and 1644 adolescents were assessed (54.1% males; mean age = 15.21 years, SD =.75). Participants reported their last-year frequency of using alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, as well as bingo, poker, other casino games, sports betting, lottery, scratch tickets and electronic gaming machines. Problem drinking was evaluated with the Rutgers Alcohol Problems Index, and gambling severity with the South Oaks Gambling Scale for Adolescents. Impulsivity was assessed using a Delay Discounting task, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Impulsive Sensation-Seeking Scale. Based on a latent class model of drugs and gambling activities, four subpopulations of males and five of females were found. General impulsivity and sensation seeking were the most consistent predictors of class membership. These novel findings support the need to consider specific groups of adolescents engaging in different patterns of addictive behaviors when implementing selective prevention strategies.

ID DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES; 5-FACTOR MODEL; SATISFACTION; BEHAVIORS;
   VALIDITY; SAMPLE
AB Authors aimed to examine an explanatory model of risk that started with dysfunctional personality trait domains, passed through low levels of mindfulness, and culminated with problem gambling. For individuals with problem gambling, mindfulness may provide a significant avenue to prevent them from engaging in addictive behaviors and lead them to an improved sense of self-control and emotion regulation. We employed a mediation analysis design assessing 326 Caucasian adolescent regular gamblers ranging in age from 15 to 17 years who were recruited in betting or bingo halls. Using the Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form (PID-5-BF)-Children, the South Oaks Gambling Screen, and the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, we examined the hypothesis that low levels of mindfulness partially mediate the relationship between dysfunctional personality trait domains and problem gambling. The findings underline the role that may play by the core skills of mindfulness. Indeed, results suggest how adolescents with personalities characterized by antagonism, disinhibition, and negative affectivity may tend toward a lack of awareness of self-related mental states and difficulty purposefully regulating attention and dealing with negative emotions that predispose them to gambling as a means of escape from uncomfortable feelings.

AB Objectives Longitudinal data on the course and relationship of concurrent psychopathology in youth are scarce but are of need for better practical patient care and prevention. This study explores the course of (and relationships over time) between sleep problems and concurrent dimensional difficulties relating to anxiety/depression, attention deficiency, and aggressive behaviors in childhood and adolescence. The latter three may jointly form a broad syndrome, the dysregulation profile.
   Methods Young people from the Raine Study, a large community cohort sample (N = 1625) were followed from age 5 to 17 years. Developmental courses of sleep problems and its concurrent regulatory difficulties were estimated separately and jointly.
   Results The majority of adolescents reported low levels of problems and which appeared to be stable over time, while a small group (rates between 7.8% and 10.1%) reported enduring problematic developmental courses. Sleep problems and regulatory difficulties shared a strong association in their development over time (individual's probabilities of having the same courses, i.e. low-low and high-high, were between 89.8% and 92.3%). Furthermore, having persistent sleep problems over time was associated with an increased risk of having regulatory difficulties by approximately 10 times, and vice versa.
   Conclusion Findings from this study provide empirical evidence for a strong mutual association in the development of sleep problems and difficulties of dysregulation with emotion, cognition, and aggression. It may be suggested that a positive screening of one such psychopathological dimension should lead to a careful assessment, not only to reduce the problem in question but also to prevent the youth from further problems.

AB Objective: This article reports results of a pilot study of three participants receiving regulation-focused psychotherapy for children (RFP-C), a manualized, short-term, psychodynamic treatment for children with oppositional defiant disorder and other externalizing problems. RFP-C targets implicit emotion regulation while using an intensive, psychodynamic, play therapy approach to decrease the child's need for disruptive behaviors.
   Methods: Three children with oppositional defiant disorder participated in a trial of RFP-C. Externalizing symptoms were assessed with the Oppositional Defiant Disorder Rating Scale, and emotion regulation was assessed with the Emotion Regulation Checklist.
   Results: All three children improved in accordance with expectations. Participants exhibited clinically significant and reliable change, as assessed by the primary symptom measure, and demonstrated improved capacity for emotional regulation.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that RFP-C has the potential to produce significant improvements in emotion regulation capacity and in symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder. This pilot study provides initial support for RFP-C as an efficacious and cost-effective intervention, with high treatment compliance rates, and lays the groundwork for a randomized controlled trial of the intervention.

AB Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit difficulties with negative affect. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been successfully adapted for individuals with ASD to treat these difficulties. In a wait-list control study, for example, group analyses showed promising results for young children with ASD using a developmentally adapted group CBT approach. This report examined response to group CBT in terms of individual-level change in young children with ASD. Eighteen children with ASD, aged 5-7 years, and their respective parents participated in treatment. Parents completed pre- and post-treatment measures of negative affect and related behaviours. Treatment responders and non-responders were grouped based on significant treatment outcomes as assessed by statistically significant change for lability/negativity and 20% decrease in intensity, duration or frequency of emotional outbursts. Results indicated that 67% of children met criteria as a treatment responder, showing meaningful improvement in at least two outcome measures. No significant group differences emerged for initial characteristics before treatment. Wilcoxon signed rank tests determined pre-/post-treatment change in parental confidence for each treatment responder group. Results indicated statistically significant increase for the treatment responder group in parent-reported confidence in their own ability and in their child's ability to manage the child's anger and anxiety, but these results were not significant for the treatment non-responder group. Results provide additional evidence that CBT can significantly decrease expressions of anger/anxiety in children with ASD as young as 5 years, yet also suggest need for further improvement.

AB Background: Siblings of children with disabilities are the most likely family members to be affected by the child's disability due to the long-lasting nature of relationships between siblings compared to those of other family members. The aim of the present study was to compare the emotional-behavioral difficulties (EBD) in siblings of children with and without Sensory Impairments (SI).
   Methods: The statistical population of this causal-comparative research included all siblings of children with and without SI in Shiraz, southern Iran in 2016. The sample consisted of ninety-one siblings of children with (38) and without (53) SI in Shiraz. Sample of siblings of children with SI was recruited by purposeful sampling and sample of siblings of children without sensory impairments were selected through a multistage random sampling method. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was utilized for measuring EBD. Two way ANOVA and MANOVA tests were used for data analyses.
   Results: Total EBD and two subscales of EBD (emotional problems and peer relationship problems) in siblings of children with SI were significantly greater than the comparison group (P<0.001). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the two subscales (conduct problems, and hyperactivity) between these two groups.
   Conclusion: This study provides strong evidence that siblings of children with SI are significantly at a higher risk of psychological problems, and accordingly we suggest for the related supports and services.

AB Background: In recent years, application and practice of mindfulness-based interventions to reduce adolescent psychological problems are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to design and study tools that measure mindfulness and its effects.
   Objectives: One of the available tools to measure mindfulness in adolescents is the mindfulness attention awareness scale for adolescents (MAAS-A). The current study aimed at examining the factor structure and reliability of a Persian version of this scale and investigating the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety.
   Methods: The current descriptive, cross sectional and psychometric study was conducted on 354 students from Kashan city, Iran, selected via the cluster sampling method in 2017. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) by the principle component analysis method, the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety were conducted to examine the validity of the MAAS-A. To calculate the reliability of the MAAS-A, Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability (four-week interval) were employed. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 19.0 and AMOS-22.
   Results: The results of the EFA suggested two factors for this scale labeled as "acting with attention and awareness" and "attention to the present moment". The CFA confirmed the two-factor model of the 14-item scale (the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 90% confidence interval (CI) = 0.001 - 0.06). The reliability of this scale was good (alpha = 0.81, retest reliability = 0.86) and the correlation between mindfulness and anxiety was negative and significant (r = -0.43, P < 0.01). Also, this relationship was significant in females (r = -0.44, P < 0.01) and males (r = -0.46, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: According to the results of the current study, the MAAS-A was a reliable and valuable scale to measure the mindfulness of adolescents. The results of correlation between mindfulness and anxiety meant that by increasing mindfulness, the anxiety reduced in adolescents.

AB Self-distancing (i.e., creating mental distance between the self and a stimulus by adopting a less egocentric perspective) has been studied as a way to improve adolescents' and adults' emotion regulation. These studies instruct adolescents and adults to use visual imagery or language to create distance from the self before engaging in self-regulation tasks and when thinking about past and future events. For example, adults are asked to recall past, negative emotional experiences from either a first-person perspective (no distance) or a third-person perspective (self-distanced). These studies show that a self-distanced perspective allows adults to cope more adaptively when recalling negative feelings. However, the self-distancing paradigm used with adults was not developmentally appropriate for young children. This modified self-distancing paradigm involves instructing children to think about their thoughts, feelings, and actions from different perspectives that vary in their distance from the self while completing a self-regulation task. The paradigm involves randomly assigning children to use one of three perspectives: self-immersed, third-person, or exemplar. In the self-immersed condition, children are asked to think about themselves using the first-person perspective (e.g., "How am I feeling?") and no distance is created from the self. In the third-person condition, children are asked to create distance from the self by using the third-person perspective (e.g., "How is [child's name] feeling?"). In the exemplar condition, the greatest distance from the self is created by asking children to pretend to be a media character and to think about that character's thoughts and feelings (e.g., "How is Batman feeling?"). Studies using the self-distancing paradigm with 4-6-year-olds have found that as the amount of distance from the self increases (self-immersed < third-person < exemplar), children perform better on self-regulation tasks. These findings suggest that the strategies implemented in the self-distancing protocol may be useful to include in self-regulation interventions for young children.

AB With many children and young adolescents reporting strong emotional bonds with their pets, the impact of pet ownership on child/adolescent healthespecially on their emotional developmenthas garnered increasing scientific interest. We examined the association between pet ownership in toddlerhood (age 3.5 years) and poor emotional expression in later childhood (age 5.5 years) using propensity score matching within a longitudinal cohort dataset from Japan (n = 31,453). A propensity score for pet ownership was calculated by logistic models based on a comprehensive list of each child's observed characteristics, including sex, household income, parental education, mother's employment status, residential environment, number of siblings, and living arrangement. Log-binomial regression analyses using matched samples revealed that children who owned pets during the toddler years were 6% less likely to have a poor emotional expression in later childhood (prevalence ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval = 0.90-0.99) compared to those without pets. This suggests that owning pets may provide children with opportunities to control their emotions, and lead to a lower prevalence of poor emotional expression. Pet ownership in toddlerhood may contribute to the development of expression.

AB Background and aims: Gaming disorder was recently recognized as a mental health disorder by the World Health Organization and included in the International Classification of Diseases. Extensive research has been conducted with regard to psychosocial correlates and comorbidity, less so for the developmental mechanisms and the processes leading to the disorder. The association between family factors, personality traits, and gaming has been studied independently but not in combination. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study examined (a) the association between parental acceptance-rejection theory and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and (b) the mediating and moderating effect of core self-evaluations (CSE), a personality construct, on the aforementioned variables. Methods: The study was quantitative and involved young adults members of online gaming communities (N = 225). Results: The results showed that parental rejection is associated with the occurrence of IGD, only through the mediating effect of CSE. The moderation model was not confirmed. Discussion: Findings bridge early emotional deficits with CSE personality traits and IGD, based on two widely acknowledged theoretical frameworks. In addition, they highlight the importance of the father's role in upbringing. Conclusions: These frameworks combine cognitive and attachment perspectives and a process-oriented approach to the development and maintenance of IGD. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to (a) the mechanisms leading to the disorder and (b) providing an evidence base for therapeutic interventions for IGD to go beyond abstinence and include self-esteem enhancement and efficacy contingencies. Directions for future research are also provided in this study.

AB Background and aims: Recent research used attachment theory and the metacognitive tenet as frameworks to explain problematic Facebook use (PFU). This study aims to test, in a single model, the role of different attachment styles and metacognitions in PFU among adolescents. Methods: Two separate studies were conducted in order to establish the link between security (Study 1) and insecurity (Study 2), metacognitions, and PFU. A total of 369 and 442 Italian adolescents (age: 14-20 years old) participated in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Results: Path analyses revealed the relative importance of different attachment dimensions with mother and father in predicting PFU and the mediating role of metacognitions between attachment styles and PFU. Discussion and conclusion: In conclusion, since attachment styles and PFU may significantly affect adolescents' development and well-being, the results of this study may provide some practical indications for researchers and practitioners.

AB Purpose of ReviewThis review summarizes findings on pediatric loss-of-control (LOC) eating and obesity published since 2013 in relation to physiological, socioenvironmental, and psychological factors.Recent FindingsLOC eating and obesity are highly comorbid in youth. Genetic and physiological risk factors are associated with the development of LOC eating. Adverse physiological outcomes of LOC eating include increased risk for overweight and obesity and greater dysfunction in components of metabolic syndrome. Socioenvironmental, psychological, and behavioral factors, such as weight-based teasing, dieting, negative affect, emotion dysregulation, and aspects of cognitive functioning, are consistently related to LOC eating in youth, independent of weight. Prospectively, LOC eating may predict the onset of anxiety disorders, depression, and more severe eating psychopathology later in life. Updates on interventions and future directions are discussed.SummaryLOC eating may be a key symptom to target adverse physiological and psychological outcomes; however, treatments are limited and require further examination.

AB The World Health Organization has recognized aggressive behavior and violence in adolescence as a global public health problem. This study examined a Dual-Pathway Model that theorizes two pathways through which self-control skills (SCS) may relate to aggression by focusing on two potential mediating cognitive variables: perceived subjective happiness and time perspective (i.e., one's view of past, present, and future experiences). A sample of 2982 Israeli adolescents (50% boys aged 11-17) completed a battery of questionnaires including SCS, subjective happiness, time perspective, hostility, anger, and physical aggression. The results of a path analysis with the bootstrap method for testing indirect effects indicated a series of variables forming two mediation chains. In the protective pathway, SCS linked positively to happiness that in turn negatively linked with hostility, anger, and physical aggression. At the same time, in the risk factors pathway, SCS linked negatively to unbalanced time perspective that in turn was linked with hostility, anger, and physical aggression. Gender differences were also found, with girls scoring significantly higher than boys on SCS and boys scoring significantly higher than girls on the physical aggression. The results lend initial credence to a Dual-Pathway Model, which may be beneficial in practical interventions geared to help adolescents with low SCS to become not only happier but also more temporally balanced and, ultimately, less aggressive.

AB Childhood trauma refers to aversive experiences during childhood and adolescents. Most studies have investigated retrospective reports of childhood trauma in the past considering the various long-term consequences of such experiences. Long-term consequences of childhood trauma include emotion dysregulation and problematic self-regulation (e.g., aggressive behavior, eating disorders, alcohol and drug misuse). Specifically, the impact of family violence needs to be considered with caution. Family violence has a crucial influence on the family in general and through transgenerational transmission. Childhood trauma has been a relevant topic for the past 20 years in the USA and for the last decade in the German-speaking countries.

AB A consequence of traumatic experiences is the development of trauma-related callous-unemotional (CU) traits that are associated with aggressive behaviour in adolescents. Trauma-related CU traits differ from primary CU traits on their genesis and the nature of deficits in emotional regulation. The aim of the current study was to compare functional and dysfunctional as well as internal and external emotion regulation strategies in adolescents depending on traumatic exposure and CU traits. We examined N = 274 adolescents (12 to 17 years), who retrospectively reported potentially traumatic experiences, CU traits, and aggressive behaviour. We compared four groups: without potentially traumatic experiences and with low CU traits (n = 188, 68.6 %), without potentially traumatic experiences and with high CU traits (n = 33, 12.0 %), with potentially traumatic experiences and low CU traits (n = 33, 12.0 %), with potentially traumatic experiences and high CU traits (n = 14, 5.1 %). Adolescents with high CU traits showed significantly more deficits in external emotion regulation strategies than adolescents with low CU traits. From the adolescents with high CU traits only these without traumatic experiences showed significantly less internal-functional strategies than adolescents with low CU traits. There were no significant differences between both groups of adolescents with high CU-traits. The findings give important insights that a differential diagnostic could inform the selection of specific therapeutic goals in order to improve emotion regulation depending on traumatic exposure and CU traits.

AB Decreased emotional awareness contributes to the risk of internalizing disorders, such as depression. Although emotional awareness may be especially important during adolescence, a developmental period in which emotional arousal is high and the risk of depression rises dramatically, little research has examined the mechanisms linking emotional awareness to depression. Starting from affect regulation models, the current study proposes emotion regulation (ER) as a key underlying mechanism in the emotional awarenessdepression relationship. The current study investigated whether maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies mediate the relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms among youth using a cross-sectional design. Participants were 220 youth (65% girls; Mage=11.87, SD=1.94) who filled out a set of questionnaires assessing emotional awareness, ER strategies, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed no direct relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms. However, emotional awareness yielded a significant mediation effect through total adaptive ER strategies on higher depressive symptoms. No evidence was found for the mediating role of maladaptive ER strategies in this relationship. The current study provides further support for affect regulation models positing that emotional awareness may be a basic skill that is required for learning adaptive ER skills, and thus call for greater attention to adaptive ER strategies.

AB We investigated the developmental implications of online social interactions among 590 youth transitioning to university. We observed friends' posts on participants' Facebook pages, and considered attributes of friends' posts used to indicate positive and negative relationship quality in face-to-face interactions. After statistical control of beginning-of-year functioning and participants' Facebook content, Facebook friends' deviant content posts (swearing; illegal/sexualized activities) predicted participants' lower grade point average, Facebook friends' posts indicating connection to participants predicted participants' lower psychopathology, and Facebook friends' verbal aggression posts predicted participants' lower institutional attachment, by the end of the year. Negative effects of friends' posts were strongest for participants who were disliked by peers face to face. The online context may uniquely influence youth adjustment in conjunction with face-to-face relationships.

AB Binge drinking is an excessive pattern of alcohol use, highly prevalent in adolescents and young adults. Several studies have explored the cognitive impairments associated with binge drinking, and Carbia et al. (2018) recently proposed a systematic review of these impairments. Although this review offers an insightful and up-to-date synthesis of this research field, the authors concluded that binge drinking is not associated with attentional impairments. We argue that such conclusion is premature. We identified published studies not mentioned by Carbia et al. (2018), which documented attentional impairments in binge drinking. In particular, a differential exploration of attentional networks has suggested that binge drinkers not only exhibit impairments for the executive control of attention, but also for its alerting network. We thus recommend a better consideration of attention in future experimental and translational research agendas.

AB The experience of pain during nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) remains enigmatic. Ultimately, there is a dearth of evidence regarding whether pain is actually experienced during NSSI behavior and, if it is, to what extent that pain offsets following cessation of the NSSI episode. Using a smartphone app to collect information on self-injury episodes reported by adolescents and young adults in their daily lives, we found that across 143 NSSI episodes comprising 442 NSSI behaviors, most participants reported feeling significant and substantial pain onset during most NSSI episodes. A small effect was established for pain offset, with pain diminishing somewhat for most at NSSI completion. Furthermore, those who had higher negative emotion at the start of NSSI episodes but experienced less pain onset reported more NSSI behaviors during such episodes. The evidence supports a dynamic experience of pain during self-injury that can vary between people and episodes.

AB Purpose of ReviewEmotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cause clinically significant impairments. We review recent neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and peripheral psychophysiological evidence for emotion and emotion regulation deficits in ADHD across youth and adults.Recent FindingsCentral and autonomous nervous system correlates argue in favor of more general self-regulation deficits and also specific emotional deficits in ADHD. These include general performance deficits in executive functions, and structural as well as functional impairments in neuronal networks associated with top-down self-regulation. Specific deficits with bottom-up emotional activation in the amygdala and emotion evaluation associated with the orbitofrontal cortex have also been described. Furthermore, vagally mediated, high-frequency heart rate variability is associated with emotional self-regulation deficits throughout the life span. The current evidence is based on multilevel studies that assess associations of emotion regulation. However, further studies that adequately consider the processual recursive character of emotion generation and regulation may give important new insights into emotional regulation of ADHD.SummaryEmotion regulation deficits in ADHD are associated with specific as well as general self-regulation deficits traceable on the level of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and psychophysiological assessments. The temporal dynamics of the interplay of those different systems need further study in order to optimize and personalize treatment of emotion regulation difficulties, including emotional reactivity, in patients with ADHD.

AB IMPORTANCE Paternal depression during the postnatal period has been associated with adverse child outcomes. Family environment has been reported as a pathway for risk transmission from fathers to children. The influence of paternal depression during the postnatal period on offspring depression remains to be clarified.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between paternal depression in the postnatal period and offspring depression and explore potential mediating and moderating factors that influence any association between paternal and offspring depression.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective study of a UK community-based birth cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) of parents and their adolescent offspring investigated associations between paternal depression during the postnatal period and offspring depression at age 18 years. We tested a hypothesized moderator (ie, sex) and conducted path analysis to examine hypothesized mediators (ie, depression in the other parent, couple conflict, and paternal involvement and emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity in offspring at age 3.5 years) of the associations between both paternal and maternal depression and offspring depression. Data collection for the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children began in 1991 and is ongoing. Data analysis for this study was conducted from June 2015 to September 2018.
   EXPOSURES Depression symptoms in fathers at 8 weeks after the birth of their children.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Offspring depression symptoms at age 18 years, using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes.
   RESULTS A total of 3176 father-offspring pairs were analyzed; of the children, 1764 were girls (55.5%) and 1412 (44.5%) were boys. Paternal mean (SD) age at delivery was 29.6 (9.6) years. The offspring of fathers who had depression during the postnatal period were at increased risk of experiencing depression symptoms at age 18 years (beta = 0.053 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]). The association is mediated by maternal depression at 8 months after birth (beta = 0.011[95% CI 0.0008-0.02]; 21% [0.011/0.053]) and conduct problems at 42 months after birth (beta = 0.004; [95% CI, -0.00004 to 0.009]; 7.5% [0.004/0.053]). Couple conflict and paternal involvement do not mediate this association. The increased risk is seen in girls but not boys (interaction beta = 0.095; P = 01).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The association between paternal depression in the postnatal period and depression in girls at age 18 years is partially explained by maternal depression. Couple conflict and paternal involvement were not found to play a role in the risk of transmission; this contrasts with the role that couple conflict was found to play in the risk of childhood behavior problems. Conduct problems in childhood appear to be a pathway for risk transmission between paternal depression and subsequent depression in offspring at age 18 years.

AB We examined the bidirectional relations between peer relations and attention problems from middle childhood through adolescence. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Chinese Children and Adolescents (LSCCA, N=2157, 51.9% male), three key aspects of peer relations (acceptance, rejection, and victimization) were assessed annually from 9 to 16years of age. Attention problems were assessed at 9 and 15years. Latent growth modeling indicated that greater attention problems at age 9 were linked with a lower intercept for peer acceptance, and higher intercepts for rejection and victimization. Also, prior lower acceptance and greater rejection and victimization, along with a higher increase over time in rejection and lower decrease over time in victimization, predicted attention problems at age 15. Cross-lagged analysis showed that attention problems were associated with less subsequent peer acceptance and greater subsequent rejection and victimization. Only peer rejection (but neither victimization nor acceptance) predicted more subsequent attention problems. Findings point to bidirectional associations between attention problems and peer relations in the developmental transition across adolescence. Evidence for differential bidirectionality of attention problems with the multiple peer experience (group versus dyadic; good versus bad) emerged, and future replications are needed.

AB Callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., lack of empathy, lack of guilt, shallow affect) are associated with severe and persistent conduct problems in youth. There is evidence showing a substantial genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems. The etiological associations between CU traits and other psychopathological symptoms, including symptoms of hyperactivity and emotional problems (such as anxiety and depression symptoms), have been less explored. To examine the etiological associations between CU traits and symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity and emotional problems separately through the use of a twin design. Participants were same-sex twin pairs (n=426 twins; 42% female; 43% MZ; age=15) drawn from the Child and Adolescents Twin Study in Sweden, a longitudinal study of twins born in Sweden. The sample was mainly composed of children who screenpositive on neurodevelopmental problems/mental health problems or at-risk children (i.e., screen-negative children considered to be genetically at-risk siblings). We used self-report measures of CU traits, conduct problems, hyperactivity and emotional problems. Model-fitting analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. We found a strong positive genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems and a moderate genetic correlation between CU traits and hyperactivity. We also found a relatively modest, but significant negative genetic correlation between CU traits and emotional problems. Using a sample of adolescent twins screened for neurodevelopmental problems, we replicated previous findings that showed a strong genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems and we extended research by examining further the etiological associations between CU traits and symptoms of hyperactivity and emotional problems.

AB Adolescence is a period of heightened emotional reactivity, which is reflected in greater activation in emotion-processing regions of the brain in adolescents relative to children and adults. While elevated emotional reactivity and poor emotion regulation are thought to contribute to the rise in rates of internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, during adolescence, little research has examined factors predicting individual differences in the neural regulation of emotion that can explain why only some adolescents experience anxiety. To address this gap, the present study examined the contribution of childhood negative emotionality (NE) and cognitive control (CC) to neural processing of emotion in adolescence. A sample of 44 girls (M age=15.5, SD=0.35) was selected from a longitudinal study that included self, parent, and teacher report of NE and CC between 2nd and 7th grades. Following 9th grade, girls completed an emotion regulation task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Neural regulation of emotion was indexed by functional connectivity between the amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) during emotion regulation. Analyses revealed that NE predicted a less mature pattern of amygdala-rVLPFC connectivity while CC predicted a more mature pattern of amygdala-rVLPFC connectivity. Additionally, we found an interaction between NE and CC, such that NE predicted emotion dysregulation at low but not high levels of CC. Neural dysregulation of emotion was associated with anxiety symptoms across the following nine months. These findings identify important individual differences in the development of emotion dysregulation that contribute to risk for anxiety in adolescence.

AB The aims of the current study were to: 1) identify patterns of agreement between parent-adolescent dyads on reports of adolescent borderline personality features utilizing latent class analysis (LCA) and 2) examine the clinical implications of class membership for indices of psychiatric severity and internal psychological resources. The sample included 643 adolescent inpatients. Borderline personality features were assessed by both adolescents and parents using the Borderline Personality Features Scale - Child (BPFS-C; Crick et al. 2005) and Borderline Personality Features Scale - Parent (BPFS-P; Sharp et al. 2010), respectively. Following recommended statistical approaches for evaluating rater concordance, LCA was utilized to identify distinct classes of parent-adolescent dyads based on concordance/discrepancy in BPFS reports. The subsequent classes were then related to outcome measures of psychiatric severity and internal psychological resources (emotion regulation and experiential acceptance). LCA identified 3 classes of parent-adolescent dyads: 2 convergent classes demonstrating BPFS-P and BPFS-C agreement at a moderate and high level and a divergent class consisting of dyads reporting clinically significant scores on the BPFS-P but clinically negligible BPFS-C scores. Both convergent classes evidenced higher rates of psychiatric severity and lower access to internal resources. The current study is the first to use LCA to examine the relation between informant concordance on reports of DSM-based adolescent borderline pathology in a clinical sample. The significance of the discrepancies within and between classes is discussed with relation to psychosocial outcomes, the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and implications for what it means when parents and adolescents disagree.

AB Self-regulation is a foundational skill in childhood and underpins various positive and negative outcomes throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. Parents and the way they parent their children play a key role in the development of young children's self-regulatory capacity. However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of parenting interventions on child self-regulatory outcomes. This paper provides an overview of the role of parenting in the development of child self-regulation and a summary of the evidence base for parenting interventions to promote self-regulation in children under age eight, focusing on infancy, the toddler/preschooler period, and early school-age. We conclude by examining the gaps in this field of research and providing directions for future research.

AB Self-regulation is developed early in life through family and parenting interactions. There has been considerable debate on how to best conceptualize and enhance self-regulation. Many consider self-regulation as the socio-emotional competencies required for healthy and productive living, including the flexibility to regulate emotions, control anger, maintain calm under pressure, and respond adaptively to a variety of situations. Its enhancement is the focus of many child and family interventions. An important limitation of the self-regulation field is that most empirical and conceptual research comes from high-income countries (HICs). Less is known about the manifestation, measurement and role of self-regulation in many collectivistic, rural, or less-developed contexts such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This position paper aims to present an initial review of the existing literature on self-regulation in LMICs, with a focus on parenting, and to describe challenges in terms of measurement and implementation of self-regulation components into existing interventions for parents, children and adolescents in these settings. We conclude by establishing steps or recommendations for conducting basic research to understand how self-regulation expresses itself in vulnerable and low-resource settings and for incorporating components of self-regulation into services in LMICs.

AB Socialization of children's emotions is implicated in a variety of child outcomes including children's social and emotional competence, peer relations, self-esteem, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Recognizing the importance of culture, an emerging body of literature has examined caregiver socialization of children's emotions in culturally diverse groups and has shown both similarities and variation in parental emotion-related socialization behaviors. Preliminary findings also suggest that caregiver emotion socialization behaviors that are associated with adaptive child outcomes in White middle-class families (with whom a bulk of the emotion socialization research is conducted) may not be related to adaptive child functioning in other cultural groups. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework that extends Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) model and unpacks aspects of culture that help explain the variation in caregiver emotion socialization processes and in the relation between caregiver emotion socialization and child socio-emotional functioning across cultural groups. Within the context of this framework, we systematically review published studies of caregiver emotion related socialization behaviors in culturally diverse families for children between preschool-age to adolescence, with a focus on their implication for child well-being. Gaps in the existing literature are identified, and directions for future research are outlined.

AB Despite abuse, children placed in childcare homes have parental representations which are marked by ambivalence. This ambivalence is characterized by the coexistence of negative and positive representation towards their biological parents. However, the fact that positive representations towards neglecting parents persist can possibly harm self-esteem. Placement aims not only to protect the child, but also to offer him the possibility of reconstructing his self-image with more secure attachment figures. When a placement is decided, the children are entrusted to Child Welfare and are placed either with their siblings or separately. This study aims to examine the parental representations and the self-esteem of 33 children that are placed with siblings and 25 children that are placed alone; all children were between the ages of 10 and 18. Then, the relation between parental representations and self-esteem was examined in each group. Those two dimensions have been respectively measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale and the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). The results show that participants placed with their siblings were less depressed and had a better self-esteem than participants placed separately. Moreover, although the two groups had neglecting parents, the participants placed with their siblings had significantly better parental care representations. This study also put into light that the links between parental representations and self-esteem are significantly different whether the participant is placed with his siblings or not. Among children placed with siblings, the more positive the images of the father and the mother, the lower the self-esteem level. These results confirm the hypothesis according to which a positive parental care representation could reinforce the negative image those children have of themselves. The results also question the effects (positive or negative) of the defensive exclusion process on the evolution of self-representations among placed children. Finally, from a therapeutic point of view, they stress the importance of working on self-esteem with placed children. (C) 2017 Societe Francaise de Psychologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Emotional reactions to peer victimization may increase risk for subsequent peer victimization. In the present study, we investigated whether shame mediated the development of chronic peer victimization, i.e., young people's experiences of being bullied persistently across time. We used a multiple mediation model to test the indirect effects of Time-1 victimization on Time-3 victimization (1 year later) through 4 Time-2 shame-related variables (characterological, bodily, and behavioral shame; shame proneness) for 396 youth (10-13 years of age). The total indirect effect of Time-1 victimization on Time-3 victimization through the 4 shame-related mediators was statistically significant. Analyses revealed specific indirect positive effects for bodily shame and shame proneness. Findings suggest that shame may be an emotional mechanism underlying chronic peer victimization.

AB There is growing recognition that clinical and developmental outcomes will be optimized by interventions that harness strengths in addition to ameliorating deficits. Although empirically-supported methods for identifying strengths are available for children and adolescents, this framework has yet to be applied to emerging adulthood. This study evaluates the nature of the Five Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD) - character, confidence, competence, connection, and caring - in a sample of emerging adults from six universities (N=4654; 70% female; 81% White). Historically, PYD has been modeled as either separate correlated factors or a second-order factor structure. More recently, the bifactor model has been recommended to determine the degree to which PYD is unidimensional versus multidimensional. The present study examined the multidimensionality of PYD by comparing the model fit of a one-factor, five-correlated factor model, and second-order factor structure with a bifactor model and found support for the bifactor model with evidence of invariance across sex. Criterion validity was also assessed using three criterion measures particularly relevant for adjustment during emerging adulthood: anxiety, depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties. PYD and the residual Cs tended to correlate negatively with indicators of maladaptive development. Future directions including applications of the PYD framework as a measure of thriving across emerging adulthood are discussed.

AB Adolescence is characterized by neurological reorganization, developments in cognitive and emotional processing, and an increasingly complex social world. During this sensitive transitional period, the ways in which adolescents identify and engage with internal and external challenges is integral to developmental trajectories. More resources should be dedicated to promoting adaptive development in adolescence, particularly ones that capitalize on and support adolescent's growing self-regulatory and socio-cognitive skills. This article summarizes research and theory on one such resource, mindful practices, and evaluates these practices as they relate to the needs and challenges of adolescence. Mindfulness-based programs are also evaluated as interventions for adolescents who are at risk for, or have already developed, maladaptive behaviors. By promoting self-regulatory and socio-cognitive skills, mindfulness practices may enhance adolescents' agentic control over their own developmental trajectories. While more research is still needed, there is substantial evidence that mindfulness is a flexible and efficacious program with potentially far-reaching implications for promoting adaptive development in adolescence.

AB Background: Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, many people, including children and adolescents, have fled their homes into neighboring countries. Little research exists on the psychosocial adjustment of refugee children and adolescents resettled in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of PTSD and emotion dysregulation in Syrian refugee children and adolescents who resettled in Lebanon and Jordan. It was hypothesized that a combination of pre-trauma variables (age and gender), trauma-specific variables (traumatic events and time spent in host country, and host country), and post-trauma variables (coping strategies, family relationships, and school environment) would be associated with PTSD and emotion dysregulation.
   Participants and Setting: Participants were 1000 Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 7-18 years attending formal and non-formal schools representing various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Methods: The trauma exposure scale, DSM-IV criteria for the assessment of PTSD, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Kidcope, Family relationship scales, and school environment scale were administered in an interview format with children and adolescents at school by two trained psychologists. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict PTSD whereas hierarchical multiple regression was used to predict emotion dysregulation.
   Results: Results indicated that 45.6% of the refugees have developed PTSD with excessive risk for comorbidity with emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation was reported by older refugee children and adolescents. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in refugee children and adolescents who had resettled in Lebanon than for those who had resettled in Jordan. Refugee children and adolescents who were exposed to higher levels of war atrocities evidenced the greatest prevalence of PTSD and emotion dysregulation. PTSD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents varied according to coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. Both decreased significantly with the passage of time spent in host country.
   Conclusions: The results may be used to formulate cognitive behavioral coping interventions that can lead to optimal developmental outcomes in the posttrauma environment.

AB Background: School-aged children and adolescents exposed to domestic violence (DV) disproportionality attend to threatening and sad cues in their environment. This bias in attention has been found to predict elevations in symptoms of psychopathology. Studies have yet to explore attention biases using eyetracking technology in preschool-aged children with DV exposure. Objective: This study investigated whether preschool-aged children exposed to DV show vigilance to angry and sad faces versus happy faces and a target non-face stimulus relative to non-exposed children, and whether such vigilance relates to child social-emotional development.
   Participants and setting: Preschool-aged children were recruited from a large, diverse, urban community. DV-exposed children were recruited from a dyadic, mother-child treatment group specifically designed for, and restricted to, mothers who have experienced domestic violence (DV-exposed group, n = 23). Children with no prior exposure to DV and their mothers were recruited within the same community (non-exposed group, n = 32).
   Methods: Children completed an eye-tracking task to assess their attention to face stimuli and mothers rated their children's social-emotional development. Total duration of fixations were analyzed.
   Results: Results showed that DV-exposed children have a significantly stronger attention bias away from sad faces (p = 0.03; d = 0.62) and neutral faces (p = 0.02; d = 0.70) relative to non exposed children, and this attention bias away from sad and neutral faces is associated with child social-emotional problems. Contrary to our hypothesis, no bias towards anger was found for DV exposed versus non-exposed children.
   Conclusions: This study contributes to growing evidence that young children's negative attention biases influence functioning and have important implications for children's well-being and development.

AB Background: Childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) and intimate partner violence victimization (IPV) is prevalent among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (LGB). Identification of distinct patterns of childhood and adult victimization, including technology-mediated and face-to-face IPV, and their cumulative relations to mental/behavioral health challenges, among LGB people is needed to facilitate identification of at-risk individuals.
   Objective: Using latent class analysis, we first sought to identify patterns of lifetime interpersonal victimization, primarily five types of CAN and IPV in LGB emerging adults. Second, we examined if LGB-status and race/ethnicity predicted class-membership; third, we assessed differences between the latent classes on emotion dysregulation, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and alcohol use.
   Participants: Participants were 288 LGB adults between 18-29 years (M = 25.35, SD = 2.76; 41.7% gay/lesbian) recruited via Amazon MTurk.
   Methods and results: The 3-step LCA identified five-latent classes: high victimization, childhood emotional abuse and neglect, cybervictimization, adult face-to-face IPV, and lower victimization. People of color (including Hispanics) were more likely to be in the high victimization class, and bisexual individuals, especially bisexual women, in the childhood emotional abuse and neglect class. High victimization and childhood emotional abuse and neglect classes had elevated emotion dysregulation levels and depression and anxiety symptoms, and the high victimization class reported the highest levels of alcohol use.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest a detrimental effect of cumulative interpersonal victimization on emotion dysregulation and the mental/behavioral health of LGB emerging adults, with bisexuals and LGB-people of color at heightened risk of cumulative victimization and of related mental/behavioral health challenges.

AB Consistently, moderate to strong correlations between emotion regulation and depressive symptomology are well documented. This relationship is most often conceptualized as unidirectional, in that poor emotion regulation acts as a pre-existing risk factor for depressive symptomatology. However, explicit examinations of the direction of this relationship have been limited, and support for a directional relation between emotion regulation and psychopathology has been inconsistent. Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data. As a replication and extension of work that has been done by others, the current study assessed Suppression and Reappraisal use and Depressive Symptoms in 1343 adolescents (Mean age = 12.9 years, SD = 0.85) who completed assessments of emotion regulation and depressive symptoms four times over two years. Results indicated that only Suppression but not Reappraisal was concurrently correlated with Depressive Symptoms. Moreover, a correlated slopes analysis showed that within-subject changes in use of Suppression, but not Reappraisal, were associated with within-subject changes in Depressive Symptoms over time. Finally, a cross-lag panel analysis showed that while Depressive Symptoms were predictive of future Suppression use, Suppression use did not predict later Depressive Symptoms. Therefore, while Suppression and Depressive Symptoms seem to be associated during adolescence, associations between reappraisal and depressive symptomology were not present in the current study. Moreover, despite previous evidence supporting emotion regulation as a risk factor for depression, suppression may be the outcome, rather than the antecedent, of depressive symptoms during adolescence.

AB Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often are faced with the challenges of difficult parenting situations. We explored the effectiveness of the Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) group parent training as an additional intervention in the treatment of ASD. Parents (n=23) went through a waiting period and participated afterwards in the training program. We assessed parenting variables via self-report measures. After the intervention, there was a significant reduction of over-reactive parenting behaviors, role restriction and an increase in parental self-efficacy. At follow-up, the effects remained stable and we additionally found a reduction of laxness and less parenting stress. Effect sizes were high (eta(2): 0.18-0.24). The SSTP, offered as an additional intervention in the treatment of ASD, proved to be effective in enhancing parenting.

AB Broader autism phenotype (BAP) characteristics (pragmatic language deficits, aloofness, and rigidity) are prevalent in families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may influence emotion-related behaviors. The current study analyzed associations among BAP characteristics with emotion-related behaviors in mothers of children with and without ASD. Twenty-seven mothers completed BAP and emotion regulation (ER) questionnaires. Maternal affect was coded during an interaction task. BAP rigidity negatively correlated with the ER strategy reappraisal. BAP total and pragmatic scores positively correlated with observed negative affect. Associations remained significant in step-wise regressions that controlled for other BAPQ subscale scores. Findings suggest that pragmatic difficulties may interfere with positive mother-child interactions and mothers with high rigidity may benefit from learning adaptive ER strategies.

AB Objective: Trauma exposure is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with youth emotional and behavioral problems. The present study adds to the current literature on trauma exposure and adolescent clinical populations by examining the association between trauma exposure and adolescent self-report of emotional and behavioral problems broadly, including internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in addition to the trauma-specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: This study included 94 female (64%) and male (36%) adolescents, ages 13-19, representing 4 clinical populations: those seeking inpatient psychiatry, outpatient psychiatry, residential substance abuse. and outpatient medical services. Adolescents self-reported trauma history and internalizing, externalizing, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Most adolescents reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event (83%; M = 2.28, SD = 1.83). Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, race/ethnicity, gender, and treatment setting indicated a greater number of types of trauma are associated with externalizing symptoms (beta = .31, p < .01) and PTSD symptoms (beta = .35, p < .01). Conclusion: Trauma is a common experience among adolescents, particularly those presenting for behavioral health services, making trauma-informed care essential in these service delivery settings. Treatment that addresses adolescent risk behaviors and prevents recurrent trauma may be particularly important given the negative impact of multiple traumatic events on developing adolescents.

AB Anxiety is a common emotional problem across development. Given that children spend approximately 50% of their waking-hours in school, it is important to consider how anxiety manifests within this setting and the unique difficulties that anxious children may experience while at school. The current paper reviews the impact of anxiety in children at the student, classroom, and district levels. Additionally, recommended treatment approaches at different developmental levels are discussed and secondary outcomes of treatments (i.e., social, emotional, and academic functioning, as well as attendance) are reviewed. Finally, recommendations for the school setting are offered at the universal, targeted, and indicated levels using a response to intervention framework.

AB Aggressive and defiant behaviors in students are costly to schools, teachers, and students. In this paper, we summarize findings from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and meta-reviews that examined school-based interventions for aggressive and defiant behaviors in students. Results of the review suggest that school-based interventions produce significant but small positive effects on aggression and defiance, with larger effects for interventions that are implemented with higher quality. Behavioral and cognitive behavioral techniques are key components of nearly all effective school interventions, whether interventions are student-directed or teacher-/environment-directed. Specific interventions with empirical support, as identified using the Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development and What Works Clearinghouse databases, are briefly summarized. Finally, recommendations are made for schools considering a school intervention for aggression and defiance, and important priorities for future research are outlined.

AB Previous research has established that the ability to manage emotions effectively is critical to healthy psychological and social development in adolescents. However, less research has considered the relationships between specific emotion regulation (ER) strategies, such as reappraisal and suppression, and social wellbeing in this age group. The current study investigated the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between 2 ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) and social outcomes (peer victimization, friendship satisfaction, and family satisfaction) in young adolescents. Analyses also controlled for mental health (anxiety and depression). Given likely gender differences in these variables, key analyses were conducted in parallel for males and females. There were 232 Australian adolescents who completed measures in Grade 7 (Age Mean = 11.97, SD = .35; 64% female) and a year later in Grade 8. Zero-order correlations indicated an inverse relationship between suppression use and social wellbeing variables, although a number of these associations were no longer significant when controlling for mental health. There was limited evidence that reappraisal was uniquely related to social outcomes. However, interaction effects suggested that greater use of reappraisal might have provided some protection against the negative social effects of poorer mental health. Poorer mental and social wellbeing also appeared to be related to ER strategy use, particularly greater suppression use. The findings suggest that ER strategy use, mental health, and social outcomes all play important and interrelated roles in adolescent wellbeing.

AB The diagnosis of cancer in a child, adolescent, or young adult is an emotionally overwhelming time. To improve the quality of education and support provided to patients and caregivers with a new cancer diagnosis, we executed a quality improvement initiative to (a) define key education milestones for the delivery of essential education during the first 2 months following diagnosis and (b) to define role accountability within the multidisciplinary team for delivery of content and execution of tasks. To develop education milestones, we (a) identified educational content from review of the literature, (b) determined the sequence of content delivery through qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers, and (c) developed education milestones by evaluation of existing workflows. To develop task lists, we (a) determined which multidisciplinary team member was best suited to deliver specific content and (b) defined discrete tasks required to execute education milestones. Key content topics and preferred sequence are as follows: Emotional Adjustment to Diagnosis, When and How to Call the Doctor, Medication Management, Practical Needs, Line Care, and Access to Nontherapeutic Clinical Trials. Eight education milestones were defined across the initial 2 months following cancer diagnosis. The education milestones are paired with task lists. The education milestones and task lists guide the execution of complex education across a multidisciplinary service line in an emotionally challenging time. Early information focuses on essential content, role responsibility is clearly defined, and psychosocial support services are purposefully and iteratively integrated into care during the initial weeks following a cancer diagnosis.

AB Deficits in a range of skill domains (including executive functioning, emotion regulation, social cognition and language/communication) are associated with disrupted youth behavior and functioning across mental health diagnoses. The identification of skill deficits are important for effective treatment planning, particularly for personalized interventions. While there are multiple ways to assess these skills, parent/caregiver reports represent an important information source. To date, no single, brief measure has been developed that gathers parent/caregiver ratings across this range of constructs. We have developed a short caregiver-report questionnaire (the Thinking Skills Inventory; TSI), to screen for skill deficits. Here, we examine the reliability and validity of this rating scale in 384 youth who were consecutively referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation. A primary caregiver completed the TSI as well as other established measures. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support five subscales on the TSI: Attention and Working Memory, Language and Communication, Emotion Regulation, Cognitive Flexibility, and Social Thinking Skills. The subscales showed moderate to high internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas range from 0.84 to 0.91). Correlations with established caregiver-report measures confirm their convergent and discriminant validity, and associations with multiple clinical diagnoses and cross-diagnostic aggressive behavior further support the utility of the scale for our intended purpose. In sum, this free, brief measure is a valid and reliable way to identify variation in skill domains relevant to a range of psychopathology. The TSI may be useful in youth mental health settings to assist with treatment planning and to inform referral for further evaluation.

AB This study examined individual and interactive effects of child negativity and parental affective behaviors when children were 4 years of age on externalizing issues exhibited by children at 5 years of age using a subsample of children with developmental delays drawn from a nationally representative data set (N = 450). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to address research questions. Results indicated that negativity displayed by parents when children were 4 years of age was associated with more externalizing issues when children reached age 5. Interactions between parent and child affective behaviors did not significantly explain additional variance in the model, though there was a trend in which parent and child negativity interacted to predict children's 5-year externalizing issues. Findings suggest interventions targeting emotional regulation in preschool-age children with developmental delays should target child and parent affective expression, and equip parents with skills to manage negative emotion.

AB Depressive adolescents are a challenging and vulnerable group in schools. Specific developmental features such as irritability and comorbid behavioural disorders complicate the recognition of their emotional problems for peers, teachers and even parents. Our research shows that teachers tend to overlook depressive feelings in adolescents; however, even peers are not able to recognize depressive feelings appropriately. Emotional problems can result in underachievement, the inability to learn and problems building satisfactory interpersonal relationships. Our review of research findings detects a complex interplay between social dynamics of exclusion and depression. Educational intervention and prevention efforts with respect to evidence-based social-emotional learning (SEL) programmes are summarized. It can be concluded that the implementation of systematic SEL concepts in schools has the potential to recognize depression-related problems early, to prevent exclusion and to reduce the burden of depressive disorders.

AB ObjectivesThe ability to regulate emotions has been linked to a variety of adolescent health-risk behaviors, including sexual risk behaviors, especially for adolescents who are experiencing mental health symptoms. However, there is limited information available on intuitive emotion regulation strategies for early adolescents with mental health symptoms to facilitate the adaptation of emotion regulation interventions for psychopathology to health-risk behavior prevention. For example, interventions to prevent sexual risk behaviors in early adolescence have yet to specifically target emotion regulation.MethodsThis paper describes the use of focus groups to identify emotion regulation strategies that were understood by and acceptable to early adolescents with mental health symptoms who are also more likely to engage in risky health behaviors. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups (k=5 groups) with 15 early adolescents with mental health symptoms.ResultsThe most commonly generated emotion regulation strategies were leaving the situation, distraction, physical release, expressing oneself to someone, positive thinking, and considering other options.ConclusionsEarly adolescents with mental health symptoms identified multiple acceptable and developmentally appropriate emotion regulation strategies. Translation of these findings for use in preventive health-risk behavior interventions (including for sexual risk) is discussed.

AB ObjectivesEmotion regulation is thought to be an important transdiagnostic process across internalizing disorders in youth, and the regulation of emotions is believed to play a central role in both adaptive and maladaptive development. Several preventive interventions focus on improving children's emotion regulation skills, but research regarding the outcomes of emotion regulation skills are scarce.MethodsWe therefore investigated whether a new transdiagnostic indicated prevention intervention for anxiety and depressive symptoms, the EMOTION program, improves emotion regulation skills as reported by parents of children aged 8-12 years. Data from a large national cluster randomized control trial (RCT) study, Coping Kids, performed in Norway were used, including data from 601 children and their parents.ResultsUsing mixed models, we found a decrease in dysregulation of emotions (=.06, CI=(0.00 to .11), p=.040) and an increase in emotion regulation (=.11, CI=(0.05 to .17) p<.001) in the intervention group compared to the control group.ConclusionsThe EMOTION intervention has a potential positive effect on children's emotional regulation skills. One opportunity in transdiagnostic interventions lies in targeting common underlying processes in internalizing disorders and thereby reaching a larger proportion of the youth population than is possible with single-disorder approaches.

In this study, we examined (1) the association between indulgent parenting in childhood and adolescence and helicopter parenting in emerging adulthood, (2) the association between indulgent parenting and parents' parenting stress and negative well-being, and (3) whether helicopter parenting mediated the association between indulgent parenting and emerging adults' psychological problems.MethodsThe sample was composed of 449 college students with a subsample of 142 parent-student dyads.ResultsResults from analyses on parents (Part I, N=142) and emerging adults (Part II, N=449) suggested that (1) indulgent parenting in childhood and adolescence was associated with helicopter parenting in emerging adulthood (b=.69, p<.01 in Part I; b=.58, p<.01 in Part II), (2) there was a positive association between indulgent parenting and parents' negative well-being (b=.26, p<.01 in Part I) and parenting stress (b=.29, p<.01 in Part I), and (3) helicopter parenting mediated the association between indulgent parenting and emerging adults' depressive and anxiety symptoms and emotional dysregulation (.15, 95% CI .03 to .43 in Part II).ConclusionsImplications for parenting and emerging adult health programs were discussed.

AB Objectives
   Since two decades scientific research is studying excessive and dysfunctional new technologies use and its influences on people's lives, in terms of personal, relational, scholastic and work functioning impairment. The objectives of the present study are to investigate gender differences in problematic new technologies use as well as to examine the relationship between problematic new technologies use, emotional regulation and its specific dimensions.
   Methods
   280 italian adolescents (51.1% males) aged 11 to 18 years (mean age = 13.31; SD = 2.33) were recruited from two italian secondary public schools and involved in this study. Data were collected using the Internet Addiction Test, the Video Game Dependency Scale, the Brief Multicultural Version of the Test of Mobile-Phone Dependence and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.
   Results
   Results indicate significant association between emotion dysregulation and problematic internet (r = .504; p < .001), videogame (r = .372; p < .001), mobile-phone (r = .424; p < .001) use. These results support hypothesis that adolescents with greater emotion dysregulation are more likely to experience problematic new technologies use. Additionally, stepwise multiple regression analysis pointed out that the lack of effective emotion regulation strategies is a common risk factors between the problematic new technologies use, but regression analysis highlighted specific risk factors for some of the investigated dependent behaviors.
   Conclusions
   Findings of this study highlight a link between problematic new technologies use, emotion dysregulation and its specific dimensions. The results are discussed considering scientific advances and the role of emotional dysregulation in determining problematic new technologies use in adolescence. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our data.

AB Background: At least 50% of students on the autism spectrum experience clinical or subclinical levels of anxiety but there is scant research on how teachers respond to anxiety in children on the spectrum.
   Aims: To compare teacher responses to anxiety-related behaviour in students who do and do not have a diagnosis on the spectrum using the Teacher Responses to Anxiety in Children (TRAC).
   Methods and procedures: Teachers (N = 64), predominantly from mainstream primary schools, completed an online survey comprised of a demographic questionnaire and two versions of the TRAC, one for students without autism and one for students with autism.
   Outcomes and results: Teachers report differences in the way they would likely respond to anxiety-related behaviours observed in students with and without autism. Teachers reported being more likely to use anxiety-promoting responses for students with autism who are showing behaviours indicative of general and separation anxiety, but not when they are showing behaviours indicative of social anxiety. Whilst there was no significant difference in the overall likelihood of use of autonomy-promoting responses between groups, there were differences in the likelihood of using specific autonomy-promoting responses dependent upon diagnosis and type of anxiety.
   Conclusions and implications: Teachers report they are likely to respond differently to anxiety-related behaviours of students on the autism spectrum but the impact of this on the behaviour of these students is yet to be determined. Professional development is a priority to increase teacher knowledge about anxiety-related behaviours in students with autism and the ways in which teachers' responses may promote or reduce anxiety and autonomy.

AB The aim of the study is to examine the relationships between early adolescents' low effortful control, middle adolescents' internalizing problems and late adolescents' Internet abuse, focusing on the mediating role that middle adolescents' internalizing problems may play in the relationship between early adolescents' low effortful control and late adolescents' Internet abuse. The study followed a sample of 482 adolescents (245 boys and 237 girls) from early adolescence (wave 1; mean age = 14.76, SD = 0.63), through middle adolescence (wave 2; mean age = 15.77, SD = 0.61), to late adolescence (wave 3; mean age = 17.88, SD = 0.57). The participants completed self-report questionnaires on temperament in wave 1 and on internalizing problems and Internet abuse in all three waves. Data from the mediation model showed that internalizing problems in middle adolescence mediated the relationship between low effortful control in early adolescence and Internet abuse in late adolescence.

AB Psychopathy has been historically associated with a lack of emotion. However, some authors argue that psychopathy may represent a tendency to externalize the experience of unpleasant emotions, including shame, what could be seen as an adaptive strategy within an evolutionary framework. Nevertheless, empirical research investigating this hypothesis is scarce. Using community (n = 295) and forensic (n = 300) male youth samples and a set of self-report measures, this study tested an evolutionary model involving pathways linking the impact of harsh rearing experiences (traumatic shameful experiences and warmth and safeness experiences) to psychopathic traits, as well as the indirect effects of external shame and shame coping strategies in that association. In addition, this study tested the invariance of this model across samples. Results indicated that the impact of harsh rearing experiences was directly and indirectly (through external shame and shame coping strategies) linked with psychopathic traits. The model explained psychopathic traits in forensic and community samples, though differences in some of the pathways were found across groups. Findings offer support for conceptualizing psychopathic traits as an adaptive strategy to cope with the impact of harsh rearing experiences, opening new pathways to prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Objective: This study primarily focused on the relationship between comorbid attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mixed features and bipolarity in major depressive patients.
   Methods: The sample comprised 2777 patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) enrolled in a multicentre, multinational study originally designed to assess different definitions of mixed depression. Socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics were compared in patients with (ADHD+) and without (ADHD-) comorbid ADHD.
   Results: Sixty-one patients (2.2%) met criteria for ADHD. ADHD was associated with a higher number of (hypo) manic symptoms during depression. Mixed depression was more represented in ADHD+ patients than in ADHD-using both DSM-5 and experimental criteria. Differences were maintained after removing overlapping symptoms between (hypo) mania and ADHD. ADHD in MDE was also associated with a variety of clinical and course features such as onset before the age of 20, first-degree family history of (hypo) mania, past history of antidepressant-induced (hypo) manic switches, higher number of depressive and affective episodes, atypical depressive features, higher rates of bipolarity specifier, psychiatric comorbidities with eating, anxiety and borderline personality disorders.
   Limitations: The study was primarily designed to address mixed features in ADHD, with slightly reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of ADHD. Other possible diagnostic biases due to heterogeneity of participating clinicians.
   Conclusions: In a sample of major depressive patients, the comorbid diagnosis of current ADHD is associated with bipolar diathesis, mixed features, multiple psychiatric comorbidity and a more unstable course. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the possible mediating role of temperamental mood instability and emotional dysregulation in such a complex clinical presentation.

AB Negative mood regulation expectancies (NMRE) represent people's beliefs that they can use behaviors and cognitions to alleviate unpleasant emotional states. The relationship between NMRE and measures of affect, coping, depression, and anxiety with youth in Grades 4 through 8 (N = 539) was examined. In hierarchical regressions, scores on an NMRE scale predicted depression, but not anxiety, independent of positive affect, negative affect, adaptive coping, and avoidant coping. Results were consistent with those found with college students and adults, suggesting the NMRE construct can add to our understanding of how youth deal with negative moods. Assessing NMRE in youth may help identify those at risk for developing affective symptoms, and provide a useful index of progress in therapeutic interventions.

AB Emotional intelligence (EI) is associated, both theoretically and empirically, with the ability to manage and regulate one's own emotions. Most evidence in this venue, however, comes from self-report measures. We tested the hypothesis that EI will associate with effective performance in an emotional regulation task in which participants were asked to self-induce emotional arousal and then to relax (modulation). One hundred twenty-seven young adults performed the task while we monitored their heart rate as an indicator of emotional responsiveness, and blood pressure as an indicator of long-term emotion regulation. They took tests of trait EI, ability EI, and trait anxiety. Structural equation modeling path analysis showed that ability EI, trait anxiety, and gender were associated with a factorial score of heart-rate variability, representing emotional regulation (arousal and modulation) indicators. The associations suggested that people with higher ability-EI scores more effectively regulated their emotional responses when asked to do so. The results also showed negative associations between ability EI and baseline blood pressure indicators. Results are discussed in light of theory and existing evidence on the link between EI and emotional regulation.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine a mindfulness model of resilience through the mediating effects of self compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation among underprivileged Turkish adolescents. The sample of the study consisted of 752 students (426 female, 326 male) who aged 14-19 (M = 15.82, SD = 0.88). A path analysis was conducted in order to examine the proposed model. The results showed mindfulness to be a positive and significant predictor of self-compassion while negatively and significantly predicting difficulties in emotion regulation. Furthermore, self-compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation were found to be significant predictors of resilience. Indirect paths from mindfulness to resilience (via self-compassion and via difficulties in emotion regulation) were also significant in the model. The hypothesized model explained 21% of the variance in resilience scores.

This multi-method longitudinal study (N = 153) utilized a path analysis to delineate links between emotion regulation (age 15), emotional eating and dietary restraint (age 16), and adiposity (% body fat) using a BodPod for body composition assessment (age 19). Emotion regulation was negatively associated with emotional eating (beta = -0.30, p < 0.001) and positively associated with dietary restraint (beta = 0.15, p < 0.05) at age 16, but was not associated with age 19 adiposity (beta = -0.01, p = ns). Emotional eating was positively associated with adiposity (beta = 0.24, p < 0.01). Indirect effects suggested that emotional eating, but not dietary restraint, at age 16 serves as a mechanism that helps explain the associations between emotion regulation and adiposity four years later. Results from this study suggest that both emotion regulation and emotional eating represent promising targets for that should be included in future interventions aimed at preventing adolescent obesity.

AB BackgroundDepression in HIV/AIDS children not only worsens the progression and outcome of illness, but also impacts their quality of life, having a negative influence on society. The present study was conducted from a psychosocial perspective, considering children's social desirability, cognitive emotion regulation, and perceived social support to identify the factors influencing depression in HIV-infected children in China.MethodsParticipants were 155 children aged 8-18years who were eligible to participate in this study assessing depression and associated risk factors using the Children's Depression Inventory, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and Children's Social Desirability scale. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to model the effects of social desirability, perceived social support, and cognitive emotion regulation on depression in HIV/AIDS children.ResultsStatistically significant linear relationships were found among social desirability, perceived social support, partial dimensions of cognitive emotion regulation, and children's depression scores. Perceived social support, planning and positive reappraisal were negatively related to the depression. Conversely, social desirability, catastrophizing and other-blame were positively associated with the depression. Linear regression analysis indicated that children's social desirability, perceived social support, and one dimension of cognitive emotion regulation (catastrophizing) were found to significantly predict depression.ConclusionsPsychosocial factors have an important influence on the depression experienced by HIV-infected children. Interventions from personal subjective psychosocial to reduce depression in HIV-infected children in China are warranted.

AB Despite many studies documenting the prevalence of various co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in children and adults with ASD, less is known about how these symptoms relate to subtypes defined by particular phenotypic features within the ASD population. We examined the severity and prevalence of comorbid symptoms of psychopathology, emotion dysregulation, and maladaptive behaviors, as well as adaptive functioning, in a group of 65 minimally verbal children (n = 33) and adolescents (n =32) with ASD. On the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5), for all the symptom classifications except oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, more participants in our sample showed elevated or clinically concerning severity scores relative to the general population. On the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI), the mean scores for Reactivity and Dysphoria factors in our sample were lower than in the autism calibration sample, which included a large number of inpatient youth with ASD. Overall, few differences were found between the children and adolescents within this severely impaired group of ASD individuals based on clinical cutoff scores on the CASI-5 and EDI factor scores. Psychiatric comorbidities and emotion dysregulation measures were not correlated with autism symptom severity or with measures of adaptive functioning, and were largely unrelated to IQ in our sample. The number of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms on the CASI-5 emerged as the main predictor of maladaptive behaviors. Findings suggest a wide range of co-occurring psychopathology and high degree of maladaptive behavior among minimally verbal children and adolescents with ASD, which are not directly attributable to autism symptom severity, intellectual disability or limitations in adaptive functioning.

AB Previous studies have suggested that major depressive disorder was associated with topological properties of impaired white matter. However, most related studies only use one property of nerve fibers to construct whole-brain structural brain network. Considering white matter changes variously, We hypothesized whether the alternations of white matter topological properties could reflect different impairment of white matter integrity. In addition, it is still unknown whether impaired integrity of the white matter fiber tracts has relationship with abnormal topological properties in MDD. This study investigated the impaired white matter by using graph theoretic analyses in a cohort of 37 MDD patients and 38 matched control subjects. In addition, we further investigated fiber tracts differences in three interregional connectivity matrixes of significant different topological regions in MDD. Our graph theoretic analyses demonstrated that 7 different regions were observed for the local measures in patients with MDD compared with control groups. These regions were the central nodes of cortical-limbic network, frontal-cingulate network, default mode network (DMN), cognitive control network (CCN)and affective network (AN). In addition, two impaired white matter pathways which included inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and cingulum were observed in MDD using fiber tracts analysis. We speculate impaired integrity of ILF is due to the alternations in the number of axons or myelination. The results further demonstrated that the number of fiber tracts of anterior cingulum was associated with the depression scores in MDD.

AB Background: Drug abuse is one of the most prevalent public health problems around the world and Iran too. Drug abuse is influenced by various psychosocial factors. This study aimed to explain the relationship model of drug abuse based on perceived criticism, mindfulness, and emotion regulation in Isfahan male adolescents. Methods: This was a correlational cross-sectional study. A total of 350 male students were randomly selected from different high schools in Isfahan during the period of 2015-2016 academic year. Four questionnaires including the probability of drug abuse questionnaire, emotion regulation inventory, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and perceived criticism scale were employed. Data were analyzed using Chi-square and correlation coefficient, besides; Structural equation modeling was used to model the direct and indirect relationships between variables. In this regard, SPSS and AMOS softwares were used. Results: Out of the whole subjects, 49.7% had score above the median, indicating more likely to be drug abuser. There was a significant correlation between emotional reappraisal (r = 0.40), expressive suppression (r = 0.38), mindfulness (0.57), and criticism (r = 0.57) with drug abuse among male adolescents (P < 0.001). Moreover, criticism through the emotional self-regulation had indirect effects on drug abuse. Totally 69% of the variance in drug abuse was explained by the study variables. Conclusions: In total, the results of this study revealed that high levels of drug abuse among students can be considered as a crucial issue, regarding the significant effects of psychological factors, adaptive emotion-regulation strategies, as well as school and family-based Psycho-social skills, are recommended.

AB BACKGROUND: Studies of white matter connectivity in children with disruptive behavior have yielded inconsistent results, possibly owing to the trait's heterogeneity, which comprises diverse symptoms like physical aggression, irritability, and delinquency. This study examined associations of global and specific white matter connectivity with childhood disruptive behavior problems, while accounting for their complex multidimensionality.
   METHODS: In a large cross-sectional population-based study of 10-year-old preadolescents (n = 2567), we assessed four previously described empirically derived dimensions of disruptive behavior problems using the Child Behavior Checklist: physical aggression, irritability, disobedient behavior, and delinquent behavior. Global and specific white matter microstructure was assessed by diffusion tensor imaging.
   RESULTS: Global fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were not associated with broad measures of disruptive behavior, e.g., Child Behavior Checklist externalizing problems scale. Global fractional anisotropy was negatively associated with delinquent behavior (beta = -.123, p(false discovery rate adjusted) = .028) and global mean diffusivity was positively associated with delinquent behavior (beta = .205, p(false discovery rate adjusted) < 0.001), suggesting reduced white matter microstructure in preadolescents with higher levels of delinquent behavior. Lower white matter microstructure in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, and uncinate underlie these associations. Global white matter microstructure was not associated with physical aggression, irritability, or disobedient behavior.
   CONCLUSIONS: Delinquent behavior, a severe manifestation of childhood disruptive behavior, was associated with lower white matter microstructure in tracts connecting frontal and temporal lobes. These brain regions are involved in decision making, reward processing, and emotion regulation. This study demonstrated that incorporating the multidimensional nature of childhood disruptive behavior traits shows promise in advancing the search for elucidating neurobiological correlates of disruptive behavior.

AB The present study tested a theoretical model of emotion regulation between parent-offspring dynamics and emerging adults' adjustment. The mediating role of emotion regulation strategies, including cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, were investigated for the effects of mother-offspring and father-offspring dynamics on emerging adults' adjustment. A sample of 352 Chinese emerging adults in Hong Kong (230 female, 121 male) participated in this study. Participants were asked to complete a set of self-reported questionnaires. Findings based on structural equation modeling indicated that greater mother-offspring intimacy and father-offspring intimacy predicted emerging adults' better cognitive reappraisal and psychological, social, and general health. Greater mother-offspring conflict also predicted more expressive suppression and poorer psychological and social functioning. Distinctive mediation pathways as a function of parents' gender were identified. These findings enrich the literature for parent-offspring dynamics and emotion regulation as explanatory processes of emerging adults' adjustment.

AB To investigate the universality and cultural specificity of emotion processing in children from three different ethnic groups (Han, Jingpo, and Dai), we administered three questionnaires, including the emotional contagion scale, emotion regulation scale, and the Chinese mood adjective check list, to 1,362 ethnic Han, Dai, and Jingpo participants (M-age = 13.78 years). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. The results revealed that emotion regulation mediated the relation between emotional contagion and mood state: positive emotional contagion increased positive mood state and decreased negative mood state by the mediated role of reappraisal, negative emotional contagion decreased positive contagion and increased negative mood state by the inconsistent mediated role of reappraisal; negative contagion increased negative mood state by the mediated role of suppression. We found both universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. Regarding cultural specificity, among Dai and Jingpo participants, negative contagion positively predicted reappraisal, while for Han participants, it did not; Jingpo participants demonstrated a weaker negative relation between reappraisal and negative mood state, and a stronger positive relation between negative contagion and suppression; and Dai participants were the only ethnic group that showed a negative connection between negative contagion and positive mood state. Regarding emotion universality, the three ethnic groups all showed positive relations between negative contagion and negative mood, and between suppression and negative mood; additionally, positive contagion positively predicted positive mood state, mediated by reappraisal. Thus, some emotion processes are universal and others more specific. In this paper, we discuss universal emotion processes and ethnic cultural differences in these emotion processes.

AB Emotion regulation is a critical mechanism in the socio-emotional development of children. Previous studies revealed that children use cognitive reappraisal to downregulate negative emotions. Moreover, the amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) shows a more obvious reduction following neutral interpretations than following negative interpretations. However, whether children can use cognitive reappraisal to regulate positive emotions remains unclear. In the present study, 46 8- to 12-year-old children were asked to reappraise the meaning of pleasant pictures. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected during the task. As predicted, LPP amplitudes increased more following reappraisal condition than following pleasant condition. The analysis of spatial-temporal shifting patterns showed that the effect occurred in the earlier window for the posterior region. As time progressed, this effect evidenced a trend from posterior region to the central and anterior regions, especially for the younger children. Furthermore, the greater brain activations occurred in left hemisphere when children upregulated positive emotions which partially supported previous research suggesting that increasing positive emotion engaged primarily left -lateralized prefrontal regions. Taken together, the findings suggest that children can use cognitive reappraisal to upregulate positive emotions.

AB BackgroundChildren born to parents with a severe mental illness, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major recurrent depression, have an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves during life. These children are also more likely to have developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, or social problems, and they may have a higher risk than the background population of experiencing adverse life events. This is due to both genetic and environmental factors, but despite the well-documented increased risk for children with a familial high risk, no family-based early intervention has been developed for them. This study aims to investigate the effect of an early intervention that focuses on reducing risk and increasing resilience for children in families where at least one parent has a severe mental illness.Methods/designThe study is a randomized clinical trial with 100 children aged 6-12 with familial high risk. It is performed in the context of the Danish health-care system. Families will be recruited from registers or be referred from the primary sector or hospitals. The children and their parents will be assessed at baseline and thereafter randomized and allocated to either treatment as usual or VIA Family. The intervention group will be assigned to a multidisciplinary team of specialists from adult mental health services, child and adolescent mental health services, and social services. This team will provide the basic treatment elements: case management, psychoeducation for the whole family, parental training, a safety plan, and potentially an early intervention if the child has mental problems. The study period is 18 months for both groups, and all participants will be assessed at baseline and after 18 months. The primary outcome measure will be daily functioning of the child, and the secondary measures are the psychopathology of the child, days of absence from school, family functioning, child's home environment, and parental stress.DiscussionThis study is to our knowledge the first to explore the effects of a multidisciplinary team intervention that provides an intensive and flexible support to match the families' needs for children with a familial high risk for severe mental illness. The study will provide important knowledge about the potential for increasing resilience and reducing risk for children by supporting the whole family. However, a longer follow-up period may be needed.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03497663. Registered on 13 April 2018.

AB A program evaluation examined mental health literacy levels and coping outcomes for youth (ages 10-16), before and at the end of their participation in a manualized, school-based mental health literacy program called Youth Education and Support (YES). Most of the youth reportedly had a parent or other family member with a mental health disorder such as depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse. The mental health literacy levels of program participants from pre to post were evaluated with the developing Knowledge of Mental Illness and Recovery (K-MIR) scale. This scale was validated using item-response theory, demonstrating good psychometric properties. Youth answered two coping questions about their use of positive coping during the program and coping skills compared from pre to post intervention. Findings revealed that youth levels of mental health literacy increased significantly from pre to post program participation. Over 90% of the youth reported an improved use of positive coping strategies from pre to post intervention. The program appeared to deliver enhanced levels of literacy and coping for this sample of youth. The scale appeared to be appropriate to measure youth mental health literacy. Recommendations for practice, policy, and research are offered.

AB Impaired sleep, short sleep duration and sleep disorders appears also in early life. The most frequent sleep disorders are insomnia and nightmares. Risk of chronification is high and daytime impairments are extensively from emotion regulation problems, impaired performance, and aggression up to suicidality. Therefore, early diagnostic and treatment is necessary. As symptoms vary according to age, treatment should be strictly age-dependent. Various guideline-oriented and age-dependent treatments will be presented. Beyond, parents often have daytime impairments due to the child's sleep problem and therefore report an improvement of their own sleep after treatment. However, more studies are necessary and randomized controlled and age-oriented studies are necessary with inclusion of comorbid disorders or address sleep disorders in the context of mental disorders. In addition, efficacy of sleep treatment in mental disorders should be studied.

AB Research supports cascading relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and academic problems. This constellation of problems is characteristic of early-onset, persistent delinquent [EOPD] youth, and appropriately targeted interventions accounting for this comorbidity may improve outcomes. To investigate these relationships in EOPD youth, we characterized their cross-diagnostic psychopathology and verbal (word-list) learning/memory and evaluated: 1) verbal learning/memory profiles of Withdrawn/Depressed relative to Non-Withdrawn/Depressed youth; 2) cognitive and psychiatric predictors of verbal learning; and 3) emotion regulation as a mediator of psychiatric and cognitive relationships. Results indicated Withdrawn/Depressed youth recalled significantly fewer words during immediate, and some delayed, recall conditions. Less word-learning was predicted by: Withdrawn/Depressed classification, higher trauma-specific re-experiencing symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, weaker executive skills, fewer trauma-avoidance and aggressive symptoms, and earlier alcohol-use onset. Emotion regulation strongly mediated the relationship between verbal learning and psychopathology, but not other cognitive skills, among these youth at high-risk for school dropout. Mental health and education implications are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Studies have shown the adverse impact of exposure to community violence on adolescent health. However, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. This study aimed at assessing the community violence exposure and the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents in Ambon, a post-conflict area in Indonesia.
   Material and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based study involving 511 of 10th-graders from six randomly selected high schools in Kotamadya Ambon. Our participants were assessed using a set of questionnaires including the Strength Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure mental health problems, and the child version of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (KID-SAVE) to measure community violence exposure. The hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the determinants of mental health problems.
   Results: In this study, boys reported more exposure to community violence (both in frequency and severity) than girls. Meanwhile, the girls reported higher emotional problems than boys. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the total sample and among boys, the community violence exposure was associated with mental health problems. However, it was the perceived impact of community violence exposure which showed an association with mental health problems among girls.
   Conclusions: This study revealed the high community violence exposure among adolescents living in a post-conflict setting in Indonesia. The study also found gender differences in the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents who were exposed to CVE.

AB Introduction: Experiencing relational victimization (e.g., peer exclusion, untrue rumors) during adolescence can have negative social-emotional consequences, including increased antisocial behavior and substance use. The negative impact of relational victimization may be lessened by spending time with supportive, prosocial peers.
   Methods: This study examined the concurrent and predictive associations between relational victimization and peer affiliates' prosocial behaviors in 244 predominately African American adolescents (ages 13-14) living in U.S. urban neighborhoods. Questionnaires were collected every six months for two years. Overt victimization was controlled for in the analysis and the moderation of gender and antisocial behaviors were tested.
   Results: Peer affiliates' prosocial behavior was stable across the two years. Relational victimization was not associated with peers' prosocial behavior at baseline or across time. Gender did not moderate the association between relational victimization and peers' prosocial behavior. Moderating effects were found for antisocial behavior; relational victimization was positively associated with peer affiliates' prosocial behavior but only for adolescents who were low on antisocial behavior at baseline.
   Conclusions: For African American youth, efforts to reduce relational aggression and increase peer support in prosocial activities prior to adolescence may be useful for preventing social-emotional problems.

AB Differences and similarities were studied in the functions of two different self-injurious behaviors (SIB): nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and sex as self-injury (SASI). Based on type of SIB reported, adolescents were classified in one of three groups: NSSI only (n=910), SASI only (n=41), and both NSSI and SASI (n=76). There was support for functional equivalence in the two forms of SIB, with automatic functions being most commonly endorsed in all three groups. There were also functional differences, with adolescents in the SASI only group reporting more social influence functions than those with NSSI only. Adolescents reporting both NSSI and SASI endorsed the highest number of functions for both behaviors. Clinical implications are discussed, emphasizing the need for emotion regulation skills.

AB This study compared social, executive, emotional, and behavioral characteristics of students with autism spectrum disorder who did and did not display school refusal behavior. The participants were 62 students with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability aged 9-16 years attending inclusive schools. Parents first completed questionnaires assessing social and executive functioning as well as emotional and behavioral problems. They then documented their child's school refusal behavior for a period of 20 days. Compared to students without school refusal behavior (n = 29), students with school refusal behavior (n = 33) were significantly less socially motivated; displayed more deficits in initiating tasks or activities, in generating ideas, responses, or problem-solving strategies; and displayed more withdrawn and depressive symptoms. Assessing social and executive functioning, as well as emotional problems, may help professionals provide tailored interventions for students with autism spectrum disorder and school refusal behavior, which will further be valuable in recognizing characteristics associated with school refusal behavior.

AB This study aims to test whether adolescent negative social interactions mediate the relation between early adolescent self-regulatory capacities and young adult psychopathology, using a fully prospective mediation model. Data were derived from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a large population cohort of Dutch adolescents (n = 962). At age 11, three indicators of self-regulation were assessed: low frustration, high effortful control, and high response inhibition. Negative social interactions between ages 11 and 22 were captured twice using the Event History Calendar. Psychopathology (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems) was assessed at ages 11 and 22. Findings indicate that adolescents' frustration and effortful control but not response inhibition assessed at age 11 are related to both internalizing and externalizing problems at age 22, after controlling for psychopathology at age 11, sex, and socioeconomic status. These associations were partly (about 22%) mediated by the negative social interactions adolescents experienced. Effect sizes were all modest. This study shows that self-regulation is related to subsequent psychopathology in part through its effect on negative social interactions, providing evidence for sequences of self-regulatory capacities, life experiences, and developmental outcomes.

AB Background: Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) has been linked to child/adolescent behavior problems and substance use in several longitudinal cohort studies. It is unclear whether these effects extend into adulthood and influence young adult behavior problems and substance use and, if so, whether they are mediated by childhood and adolescent experiences.
   Methods: These data are from an ongoing longitudinal study of individuals born to women who were recruited early in pregnancy. Trimester-specific data on prenatal drug exposure were obtained. Caregivers and offspring were assessed at delivery and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, and 21 years postpartum. This report is from age 21, when 225 offspring (52% females; 54% African American, 46% Caucasian) reported on behavior problems, emotion regulation, and substance use.
   Results: There were significant direct associations between PCE and early initiation of marijuana, 21-year emotion regulation problems, arrest history, and Conduct Disorder. The relation between PCE and young adult internalizing behavior was mediated by adolescent mood symptoms. The association between PCE and 21-year marijuana use was mediated by early initiation of marijuana use.
   Conclusions: PCE has both direct and indirect long-term associations with young adult development. Using statistical models that considered the complex interrelationships among PCE and adult outcomes, we demonstrated that the direct effects of PCE on young adult emotion regulation problems, arrest history, and Conduct Disorder are not completely explained by earlier adolescent behavior. Moreover, the analyses suggesting mediated pathways from PCE to young adult problems identify crucial variables to target interventions for exposed children and adolescents.

AB Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities (DD) often struggle with behavior management and emotion-regulation (ER). In this manuscript, we describe the results of a chart review examining a group treatment program designed to address ER deficits in youth with ASD and/or DD. The intensive 5week program utilizes cognitive behavior, applied behavior analysis, and mindfulness techniques and includes biweekly child and parent groups. Results indicate that this program is feasible and associated with high caregiver satisfaction. Pre-and-post outcome results indicate statistically significant improvement on behavioral measures, but did not demonstrate significant improvment on the Pediatric Quality of Life Family Impact Module. Based on overall positive outcomes, a randomized controlled trial of the program is indicated.

AB Black youth account for the largest number of new HIV infections among heterosexual youth. Mental illness and difficulties in emotion regulation contribute to increased reports of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk-related sexual behaviors in this group. Yet limited interventions exist to address this affective component of the sexual decision-making process. The purpose of this paper was to describe the trial design, research challenges, and baseline characteristics from a study designed to fill this gap. Project GOLD was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a psychoeducational HIV/STI prevention intervention designed to address the role of mental illness and emotion regulation in HIV/STI risk among heterosexually-active Black youth aged 14 to 17 (N = 108). Challenges encountered in the research process warrant further attention in future research (e.g., disagreement among the regulatory bodies on parental permission requirements). The most common mental health diagnoses were Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (15.7%) and current substance abuse (7.4%). Participants reported higher levels of emotional suppression, and adaptive methods of emotion management, than culturally inappropriate expressions of anger or sadness. They also reported a mean age of 13.6 at first vaginal sex, used condoms 66% of the time for vaginal sex, and had an average of three sexual partners in the past 6 months. More than one-quarter (26.9%) had sex with more than one person in the same day. These findings indicate intervention is crucial for this population. The forthcoming trial evaluation will indicate the promise of such interventions in reducing HIV/STI infections in this key population.

AB BackgroundAccumulating evidence indicates that Latino children and adolescents are at risk for higher anxiety relative to youth of other ethnicities. However, to date, very little research has been conducted to examine culture specific mechanisms of anxiety in Latino youth.ObjectiveThis study explored whether strict adherence to Latino cultural values emphasizing maintenance of group harmony, familismo and simpatia, in combination with poor awareness and identification of negative emotions predicts increased anxiety among Latino youth.MethodFamilismo, simpatia, poor emotion awareness, and anxiety were measured in a mixed clinically anxious (n=27) and non-clinical (n=20) sample of 7-13year-old Latino children. Anxiety was measured through self-report and mother report.ResultsTwo way interactions between familismo and simpatia, and between poor emotion awareness and simpatia predicted anxiety level. Graphs of the interactions indicated that the combination of high levels of each variable was associated with the highest levels of child-reported anxiety, while high familismo in the context of low simpatia was associated with low anxiety levels per child and parent report. In contrast, low simpatia in the context of poor emotion awareness was associated with low mother-reported child anxiety.ConclusionsStrict adherence to cultural values emphasizing family cohesion and positive interdependent social experiences in combination with poor emotion awareness are linked to anxiety in Latino youth.

AB BackgroundShame has been found to relate to several psychopathologies, but the way the individual copes with experiences of shame may determine specific expressions of psychopathology, making it essential to rigorously address such coping styles.ObjectiveThis study evaluated the psychometric properties of a Portuguese version of the Compass of Shame Scale using an adolescent sample, to investigate if its internal structure was valid for diverse adolescent subsamples, and to gather evidence on the construct validity of the instrument.MethodAdolescent community boys and girls (n=1924; 52.3% boys) and adolescent boys with a history of behavior problems taken from foster care and juvenile detention facilities (n = 396) filled in self-report questionnaires on coping with shame and other relevant constructs.ResultsA five-factor model was applicable to exploring the coping with shame of adolescent community boys and girls and adolescent boys with behavior problems. Girls, in comparison with boys, more frequently internalized shame or coped with it adaptively. Boys taken from foster care and juvenile detention facilities, compared with community boys, more often externalized shame by attacking others and less frequently attacked themselves, avoided shame experiences or coped with it adaptively. Construct validity in relation to self-criticism, external shame, and experiential avoidance was found.ConclusionsThe measure demonstrated reliability and validity estimates consistent with expectations across diverse samples of adolescents. So, it may help advance knowledge on how diverse youth cope with shame and on the interchanges between experiencing shame, managing shame, and psychopathology.

AB Objective The relationship between eating disorders (EDs) and substance use (SU) has only been briefly described in literature using mainly adult populations. This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of SU among patients of an adolescent ED outpatient treatment program. Method A retrospective chart analysis was conducted to determine and subsequently compare medical status, psychosocial factors, treatment course and outcome between patients with and without SU. Results Over 60% of patients with SU status (n = 203) reported regularly consuming substances. 33.4% of substance users received a diagnosis involving purging behaviors compared to 5.9% of nonusers. Females composed 96.4% and 81.7% of users and nonusers, respectively. Users reported significantly more self-harm (57.7% of users vs. 38.6% of nonusers) but did not differ significantly in terms of trauma (abuse or victimization; 48.3% of users vs. 44.9% of nonusers). The percentage of ideal body weight significantly improved throughout treatment and did not differ by SU with a mean increase of 5.29% (SD = 13.6) among nonusers compared to 5.45% (SD = 7.5) of users. While users and nonusers did not differ before and after treatment in ED severity, users were more likely than nonusers to drop-out of treatment (41.5% of users vs. 25.2% of nonusers). Discussion Adolescents with SU benefit from ED outpatient treatment as much as those without SU, however, users are more likely to drop-out. Therefore, treatment should target these adolescents' emotional dysregulation to improve treatment compliance. Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy of such an approach.

AB Background: There is little research investigating the relationship between childhood abuse, including neglect, and suicidality in adult men, despite epidemiological data suggesting that they are most at risk for suicide.
   Objective: To investigate the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect and suicidality, and the possible mediating roles of affect dysregulation and social inhibition.
   Participants and setting: a cohort of eighty-six socio-economically deprived male Caucasian participants previously identified as suicidal, attending a non-clinical community group.
   Methods: Participants completed self-report measures on childhood trauma, emotion regulation, interpersonal difficulties and suicidal behavior.
   Results: Mediation analysis indicated that emotion dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties significantly mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality with a medium effect size (R-2 = .41, p < .001).
   Conclusions: Study results suggest that early childhood abuse and neglect results in dysfunctional emotion regulation, which leads to suicidality in the context of impoverished social environments. The provision of psychological interventions aimed at improving social and emotional functioning may help to safeguard men who are most at risk of suicide.

AB Background: To date whether the effects of parental corporal punishment (CP) on executive function (EF) distinct components are different is less clear. Moreover, theory and empirical work suggest that physiological regulation system may help to explain the individual differences in the developmental outcomes associated with parental CP.
   Objective: This study examined the effects of parental CP on Chinese preschoolers' EF and whether the cortisol stress reactivity would moderate such effects.
   Participants and Setting: One hundred and fifty-two preschool-aged children and their parents from Beijing China participated in the present study.
   Methods: Parental CP was reported by fathers and mothers respectively in the first year of the study (2015, spring), and children's EF was assessed and salivary cortisol was collected in the second year (2016, spring).
   Results: Both paternal and maternal CP were negatively correlated with children's EF one year later, and the relation between maternal, but not paternal CP and children's EF was moderated by cortisol stress reactivity. Specifically, compared to children with high cortisol stress reactivity levels, children with low cortisol stress reactivity levels who experienced maternal CP in the past year showed poorer global EF and working memory.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the critical importance of examining the interactive effects of individual physiological level and environmental-level risks on young children's self-regulation outcomes.

AB Despite emotion regulation being altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no studies have investigated its relation to multimodal amygdala connectivity. We compared corticolimbic functional and structural connectivity between OCD patients and healthy controls (HCs), and correlated this with the dispositional use of emotion regulation strategies and with OCD severity. OCD patients (n = 73) and HCs (n = 42) were assessed for suppression and reappraisal strategies using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and for OCD severity using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) connectivity maps were generated using subject-specific left amygdala (LA) and right amygdala (RA) masks. We identified between-group differences in amygdala whole-brain connectivity, and evaluated the moderating effect of ERQ strategies. Significant regions and amygdala seeds were used as targets in probabilistic tractography analysis. Patients scored higher in suppression and lower in reappraisal. We observed higher rs-fMRI RA-right postcentral gyrus (PCG) connectivity in HC, and in patients this was correlated with symptom severity. Reappraisal scores were associated with higher negative LA-left insula connectivity in HC, and suppression scores were negatively associated with LA-precuneus and angular gyri connectivity in OCD. Structurally, patients showed higher mean diffusivity in tracts connecting the amygdala with the other targets. RA-PCG connectivity is diminished in patients, while disrupted emotion regulation is related to altered amygdala connectivity with the insula and posterior brain regions. Our results are the first showing, from a multimodal perspective, the association between amygdala connectivity and specific emotional processing domains, emphasizing the importance of amygdala connectivity in OCD pathophysiology.

AB Background Mental illness is among the most common causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability in childhood. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has shown significant benefit in mental health; however, evidence of its effectiveness in youth is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of MBSR plus usual care versus usual care alone for reducing mental health symptoms in youth. Methods A two-arm, mixed methods, randomized cluster-controlled trial of 12-18 year olds who were residents of CASA House, a voluntary residential treatment program for adolescents, between January 2011 and March 2013 (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01307943). Interventions Treatment terms were randomized to usual care, or MBSR plus usual care, which included eight MBSR sessions of 2 hr/week. Outcomes The primary outcome was impact on emotions and behavior at the end of the program, using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2). Secondary outcomes included perceived stress levels, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. Results A total of 85 participants were randomized to either the MBSR arm (n = 45) or control arm (n = 40). Significant differences in favor of MBSR were found on Teacher ratings of the Internalizing Problems (p = .038) and Adaptive Skills subscales (p = .022) on the BASC-2. No significant differences were found on other outcomes. A post hoc analysis found that the MBSR arm had a significantly shorter time to discharge (p = .02). Conclusion The results of this study indicate that MBSR is effective for improved coping with internalizing problems and adaptive emotional skills in our sample. Future studies should focus on larger, longer-term studies in youth.

AB Physiological synchrony, or concordance, among caregiver-child dyads involves the matching of biological states. Understanding this process is critical for enhancing our knowledge of the ways that the caregiver-child relationship supports child development. However, the meaning of physiological synchrony for child adjustment is poorly understood. This study examined physiological synchrony in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of parasympathetic activity, between 87 mothers (M age = 35.30 years, SD = 6.71 years) and their preadolescent children (M age = 10.36 years, SD = 1. 19 years, 52.9% girls). Dyads, all of which were from economically impoverished backgrounds, participated in 3 tasks that varied in the level of interaction that was required between the partners. Mothers self-reported their own depressive symptoms and rated their children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Physiological synchrony was generally strongest in tasks requiring the greatest levels of interaction among partners. Further, RSA synchrony was positive in the context of low levels of maternal depressive and child internalizing symptoms, and negative in the context of high levels of such symptoms, though results varied by task. Child externalizing symptoms did not moderate the RSA concordance process. The results identify both proximal and distal contexts in which physiological synchrony occurs, which ultimately broadens our understanding of the meaning and significance of parent-child physiological synchrony.

TI The Role of Fathers' Versus Mothers' Parenting in Emotion-Regulation

AB This 4-year, multi-informant longitudinal study (N = 480, initial age: 15) investigated the interplay between parental support, behavioral and psychological control, and adolescents' emotion regulation development. We examined reciprocal effects between parents and children, mothers' versus fathers' unique roles in emotion regulation development, and sex differences. Multi-informant data allowed us to compare effects of adolescent-perceived and parent-reported parenting. Finally, innovative analyses allowed us to disentangle between-family differences from within-family predictive processes. Parenting and emotion regulation were associated at the between-family and within-family levels, especially according to adolescent reports. Support primarily played a role between mothers and adolescents, and perceived behavioral control between fathers and adolescents. Sex moderation revealed that support played a more prominent role in mother-daughter than mother-son relationships, and that daughters experienced greater behavioral control. Child effects outnumbered parent effects, which might reflect the increasing equality of adolescent-parent relationships. Finally, adolescent-perceived parenting was a stronger correlate of emotion regulation than parent-reports, suggesting that adolescents' perceptions are a relevant source of information for research and practice. Consistent with the self-determination theory perspective on parenting, emotion regulation flourished when adolescents felt like mothers provided support, and fathers loosened behavioral control. These results are in line with the notion that mother-child relationships are supportive attachment relationships, whereas fathers provide "activation" relationships, challenging adolescents to regulate emotions autonomously by providing less explicit structure.

AB One particular developmental task during adolescence is to regulate fluctuating moods to successfully transition through this period. The aim of this person-centered study was to identify distinct developmental trajectories of adolescent mood variability and to compare adolescents in different trajectories on changes in depressive symptoms, delinquency, and alcohol consumption in early to middle (ages 13-16) and middle to late adolescence (ages 16-20). Dutch adolescents (n = 482, 57.1% male) rated their daily emotions three weeks per year for five years using Internet daily diaries (ages 13-18). Day-to-day mood changes were calculated as an indicator of mood variability. Adolescents provided annual reports on depressive symptoms, delinquent acts, and alcohol consumption (ages 13-20). Results showed that most adolescents (88%) followed a trajectory characterized by decreases in mood variability (i.e., more stable moods). However, a minority (12%) followed a trajectory of increases in mood variability with a peak during middle adolescence. Adolescents with an increasing mood variability trajectory showed stable depressive and delinquency symptoms in early to middle adolescence compared with adolescents with a decreasing mood variability trajectory, who showed a decline in these symptoms. At age 16, there was a significant difference between the groups in depressive and delinquency symptoms, which stayed stable toward late adolescence. Although the two groups did not differ concerning alcohol consumption in early to middle adolescence, adolescents from the increasing mood variability class experienced less steep increases in alcohol use from middle to late adolescence compared with adolescents from the decreasing mood variability class.

AB Despite the high prevalence and substantial costs of early life stress (ELS), the mechanisms through which ELS confers risk for psychopathology are poorly understood, particularly among youth who are in an earlier stage of the transition through puberty. We sought to advance our understanding of the link between ELS and psychopathology by testing whether rumination mediates the relation between ELS and symptoms of psychopathology in youth in the early stages of puberty, and whether sex moderates this mediation. We assessed levels of ELS, both brooding and reflection subtypes of rumination, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 170 youth in the early stages of puberty (56% girls) ages 9-13years. Brooding, but not reflection, mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Importantly, however, sex moderated the relation among ELS, brooding, and symptoms. Specifically, brooding mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms for girls, but not for boys. Findings support the formulation that brooding is a mechanism linking ELS to multiple forms of behavioral and emotional problems exclusively in girls in the early stages of puberty.

AB Among the 90% of adolescents involved in juvenile justice who have experienced traumatic victimization, a sub-group may be at highest risk due to histories of multiple types of interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma, termed polyvictims. Latent class analyses (LCA) have identified polyvictimized subgroups in several studies of adolescents and adults, but only one study of traumatic victimization has been conducted with justice-involved youth (Ford et al. 2013). The current investigation replicates and extends that study's findings using LCA to assess a wider range of victimization- and nonvictimization-related adversities and emotion dysregulation, DSM-5 symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and behavioral health problems, such as substance use, anger, depression, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation. In a sample of juvenile detainees three latent classes were identified: mixed adversity (MA; n=327), violent environment (VE; n=337), and polyvictimization (PV; n=145). In contrast to MA youth, PV youth were more likely to report exposure to all forms of adversity, and in contrast to both MA and VE youth, exposure to maltreatment and family violence, and higher levels of emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and depression/anxiety symptoms, somatic complaints, and suicidality. VE youth (vs. MA youth) were more likely to report exposure to violence and non-interpersonal traumas, and were higher on some forms of emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, anger and substance use. Findings suggest that most justice-involved youth have experienced substantial adversity, with almost one in five identified as a polyvictim having experienced multiple adversities, including impaired caregivers, and evidencing the most severe problems in emotion dysregulation and PTSD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms.

AB Anxious youth often have trouble regulating negative affect (NA) and tend to over-rely on parents when faced with challenges. It is unclear how social interactions with parents or peers actually helps or hinders anxious youths' success in regulating NA. The aim of this study was to examine whether the success of anxious youths' emotion regulation strategies differed according to social context. We compared the effectiveness of co-ruminating, co-problem solving and co-distracting with parents/peers for regulating anxious youth's NA in response to stress in their daily lives. We also examined the benefit of attempting each strategy socially vs. non-socially (e.g., co-ruminating vs. ruminating). One-hundred-seventeen youth (9-14) with a current diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and/or Social Phobia completed an ecological momentary assessment (14 calls over 5days), reporting on recent stressors, their affective state, presence of others, and emotion regulation strategies within the prior hour. Mixed linear models revealed that co-distracting was the most effective social strategy for reducing NA, but only for boys. Co-rumination was the least effective social strategy for regulating NA. Regarding social context, only co-distracting was more effective for regulating NA over distracting alone, but only among anxious boys. Results suggest that co-rumination is an ineffective use of social support for regulating NA. Anxious boys may benefit from social support by co-distracting with parents/peers, but improper use may reflect avoidance and contribute to long-term anxiety maintenance. Results extend research on gender differences in interpersonal relationships and emotion regulation.

AB A conceptual model was tested, separately for male and female adolescents, in which adolescent dating violence (ADV) perpetration toward a romantic partner is affected by the memories of authoritarian paternal and maternal parenting styles through the mediation of adolescents' emotion dysregulation. The sample consisted of 622 Italian adolescents (35.5% males; 64.5% females) aged 13 to 21 years. Participants completed a questionnaire composed of three self-report scales: Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire measuring adolescents' memories of parenting styles; Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory, measuring multiple forms of abusive behavior that may occur between adolescent dating partners; and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire, measuring emotion regulation. For both male and female adolescents, there were significant indirect effects of the memories of both maternal and paternal authoritarian styles on ADV perpetration that were mediated by the adolescents' impulse control difficulties.

AB Military families experience unique stressful circumstances such as frequent moves, service-related physical and mental health difficulties, and separation from support. Although many families exhibit high resilience in response to these stressors, military children are at an increased risk for emotional and behavioral difficulties, exposure to intimate partner violence, and child maltreatment. These potential problems not only affect child functioning, but often also negatively impact family and veteran outcomes. Although the Department of Defense has enhanced efforts to address child and family trauma among military families, many veterans' families are still not receiving timely, evidence-based treatment. With many veterans receiving care through Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, incorporating family treatment into VA services is important for promoting optimal veteran outcomes. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) has been used successfully for civilian and military children exposed to trauma including child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and traumatic grief. This article reviews research regarding veterans' mental health, child and family functioning, and parenting, and highlights the value of implementing TF-CBT in the VA given its family and-resilience-focused structure, strong empirical support, and flexible delivery model. Strengths of delivering TF-CBT in the VA (e.g., provision of trauma services for families where veterans are already receiving care, family education about trauma), as well as implementation barriers (e.g., VA policy regarding veteran-focused treatment, reduced facility resources) are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, including mixed-methods research with veterans' families to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of TF-CBT dissemination within VA facilities.

AB Implementation issues often interfere with delivery of evidence-based interventions for students exposed to trauma. To improve uptake of evidence-based techniques for such students, a partnership of interventionist scientists, research and development experts, and students created a self-paced, confidential, online curriculum. This article describes the program and results of an open trial in 5 schools that serve primarily ethnic minority youth in urban settings. Fifty-one middle and high school students completed surveys before and after the program, as well as within the program, to assess emotional and behavioral symptoms (depressive, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms and behavior) and purported mechanisms of action (coping, cognitions, emotional self-efficacy). Results indicated the program was feasible and acceptable, with moderate satisfaction. Despite low power in this study, we observed changes in several hypothesized mechanisms of action. In addition, we observed promising improvements in PTSD symptoms, emotional problems, and total behavioral difficulties. These findings offer the promise of using a self-help web-based tool to augment and enhance usual school support services.

AB Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have high rates of co-occurring emotional and behavioral problems. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has been used to assess emotional and behavioral functioning in many large-scale studies of children with ASD. However, the previously established factor model may account for symptom patterns differently in children with concurrent intellectual disability (ID).
   Method: In a sample of children with ASD, a multi-group nested confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare participant groups with and without concurrent ID on each of the subscales of the CBCL.
   Results: In almost all of the subscales, children with ASD and concurrent ID exhibit different baseline levels, measurement error, and overall predictive ability on the behavioral and emotional problems of the CBCL than children with ASD alone. In younger children with ASD, configural invariance was present in Emotional Reactivity, Anxious/Depressed, and Somatic Complaints, metric invariance was present in Sleep Problems, residual invariance was present in Withdrawn Behavior, and structural invariance was present in Attention Problems and Aggressive Behavior. In older children with ASD, configural invariance was present in Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, and Rule-Breaking; whereas, metric invariance was present in Withdrawn/Depressed and Aggressive Behavior.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, when dealing with intellectually heterogeneous ASD samples, the item-level data of the CBCL should be used, rather than broad subscale-level data. These findings underscore a continued need for development and validation of measures that are appropriate for use in individuals with ASD across ages and intellectual functioning.

AB Background Because emotional symptoms are common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and associate with much morbidity, some consider it to be a core feature rather than an associated trait. Others argue that emotional symptoms are too nonspecific for use as diagnostic criteria. This debate has been difficult to resolve due, in part, to the many terms used to describe emotional symptoms in ADHD and to concerns about overlap with mood disorders. Methods We sought to clarify the nature of emotional symptoms in ADHD by reviewing conceptual and measurement issues and by examining the evidence base regarding specificity of such symptoms for ADHD. We reviewed the various terms used to define emotional symptoms in ADHD, clarify how these symptoms are demarcated from mood disorders, and assess the possibility that symptoms of emotional impulsivity and deficient emotional self-regulation should be considered as core symptoms. We addressed psychiatric comorbidities, the effects of ADHD treatments on associated emotional dysregulation, and the utility of current rating scales to assess emotional symptoms associated with ADHD. Results Emotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and adults with ADHD. Although emotional symptoms are common in other psychiatric disorders, emotional impulsivity (EI), and deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) may be sufficiently specific for ADHD to function as diagnostic criteria. Conclusions Emotional symptoms in ADHD cause clinically significant impairments. Although there is a solid theoretical rationale for considering EI and DESR to be core symptoms of ADHD, there is no consensus about how to define these constructs sin a manner that would be specific to the disorder. An instrument to measure EI and DESR which demarcates them from irritability and other emotional symptoms could improve the accuracy of diagnostic criteria for ADHD.

AB Purpose A specialized unit for long-term sentenced male young people sought to provide additional support to those convicted of the gravest violent offences, who had the highest risk of further offending. One key element was the introduction of a violence reduction intervention, Life Minus Violence-Enhanced (LMV-E). The present study evaluated LMV-E. Methods Participants (N = 21, starting age = 16-17 years) were convicted of a violent offence and had a history of custodial and or community violence. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons were of risk for future violence as measured by the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY; Borum et al., , Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY). Psychological Assessment Resources Inc.) and treatment-related change on self-report questionnaires. Sanctions for further aggression in custody or following release were recorded at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Results SAVRY identified statistically significant reductions in individual-clinical and social-contextual scales, with large effect sizes. Statistically significant changes, with moderate effect sizes, were noted in self-report questionnaires. Reductions were in rumination, physical and verbal aggression, and anger. Improvements were in emotional awareness, emotion regulation, and impulsivity. Follow-up showed favourable rates of aggression within the community and custody. Conclusions Risk reduction findings are important, pointing towards a generalized reduction in aggression risk following this intervention. Significantly, participants also demonstrated improvement in empathy, a direct treatment target. Treatment-related change was multidomain, across several areas addressed by the intervention. This study therefore found good evidence for the utility of LMV-E in addressing risk of aggression for young people.

AB Poor sleep is a significant risk factor for depression across the lifespan and sleep problems have been hypothesised to contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression symptoms. However, sleep problems are usually not a direct target of interventions for depression. A range of non-pharmacological treatments can reduce sleep problems but it is unclear whether these interventions also reduce other depression symptoms. The aim of this review was to examine whether non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems are effective in reducing symptoms of depression. We carried out a systematic search for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological sleep interventions that measured depression symptoms as an outcome. Forty-nine trials (n = 5908) were included in a random effects meta-analysis. The pooled standardised mean difference for depression symptoms after treatment for sleep problems was -0.45 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.36). The size of the effect on depression symptoms was moderated by the size of the effect on subjective sleep quality. In studies of participants with mental health problems, sleep interventions had a large effect on depression symptoms (d = -0.81, 95% CI: -1.13, -0.49). The findings indicate that non-pharmacological sleep interventions are effective in reducing the severity of depression, particularly in clinical populations. This suggests that non-pharmacological sleep interventions could be offered as a treatment for depression, potentially improving access to treatment. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the measurement of social emotional competence in low-income youth by assessing the validity of responses derived from the widely used, teacher-rated Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA). Based on the five-component social emotional learning model proposed by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, the teacher-rated DESSA shows promise as an easy-to-administer, strengths-based assessment tool for teachers from low-income communities. In a sample of 313 kindergarten students from a southeastern city, three competing measurement models were tested (one-factor, correlated five-factor, and higher order five-factor) using confirmatory factor analyses. Results revealed that, relative to the one-factor model, the higher order five-factor framework had the best model-data fit, although the first-order factors were highly correlated with the second-order factor. Furthermore, zero-order correlations showed that the DESSA was associated with both direct and teacher-reported measures of school-related outcomes. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

AB In this study, we explored the predictive role of behavioral measures of Executive Functions (EFs) and a self-report measure of Effortful Control (EC) on the academic performance of early adolescents. We also analyzed the mediating role of self-reported empathy and social behavior rated by peers (i.e., prosocial behavior and social preference) and by the lead teacher (i.e., social competence). A sample of 244 adolescents aged between 12 and 13 years participated in the study. The resulting structural equation model indicated that EFs and EC predict academic performance in a complementary and independent way. Results also confirmed the mediating role of empathy and social behavior. The final model explained 64% of academic performance. We discuss the appropriateness of obtaining complementary measures of EFs and EC in predictions of academic performance as well as the importance of introducing activities involving self-regulation, empathy, and socioemotional skills in the school setting.

AB Given the increasing societal concerns about youth's mental health problems in the context of rapid sociocultural changes in urban China, studying the links of appraisals and coping to Chinese children's adjustment can inform cultural adaptations of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions for this population. In a school-based sample of 591 Chinese preadolescent children (53.6% girls, X over bar age = 11.6 years, in fifth and sixth grades) in Beijing, we tested the concurrent relations between (a) children's self-reported threat appraisals of stressors and use of coping strategies (active, avoidant, distraction, and support seeking), and (b) three domains of adjustment (externalizing and internalizing problems, and social competence) rated by parents, teachers, and children. Structural equation modeling revealed that controlling for stressors and family demographics, threat appraisals and avoidant coping were positively associated with internalizing problems. Active coping was negatively associated with externalizing problems and positively associated with social competence, and support seeking coping was negatively associated with internalizing problems. Gender did not moderate threat/coping-adjustment associations.

AB The aim of this article is to provide preliminary efficacy of a psychological intervention for children and young patients to help them to improve resilience, coping strategies for pain, anxiety, and general emotional discomfort in long-term hospitalization using a virtual reality videogame and telepsychology. A case study illustration in an adolescent was 15-year-old Spanish boy hospitalized in the pediatric ward and prescribed dialysis is presented to provide some clinical evidence of the treatment's strategic feasibility and efficacy for this population. Patient was pre, post, and follow-up assessed anxiety, affective, resilience, and avoidance. Space Academy is a virtual reality-based treatment with positive psychology and third-wave therapy components that consist in understanding the basic aspects of their disease, to promote emotional perception and regulation and promote and develop resilience. Results show good acceptability and feasibility, improved state and trait anxiety, resilience, and emotional competence in controlling behavior. The case illustration shows improvements in anxiety resilience and acceptance. The use of information and communication technologies in psychology is an advance in clinical and health care psychology.

AB Failures in emotion regulation, especially as a result of interpersonal stress, are implicated as transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology. This study examines the effects of an experimentally timed targeted interpersonal rejection on emotion reactivity and regulation in typically developing adolescent girls. Girls (n = 33, ages 9-16 years, M = 12.47, SD = 2.20) underwent fMRI involving a widely used emotion regulation task. The emotion task involves looking at negative stimuli and using cognitive reappraisal strategies to decrease reactions to negative stimuli. Participants also engaged in a social evaluation task, which leads participants to believe a preselected peer was watching and evaluating the participant. We subsequently told participants they were rejected by this peer and examined emotion reactivity and regulation before and after this rejection. Adolescent girls evidence greater reactivity via higher self-reported emotional intensity and greater amygdala activation to negative stimuli immediately after (compared with before) the rejection. Self-reported emotional intensity differences before and after rejection were not observed during regulation trials. However, on regulation trials, girls exhibited increased prefrontal activation in areas supporting emotion regulation after compared with before the rejection. This study provides evidence that a targeted rejection increases self-report and neural markers of emotion reactivity and that girls increase prefrontal activation to regulate emotions after a targeted rejection.

AB Introduction: Recent increases in marijuana use among adolescents, in concert with decreases in perceptions of harm caused by marijuana use, documented associations of marijuana use with health problems and academic disengagement, and the increase in cannabis potency over the past two decades highlight the need for effective prevention and intervention efforts to delay and/or curb marijuana use among adolescents. The present study investigated the role of four promotive factors in the role of abstinence from marijuana use initiation.
   Methods: Low-income, urban, African American youth (N = 302; 54.6% female; M age = 12.05 years, SD = 1.57 years, Range = 10 to 16) participating in a larger study of stress and coping who had not initiated marijuana use at baseline were included in the sample. Goal directedness, emotion regulation, perceived support from mother, and religious coping, assessed at baseline, were evaluated for their contributions to marijuana use initiation two years later."
   Results: By time 3, 14.7% of the sample reported having initiated marijuana use. Univariate analyses indicated that abstainers were younger, better able to regulate their emotions, and marginally more likely to use religious coping. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a best-fitting model describing abstinence from marijuana use; this model revealed age and emotion regulation as unique contributors to abstinence.
   Conclusions: Emotion regulation is a teachable skill, and is included in many school-based prevention and parenting programs. Recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of self-regulation interventions in African American youth are discussed.

AB The well-documented disparities in availability, accessibility, and quality of behavioral health services suggest the need for innovative programs to address the needs of ethnic minority youth. The current study aimed to conduct a participatory, formative evaluation of "Working on Womanhood" (WOW), a community-developed, multifaceted, school-based intervention serving primarily ethnic minority girls living in underserved urban communities. Specifically, the current study aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial promise of WOW using community-based participatory research (CBPR) and represented the third phase of a community academic partnership. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 960 WOW participants in 21 urban public schools, as well as WOW counselors, parents, and school staff over the course of one academic year. Results demonstrated evidence of acceptability of WOW and noteworthy improvements for WOW participants in targeted outcomes, including mental health, emotion regulation, and academic engagement. Findings also indicated several challenges to implementation feasibility and acceptability, including screening and enrollment processes and curriculum length. Additionally, we discuss how, consistent with participatory and formative research, findings were used by program implementers to inform program improvements, including modifications to screening processes, timelines, curriculum, and trainings - all in preparation for a rigorous effectiveness evaluation.

AB Literature reviews have shown that trait-mindfulness is significantly correlated to emotional wellbeing, both in adults and in children. Particularly, being judgemental towards ones inner thoughts, feelings and sensations, and acting unawares, is associated with higher maladjustment.
   In the present cross-sectional study, we explored the role of the different facets of mindfulness in both anxiety and depression, controlling for the effects of gender, age, rumination, and worry, and analysed which facets of mindfulness have the strongest effect in predicting depression and anxiety. Two-hundred seventy-four community adults were assessed in the domains of depression, anxiety, rumination, worry, and mindfulness. Regression analyses showed that, among the facets of mindfulness, a judgemental attitude towards one's thoughts and feelings is the strongest predictor of both depression and anxiety. Our study highlights the importance of a normalising, accepting, non-judgemental attitude to decrease anxiety and depression, and to foster wellbeing.

AB Self-concept clarity is a developmentally salient resource among adolescents and is positively associated with psychological adjustment. However, the mechanism underlying the association between self-concept clarity and adjustment remains inadequately understood. This study examined whether emotion regulation mediated the relationship between self-concept clarity and psychological adjustment in a sample of adolescents (N = 922) aged 14-16 years. Findings showed that the more adolescents had a clear idea of themselves the more they were effective in emotion regulation when dealing with both positive and negative emotions, and the more they were psychologically adjusted.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic disorder (IPV-PTSD) on child appraisal of emotion, as measured by high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) during an Emotional Face-matching Task (EFMT). We recorded HD-EEG in 47 children of mothers with and without IPV-PTSD during an Emotional Face-matching Task (EFMT). Mothers and children each performed the EFMT. Behavioral results demonstrated that both mothers who were directly exposed to violent events, and their children, presented attentional bias toward negative emotions when processing facial stimuli. EEG findings confirmed differences in emotion appraisal between children of IPV-PTSD mothers and non-PTSD controls at scalp-level and in terms of source localization upon which children of IPV-PTSD mothers demonstrated decreased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in response to angry and fearful faces as compared to non-PTSD children with respect to the N170 component. Our study, to our knowledge, is the first to show that maternal IPV-PTSD significantly affects a mother's own and her child's neural activity in response to facial expressions of negative emotion. These findings are potentially important to the development and study of effective interventions to interrupt intergenerational cycles of violence and trauma.

AB Background: Emotion dysregulation increases the risk of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Music can help regulate emotions, and mobile phones provide constant access to it. The Music eScape mobile app teaches young people how to identify and manage emotions using music.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the effects of using Music eScape on emotion regulation, distress, and well-being at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Moderators of outcomes and user ratings of app quality were also examined.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared immediate versus 1-month delayed access to Music eScape in 169 young people (aged 16 to 25 years) with at least mild levels of mental distress (Kessler 10 score>17).
   Results: No significant differences between immediate and delayed groups on emotion regulation, distress, or well-being were found at 1 month. Both groups achieved significant improvements in 5 of the 6 emotion regulation skills, mental distress, and well-being at 2, 3, and 6 months. Unhealthy music use moderated improvements on 3 emotion regulation skills. Users gave the app a high mean quality rating (mean 3.8 [SD 0.6]) out of 5.
   Conclusions: Music eScape has the potential to provide a highly accessible way of improving young people's emotion regulation skills, but further testing is required to determine its efficacy. Targeting unhealthy music use in distressed young people may improve their emotion regulation skills.

AB There is a critical need for fast, inexpensive, objective, and accurate screening tools for childhood psychopathology. Perhaps most compelling is in the case of internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, where unobservable symptoms cause children to go unassessed-suffering in silence because they never exhibiting the disruptive behaviors that would lead to a referral for diagnostic assessment. If left untreated these disorders are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new approach for identifying children with internalizing disorders using an instrumented 90-second mood induction task. Participant motion during the task is monitored using a commercially available wearable sensor. We show that machine learning can be used to differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with 81% accuracy (67% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We provide a detailed description of the modeling methodology used to arrive at these results and explore further the predictive ability of each temporal phase of the mood induction task. Kinematical measures most discriminative of internalizing diagnosis are analyzed in detail, showing affected children exhibit significantly more avoidance of ambiguous threat. Performance of the proposed approach is compared to clinical thresholds on parent-reported child symptoms which differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with slightly lower accuracy (.68-. 75 vs. .81), slightly higher specificity (.88-1.00 vs. .88), and lower sensitivity (.00-. 42 vs. .67) than the proposed, instrumented method. These results point toward the future use of this approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success.

AB The present study examined the various configurations of Chinese fathers' emotion socialization behaviors and how these configurations relate to adolescents' emotion regulation (ER). A total of 731 Chinese secondary school students completed measures of paternal reactions to their negative emotions, their use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression strategies, and overall ER ability. Four profiles of paternal emotion socialization were identified: the supportive (high supportive, low punitive, and moderate minimization responses to adolescents' negative emotions), the balanced (moderate warmth/responsiveness and nonsupportive reactions, and below-average levels of expressive encouragement), the disengaged (low across the four paternal emotion socialization practices), and the harsh (low supportive and high nonsupportive responses) profiles. Chinese adolescents with supportive and balanced fathers reported greater use of cognitive reappraisal than did those with disengaged and harsh fathers. Overall ER ability was the highest among adolescents with supportive fathers and the lowest among those with harsh fathers. Expressive suppression did not differ across four profiles. These findings highlight the importance of adopting person-centered approaches in understanding parental emotion socialization strategies and their associations with adolescents' emotion regulation.

AB A new questionnaire, the Behavioral Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (BERQ) was developed. This questionnaire consists of 5 scales and assesses ones behavioral style or strategies of responding to stressful events to regulate emotions. It is the first questionnaire that measures behavioral coping only and complements the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) which measures cognitive coping. In a sample of 457 adults from the general population the psychometric properties of the BERQ (measuring dispositional coping) and its relationship with well-being and the CERQ were examined. Principal component analyses supported the allocation of items to the subscales, with alphas of all scales being high. All BERQ scales correlated significantly with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Higher use of Seeking Distraction, Actively Approaching and Seeking Social Support was related to fewer depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting these are more adaptive strategies. Higher use of Withdrawal and Ignoring was related to more depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting these are less adaptive strategies. The BERQ and CERQ scales were mainly small to moderately correlated with each other. The results suggest that it is important to pay attention to behavioral coping in the development of intervention programs for mental health problems.

AB Mood disorder patients have a tendency to be more internally oriented, with difficulties in switching attentional focus, which might result in the generation of negative thoughts, such as rumination. The present study explored self-referential neural activity correlating with rumination tendency and attentional switching capacity in bipolar disorder.
   Twenty euthymic bipolar patients and twenty matched healthy controls underwent a novel introspection task of switching between internally and externally focused attention during a word processing task, while their brain activity was assessed using functional MRI.
   During internal focus, higher activity in self-related regions (mPFC, PCC) was found in euthymic bipolar patients as compared to controls, verifying the hypothesis of exaggerated recruitment of self-referential processes in bipolar subjects. Switching from internal to external focus revealed higher parahippocampal activity in patients as compared to controls, additionally more pronounced when switching away from negative as compared to positive self-referential information. Furthermore, rumination traits correlated with activity in PCC, subgenual and pregenual ACC, and bilateral anterior insula during repetition of internal focus, specifically when evaluating negative words. Finally, we used ACC subregions that correlated with tendency to ruminate as seeds for a whole brain connectivity analysis. Patients showed stronger connectivity between sgACC (seed), pgACC, dPFC, and anterior insula during internal focus, whereas pgACC (seed) was more strongly connected to parahippocampal gyrus when switching from internal to external focus.
   These findings reveal an overactive rumination-related network whose activity is enhanced by negative information in euthymic bipolar patients, which could possibly contribute to impaired switching of thoughts away from internal attention.

AB Drama Pedagogy Training (DPT), as other drama-based pedagogies, has been related to several outcomes, including creativity enhancement. This enhancement is commonly proven through the measurement of different creative processes. In our review we systematize characteristics, activities and techniques of DPT that are assumed to be related to creativity in order to have a more comprehensive framework to identify the specific DPT elements that are involved in the enhancement of some of the creative processes of children and adolescents. To this end, we identified five creative processes in experimental studies using DPT: divergent thinking, fantasy and imagination, associative thinking, symbolization, and problem solving. These processes were cross referenced with DPT characteristics, activities, and techniques that were argued to be related to creativity enhancement. Our review will propose a model with two main categories and six elements as follows: (1) technical drama phases which emphasizes the role of narrative and embodiment through (a) corporal and vocal training and (b) main drama techniques (e.g., storytelling and improvisation and role-play), and (2) psycho-pedagogical framework which emphasizes the role of a dialogic space through (c) playfulness and a (d) collaborative, safe space. We also identified (e) feedback as an important element of DPT which belongs to both drama technical phases and psycho-pedagogical framework categories. Along with the model, we explain the creative outcomes associated to each of these elements as a means to attire the attention to drama-based pedagogies for the development of creativity in the educational setting.

AB The term Phantom Phone Signals (PPS) refers to the perception of a mobile phone ringing, vibrating and blinking when in fact it did not. Data in youth are lacking, and controversies exist on whether PPS is related to psychopathology. In the present study, we showed data on the prevalence of PPS in a population (N = 2959) of students aged 10 to 14 years. We also explored the possible association between PPS and emotional or behavioural problems. Our results showed that PPS is a relatively common phenomenon with a prevalence rate of 58.9%, being more frequent in females. In univariate and multivariate analyses, we also found an association between the presence of PPS and emotional problems and temper tantrums, after accounting for relevant covariates. PPS is a relevant phenomenon to be considered in youth. It is common and may be a signal for emotional problems.

AB Based on the evidence that emotion regulation difficulties underpin many mental health struggles during adolescence, including substance use disorders (SUDs), we focused on distress tolerance as a particularly salient mechanism of action for bolstering emotion regulation outcomes for adolescents in early SUD recovery. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in improving distress tolerance through teaching skills to reduce individuals' perceived stress or feelings of crisis and increasing a sense of agency and self-regulatory efficacy. The aim of the present study was to improve emotion regulation outcomes in the student body of a recovery high school (N = 27) through six weeks of mindfulness intervention content delivered in a small-group format. Thus, we tested feasibility through recruitment and retention rates and examined preliminary efficacy outcomes from two, randomized mindfulness intervention conditions, and used a comparison group of students without an SUD diagnosis (N = 29) sampled from the community. Results indicate significant post-intervention impacts on recovery students' depression symptomology and on two separate measures of impulsivity (t(22) = 2.358, p < .05; t(20) = 2.358, p < .05; t(17) = 3.979, p < .01, respectively), although no significant differences between intervention condition were noted. Findings from the current study echo similar studies with comparable samples. Implications for the dosage and approach of group-format mindfulness interventions for adolescent samples are discussed.

ID MULTISYSTEMIC THERAPY; CHILDREN; OFFENDERS; TRIAL; PREVENTION
AB Targeting broad implementation of early intervention services has a high potential for impact given the prevalence of child sexual abuse committed by youth and the low recidivism rate following effective interventions. This multisite quasi-experimental study examined the outcomes for 320 youth ages 10-14 years and their caregivers who participated in community-based problematic sexual behavior - cognitive behavior therapy (PSB-CBT). Significant reductions in PSB with a large effect size (e.g. t(126) = 11.69, p < .001, d = 2.08) were found. No site differences were found, despite racial and regional diversity. Nonsexual behaviour problems, emotional problems, and trauma symptoms also significantly improved. Positive outcomes extended to caregivers. Recommended next steps include rigorous strategies for examining the impact of widespread implementation of evidence-based early intervention programmes on the prevention of sexual abuse, complemented with thoughtful efforts to develop and implement policies and procedures that improve the safety and well-being of all children in the community.

AB Objective(s): This study examined changes in depressed adolescents' reports of attachment anxiety and avoidance with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-A), and the relationship between attachment style and change in depression with IPT-A. Method: Forty adolescents (aged 12-17) participated in a 16-week randomized clinical trial of 4 adaptive treatment strategies for adolescent depression that began with IPT-A and augmented treatment for insufficient responders (n = 22) by adding additional IPT-A sessions (n = 11) or the antidepressant medication, fluoxetine (n = 11). Adolescents were 77.5% female and 22.5% male (mean age = 14.8, SD = 1.8). Ten percent of adolescents were Latino. Racial composition was 7.5% Asian, 7.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 80.0% white, and 5.0% biracial. Measures of attachment style (Experience in Close Relationships Scale-Revised [ECR-R]) and depression (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R]) were administered at baseline and Weeks 8 and 16. Results: Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance (ECR-R) decreased significantly from baseline to Week 16. Baseline Avoidance positively predicted greater reductions in depression (CDRS-R), controlling for fluoxetine. Reductions in Anxiety and Avoidance were also significantly associated with reductions in CDRS-R, controlling for fluoxetine. Conclusions: Adolescents' reports of attachment anxiety and avoidance are amenable to intervention with IPT-A. IPT-A may be particularly beneficial for adolescents who report a high level of avoidant attachment.

AB Family and emotional variables are related to the development and maintenance of different psychopathological disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze differences between emotional variables (emotion regulation, optimism and tolerance to frustration) and family variables (perceived educational styles) with obsessive-compulsive responses. Method: Participants were 473 adolescents (249 boys and 224 girls) aged between 12 and 18 years old (M = 14.84, SD = 1.83) who were studying Secondary Education. Results: The optimism variable reached the highest explanatory weight of obsession-compulsion, followed by attention to symptoms, sharing of feeling with father and tolerance to frustration. The scores in anxiety and depression showed a high percentage of variance explained. Conclusions: Optimism, adequate attention to symptoms, tolerance to frustration and relationships of trust between parents and children could be protective factors of obsessive-compulsive thoughts.

AB Purpose: In this paper, we present an exploratory, qualitative strand of a multiphase program evaluation of the Canadian-based SNAP (R) Youth Justice (SNAP YJ) model for males involved with the youth criminal justice system. SNAP YJ's therapeutic approach is founded on the evidence-based SNAP (Stop Now And Plan) model which focuses on strategies to enhance emotion regulation, self-control, and problem-solving for latency-aged children and their families. Integrating best practices from the literature, the SNAP YJ intervention uses technology (digital modules) to convey the manualized strategies and program sessions, engaging youth in an interactive manner. This systemic, cognitive behavioral intervention is designed to reduce further contact with the law and/or gang affiliation. The objectives of this study are to understand youth experiences of programing, enrich and contextualize preliminary outcome findings, and further develop programing through the inclusion of the youth perspective and feedback.
   Methods: A thematic analysis of 15 interviews with program participants from diverse backgrounds was conducted.
   Results: The results revealed a continuum of learning related to self-understanding and awareness of feelings; thinking and consequences; and prosocial skills and behavior.
   Discussion: Refinements to the program to target increased program effectiveness as a result of youth experiences are discussed.

AB Emotional disorders, namely anxiety and depression, frequently affect adolescents with asthma. In addition, their parents also may present emotional problems. The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety and depression in asthmatic adolescents and in their parents in a real-life setting. A series of adolescents with allergic asthma were consecutively enrolled. Asthma was diagnosed according to the GINA document and consistently the symptom control grade was assessed. We used the HADS questionnaire for the adolescents, and HADS, STAY, and BDI questionnaires for their parents. Globally, 121 adolescents (71 males, 50 females, mean age 13.4 +/- 0.8 years, age ranging between 12 and 15 years) with allergic asthma and their parents were evaluated. Only 29% of adolescents had controlled asthma. Adolescents with controlled asthma had lower HADS-A and HADS-D scores than other patients, whereas there was no difference among parents. Severe maternal anxiety was more frequent in poorly controlled subjects than in partially controlled ones; absence of maternal anxiety was more common in controlled subjects. The preliminary results of the current study suggest that anxiety and depression are common in adolescents suffering from asthma as well as in their parents, mainly in mothers. Emotional disorders might affect also the asthma control. Thus, in clinical practice, the psychological assessment could he included in the asthma work-up.

AB Oculometric behaviour assessed by pupil response provides important information about central autonomic activity and emotional regulation. However, studies regarding pupil response to emotional stimuli in adolescent depression are rare. We aimed to study emotional-linked pupil response in adolescent depression. Twenty depressive adolescents (average age: 15.4 +/- 1.2 years) and 20 age/gender-matched healthy subjects were examined. Average pupil diameter assessed by eye-tracking and pupillary light reflex were evaluated during protocol - baseline, free-view task, recovery phase. Regarding right eye, significantly greater initial pupil diameter and pupil dilation to positive pictures free-viewing (p=0.013, p=0.031, respectively), significantly slower average and maximum constriction velocity in baseline and positive pictures free-viewing (p=0.036, p=0.050, p=0.021, p=0.015, respectively), significantly slower maximum constriction velocity in recovery phase (p=0.045), and significantly faster average dilation velocity in negative pictures free-viewing (p=0.042) were observed in depressive group. Regarding left eye, significantly lower constriction percentual change in negative pictures free-viewing (p=0.044) and significantly greater baseline pupil diameter and pupil diameter at the peak of constriction in positive vs. negative pictures free-viewing (p=0.002, p=0.015, respectively) were observed in depressive group. Our study revealed discrete central autonomic dysregulation - parasympathetic hypoactivity associated with relative sympathetic dominance influenced by impairments in emotional processing already in adolescent depression.

AB ADHD is today the most frequently diagnosed mental health condition among children and adolescents. The common belief is that it is a mental illness, and doctors and psychiatrists have solid scientific evidence to make the diagnosis and provide safe and effective psychopharmacological treatment. However, the scientific literature does not support this belief so widespread in our society. The article reviews the historical way in which this belief has been constructed and analyzes a scientific article that supposedly supports this way of approaching the behavioral and emotional problems of children of our times. The conclusion is that society today has no evidence to support this belief.

AB According to the research data, the number of adolescents and university students with emotional maladjustment is growing up along with increasing levels of perfectionism. In this study, the authors compared indices of perfectionism in two samples of Russian university students that completed the Three-Factor Perfectionism Inventory (N.G. Garanyan, A.B. Kholmogorova) in 2005-2008 (N=449) and 2017-2018 (N=194). The comparison revealed that levels of the most destructive perfectionism aspects associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms have significantly increased. Overall, the means on subscale corresponding to socially prescribed perfectionism have increased by 34%, whereas the indices of perfectionistic thinking have grown twice. According to multifactorial psychosocial model of affective spectrum disorders (A.B. Kholmogorova, N.G. Garanyan, 1998), the cult of success and achievements in modern society is inextricably linked to this growth of perfectionism indices. The data obtained and their interpretations correspond closely to the studies of researchers from western countries. The necessity to create a healthy learning environment and establish psychological service in education's system is confirmed.

AB Background: Previous studies have identified structural brain abnormalities in pediatric PTSD. However, little is known about what structural brain substrates may confer recovery versus persistence of PTSD in the context of the developing brain.
   Methods: This naturalistic longitudinal study used T1-weighted MRI to evaluate cortical thickness and surface area in youth with a PTSD diagnosis (n = 28) and typically developing healthy youth (TD; n = 27) at baseline and one-year follow-up. Of the PTSD group, 10 youth were remitters at one-year follow up while 18 had persistent PTSD. Whole-brain estimates of cortical thickness and surface area were extracted to identify differences in cortical architecture associated with PTSD remission and persistence as compared to typical development.
   Results: Youth who achieved PTSD remission entered the study with significantly lower trauma exposure and reduced symptom severity as compared to nonremitters. PTSD persistence was associated with decreased surface area over time in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (v1PFC) as compared to both remitters and TD youth. In contrast, PTSD remission was associated with expansion of frontal pole surface area and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) thickness over time. Across clinical groups, vmPFC thickness was further inversely associated with symptom severity.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, these findings represent the first report of cortical substrates underlying persistence versus remission in pediatric PTSD. Together, these findings suggest active structural developmental processes unique to both remission and nonremission in youth with PTSD. In particular, expansion of prefrontal regions implicated in emotion regulation may facilitate recovery from PTSD in youth and would warrant further study.

AB Adolescents throughout the world do not obtain adequate sleep. A recent proliferation of experimental and quasi-experimental studies has considerably clarified the relationships between sleep loss and neurobehavioral function suggested by earlier epidemiological and cross-sectional studies. These new studies concur in finding that multiple successive nights of restricted sleep can impair multiple cognitive and affective functions. These effects cumulate from night to night, may not fully recover after weekend recovery sleep and may even be compounded by re-exposure to sleep restriction. An hour long afternoon nap reduces sleepiness in addition to improving vigilance, memory encoding and mood without interfering with nocturnal sleep when the latter is shortened. However, this does not detract from the point that adolescents require approximately 9h of sleep per night for optimal neurobehavioral function, a message that more need to embrace.

AB Background/Aim. Attachment and emotion regulation skills are recognized as important factors in the development of depression, but their specifics have rarely been discussed in clinical adolescent population. The aim of our study was to investigate attachment and emotion regulation strategies in adolescents with depression. Methods. The sample consisted of 101 adolescents, age 16 to 24, divided into three groups: 1) 41 adolescents with the diagnosis of depressive disorder; 2) 30 adolescents with the diagnosis of anxiety disorder; 3) 30 health adolescents (without psychiatric diagnosis). The assessment was done by the following instruments: the Socio-demographic questionnaire; the Semistructured clinical interview (SCID-I) for the Diagnostic and Stratistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) and Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Data were analyzed using MANCOVA and partial correlation, with gender, age and birth order as covariates. Results. The adolescents with depressive disorders had less secure attachment to mother and peers than the health adolescents and less secure attachment to father comparing to other two groups (MANCOVA F = 4.571; p = 0.000). The adolescents with anxiety disorder had less secure attachment to father and peers compared to the healthy adolescents group (p < 0.05). The depressed adolescents used the strategy of cognitive reappraisal less often than both control groups (MANCOVA F = 5.200; p = 0.001). Subjective experience of depressive symptoms was related to insecure attachments to both parents and peers (r = -0.457; -0.436; -0.349; p = 0.000), as well as to lower use of cognitive reappraisal (r = -0.446; p = 0.000). Conclusion. Our findings related the adolescent depression to insecure attachment in all domains, with the specific weakness in emotion regulation (weak cognitive reappraisal). The findings could have practical implications for preventive and therapeutic interventions.

AB The Experiences in Close Relationship Scale (ECR) is one of the most commonly used self-report instruments of adult attachment and has been widely adopted in psychotherapy research. Composed of two subscales, namely Attachment Avoidance and Anxiety, the ECR was recently shortened to a 12-items version, called the ECR-12. Given the importance of extending knowledge on its applicability in understudied populations, our aim was to validate the ECR-12 in a large sample of Italian native-speakers. A total of 1197 participants (73.2% females; mean age=28.53 +/- 11.37 years) completed the ECR-12. Each participant also completed other measures of attachment, psychopathology, interpersonal distress, coping strategies, and well-being. An Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling analysis showed an excellent fit of the data, providing support for the two-dimensional orthogonal structure of the ECR-12. In addition, the measurement model was invariant across genders. Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance subscales demonstrated good internal reliability, with McDonald's Omegas and Cronbach's Alphas above the suggested 0.8 cut-off. Finally, the Italian version of ECR-12 showed adequate convergent, concurrent, and divergent validity. Highly anxious individuals reported the highest levels of maladaptive interpersonal functioning and coping strategies, resulting in lower well-being. Interestingly, both attachment insecurity dimensions predicted higher levels of psychopathology, even after controlling for demographic variables and levels of self-reported relational difficulties. Given the good psychometric properties of the ECR-12, researchers and practitioners in Italy are encouraged to adopt the ECR-12 in their future research on adult attachment in psychotherapy.

AB The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between sexting and emotional competence. A total of 440 students from the University of Mostar took part in this research, aged from 18 to 25 years (M=21.32, SD=1.84). The participants completed the Scale of Sexting Behaviour, and The Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire. The results of the study showed that 23.64% students had participated in receiving and sending sexually suggestive or provocative contents, whilst 10.23% had openly publicized such content. Young men participated to a greater extent in sexting in comparison with young women, and were less successful in recognition and understanding emotions, as well as in regulating and ;Hanging emotions. The data analysis revealed that the participants with lower results on the scale of emotional competence were involved more often in receiving, sending or publishing sexually suggestive or provocative contents. Sex and the ability to regulate and manage emotions were statistically significant predictors of receiving and sending sexually explicit content. These predictors, alongside the ability to understand emotions, proved to be significant in prediction of publication of sexually explicit contents. The results indicate the importance of emotional competence in explaining and prevention of sexting in young men and women.

AB The present work investigates the link between attachment relationships, mentalization, and emotional regulation in 10-year-olds children. The aim is to verify if children - teacher attachment relationship could influence children's mentalization style and cognitive/emotional regulation strategies. For this purpose, 110 children were tested with the Separation Anxiety Test-School Version, the Mentalizing task and the kids' version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. The results show that Self-Reliance component of the attachment representation with teacher predicts both the negative scale of mentalization and the propensity to use the emotional regulation strategy of "Positive Refocusing". Likewise, the Avoidance scale and the Total scale of the Separation Anxiety Test-School Version also influence the use of the cognitive emotion regulation strategy "Putting into Perspective" and of "Positive Refocusing," respectively. Results are discussed within the theoretical framework of multiple attachment theory, confirming the hypothesis that affective relationships with professional caregivers namely school teachers - play an important role in constructing self-representation and the abilities to regulate emotions in stressful situations.

AB Emotions and self-esteem are critical components of well-being and adaptation during adolescence. People differ in their average levels of affect and self-esteem, as well as in how much their affect and self-esteem fluctuate from moment to moment. Fluctuations in affect in particular have not been extensively examined in relation to adolescent-relevant variables. The present study investigates internalizing symptoms, social functioning, and overt and relational aggression as correlates of average levels and within-person variability in daily positive and negative affect (PA and NA) and self-esteem. Crucially, unique association were examined controlling for the other variables. Early adolescents (mean age 10.8 years, N= 94) completed daily diaries across four days on PA, NA, and self-esteem. They also completed general questionnaires, as did peers. Some key findings were that more internalizing symptoms were significantly associated with more variability in NA. The importance of peer relationships for adolescents' daily mean levels of PA and NA were shown. Peer-perceived social functioning was associated with less fluctuations in self-esteem. Some unexpected, non-significant, findings for aggression appeared. Finally, higher mean NA were associated with more NA fluctuations, whereas higher mean PA and self-esteem were associated with less fluctuations.

AB The article presents a study of mindfulness as a feature of consciousness in orphan and parentless adolescents. The adolescents' mindfulness is analysed through their awareness of the ability to achieve positive psychological effects, including psychological well-being and resilience.The study employed the following 9 techniques: the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM); the Resilience Scale; the Self-Compassion Scale; the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire; the Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale; the Gratitude Questionnaire; the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; the scales for measuring readiness to help and aggression in the classroom; the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).The sample included 20 orphan and parentless adolescents. The study revealed that mindfulness is indeed a factor of psychological well-being. The educators of twenty organizations for orphans and children without parental care assessed the adolescents' strengths and difficulties in order to evaluate their cognitive emotion regulation abilities. Correlation analysis allowed us to identify the relationship of mindfulness, psychological well-being indicators and emotional regulation with a number of social psychological characteristics of personality in the adolescents: indicators of positive psychological effects of mindfulness, in particular, humanity, resilience, competence (environmental management), and decrease of cognitive and emotional reactivity.

AB Students with low socioeconomic status (SES) are much less likely to participate in out-of-school-time (OST) activities than their more affluent peers. This "opportunity gap" may have compounding effects, as these activities help develop key noncognitive factors: the skills, beliefs, and behaviors associated with college readiness. College access programs may provide opportunities that are out of reach to students with low SES, including outdoor adventure education (OAE) experiences. This study involved 175 adolescents from a needs-based college access program and examined the relation of participation in a weeklong OAE experience to changes in student attitudes and beliefs, specifically (a) self-efficacy for dealing with challenge and engaging in help-seeking behaviors, (b) growth mindsets toward leadership and emotional regulation, and (c) sense of belonging within a community of learners. The study employed pre- and post-course measures of noncognitive factors along with in-depth interviews to identify outcomes and converging results from quantitative and qualitative data. Results indicate that OAE participation relates to gains in self-efficacy for dealing with challenge and using help-seeking behavior and reinforces sense of belonging. Interviews identified that the OAE experience provides an emotionally intense and authentic practice setting where students feel impelled to overcome difficulties. Unfamiliarity with the backcountry setting necessitated that students reach out to others for assistance, remain flexible, and adapt to new environments-key skills associated with college success.

TI Help or hindrance: the relationship of physical activity with

   PROGRAM; ASSOCIATION
AB BACKGROUND
   Puberty is a particularly important period for moulding one's lifestyle. Physical activity (PA) levels exhibited by teenagers remain low despite efforts to promote it, and the percentage of individuals who are exempt from taking part in physical education classes is high. In this context, the aim of the current study is to analyse the levels of aggression and self-esteem in adolescents characterised by different levels of physical activity.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   A total of 968 16-year-old adolescents took part in the study. Participants were divided into four subgroups: 1) a nonactive group, n = 141 (95 girls); 2) a physical education (PE) group, n = 514 (322 girls); 3) a high PA group, n = 178 (81 girls); and 4) an athlete group, n = 135 (66 girls). Participants were asked to complete a socio-demographic survey and a set of questionnaires (IPAO, KAM-RE, and SES).
   RESULTS
   The non-active group scored higher than the PE and high PA groups on the general aggressiveness scale. Statistically significant differences were found between the non-active group and other groups for direct and indirect aggression, opposition, and verbal aggression. The athlete group scored higher on the indirect aggression scale than the PE group. The high PA group scored higher than the non-active group in self-esteem.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Undertaking compulsory physical activity in school and additional physical activity based on one's own interests is associated with lower levels of aggression in comparison to individuals who do not undertake any physical activity. For this reason, it is necessary to continue consistently promoting physical activity in school and during free time.

AB Background. Methodological and ethical constraints have hampered studies into long-term lasting outcomes of stimulant treatment in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Lasting effects may be beneficial (i.e. improved functioning even when treatment is temporarily ceased) or detrimental (i.e. worse functioning while off medication), but both hypotheses currently lack empirical support. Here we investigate whether stimulant treatment history predicts long-term development of ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning or cognition, measured after medication wash-out.
   Methods. ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning and cognitive test performance were measured twice, 6 years apart, in two ADHD groups (stimulant-treated versus not stimulant-treated between baseline and follow-up). Groups were closely matched on baseline clinical and demographic variables (n = 148, 58% male, age = 11.1). A matched healthy control group was included for reference.
   Results. All but two outcome measures (emotional problems and prosocial behaviour) improved between baseline and follow-up. Improvement over time in the stimulant-treated group did not differ from improvement in the not stimulant-treated group on any outcome measure.
   Conclusions. Stimulant treatment is not associated with the long-term developmental course of ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning, motor control, timing or verbal working memory. Adolescence is characterised by clinical improvement regardless of stimulant treatment during that time. These findings are an important source to inform the scientific and public debate.

AB Early-onset bipolar disorder (EOBD) diagnoses have increased, yet much remains to be understood about its impact on developmental considerations that influence the course of illness and treatment. This qualitative study utilized semi-structured interviews to explore the experience of stigma, self-stigma, and identity associated with EOBD during adolescence. Participants described experiencing changes in identity and stigma and self-stigma across seven sub-themes: adaptation and integration, emotional adjustment, secrecy and selective disclosure of illness, change in identity and sense of self, labeling, self-labeling, and challenging and rejecting labeling. Implications of findings for social work practice and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Background: Several studies worldwide have pointed to depression and anxiety symptoms as being related to adolescent smoking. The aim of this study was to investigate, the potential link of cigarette smoking with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and the influence of gender on these relationships in Brazilian adolescents.
   Methods: Associations of smoking with Children Depressive Inventory version 2 (CDI2) scores, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) scores, and poor school performance (i.e., grade retention) were examined in 988 Brazilian students (age range, 11-17 years) enrolled in 82 public and private schools. Logistic regression modeling was employed and the resultant odds ratios (ORs) are reported with 95% CIs.
   Results: Of 988 participants, 240 (24.3%) were smokers. Mean (+/- standard error) HAM-A scores were higher for smokers (21.1 +/- 9.7) than nonsmokers (15.4 +/- 8.6; p < 0.0001). Relative to nonsmokers, smokers had higher total CDI2 scores (p = 0.033), and higher scores for the CDI2 domains of Emotional Problems (p = 0.023), Negative Self-esteem (p < 0.001), and Functional Problems (p = 0.046). Suicidal ideation was common among smokers with depressive symptoms (54.2%). Smoking was associated with being held back three grades (p < 0.001). Female smokers were more likely to report suicidal ideation than male smokers (p = 0.020). Logistic regression modeling revealed significant associations of suicidal ideation with being female (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.38-2.37), being a female smoker (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.51-2.80), and having a HAM-A score > 16 (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.66-2.86).
   Conclusion: Smoking was found to be associated with anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor school performance in Brazilian adolescents; and female smokers reported more suicidal ideation than male smokers.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this research was to investigate the pattern of relationship between attachment styles, gaming addiction and empathy among adolescents.
   Research Methods: The correlational survey method was used herein. In order to explain the pattern of relationship between the variables, a theoretical model based on the literature was recommended, which was tested by the Structural Equality Modeling (SEM). The sample of the research consisted of 338 middle school and high school students studying in Istanbul Umraniye district. 117 of the students (52.5%) were female while 160 thereof (47.5%) were male. Student ages ranged between 10 and 17, and their age mean was 13. The data was collected by the Attachment Styles Scale, Gaming Addiction Scale and Empathetic Tendency Scale. Findings: According the result of the Analysis, secure addiction significantly predicted gaming addiction in a negative way while it significantly predicted empathetic tendency in a positive way. Avoidant addiction significantly predicted gaming addiction in a positive way and empathetic tendency in a negative way. Anxious-ambivalent addiction, on the other hand, only predicted gaming addiction, in a positive way and significantly, and gaming addiction significantly predicted empathetic tendency in a negative way.

AB A growing body of research focuses on the concept and assessment of emotional competence due to the positive impact on positive youth development such as well-being. The Emotional Skills and Competences Questionnaire (ESCQ) has shown good psychometric properties in a cross-cultural setting. This study provides further evidence of the factorial structure of ESCQ using a new short version of 21 items. A total of 1300 students aged 12 to 15 years (M=13.47, SD=1.09) completed the original version of the ESCQ translated into Spanish. Data on emotional intelligence (TMMS-24), satisfaction with life (SWLS) and positive and negative affects (SPANE) were collected. Factor analysis confirmed the trifactorial structure of the reduced version (ESCQ-21), presenting adequate reliability indexes for each factor. Results provided evidence for construct validity and criterion validity. The ESCQ-21 factors were positively associated with the dimensions of TMMS-24, and predict subjective well-being (SWLS and SPANE). The ESCQ-21 appears to be an adequate evaluation tool to understand better how emotional skills may affect adolescent's subjective well-being.

AB Background Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviour is very common among adolescents. Its prevalence and behavioural characteristics may vary according to regional and cultural differences. Investigation of NSSI locations and diagnosis of adolescents with NSSI are relatively lacking in China. Aims The study objective was to determine the prevalence and features of NSSI among middle school students in Shanghai. Methods The participants were from grade 6 to 8 selected from three junior schools in Jing'an District. Consenting students completed the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory to determine the prevalence and characteristics of NSSI. Those who indicated NSSI within the past month were administered the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents to assess for emotional disorders. Result The result shows 510 participants (21.7%; mean age 13.51 (0.97) years old; 56.7% female) reported at least one instance of NSSI during the previous 12 months. NSSI was significantly more common in girls than boys (24.9% vs 18.5%; chi(2)=14.03, p=0.00). Commonly reported reasons for NSSI were for internal and external emotion regulation (87.9%, 82.3%) and social influence (57.8%). Anxiety disorders were the most common (28.9%) disorder associated with NSSI. Conclusion The rate of NSSI of middle school students in Shanghai inner bound is similar to those reported in North American and European youth. It is essential that school mental health professionals are aware of how to manage NSSI within the school setting.

AB Given the negative role of problematic use of new technological devices (NTD) in behavioral and psychological domains, the aim of the study is the Italian adaptation and validation of the Internet Motive Questionnaire for Adolescents (IMQ-A) in order to understand the motivation for the use of NM. A total of 769 students 10-19 aged (M = 13.22, SD = 1.56) completed the IMQ-A, the Collins Figures Rating Scale, and two measures regarding the problematic NTD use, focused on overuse during the night and during meals. The IMQ-A showed adequate internal consistency with regard to its four subscales: Coping (alpha = .84), Social (alpha = .80), Enhancement (alpha = .80), and Conformity (alpha = .68) motives. However, with regard to factorial structure, a threefactor model (excluding Conformity subscale) showed slightly better fit indices than the original model. Coping motive was correlated with problematic NTD use and succeeded in predicting higher scores in body dissatisfaction as evidence of criterion-related and external validity. The Italian adaptation of the IMQ-A can be useful in both research and clinical fields, in order to propose alternative strategies for coping to users and to improve emotion regulation facets.

AB The aims of the present study were to map the level and distribution of aggressive and antisocial behaviors in a sample of Moroccan high school students and to define the level of these behaviors in adolescents who reported parental alcohol use problems and/or experienced abuse. In total, 375 high school students completed the "Mental and Somatic Health without borders (MeSHe)" survey that includes the Life History of Aggression scale. Male students had significantly higher scores for aggression and antisocial behaviors than female. The students who reported experience of abuse or parental alcohol use problems scored significantly higher for aggression, self-directed aggression, and antisocial behaviors compared to students not reporting these negative psychosocial factors. Previously shown gender-specific patterns in aggressive and antisocial behaviors, but not in self-harm behaviors were confirmed in these Moroccan high school students. Reported experience of abuse and/or parental alcohol use problems were associated with increased frequency of aggressive and antisocial behaviors.

AB The purpose of this study was to test developmentally informed hypotheses about regulatory responses to sadness that attenuate versus exacerbate it (adaptive versus maladaptive mood repair responses, respectively) across late childhood, early adolescence, and mid-adolescence. In a multi-site study in Hungary, clinic-based, 7- to 14-year-olds with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' (4th ed., text rev.) depressive disorders (N = 697; 55% male) and age/sex matched (at 1:2) nondepressed, school-based controls (N = 1,394) reported on their usual responses to sadness/dysphoria; parental reports were obtained separately. Adaptive and maladaptive response repertoire scores were compared across ages within and across subject groups, and by informant, controlling for confounds. Contrary to Hypothesis 1, older (vs. younger) youths in both groups reported fewer adaptive regulatory responses. Maladaptive response repertoires were unrelated to age among controls but significantly increased with age among depressed youths, particularly the girls. Partially supporting Hypothesis 2, subject groups differed in age-related trajectories of mood repair repertories, but not as expected (e.g., younger depressed children reported larger adaptive response repertoires than did controls). Parental reports revealed no developmental changes in offspring's mood repair repertories. Parent-offspring reports were most discordant for younger (vs. older) offspring, tended to converge around age 11, and were consistently and significantly larger in the depressed sample. Self-reported adaptive mood repair repertories appear to have been laid down by late childhood and then undergo "trimming" across ages 7-14 years. The extensive maladaptive mood repair response repertoires of depressed youths, which increased with age, distinguish them primarily from controls. Therefore, reducing maladaptive regulatory responses to sadness should be a priority when treating depressed youths.

AB Results: The higher traumatic exposure during the war, the greater the tendency to have emotional problems and behavioral problems for both kinds of participants. The result showed that there were no differences on the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems between the two groups, and both veterans and wives of veterans had no differences on seeking professional help for their emotional and behavioral problems. Wives of veterans living in rural areas showed higher scores on almost all ASR scales compared with those living in urban areas or even with those of veterans from urban and rural areas. Veterans with elementary education level had the highest scores compared with other groups. Veterans with poor well-being had the highest scores compared with other groups. Using Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems as outcome variables and trauma exposure, smoking, drinking alcohol, and well-being as predictors, we found that the model was a significant predictor for both male and female participants on these three scales.

AB Social-emotional competence in children is an important area in which to develop and improve effective programs and evaluation. Research shows a positive association between social-emotional learning (SEL) and improvements in students' conduct, social behavior, and school engagement as well as decreases in high-risk behaviors such as taking drugs, smoking and aggression. Extensive research points to the positive benefits of successful SEL curriculum in schools, but less research exists on SEL implementation in after-school care settings. Since social-emotional competence is correlated with higher positive effects and a decrease of negative effects in the social, behavioral, and academic outcomes of children exposed to these programs, more research is needed on the most effective format and environment for implementation. The purpose of this article is to review this research, and report the results of an evaluation comparing pre- and post-program survey data from children (n = 125; age range = 4-11 years) attending an after-school program that has incorporated an SEL curriculum. Results showed significant increases in two SEL competencies: empathy and self-soothing. The advantages to providing both SEL instruction and evaluation in after-school care settings in addition to schools is also explored.

AB In Colombia, an increase of suicidal behavior in adolescents caused by personal and environmental factors is evidenced. This quantitative, descriptive, correlational research aimed to establish the existing relationship between social cognition, perception of the quality of relationships and emotional regulation with the variables of psychosocial risk, suicide risk and level of psychological well-being in adolescents in contexts of high socioeconomic vulnerability of Bogota. A total of 155 adolescents were selected through non-probabilistic sampling at convenience, with ages between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.47 and DE = 1.03). The results allowed observing the existence of significant relationships between the study variables. From a linear regression analysis, the emotional bond and emotional self-regulation had a higher level of explanation about the perception of well-being and the psychosocial risk associated with suicide. Finally, the results and implications of a greater participation of the emotional bond in comparison to that of social cognition in adolescence are discussed, in order to formulate programs that promote well-being and prevent risk.

AB Emotional processes and social interactions are relevant units in the study of the actors involved in contexts of political violence, since they have been exposed to constant conflict and they can develop inappropriate behaviors in daily life. Despite the fact that works on the subject are outlined, very few approach the phenomenon from a perspective of behavioral analysis, specially because of the advances that are denoted in related topics. That is why this review seeks to analyze the conceptual and methodological trends in written production on this subject from this theoretical perspective. The review was completed using the PRISMA guidelines with a search of six electronic databases that resulted in 297 articles for the initial review and 31 articles included in the final analysis. The results show that the most frequent studies are the quantitative empirical ones, showing there is a difference between the concepts of analysis by population, since the results throw an emphasis on the analysis of personnel of military forces that seem affected by hostility and aggression, with emphasis on war veterans and an approach based on in diagnostic categories from psychopathology. There are no approaches from other theoretical perspectives, such as those proposed by the analysis of behavior that could help to understand a personal, contextual and historical reality. Emphasis is placed on the need for an empirical specification regarding the results and the importance of the role of the environment for the maintenance and construction of repertoires of social interaction and identification, expression and emotional regulation.

AB This study investigates the usefulness of the emotion regulation (ER) brain behavioural systems and sensory sensitivity to better understand sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Specifically, associations between positive and negative ER, and incremental validity of brain behavioural systems and highly sensitive person (HSP) as predictors of the attitudes towards appearance are examined. Data were obtained in a sample of healthy adolescents (N = 331). Results of a series of multiple regression analyses showed that ER provided a significant prediction of each of the five attitudes towards appearance variables. Dimensions of brain behavioural systems including behavioural activation system (BAS), behavioural inhibition system (BIS), fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) showed multiple associations with facets from the attitudes towards appearance. BAS and FFFS were found to be the positive predictors and BIS was a negative predictor. HSP was found to be a positive predictor of attitudes towards appearance. The results expand the understanding of the attitudes towards appearance and indicate how domains of ER, personality, and sensory processing could explain the attitude of adolescents towards their appearance.

AB In this article, based on the pilot study Active music creation as a way of reducing the social anxiety of adolescents, we have explored the importance of music on the minds of adolescents and how this knowledge can be used for the emotional literacy of adolescents who participated in the study. In the first part of the article, we focused on adolescents and the development of an adolescent brain, and what music means in this crucial period of development. Furthermore, we focused on the music and its positive effects on the human brain, and how we can connect music with the teaching of emotional regulation. Music has always been what connects people since the voice itself is the first contact with the musicality that surrounds us from the conception onwards. The voice itself carries all emotional nuances, it communicates in what physical and emotional condition a speaker is and offers a bridge between "us" and "others". A group of adolescents who participated in our study learned to use their voices as a tool that offers emotional support. Through the exercises of cultivating this inner strength (their voice), they also learned emotional regulation, strengthening the sense of "self"; they were learning who they were, exceeded the expectations they had about themselves, and at the same time enjoyed themselves and built their own expression in the group. We also explored how we can use singing and instrumental techniques for therapeutic purposes, although our research was not intended to examine the effects of music therapy. Nevertheless, when creating singing and acting workshops for adolescents, we realized that our goal was achieved. Using the voice and learning with music were used as a therapeutic intervention in working with young people and the levels of social anxiety and restraint were shown to have decreased.

TI Pragmatic language impairment general and specific associations to

AB Background: The results of several international studies indicate a high prevalence of language and communication impairments among children who are referred to child psychiatric services. However, these impairments are likely to remain undetected unless language and communication impairments are evaluated during the psychiatric assessment.
   Aims: The aim of the present study is to investigate the specific association between general and specific mental health problems, as expressed by the problem scales of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teachers Report Form (TRF), and pragmatic skills and pragmatic language impairments (PLI) as defined the Pragmatic Composite of the Child Communication Checklist (CCC-PC).
   Methods: Children aged from 8 to 13 years (n = 73) were recruited in sequence following referral to a child and adolescent psychiatry (CAMHS) outpatient clinic within 12 months. Children with possible or established autism or intellectual disability were excluded. Standardized instruments measuring language, communication and mental health symptoms were distributed to parents and teachers, an intelligence test administered for clinical purposes, and demographic information was included.
   Results: The parent reports showed PLI among 38% of the children and revealed strong associations with the CBCL scales for emotional problems, thought problems and, especially, social and withdrawal symptoms, which mean more associations to internalized and non-externalized problems. PC-scores were at similar levels and PLI was reported by teachers at similar rates (compared to parent reports) with moderate agreement. Teacher PC-scores showed associations to only one TRF-scale, social problems. The CCC-PC subscale with the strongest associations to mental health symptoms was "Use of Context" ("Social Relationships" do not contribute to the CCC-PC scores).
   Conclusion: There was a general increase in PC-scores and increased prevalence of PLI in this clinical sample. PC-scores correlated with symptom scores for internalizing and non-externalizing problems scales. The strongest common factors appear to be related to the social aspects of mental health. Pragmatic skills should be considered as a protective factor for mental health rather than investigating pragmatic impairment as a risk or vulnerability factor.

AB Background: Emotional and behavioral problems (EBD) or mental health problems in children and adolescents are an important public health issue, but there has been no evaluation to date of the extent of such problems in near-developed countries. This study evaluated the prevalence and stability of EBD among children in Malaysia.
   Methods: This research comprises a longitudinal population-based study that measured the prevalence and 6-month stability of EBD in children aged seven to eight years and thirteen to fourteen years attending public schools in Malaysia based on parents, teachers and children's (aged 13 to 14 years) report of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at baseline and 6 months later.
   Findings: The prevalence of EBD in Malaysian school children was 9.3% for teacher-report, 8.5% for parent-report and 3.9% for child-report. There was no significance difference in the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems over six-months for all informants, except for teacher-report Emotional and Conduct problems scores which increased significantly and child-report Total Difficulties and Emotional problems scores which decreased significantly (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This study shows that the prevalence of EBD among Malaysian children is almost similar to the Western countries and stable over a 6-month period. These findings suggest the need for policy makers in near-developed countries to provide services aimed at preventing EBD and treating children identified as having such problems.

AB In this study, we developed and validated a new inventory that assesses emotion labor in parent-child relationships. Participants included 230 young adults who reported on the frequency with which they engaged in emotion labor with both parents. Results produced a 24-item inventory that assesses young adults' surface acting, deep acting, and emotional effort when having conversations with their mother and father, labeled the Emotion Labor in Families (ELF) scale. Tests of concurrent and discriminant validity supported the construct validity of the ELF scale, although the dimension of emotional effort was largely unassociated with the validity measures included in this report.

AB Anxiety trait is a relatively stable personality trait, which refers to the differences between individuals in terms of their tendency to experience state anxiety in response to the anticipation of a threat. Regular sport activity may influence some aspects of emotional adjustment in positive way and so on an individual's well-being. The aim of the study is to find out the possible differences in the level of separate dimensions of personal well-being of men and women with increased anxiety trait level, regarding their sport activity. The research sample consists of 74 respondents in late adolescence (30 men: athletes n=12, nonathletes n=18; 44 women athletes n=18, nonathletes n=26). We have used the standardized STAI questionnaire to determine the level of anxiety trait and standardized BDP questionnaire to determine the level of personal well-being (with respect to its two positive dimensions and three negative dimensions). The results have showed that male athletes demonstrated a significant higher level of positive attitude towards life (p=0.01) and a significantly lower level of awareness of problems (p=0.04) and depressive mood (p=0.03) as male nonathletes. Female athletes demonstrated a significant higher level of positive attitude towards life (p=0.02) and selfevaluation (p=0.00) while a significant lower level of depressive mood (p=0.04) as female nonathletes. Our findings indicate that regular sport activity can be a suitable instrument to increase personal well-being (in some aspects of well-being) of women and men with higher level of anxiety trait.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between parent-child relationship and emotional regulation in adolescents across four countries regarding: (a) mother-child relationship; (b) father-child relationship; (c) adolescents' emotion regulation; and (d) the relationship between mother-child/father-child close relationships and adolescents' emotion regulation. Sex differences were also considered in the analysis. The sample of 270 Zambian, 216 Argentinian, 200 Ghanaian, and 180 Indian adolescents answered The Experience in Close Relationship Questionnaire and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire. Results revealed cultural differences in the way adolescents perceived their relations with parents. Zambian adolescents were more likely to perceive their relationship as avoidant compared to Ghanaian, Argentina and Indian. Consistent with literature, Zambian and Argentinian adolescents who perceived their parents as avoidant were likely to use less cognitive appraisal as an emotion regulation strategy. Finally, Argentinian adolescents who used expressive suppression were also likely to perceive their parents as avoidant.

AB Aim. This study explores the association between sleep quality and emotional regulation, and investigates the genetic and environmental bases of this association.
   Methods. Three-hundred-eighty-two adolescent twins, from the Italian Twin Registry, and their parents filled the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist questionnaires, from which the construct of Effortful Control (EC) was derived as a measure of emotional regulation. Twins were identified as "good" or "non-good" sleepers based on answers to the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire. EC levels were compared between samesex sleep discordant twins.
   Results. A significant association was detected between EC scores and sleep quality. When controlling for shared (fetal or early life) environmental factors and genetic background in the discordant twin analysis, this association weakened in dizygotic twins and disappeared in monozygotic twins.
   Conclusion. Results support the association between sleep quality and EC in adolescence; furthermore, they suggest that sleep quality and emotional regulation may depend on common genetic or environmental factors.

AB Background. Mental health issues, often manifested as behavioural difficulties, in children are estimated to be high in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) settings. There is a paucity of definitive data due to a lack of well-validated tools to use across settings. This review aims to provide evidence on what tools are used and which have been adapted and validated in LMIC settings. Methods. We performed a systematic review to identify tools used to assess or screen externalising behaviour problems in children and adolescents in LMIC and assess their cultural adaptations. We searched for studies measuring externalising behaviour in children from 0 to 19 years published up to September 2018. Articles were assessed to identify tools used and analysed using the Ecological Validity Framework. Results. We identified 82 articles from over 50 LMICs who had studied externalising behaviour in children. Twenty-seven tools were identified, with a predominance of studies using tools from the USA and Europe. Most studies did not describe an adaptation and evaluation process, with only one study following recommended criteria. New tools were identified which both screen and assess externalising behaviour which have not yet been utilised across settings. Conclusions. Although tools from the USA and Europe are often utilised to screen and assess for externalising behaviour problems in children in LMICs, the conceptual frameworks behind the use of these tools in other cultural contexts are not always carefully examined. In order to have valid data across cultures, we should aim to adapt and validate tools before use. Provision of processes to validate tools across LMIC settings would be beneficial.

AB Research supports the clinical importance of childhood irritability, as well as its developmental implications for later anxiety and depression. Appropriate treatment may prevent this progression; however, little evidence exists to guide clinician decision making regarding treatment for chronic irritability symptoms. Given the empirical support for irritability as a dimension of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), behavioral interventions that improve ODD symptoms, especially through emotion regulation training, are strong candidates for identifying effective treatment strategies for irritability. Data from a randomized controlled effectiveness trial were used to assess hypotheses regarding irritability. The Stop Now and Plan (SNAP) Program was developed for preadolescent youths demonstrating clinically high rates of conduct problems. Participants (252 boys, ages 6-11) were assigned to participate in either SNAP or standard services; data were collected at 4 time points over 15 months. Although lower irritability scores over time were seen for the SNAP group compared to standard services, the main effect for treatment was small and did not reach statistical significance. However, a significant indirect effect of SNAP treatment on irritability via improved emotion regulation skills was found; improved emotion regulation skills were associated with significant and substantial reductions in irritability. Specific effects of SNAP for the improvement of emotion regulation skills function as a mechanism for subsequent reductions in irritability, supporting the distinction between emotion regulation and irritability symptoms. Enhancing increased emotion regulation skills within existing evidence-based interventions for children with ODD should provide a strong foundation for treatments to target irritability symptoms.

AB Sleep disturbance is prevalent in anxious youth and prospectively predicts poor emotional adjustment in adolescence. Study 1 examined whether anxiety treatment improves subjective and objective sleep disturbance in anxious youth. Study 2 examined whether a sleep intervention called Sleeping TIGERS can further improve sleep following anxiety treatment. Study 1 examined 133 youth (ages 9-14; 56% female; 11% ethnic/racial minority) with generalized, social, or separation anxiety over the course of anxiety treatment (cognitive behavioral treatment or client-centered treatment). Sleep-related problems (parent-, child-report) and subjective (diary) and objective (actigraphy) sleep patterns were assessed across treatment in an open trial design. Study 2 included 50 youth (ages 9-14; 68% female; 10% ethnic/racial minority) who continued to report sleep-related problems after anxiety treatment and enrolled in an open trial of Sleeping TIGERS. Pre- and postassessments duplicated Study 1 and included the Focal Interview of Sleep to assess sleep disturbance. Study 1 demonstrated small reductions in sleep problems and improvements in subjective sleep patterns (diary) across anxiety treatment, but outcomes were not deemed clinically significant, and 75% of youth stayed above clinical cutoff. Study 2 showed clinically significant, large reductions in sleep problems and small changes in some subjective sleep patterns (diary). Anxiety treatment improves, but does not resolve, sleep disturbance in peri-pubertal youth, which may portend risk for poor emotional adjustment and mental health. The open trial provides preliminary support that Sleeping TIGERS can improve sleep in anxious youth to a clinically significant degree.

AB BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of cyberbullying is on the rise among adolescents and in schools.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between personality characteristics such as empathy, the tendency to implement cognitive mechanisms aimed at moral disengagement, and the use of social media.
   PARTICIPANTS: Italian students from first to fifth year in high school classes (n = 264).
   METHODS: A questionnaire was used to gather information on the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their use of social media, their level of empathy (Basic Empathy Scale, BES), and mechanisms of moral disengagement (Moral Disengagement Scale MDS). Two questions were included to determine whether each participant had ever been a victim of or witness to cyberbullying.
   RESULTS: Results suggest that offensive behaviors are related to mechanisms of moral disengagement and to interaction using forms of communication that allow anonymity. In addition, offensive behavior appears to be related to forms of Internet addiction, while prosocial behavior is linked with cognitive empathy.
   CONCLUSION: In order to promote the establishment of prosocial behavior, it would seem necessary for the various players involved - schools, parents, social network developers - to make an effort to implement educational environments and virtual social networks based on a hypothesis of "design for reflection", educating young people about the need to take the time to understand their feelings and relationships expressed via social media.

AB As societies become increasingly diverse, mental health professionals need instruments for assessing emotional, behavioral, and social problems in terms of constructs that are supported within and across societies. Building on decades of research findings, multisample alignment confirmatory factor analyses tested an empirically based 8-syndrome model on parent ratings across 30 societies and youth self-ratings across 19 societies. The Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 and Youth Self-Report for Ages 11-18 were used to measure syndromes descriptively designated as Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior. For both parent ratings (N=61,703) and self-ratings (N=29,486), results supported aggregation of problem items into 8 first-order syndromes for all societies (configural invariance), plus the invariance of item loadings (metric invariance) across the majority of societies. Supported across many societies in both parent and self-ratings, the 8 syndromes offer a parsimonious phenotypic taxonomy with clearly operationalized assessment criteria. Mental health professionals in many societies can use the 8 syndromes to assess children and youths for clinical, training, and scientific purposes.

AB Past research has found that an important regulatory dimension of child temperament, effortful control, predicts child achievement. However, other dimensions of temperament may moderate the relation between effortful control and achievement. This study explored whether exuberance, a reactive temperament dimension, may moderate or compensate for low effortful control when predicting children's reading and math achievement in first grade. Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (n = 861) were used to test this hypothesis. The hypothesis was supported that for children with average or low exuberance, children's effortful control positively predicted their reading achievement scores in first grade; whereas for children with high exuberance, children's effortful control did not predict their reading achievement scores. Instead, highly exuberant children had high reading achievement scores regardless of their effortful control. Exuberance did not moderate the relation between effortful control and math achievement. Results suggest that children's high exuberance compensates for poor effortful control when learning to read and that parents and teachers should explore strategies for channeling these children's exuberance to support their academic growth.

AB Peripartum depression is prevalent among young mothers (ages 25 and younger), and low family support can exacerbate depressive symptoms. The current study explores an innovative method for engaging young mothers in a family-based intervention to help reduce peripartum depressive symptoms. This descriptive study includes details on the baseline characteristics of participants, integrative support teams, and a service delivery method to engage families living rural communities. In conclusion, engaging depressed young mothers living in rural communities requires a multifaceted approach. Our approach has demonstrated promise in engaging this hard-to-reach population. Implications for clinical practice and future research are addressed.

ID HEALTH
AB Background: Childhood and adolescence is one of the most important, most sensitive and also most decisive periods of human life. Events during this period, for children and adolescents under the supervision of the welfare organisation, can lead to behavioural-cognitive and emotional problems and face the natural process of transition from this period with serious challenges. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between quality of life and happiness among children and adolescents under the supervision of welfare organisation of Ahwaz in 2015.
   Methodology: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 75 children and adolescents aged 8-18, under the supervision of the welfare organisation, using the available sampling method. The data collection tool was a demographic information questionnaire, the Kidscreen quality of life and the Oxford happiness. The collected data were analysed using SPSS software version 20 and independent t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman and Chisquare tests. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: The results showed that there was a significant and direct correlation between quality of life and happiness in children and adolescents under the supervision of the welfare (P <0.001 and r = 0.656). All aspects of the quality of life in the group who did not show happiness reported to be lower.
   Conclusion: The quality of life of children and adolescents under the supervision of welfare is related to their happiness. The effect of the use of pharmaceutical supplements/drugs and its relationship with the happiness of children should be studied in future.

The study sample consisted of 292 students in the 8th grade at a junior high school, selected through a purposive sampling technique. The adolescents experienced emotional and behavioral problems, as well as relationship problems with their peers, which within the study was categorized as normal, while problems in the family have the borderline score. It is essential to promote mental health in adolescents in order to maintain good emotional conditions and behaviors, as well as good relationships within their peer group. In the meantime, mental health promotion programs should be given to adolescents and their families to prevent problems among adolescents that will affect their mental health condition.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to compare the quality of life reported by patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to the patients' quality of life as reported by their caregivers. In addition, it aimed to examine how emotional problems, including depression and anxiety, and the severity of the symptoms affect the quality of life reported by the patients and their caregivers.
   Methods: The patients' quality of life and their degree of depression and anxiety were measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Child Self-Report, the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, respectively. The caregivers' perception of the patients' quality of life and severity of the ADHD symptoms were measured using the PedsQL 4.0 Parent Proxy Report and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS), respectively. A total of 66 participants completed the survey. The independent-samples t-test, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted.
   Results: The mean score of the PedsQL 4.0 Child Self-Report was significantly higher than the mean score of the PedsQL 4.0 Parent Proxy Report. However, for school function, the PedsQL 4.0 Child Self-Report score was significantly lower than that of Parent Proxy Report. The correlation between the PedsQL 4.0 Child Self-Report and PedsQL 4.0 Parent Proxy Report scores was significant only for emotional function and social function. The multiple regression analysis showed that the PedsQL 4.0 Child Self-Report and PedsQL 4.0 Parent Proxy Report scores were significantly predicted by the CDI and CPRS scores, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that there are clear differences between the quality of life reported by the patient themselves and that reported by their caregivers. In addition, the findings suggest that it is critical to treat the patients' accompanying depressive symptoms.

AB Initially, the major focus of attachment theory was the parent-child relationship, but Bowlby (1988) also described the attachment system as active over the entire life course. Accordingly, a proliferation of research on attachment theory in the past two decades has addressed an array of familial predictors as well as intrapersonal and relational outcomes of attachment. The purpose of this review is to present: 1) measurement of attachment, 2) family violence, parental depression, and parental divorce as predictors of attachment, 3) (in)stability of attachment over time, 4) impact of attachment on emotion regulation and psychopathology, and 5) influence of attachment on romantic relationship. Special attention is paid to the role of attachment as a mediator between family of origin experiences and outcomes among youth and adults.

AB Young people from residential care facilities are frequently at risk of chronification of a mental disorder. Due to traumatisation, externalised behaviour problems, e.g. repeatedly inappropriate anger expression, can be noticed, which put the success of the treatment into question. It is therefore necessary to address problematic anger reactions of young people and to change the handling of anger. In this paper, a 10-week cognitive behavioral anger management training for young people with behavioural problems in residential care is presented. The applied test diagnostic procedures pointed out that the willingness to aggressive behaviour as well as outwardly directed anger expression were reduced and the anger control was increased. Overall, the effectiveness of the programme-supported intervention could be shown in an individual case. Young people from residential care facilities could therefore benefit from a participation at an anger management intervention by learning to optimize their emotion regulation and thus increase their social skills. Thereby, their social reintegration might be facilitated.

TI Subclinical eating disorder symptoms and positive vs. negative affect in

AB BACKGROUND
   Subclinical symptoms of eating disorders (ED) appear early, and adolescents still represent a specific risk group. Are there strategies of self-regulation which can protect adolescents against severe symptoms? We investigated differential mediators between subclinical eating disorder symptoms and negative vs. positive affect in adolescents.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   Data were collected twice. Adolescents (ages 17-18, N = 98) filled in the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), the Volitional Competences Questionnaire (VCQ), the Personality Style and Disorders Inventory (PSDI) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedules (PANAS). We postulated two different serial multiple mediation models originating in eating disorders, one leading to negative affect (through depressive personality style and self-motivation) and the other leading to positive affect (through self-regulation competences: self-relaxation and self-motivation).
   RESULTS
   The serial multiple mediation models were confirmed, with the postulated variables serving as mediators of positive and negative affect. In addition to body dissatisfaction, there were two additional predictors for positive affect (ineffectiveness and social insecurity) and five predictors for negative affect (drive for thinness, bulimia, perfectionism, interoceptive awareness, asceticism).
   CONCLUSIONS
   These experiences of eating disorders are associated with affect, through self-regulation of emotion (self-motivation), which along with depression or self-relaxation leads to either a decrease in the negative affect or an increase in the positive affect. Self-regulation is an important factor in preventing eating disorders and protecting the overall emotional well-being in high school students.
