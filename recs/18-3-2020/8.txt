AB Self-injury is often motivated by the desire to reduce the intensity of negative affect. This suggests that people who self-injure may have difficulty suppressing negative emotions. We sought to determine whether self-injuring individuals exhibit impaired inhibitory control over behavioral expressions of negative emotions, when responding to images containing aversive emotional content. Self-injuring participants and healthy controls completed a Stop Signal Task in which they were asked to judge the valence (positive or negative) of images. Three types of images depicted emotional content (neutral/positive/negative). A fourth type depicted self-cutting. An unpredictable "stop signal" occurred on some trials, indicating that participants should inhibit their responses to images presented on those trials. Compared to controls, self-injuring participants showed poorer inhibition to images depicting negative emotional content. Additionally, they showed enhanced inhibition to self-injury images. In fact, self-injuring participants showed comparable response inhibition to cutting images and positive images, whereas controls showed worse inhibition to cutting images compared to all other types of images. Consistent with the emotion regulation hypothesis of self-injury, people who self-injure showed impaired negative emotional response inhibition. Self-injuring individuals also demonstrated superior control over responses to stimuli related to self-injury, which may have important clinical implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study aimed to explore changes in heart rate variability (HRV), a proxy for parasympathetic activity characterizing emotion regulation processes before, during and after negative emotional induction in patients suffering from restrictive type anorexia nervosa (AN-RI). We compared two methods of HRV analysis, the Fast Fourier Transform high frequency (FFT-HF) and a specific HRV high frequency analysis technique, namely, the wavelet transform HRV (WT-HRV). A sample of 16 inpatients with AN-RI was compared to 24 control participants. Heart rate (HR) was continuously recorded for 5 min before the beginning of the video until 5 min after the video. The participants answered questionnaires concerning their eating behaviors, mood disorders and difficulties in emotion regulation. During the entire procedure, the FFT-HF in patients was lower than that in controls. Using the WT-HRV, the patients did not differ from the controls at baseline, and only the controls showed a decrease during emotional induction. After the video, the WT-HRV in patients began to decrease during the first 2 min of emotional recovery although the WT-HRV in controls was already increased. These results highlighted the disturbances in the physiological dynamics of emotion regulation processes in patients with AN-RT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social interaction skill is important for psychological wellbeing, stress regulation, protection from disability and overall life satisfaction. Increase in activity of the vagus nerve, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), is associated with social interaction skill and decreased stress. In this meta-analysis we collated statistics from thirteen studies consisting of 787 participants who were participating in social interactions while HRV was simultaneously collected. Results revealed that while dyadic social interactions do not increase HRV generally from a baseline state, negative dyadic social interactions decrease HRV in a manner similar to the Trier Social Stress Task. Further, participants with psychopathology do not show cardiac autonomic flexibility during social interactions as indicated by reductions under stress and increases with subsequently positive social interactions. The role of age, gender and HRV index were also examined as potential moderators of HRV. Implications for health and wellbeing resulting from exposure to negative social interactions are discussed.

AB Objective: To assess quality of life of adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the Netherlands and to identify domains and major problems influencing quality of life.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Subjects: Seventy-nine men aged >= 20 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
   Methods: The Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and an interview were used to assess quality of life and problems.
   Results: Compared with Dutch general population reference values, the SF-36 domains scores were lower on all domains except mental health and role limitations due to emotional problems. On the WHOQOL-BREF the social relationships domain score was lower. Main problems were intimate relationships, work, leisure, transport and meaningfulness of life. Seventy-three percent stated overall quality of life as "(very) good". The SF-36 domains mental health (r(s) 0.53, p<0.001) and vitality (r(s) 0.49, p<0.001) had the strongest associations with overall quality of life.
   Conclusion: Adult men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy assess their health status as low in the physical, but not in the mental, domains. Experienced problems are mainly in the area of participation. They are generally satisfied with their overall quality of life.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a cancer parenting program for child rearing mothers with breast cancer, the Enhancing Connections Program. Primary goals were to decrease maternal depressed mood and anxiety, improve parenting quality, parenting skills and confidence, and enhance the child's behavioral-emotional adjustment to maternal breast cancer. Method: A total of 176 mothers diagnosed within 6 months with Stage 0 to Stage III breast cancer and their 8- to 12-year-old child were recruited from medical providers in 6 states: Washington, California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Arizona, and Indiana. After consenting and obtaining baseline measures, study participants were randomized into experimental or control groups. Experimental mothers received 5, 1-hr educational counseling sessions at 2-week intervals; controls received a booklet and phone call on communicating and supporting their child about the mother's cancer. Outcomes were assessed at 2 and 12 months. Results: Compared to controls, at 2 months experimental mothers significantly improved on depressed mood and parenting skills; experimental children improved on behavioral-emotional adjustment: total behavior problems, externalizing problems, and anxiety/depressed mood significantly declined. At 1 year, experimental children remained significantly less depressed than controls on both mother-and child-reported measures. The intervention failed to significantly affect parenting self-efficacy or maternal anxiety. Conclusions: The Enhancing Connections Program benefitted mothers and children in specific areas and warrants refinement and further testing.

AB Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in adolescence, and is characterised by an inability to down-regulate negative emotional responses to stress. Adult studies suggest this may be associated with reduced functional connectivity between prefrontal and subcortical regions, yet the neurological mechanisms in adolescence remain unclear.
   Methods: We developed a novel, age-appropriate, reappraisal paradigm to investigate functional connectivity during reappraisal of a real-life source of stress in 15 depressed and 15 non-depressed adolescents. During fMRI, participants i) attended to, and ii) implemented reappraisal techniques (learnt prior to fMRI) in response to, rejection.
   Results: Reappraisal reduced negative mood and belief in negative thoughts in both groups alike, however during reappraisal (versus attend) trials, depressed adolescents showed greater connectivity between the right frontal pole and numerous subcortical and cortical regions than non-depressed adolescents.
   Conclusions: These findings tentatively suggest that, when instructed, depressed adolescents do have the ability to engage neural networks involved in emotion regulation, possibly because adolescence reflects a period of heightened plasticity. These data support the value of cognitive reappraisal as a treatment tool, identify neural markers that could be used to optimise current therapies, and lay the foundations for developing novel neuroscientific techniques for the treatment of adolescent depression.

AB Cataract was prospectively assessed by serial slip lamp tests in 271 patients included in the Leucemie Enfants Adolescents (LEA) programme, the French cohort of childhood leukaemia survivors. All had received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after total body irradiation (TBI, n=201) or busulfan-based (n=70) myeloablative conditioning regimen. TBI was fractionated in all but six patients. The mean duration of follow-up from HSCT was 103years. Cataract was observed in 113/271 patients (417%); 9/113 (81%) needed surgery. Cumulative incidence after TBI increased over time from 30% at 5years to 708% and 78% at 15 and 20years, respectively, without any plateau thereafter. The 15-year cumulative incidence was 125% in the Busulfan group. A higher cumulative steroid dose appeared to be a cofactor of TBI for cataract risk, in both univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. In the multivariate analysis, cataract had an impact in two quality of life domains: the role limitation due to physical problems' and the role limitation due to emotional problems'. These data suggest that with increasing follow-up, nearly all patients who receive TBI, even when fractionated, will suffer from cataract that can impact on their quality of life and that high cumulative steroid dose is a cofactor.

AB Loneliness has been linked cross-sectionally to emotional skill deficits (e.g., Zysberg, 2012), but missing from the literature is a longitudinal examination of these relationships. The present study fills that gap by examining the prospective relationships between loneliness and emotional functioning in young adolescents in England. One hundred and ninety-six adolescents aged 11-13 years (90 females) took part in the study and completed the youth version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT-YV) and the peer-related subscale of the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents (LACA) at two time points, which were 10 months apart. Prospective associations were obtained for male and female adolescents separately using cross-lagged statistical techniques. Our results showed prospective links between understanding and managing emotions and loneliness for both females and males. Perceiving and using emotions were prospectively linked to loneliness in males only. Possible explanations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Fear extinction learning is a highly adaptive process that involves the integrity of frontolimbic circuitry. Its disruption has been associated with emotional dysregulation in stress and anxiety disorders. In this article we consider how age, genetics and experiences shape our capacity to regulate fear in cross-species studies. Evidence for adolescent-specific diminished fear extinction learning is presented in the context of immature frontolimbic circuitry. We also present evidence for less neural plasticity in fear regulation as a function of early-life stress and by genotype, focusing on the common brain derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. Finally, we discuss this work in the context of exposure-based behavioral therapies for the treatment of anxiety and stress disorders that are based on principles of fear extinction. We conclude by speculating on how such therapies may be optimized for the individual based on the patient's age, genetic profile and personal history to move from standard treatment of care to personalized and precision medicine.

AB By current estimates, at any given time, approximately 11% to 20% of children in the United States have a behavioral or emotional disorder, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Between 37% and 39% of children will have a behavioral or emotional disorder diagnosed by 16 years of age, regardless of geographic location in the United States. Behavioral and emotional problems and concerns in children and adolescents are not being reliably identified or treated in the US health system. This clinical report focuses on the need to increase behavioral screening and offers potential changes in practice and the health system, as well as the research needed to accomplish this. This report also (1) reviews the prevalence of behavioral and emotional disorders, (2) describes factors affecting the emergence of behavioral and emotional problems, (3) articulates the current state of detection of these problems in pediatric primary care, (4) describes barriers to screening and means to overcome those barriers, and (5) discusses potential changes at a practice and systems level that are needed to facilitate successful behavioral and emotional screening. Highlighted and discussed are the many factors at the level of the pediatric practice, health system, and society contributing to these behavioral and emotional problems.

AB Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD). However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA). It is unclear, then, whether the heightened symptomology found in age-matched children with DD is beyond what would be expected given their developmental level. The present study assessed rates of behavior problems and mental disorder in 35 children with DD at age 9 years. These were compared with rates from 35 children with TD matched for CA at age 9 and also earlier rates for these same children at age 6, when matched for mental age (MA). Children with DD had significantly more behavior problems in 7 of the 17 scales of the CBCL when compared to TD children matched for CA, and 6 of 17 scales when compared to the MA-matched group. Rates of meeting DSM-IV criteria for a psychiatric disorder were significantly higher in the DD group than both the CA- and MA-matched TD groups for three and four, respectively, of the seven diagnoses examined. Descriptively, the mean ratings for all variables assessed were higher for the DD group than both TD comparison groups, with the exception of the Anxious/Depressed scale of the CBCL. These findings validate the heightened risk for clinically significant behavior problems and mental disorders in youth with DD above and beyond their developmental functioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Few longitudinal studies have examined the psychological symptoms that may lead to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among Chinese adolescents and young adults. This study determined the predictive effects of psychological symptoms for NSSI during a 9-month follow-up period.
   Data from 17,622 students, 12-24 years of age, were analyzed in a cross-sectional fashion with respect to associations between psychological symptoms and NSSI. Follow-up surveys were performed 3, 6, and 9 months later. Incident cases of NSSI during follow-up were correlated with the psychological symptoms at baseline.
   A total of 3,001 (17.0 %) students reported that they had NSSI in the 12 months before the initial assessment. The total rate of NSSI revealed no statistically significant differences by gender, but marked differences between grades. The response rate 3, 6, and 9 months later was 91.8, 81.8, and 79.1 %, respectively. Our cross-sectional study demonstrated statistically significant associations between emotional problems, conduct problems, social adaptation problems, psychological problems, and NSSI (P < 0.01). In the longitudinal study, emotional problems, conduct problems, social adaptation problems, and psychological problems at baseline had statistically significant associations with incident NSSI in follow-up involving the adolescents, while the association in young adults was attenuated after adjustment for confounding variables. Moreover, psychological symptoms at baseline showed a monotonic dose-response relationship with NSSI in follow-up involving adolescents.
   The findings suggest that adolescents with psychological symptoms are a group with elevated risks for later NSSI. The prevention programs of NSSI should target attenuating the severity of psychological symptoms.

AB The present study investigated anxiety disorder symptoms in Chinese preschool children. A total of 1,854 mothers of children aged 3-6 years completed the 28-item Chinese version of Spence Preschool Anxiety Scale (PAS). Results demonstrated that the structure of anxiety in Chinese preschool children included five factors, and this five-factor structure applied to different age and gender groups. Inconsistent with the study by Edwards et al. (J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol 39:400-409, 2010) suggesting that obsessive-compulsive disorder did not comprise an independent factor in Australian preschoolers, this symptom can be viewed as an independent factor in Chinese preschoolers. Younger children displayed higher anxiety levels than older children. Anxiety symptoms of Chinese preschoolers were found at a high level compared to other studies. Substantial differences were found with regard to the content of prevalent anxiety symptoms among Chinese and Australian preschool children. The applicability of the five-factor structure of PAS and research implications are discussed.

AB An ecological stress process model was employed to explore relations between children's exposures to family and community violence and child mental health, and emotionally-regulated coping (ERC) as a protective factor among Latino, European-American, and African-American school-aged children (n = 91; girls, n = 50[54 %]) living in single-parent families who were either homeless and residing in emergency shelters or housed but living in poverty. Mothers reported domestic violence experiences and their child's history of physical/sexual abuse, community violence exposures, and mental health. Children reported on exposure to community violence, internalizing symptoms, and coping. The mental health impacts of multi-level violence exposures and ERC as a moderator of associations between violence exposures and child mental health was tested with structural equation modeling. Family abuse was uniquely associated with PTSD, and community violence with anxiety and aggression. Latent interaction tests revealed that ERC moderated relations between family abuse and anxiety, aggression and PTSD. Emotionally-regulated coping appears to play a protective role for children's mental health in contexts of violence exposure, offering opportunities for intervention and prevention.

AB Although studies document an association between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and social problems, little is known about mediating or moderating mechanisms underlying this association. We examined whether, among youth, emotion dysregulation (ED) mediates the negative association between ADHD and social skills, and whether this mediational process is moderated by symptoms of depression. A total of 171 youth with ADHD (76 % male; Mage = 12.15, SD = 0.95) and their parents completed measures of ED, depression, and social skills. Results indicated that, after controlling for oppositional defiant disorder, the negative association between ADHD and social skills was mediated by ED. Further, this indirect effect was relevant for youth with non-clinical and subclinical levels of depression but not for those with clinical levels of depression. These findings underscore the importance of ED in the association between ADHD and social functioning among youth and suggest a need for additional research to understand how and when ED impacts such functioning.

AB Background In Western settings, migration is associated with psychological well-being, but studies inevitably focus on culturally distinct ethnic minorities, making it difficult to distinguish migration from cultural assimilation. Many children in Hong Kong, a developed non-Western setting, have migrant parents with the same Chinese ethnicity. This study examined the association of migration with the child's psychological well-being in Hong Kong.
   Methods Multivariable linear regression was used in Hong Kong's 'Children of 1997' Chinese birth cohort to examine the adjusted associations of migration (both parents Hong Kong born n=4285, both parents migrant n=1921, mother-only migrant n=462, father-only migrant n=1110) with a parent-reported Rutter score for child behaviour at similar to 7 (n=6294, 80% follow-up) and similar to 11 years (n=5598, 71% follow-up), self-reported Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory score at similar to 11 years (n=6937, 88% follow-up) and self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depressive symptom score at similar to 13 years (n=5797, 73% follow-up), adjusted for sex, highest parental education and occupation, household income, maternal and paternal age at birth, age of assessment and survey mode (PHQ-9 only).
   Results Migration was unrelated to the overall self-esteem or depressive symptoms, but both parents migrant was associated with better behaviour (lower Rutter scores) at similar to 7 years (beta-coefficient (beta) -1.07, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.66) and similar to 11 years (-0.89, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.45).
   Conclusions In a non-Western context, migration appeared to be protective for childhood behaviour.

AB Resilience can be defined as establishing equilibrium subsequent to disturbances to a system caused by significant adversity. When families experience adversity or transitions, multiple regulatory processes may be involved in establishing equilibrium, including adaptability, regulation of negative affect, and effective problem-solving skills. The authors' resilience-as-regulation perspective integrates insights about the regulation of individual development with processes that regulate family systems. This middle-range theory of family resilience focuses on regulatory processes across levels that are involved in adaptation: whole-family systems such as routines and sense of coherence; coregulation of dyads involving emotion regulation, structuring, and reciprocal influences between social partners; and individual self-regulation. Insights about resilience-as-regulation are then applied to family-strengthening interventions that are designed to promote adaptation to adversity. Unresolved issues are discussed in relation to resilience-as-regulation in families, in particular how risk exposure is assessed, interrelations among family regulatory mechanisms, and how families scaffold the development of children's resilience.

AB The current study used an influence model of personality and stress processes to examine the association between individual differences in trait self-control and daily stress exposure and reactivity in adolescent youth. A total of 129 adolescents (M-age=14.7 years, 59% female) completed individual difference measures of self-control, neuroticism, and measures of responses to stress. Participants then reported on daily stressful events, stress severity, mood, coping, and mindlessness (a predictor of acting on impulse) for 14 consecutive days. Self-control predicted less exposure to daily stress, less reactivity to daily stress, and more adaptive responses to stress. Specifically, adolescents with higher self-control experienced fewer daily stressors and reported lower stress severity, particularly when daily mindlessness was high. Second, adolescents with higher self-control reported less mindlessness in response to daily stress relative to those with lower self-control, but they did not show differences in emotional reactivity to stress. Finally, results also offered evidence for an indirect effect of problem-focused coping strategies between self-control and emotional reactivity to stress. The current investigation illustrates the importance of trait self-control in daily stress processes among adolescents and suggests possible mechanisms through which self-control confers these positive effects.

AB Children's sleep problems are common and associated with increased risk for adjustment problems. We examined daily links between children's sleep and mood, using a daily diary method and actigraphy. We also tested children's daily mood as a mediator of relations among sleep and children's broader internalizing and externalizing symptoms. A community sample of 142 children (mean age=10.69years; 57% girls; 69% European American, 31% African American) and their parents participated. For 1week, children wore actigraphs and parents completed a daily telephone interview about their child's mood. Following the week of actigraphy, mothers and fathers reported on their child's adjustment. Multi-level models indicated within-person relations between children's mood and subsequent sleep fragmentation (indicated by increased activity) and sleep latency, and between-person relations between sleep latency and subsequent mood on the next day. Significant indirect effects were found such that a more negative daily mood (aggregated across diary days) mediated relations between poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Findings extend previous research by highlighting disruptions to children's daily mood as a potential mechanism linking sleep problems to children's mental health.

AB Despite the growing body of research linking sleep problems and social ties, research investigating the direction of effects between these two constructs is lacking. Furthermore, there remains a dearth of research examining the mechanisms that may explain the association between sleep problems and social ties within a longitudinal design. The present 3-year longitudinal study addressed two research questions: (1) Is there a bidirectional association between sleep problems and social ties at university? and (2) Does emotion regulation mediate the association between sleep problems and social ties at university? Participants (N = 942, 71.5 % female; M = 19.01 years at Time 1, SD = 0.90) were university students who completed annual assessments of sleep problems, social ties, and emotion regulation, for three consecutive years. Results of path analysis indicated that the bidirectional association between sleep problems and social ties was statistically significant (controlling for demographics, sleep-wake inconsistency, sleep duration, and alcohol). Analyses of indirect effects indicated that emotion regulation mediated this link, such that better sleep quality (i.e., less sleep problems) led to more effective emotion regulation, which, subsequently, led to more positive social ties. In addition, more positive social ties led to more effective emotion regulation, which, in turn, led to less sleep problems. The findings highlight the critical role that emotional regulation plays in the link between sleep problems and social ties, and emphasize the need for students as well as university administration to pay close attention to both the sleep and social environment of university students.

AB Objective: Research shows great individual variation in changes in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) after major traumas of terrorist attacks, military combat, and natural disasters. Earlier studies have identified specific mental health trajectories both in children and adults. This study aimed, first, to identify potential PTSS-related trajectories by using latent class growth analyses among children in a three-wave assessment after the 2008/2009 War on Gaza, Palestine. Second, it analyzed how family- and child related factors (e.g., attachment relations, posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), guilt, and emotion regulation) associate with the trajectory class membership.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 240 Palestinian children (49.4% girls and 50.6% boys) of 10-13 years of age (M-11.29. SD-0.68), who completed PTSS (CRIES) assessments at 3 (T1), 5 (T2), and 11 (T3) months after the war. Children reported their personal exposure to war trauma, attachment style, cognitive trauma processing, and emotion regulation, and their parents reported family war trauma exposure and attachment style.
   Results: Results revealed a three-trajectory solution, a majority of children belonging to the Recovery trajectory (n=183), and a minority belonged either to Resistant trajectory (n=29) or to Increasing symptoms trajectory (n=28). Low levels of negative posttraumatic cognitive appraisals, feelings of guilt and emotion regulation were characteristic of children in the Resistant trajectory as compared to Increasing symptoms trajectory. Father's attachment security was further associated with the Resistant trajectory membership. Children's attachment avoidance and high parental trauma were typical to children in Recovery trajectory (as compared to the Increasing symptoms trajectory). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Emotion dysregulation is not a formal criterion for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and meltdowns). In this study, 21 high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group-matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age-appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long-term outcomes in youth with ASD.

AB Examining factors that support resilience is critical to ameliorating the impact of child maltreatment. This paper evaluated existing evidence for the effects of "Eastern Arts'' (i.e., meditation, yoga, tai chi, qigong) on resilience (i.e., positive health and socioeconomic outcomes) among maltreated youth. Using a scoping review framework as outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8:19-32, 2005), we searched through five peer-reviewed databases, limiting the search to English-language articles, with no limit on time frame of publication. We then used pre-specified six-point inclusion/exclusion criteria to select journal articles for review. The initial literature search returned 330 articles, eight of which met the criteria and were selected for further review. All but one of the studies showed some improvement in the targeted dependent variable for the Eastern Arts intervention group versus the control group/pre-post intervention. Though the number of articles examining Eastern Arts interventions is extremely limited, the majority of studies included in this review showed an improvement in the targeted health outcome. Given the strong theoretical background, positive (though limited) research outcomes, and minimal side effects, further examination of the Eastern Arts for supporting resilience among maltreated youth, and use in the child welfare context, is warranted.

AB Dropout from child and adolescent psychotherapy is a common phenomenon which can have negative consequences for the individual later in life. It is therefore important to gain insight on dropout risk factors.
   Several potential risk factors [ethnic minority status, a lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher problem severity] were analyzed in present study. Innovations are that these risk factors were examined for children and adolescents separately, and a distinction was made in termination status between referred patients, dropouts and completers.
   For ethnic majority and minority outpatient children (age 5-11, n = 399) and adolescents (age 12-20, n = 352) problem severity, ethnic background, SES, and treatment termination status (completer, dropout, referral) were specified. Multinomial logistic regression models were used as main method of analysis.
   For children, a Moroccan/Turkish ethnicity and higher externalizing scores were risk factors for being referred. For adolescents, a Surinamese/Antillean ethnicity, being female, being older, and lower parental SES occupation levels were risk factors for dropout.
   Different dropout risk profiles emerged for children versus adolescents, and for dropouts versus referrals. Also, it depended on the specific ethnic background whether ethnic minority status was a predictor for dropout, and the relationship between SES and termination status differed by whether parental SES occupation or parental SES education were used as SES indicator. Professionals should thus be aware of these potential risk factors for dropout or referral when treating children and adolescents.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the physical similarity of avatars with the user on emotion regulation strategy training. In this study twenty-four teenagers observed an avatar (either physically similar to the participant or neutral) that gets frustrated with his/her computer, after which he/she applies an emotion regulation strategy (slow breathing). The intensity of the emotional induction and regulation processes was measured using questionnaires and electroencephalogram data. The results show that observing an avatar that is physically similar to the participant has a significantly greater impact on emotional valence and arousal in participants and also induces emotional states that are significantly more intense than when observing a neutral avatar. The results seem to indicate significantly greater activation of specific brain regions that are related to these processes and greater identification with the avatar in terms of both subjective and objective measures in participants that observed an avatar that was physically similar to them. However, there were no significant differences in the sense of presence or the appeal (i.e., satisfaction) to participants regarding the virtual environment. The use of avatars in mental health applications is relatively new and its specific influence is still unknown. We consider this study to be a first step forward in better understanding the use of avatars in mental health applications for youth. This research brings new guidelines to the design of different types of applications in this field in order to achieve greater behavioral changes in youth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundPrenatal maternal depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms have been found to be associated with child and adolescent behavior problems. In this paper, we investigate their impact on behavior problems and depressive symptoms in adulthood.
   MethodsParticipants included 3,099 mother-offspring pairs from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), an Australian based, prebirth cohort study. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) with parallel processes to identify trajectories of maternal depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms over four time periods between the mothers' first clinic visit and 5 years postpregnancy. We fitted the estimates from the maternal trajectories in multivariate logistic regression models to predict internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 21. We adjusted for a wide range of prenatal and postnatal factors, including maternal life events, relationship quality, contact with the new born, as well as concurrent maternal depressive and anxious symptoms and father's history of mental health problem.
   ResultsLCGA found seven groups of mothers; one group of mothers exhibited high levels of depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms during pregnancy but not at later time points. Their offspring experienced increased levels of behavior problems and depressive symptoms.
   ConclusionsThis paper provides the first evidence that high levels of maternal subjective depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms experienced in early pregnancy may predict internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and depressive symptoms in young adults.

AB Early-life stress increases the prevalence of psychiatric diseases associated with emotional dysregulation. Emotional regulation requires the inhibitory influence of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on amygdalar activity, and dysfunction of this system is believed to induce anxiety. Because mPFC and amygdala have dense reciprocal connections and projections between them continue to develop until adolescence, early-life stress may impair the function of this circuit and cause emotional dysregulation. We examined the effects of stress during circuit development on anxiety-like behaviors, neural activities in the mPFC and amygdala, and impulse transmission in the mPFC-amygdala circuit in adult rats. Early-life stress, unpredictable stress twice a day for 12days following early weaning, increased anxiety-like behaviors in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests. In the open-field test, stress altered Fos expression in the mPFC and amygdala. Compared to non-stressed rats, which were exposed to neither unpredictable stress nor early weaning, stressed rats exhibited decreased Fos expression in the right superficial layers of the infralimbic cortex and increased Fos expression in the right basolateral amygdala and both sides of the central amygdala. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that excitatory latencies of mPFC neurons to amygdalar stimulation in stressed rats were significantly longer than control rats in the right, but not left, hemisphere. Stress had no effect on excitatory latencies of amygdalar neurons to mPFC stimulation in the mPFC-amygdala circuits in the both hemisphere. These data suggest that early-life stress impairs the mPFC-amygdala circuit development, resulting in imbalanced mPFC and amygdala activities and anxiety-like behaviors.

AB Youth under 25 show substantial sexual and substance use risk behaviors. One factor associated with risk behaviors is delay discounting, the devaluation of delayed outcomes. This study determined if delay discounting for sexual outcomes is related to sexual risk and substance use among 18-24 year olds. Females (70) and males (56) completed the Sexual Discounting Task, which assessed their likelihood of having unprotected immediate sex versus waiting for sex with a condom, at various delays, with 4 hypothetical sexual partners selected from photographs: the person they most wanted to have sex with, least wanted to have sex with, judged most likely to have a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and judged least likely to have an STI. They also completed instruments assessing HIV knowledge, sexual behaviors, substance use, risk attitudes, inhibition, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking. Condom use likelihood generally decreased with increasing delay. Preference for immediate, unprotected sex was greater for partners whom participants most (vs. least) wanted to have sex with and judged least (vs. most) likely to have an STI. Preference for immediate, unprotected sex in the "most want to have sex with" and "least likely to have an STI" conditions was related to greater lifetime risky sexual partners, lifetime number of unique substances used, disregard of social approval/danger, disinhibition, and sensation/excitement-seeking. Males showed greater likelihood of unprotected sex than females when condom use was undelayed, but delay similarly affected condom use between sexes. Delay discounting should be considered in strategies to minimize youth risk behavior.

AB Background: Attachment theory has been conceptualised as an emotion regulation theory. Research attributes the occurrence of depressive symptoms to a dysfunction of emotion regulation. Anxious attachment and avoidant attachment, which are two dimensions of insecure attachment, are hypothesised to lead to the development or hyperactivating and deactivating emotion regulation strategies.
   Methods: This systematic review examines the literature On the role of emotion regulation and its relationship with attachment and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, we examined evidence for hyperactivating and deactivating strategies.
   Results: Nineteen papers were identified. Adolescent studies demonstrated associations of varying strength and found unreliable and contradictory results for emotion regulation as a mediator. Conversely, adult studies provided strong evidence for emotion regulation as a mediator. The hypothesis that hyperactivating strategies mediate anxious attachment and depressive symptoms was consistently supported. Mixed evidence was provided for deactivating strategies as mediators to avoidant attachment and depressive symptomatology.
   Limitations: Limitations of methodology and quality of studies are identified with particular attention drawn to problems with conceptual singularity and multicollinearity.
   Conclusions: Despite mixed variable findings, this review indicates that emotion regulation is a mediator between attachment and depression. Hyperactivating strategies, in particular, have been consistently noted as mediators for anxious attachment and depressive symptomatology, whereas evidence for deactivating strategies as mediators between avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms has been mixed. Future research should test the mediators of attachment and symptoms and examine theoretically grounded models of psychopathology, such as metacognitive and cognitive models using clinical samples.

AB Recently, research studies and media have reported on the detrimental effects violent video games have on the social behaviors of adolescents. For example, previous studies have found that playing video games is positively associated with aggressive behaviors and negatively associated with prosocial behaviors. However, very few studies have examined the mediating effects of personal characteristics between students playing video games and their social behaviors. Thus, using a sample of 1,242 seventh, eighth, and ninth grade Korean students, the authors aimed to determine how playing video games is related to aggressive and prosocial behaviors and whether the emotional competencies of adolescents, such as empathy, emotional regulation, and behavioral self-control, mediate this relationship. The results indicated that violent video games have a significant direct effect on aggressive behaviors, and a significant indirect effect on prosocial behaviors. Specifically, empathy and behavioral self-control were found to mediate the relation between playing violent video games and prosocial behaviors. These results suggest different prevention and intervention approaches to reduce aggressive behaviors and increase prosocial behaviors in students exposed to violent video games. The limitations and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) adopts a dimensional approach for examining pathophysiological processes underlying categorically defined psychiatric diagnoses. We used this framework to examine relationships among symptom dimensions, diagnostic categories, and resting state connectivity in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth selected from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms study (n=42) and healthy control youth (n=18). Region of interest analyses examined relationships among resting state connectivity, symptom dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M]; dimensional severity measures of mania, depression, anxiety), and diagnostic categories (Bipolar Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Disruptive Behavior Disorders). After adjusting for demographic variables, two dimensional measures showed significant inverse relationships with resting state connectivity, regardless of diagnosis: 1) PGBI-10M with amygdala-left posterior insula/bilateral putamen: and 2) depressive symptoms with amygdala-right posterior insula connectivity. Diagnostic categories showed no significant relationships with resting state connectivity. Resting state connectivity between amygdala and posterior insula decreased with increasing severity of behavioral and emotional dysregulation and depression; this suggests an intrinsic functional uncoupling of key neural regions supporting emotion processing and regulation. These findings support the RDoC dimensional approach for characterizing pathophysiologic processes that cut across different psychiatric disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence for the longitudinal associations between internalising symptom development and academic attainment is sparse and results from existing studies are largely inconclusive. The approaches that have been used in existing studies examining this relationship have in common the limitation of grouping together all individuals in the sample which makes the assumption that the relationship between time, symptoms and attainment across all individuals is the same. The current study aimed to use heterogeneous trajectories of symptom development to examine the longitudinal associations between internalising symptom development and change in academic attainment over a three years period in early adolescence, a key period for internalising symptom development. Internalising symptoms were assessed for 3 consecutive years in a cohort from age 11-14 years (n = 2647, mean age at T1 = 11.7 years). National standardised test scores prior to the first wave and subsequent to the last wave were used as measures of academic attainment. Heterogeneous symptom development trajectories were identified using latent class growth analysis and socio-demographic correlates, such as gender, SES and ethnicity, of the different trajectory groupings were investigated. Derived trajectory groupings were examined as predictors of subsequent academic attainment, controlling for prior attainment. Results demonstrate that symptom trajectories differentially predicted change in academic attainment with increasing trajectories associated with significantly worse academic outcomes when compared to pupils with low levels of symptoms in all waves. Hence, a trajectory based approach provides a more nuanced breakdown of complexities in symptom development and their differential relationships with academic outcomes and in doing so helps clarify the longitudinal relationship between these two key domains of functioning in early adolescence.

AB Background: Research on homeless youth has shown that this population is at high risk for various mental health problems. Previous studies conducted among homeless young adults in Ghana have focused primarily on economic, social and cultural causes of homelessness, their engagement in risky sexual behaviours and the prevalence of STI including HIV/AIDS. We are therefore not fully informed of the prevalence of psychological symptoms and their associated factors. The aim of the study was to determine the association between psychological functioning and social and health risk behaviours among a sample of homeless youth in Ghana.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 227 (122 male and 105 female) homeless youth was conducted in Ghana in 2013. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data due to low level of literacy among the study population. Pearson-moment correlation coefficient (r) and multiple standard regression models were fitted to analyse the data.
   Results: Approximately 87% of the participants in this study exhibited moderate to severe psychosocial symptoms. Specifically, emotional, conduct, hyperactivity and peer relationship problems among the participants were 69%, 74%, 54% and 89% respectively. Overall psychosocial functioning was predicted by stigma (self-stigma and experienced stigma), violent behaviours and suicidal ideation. Substance use and perceived resilience were significantly associated with emotional problems.
   Conclusion: There is a need for holistic interventions to help improve the psychological and social functioning of homeless youth. Such programmes should strengthen socio-emotional coping strategies in street youth as well as address contextual risk factors such as stigma and discrimination by the public.

AB Boys with sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA) represent an understudied group. We examined parent-reported physical and socio-emotional problems in 25 boys with SCA (Mean age = 11.7 years, SD = 4.5). The majority had no severe physical health problems. One third of the sample had sleep problems and half of them had weekly or monthly pain. Total emotional and behavior problems, as assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, were at the same level as reported for boys referred to child mental health clinics. Thus, boys with SCA may have the same need for psychological assessment and intervention as clinic-referred boys.

AB The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies mediates the relationship between daily hassles and depression in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression. A total of 175 university students with cognitive vulnerability to depression were recruited (weakest-link approach to identify the participants with cognitive vulnerability from 1017 university students) and 842 individuals with no cognitive vulnerability completed questionnaires measuring cognitive emotion regulation strategies (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and daily hassles (General Social and Academic Hassles Scale for Students). Results using structural equation modeling showed that the total scores of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies partially mediated the relationship between daily hassles and depression in the sample of individuals with cognitive vulnerability but not in the sample of individuals with no cognitive vulnerability. Moreover, in the sample of individuals with cognitive vulnerability, the catastrophizing of the maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategy partially mediated the relationship between daily hassles and depression. In contrast, the others of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies did not mediate the influence of daily hassles on depression.

AB The purpose of this study was to review the current evidence base of psychosocial treatments for suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in youth. We reviewed major scientific databases (HealthSTAR, MEDLine, PsycINFO, PubMed) for relevant studies published prior to June 2013. The search identified 29 studies examining interventions for suicidal or nonsuicidal SITBs in children or adolescents. No interventions currently meet the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology standards for Level 1: well-established treatments. Six treatment categories were classified as Level 2: probably efficacious or Level 3: possibly efficacious for reducing SITBs in youth. These treatments came from a variety of theoretical orientations, including cognitive-behavioral, family, interpersonal, and psychodynamic theories. Common elements across efficacious treatments included family skills training (e.g., family communication and problem solving), parent education and training (e.g., monitoring and contingency management), and individual skills training (e.g., emotion regulation and problem solving). Several treatments have shown potential promise for reducing SITBs in children and adolescents. However, the probably/possibly efficacious treatments identified each have evidence from only a single randomized controlled trial. Future research should focus on replicating studies of promising treatments, identifying active treatment ingredients, examining mediators and moderators of treatment effects, and developing brief interventions for high-risk periods (e.g., following hospital discharge).

AB Numerous studies have reported substantive correlations between indicators of parenting, children's emotion regulation (ER), and children's psychosocial adjustment. However, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Particularly in early adolescence, it is still unclear whether relations between parenting and ER are caused by adolescent behavior, by parent behavior, or by reciprocal processes. Moreover, it is unclear whether ER can be seen as an antecedent or a consequence of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine predictive relations among parenting and adolescents' ER, and adolescents' ER and psychosocial adjustment, respectively. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant data at two measurement occasions (Grade 6, Grade 7). All told, 1,100 adolescents (10-14 years) and their parents filled out questionnaires assessing responsiveness and psychological control, adolescents' anger regulation, and adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior. Cross-lagged analyses revealed reciprocal effects between parenting, ER, and adjustment for the parent and boys', but not for the girls', report. Moreover, relations were different for adolescents with versus without clinically elevated symptoms of psychopathology. Our findings support the assumption that reciprocal relations between parenting, ER, and psychosocial adjustment are likely to persist until early adolescence. Nevertheless, the moderating role of gender and psychopathology should be taken into account. Possible reasons for the different findings, and practical implications, are discussed.

AB ABSTRACT. Although body dissatisfaction is recognized as the strongest risk factor for eating disturbances, a majority of young males are body dissatisfied, but do not concomitantly report severe levels of eating disorder symptomatology. The present investigation was designed to examine five theoretically relevant variables (i.e., body checking, emotional dysregulation, perfectionism, insecure-anxious attachment, and self-esteem) as potential moderators of the relationship between body dissatisfaction and two critical components of male eating disorder symptomatology: drive for muscularity and bulimic behaviors. Data collected from 551 Italian males between 18 and 28years old were analyzed using latent structural equation modeling. The authors found that emotional dysregulation, body checking, insecure-anxious attachment and perfectionism intensified the relationship between body dissatisfaction and each criterion variable representing male eating disorder symptomatology; the interactions accounted respectively for an additional 2%, 7%, 4% and 5% of variance in drive for muscularity and for an additional 6%, 4%, 5%, and 2% of the variance in bulimic behaviors. By contrast self-esteem weakened this relationship and the interactions accounted for an additional 3% of the variance in both drive for muscularity and bulimic behaviors. Implications of these findings for prevention and treatment of male eating disturbances are discussed.

AB Background: A more comprehensive understanding of factors that affect smoking cessation outcomes among adolescents may help enhance treatment interventions. One promising but underexplored factor that may influence cessation success is teens' specific expectancies or beliefs about smoking outcomes. The present study evaluated the validity and reliability of a new measure of expectancies and its association with cessation outcomes among 762 adolescent smokers participating in studies of the American Lung Association's Not On Tobacco cessation program. Methods: Self-report questionnaires were collected prior to and following participation in a smoking cessation program. Self-reported cigarette use was verified with expired-air carbon monoxide. A multistep exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and reliability and validity analyses were performed. Results: Four theoretically related yet empirically independent factors were identified by the Smoking Expectancies Questionnaire (SEQ): (1) Positive Reinforcement, (2) Negative Reinforcement-Emotional Regulation, (3) Negative Reinforcement-Addiction and Withdrawal, and (4) Negative Outcomes/Risk. These factors could be subsumed by a single SEQ factor that reflected an overall concept of smoking expectancies relevant for adolescent smoking cessation. An overall SEQ Function score reflecting the balance between positive and negative expectancies predicted both preintervention cigarettes per day and cessation outcomes. Conclusions: A single, overall SEQ Function score may prove useful for understanding the associations among individual, social, and contextual factors in predicting treatment outcomes. Additionally, study findings may assist with modifying smoking expectancies among cessation program participants, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes with diverse youth smoking populations.

AB Background: Psychotherapy for youth with mood dysregulation can help stabilize mood and improve functioning, but the neural mechanisms of this improvement are not known. In this study we investigated the changes in brain activation underlying improvement in mood symptoms.
   Methods: Twenty-four subjects (ages 13-17) participated: 12 patients with clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or mania, and 12 healthy comparison subjects (HC) matched for age and sex. All subjects completed functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing facial expressions. The patients then received up to 4 months of psychotherapy and were rescanned at end of treatment. Whole brain differences between patient and control groups were assessed with a voxel-wise analysis. Changes in activation from pre- to post-treatment within the patient group were tested for correlation with changes in mood symptoms.
   Results: At baseline the patient group had hypoactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hyper-activation in the posterior cingulate cortex compared to the HC group. Between pre- and post-treatment activation increased in the DLPFC and decreased in the amygdala. Increases in DLPFC activation were significantly correlated with improvement in mania symptoms.
   Discussion: Enhancement of frontal executive control brain regions may underlie improvement in mood dysregulation in pediatric patients at familial risk for bipolar disorder. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to effectively control feelings of disgust is an adaptive skill in childhood that would appear to be associated with the prevention of disgust-related mental disorders. A total of 162 children (71 boys, 91 girls) aged between 10 and 13 participated in a disgust regulation experiment, during which they were presented with disgust-evoking and neutral images. The children were assigned to one of two regulation groups. They were asked to either reinterpret the meaning of the disgust stimuli (reappraisal) or to show typical facial and vocal disgust expressions (expression/venting). Reappraisal was an effective method to reduce self-reported disgust for boys and girls. The personality trait disgust sensitivity (the tendency to experience one's own feelings of disgust as aversive and uncontrollable) negatively correlated with regulation success during reappraisal. This effect, however, was only found in female subjects. The expression of disgust did not change disgust ratings in either of the two gender groupings. The findings demonstrate that reappraisal was a helpful regulation strategy for most children with the exception of disgust-sensitive females. Future studies should focus on this group to see if adapted reappraisal methods or alternative regulation strategies are more effective.

AB Child maltreatment increases the risk for psychiatric disorders throughout childhood and into adulthood. One negative outcome of child maltreatment can be a disorder of emotional functioning, reactive attachment disorder (RAD), where the child displays wary, watchful, and emotionally withdrawn behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, little is known about the potential neurobiological consequences of RAD. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether RAD was associated with alterations in grey matter volume (GMV). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging datasets were obtained for children and adolescents with RAD (n = 21; mean age = 12.76 years) and typically developing (TD) control subjects (n = 22; mean age = 12.95 years). Using awhole-brain voxel-based morphometry approach, structural images were analysed controlling for age, gender, full scale intelligence quotient, and total brain volume. The GMVwas significantly reduced by 20.6% in the left primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) of the RAD group compared to the TDgroup (p = .038, family-wise error-corrected cluster level). This GMV reduction was related to an internalising problem measure of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. The visual cortex has been viewed as part of the neurocircuit regulating the stress response to emotional visual images. Combinedwith previous studies of adultswith childhood maltreatment, early adverse experience (e.g. sensory deprivation) may affect the development of the primary visual system, reflecting in the size of the visual cortex in children and adolescents with RAD. These visual cortex GMV abnormalities may also be associated with the visual emotion regulation impairments of RAD, leading to an increased risk for later psychopathology. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Background: There are suggestions that patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show impairment in executive attention control and emotion regulation. This study investigated emotion regulation as a function of the recruitment of executive attention in patients with ADHD.
   Methods: Thirty-five healthy children/adolescents (mean age = 13.91) and twenty-six children/adolescents with ADHD (mean age = 14.53) participated in this fMRI study. They completed the affective Stroop paradigm viewing positive, neutral and negative images under varying cognitive loads. A 3-way ANOVA (diagnosis-by-condition-by-emotion) was conducted on the BOLD response data. Following this, 2 3-way ANOVAs (diagnosis-by-condition-by-emotion) were applied to context-dependent psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses generated from a dorsomedial frontal cortex and an amygdala seed (identified from the BOLD response ANOVA main effects of condition and emotion respectively).
   Results: A diagnosis-by-condition interaction within dorsomedial frontal cortex revealed reduced recruitment of dorsomedial frontal cortex as a function of increased task demands in the children/adolescents with ADHD relative to healthy children/adolescents. The level of reduction in recruitment of dorsomedial frontal cortex was significantly correlated with symptom severity (total and hyperactivity) measured by Conner's Parent Report Scale in the children/adolescents with ADHD. In addition, analysis of gPPI data from a dorsomedial frontal cortex seed revealed significant diagnosis-by-condition interactions within lateral frontal cortex; connectivity between dorsomedial frontal cortex and lateral frontal cortex was reduced in the patients with ADHD relative to comparison youth during congruent and incongruent task trials relative to view trials. There were no interactions of group, or main effect of group, within the amygdala in the BOLD response ANOVA (though children/adolescents with ADHD showed increased responses to positive images within temporal cortical regions during task trials; identified by the diagnosis-by-condition-by-emotion interaction). However, analysis of gPPI data from an amygdala seed revealed decreased connectivity between amygdala and lentiform nucleus in the presence of emotional stimuli in children/adolescents with ADHD (diagnosis-by-emotion interaction).
   Conclusion: The current study demonstrated disrupted recruitment of regions implicated in executive function and impaired connectivity within those regions in children/adolescents with ADHD. There were also indications of heightened representation of emotional stimuli in patients with ADHD. However, as the findings were specific for positive stimuli, the suggestion of a general failure in emotion regulation in ADHD was not supported. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: Previous studies have reported changes in gray matter volume in youths with conduct disorder (CD), although these differences are difficult to interpret as they may have been driven by alterations in cortical thickness, surface area (SA), or folding. The objective of this study was to use surface-based morphometry (SBM) methods to compare male youths with CD and age and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) in cortical thickness, SA, and folding. We also tested for structural differences between the childhood-onset and adolescence-onset subtypes of CD and performed regression analyses to assess for relationships between CD symptoms and callous-unemotional (CU) traits and SBM-derived measures.
   Methods: We acquired structural neuroimaging data from 20 HCs and 36 CD participants (18 with childhood-onset CD and 18 with adolescence-onset CD) and analyzed the data using FreeSurfer.
   Results: Relative to HCs, youths with CD showed reduced cortical thickness in the superior temporal gyrus, reduced SA in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and increased cortical folding in the insula. There were no significant differences between the childhood-onset and adolescence-onset CD subgroups in cortical thickness or SA, but several frontal and temporal regions showed increased cortical folding in childhood-onset relative to adolescence-onset CD participants. Both CD subgroups also showed increased cortical folding relative to HCs. CD symptoms were negatively correlated with OFC SA whereas CU traits were positively correlated with insula folding.
   Conclusions: Cortical thinning in the superior temporal gyrus may contribute to the social cognitive impairments displayed by youths with CD, whereas reduced OFC SA may lead to impairments in emotion regulation and reward processing in youths with CD. The increased cortical folding observed in the insula may reflect a maturational delay in this region and could mediate the link between CU traits and empathy deficits. Altered cortical folding was observed in childhood-onset and adolescence-onset forms of CD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impairment in social communication and presence of stereotyped/restricted behaviors. Children with ASD very often demonstrate co-morbid psychiatric problems, problems known to be affected by testosterone in neurotypical populations. However, there are few reports investigating relationships between testosterone and psychiatric conditions in children with ASD. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between plasmatic levels of testosterone and behavioral/emotional problems in pre-pubertal boys with ASD. The study sample consisted of 31 pre-pubertal boys (ages 3-10) with ASD. Parents completed the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF) to assess specific behavioral/emotional problems as observed in the previous 2 months. Plasmatic testosterone levels were determined in boys according to standardized procedures. It was found that there were positive correlations between testosterone levels and the conduct problems subscale (p=0.034, rs=0.382) of NCBRF and also between testosterone levels and the hyperactive subscale (p=0.025, rs=0.402) of NCBRF. Findings in this study are in line with research conducted in the neurotypical population. This is the first large study investigating testosterone and emotional/behavioral problems in ASD and warrants further research in this field in order to clarify the etiopathogenesis of psychiatric co-morbidities and improve their treatment.

TI ALTERED PAIN PERCEPTION IN SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR AND THE ASSOCIATION

AB Background: The pathophysiology of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is controversial. There is growing evidence of altered pain perception in people engaging in NSSI. Some hypotheses have been made on addictive aspects of this behavior. Pain and addictive behavior are modulated by the opioid system, which makes the endogenous opioids one of the candidate neurotransmitters related to NSSI. This article explains the theoretical background on NSSI as an addictive behavior, endogenous opioids involvement and pain perception changes in NSSI and updates the latest findings in this field. The main aim of this paper is a comprehensive review of published studies on pain perception in NSSI and an evaluation of the impact of NSSI functions and other psychological elements on pain perception measures.
   Subjects and methods: We have reviewed six studies of pain perception in participants with NSSI compared with controls. The participants of these studies were not mentally disabled or autistic and did not have a diagnosed personality disorder.
   Results: The reviewed studies have demonstrated a higher pain threshold and longer pain tolerance or endurance in five of six studies. Emotional dysregulation was significantly associated with all pain perception variables in one study. Neuroticism, self-criticism and painful and provocative experiences revealed correlated with pain endurance or pain tolerance. No correlation between pain perception measures and dissociation, hopelessness or locus of control was found.
   Conclusions: Pain perception was altered in participants with NSSI. Pain perception was associated to emotional dysregulation, self-criticism, neuroticism and painful and provocative experiences. Because of the small number of studies reviewed, results should be seen as guidelines for further studies. They should be replicated on a bigger sample of studies. Further research should focus on pain perception measures in participants with NSSI and an excluded personality disorder.

AB This study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief parent-based prevention intervention to delay or prevent the initiation of alcohol and drug use in young adolescents with emotional/behavioral disorders. Findings from a small randomized clinical trial comparing the individualized family substance use preventive intervention based on the Family Check-Up model (FCU condition) to a Psychoeducation (PE) session revealed that parents in both conditions reported an increase in alcohol-related communication at three and six months as well as an increase in general family communication. Parents in the FCU condition reported an increase on overall substance-related communication, and reported experiencing less problematic family communication compared to those in PE. Parents in the PE condition reported greater increases in parental monitoring than parents in the FCU condition. Study findings suggest a larger trial is indicated to test individual and family factors that lead to differential efficacy of these preventive interventions.

AB Machiavellianism is a well-studied topic in several branches of psychology. Still, it has received little attention from a developmental perspective. Previous retrospective studies linked Machiavellianism to poor parental care, but actual reports of adolescents who live in their family of origin have been ignored so far. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between Machiavellianism and parental attachment in adolescence and possible sex differences based on life history theory. An adolescent sample (N = 376; 17.27 +/- .77 years of age) completed the Mach-IV and the maternal and paternal versions of revised Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA-R). According to our results, significant sex differences emerged in the relationship between Machiavellianism and attachment to parents. For girls, maternal alienation proved to be the only significant predictor of Machiavellianism, whereas for boys, low intensity and quality of verbal communication with father predicted higher levels of Machiavellianism. Results are discussed from an evolutionary perspective of socialization and from the perspective of emotion regulation.

AB Various studies have reported a huge increase in the numbers of orphaned adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa and its effects on their psychological, emotional and behavioural development. Yet, their needs are seldom recognised or adequately addressed in policy and programmes. This article uses a qualitative study to report the experiences of 11 orphaned adolescents (5 boys and 6 girls aged between 15 and 18 years) affected by HIV and AIDS in a secondary school (in Atteridgeville, Pretoria, South Africa) and the school support provided by them. The primary data-generation strategies were informal interviews and the Beck Youth Inventories-II (BYI-II) (adopted to measure the participants' level of emotional, behavioural and psychological problems). All interview transcriptions with the participants were thematically analysed. BYI-II data were subjected to T scores (in percentages) to know the participant's psychological, behavioural and emotional problems in order to compare it with their perceptions on the degree of support provided by the school. Result shows that participants have a high prevalence of psychological, behavioural and emotional problems and that the school support provided to them (teachers' support, the general school environment and the degree of discrimination, labelling and bullying that exists in the school) was not sufficient. The participants, however, reported a high level of support from the principal. In conclusion, we have suggested the urgent need for teachers to acquire and possess basic knowledge and skills in caring and paying attention to learners affected by HIV and AIDS and for government agencies and NGOs working with HIV-and AIDS-affected children, to focus on proposals that address the psychological, behavioural and emotional problems in such affected adolescents.

AB Youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are at increased risk for developing significant co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Although prevalence estimates vary, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are among the most common comorbid conditions. There has been increased interest in the assessment and treatment of these symptoms in youth with ASD, with the majority of studies thus far focusing on anxiety disorders. The present paper reviews the literature on the most common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in youth with ASD and discusses current trends in intervention for these disorders. Given the numerous challenges involved in the identification of psychiatric conditions in youth with ASD, general guidelines for the assessment of psychiatric symptoms in youth with ASD will be provided. Information regarding the prevalence and specific assessment strategies for each mental health condition precedes a review of intervention programs. Although not specific to a single psychiatric condition, difficulties in emotion regulation are thought to underlie many of the social/emotional and behavioral difficulties characteristic of youth with ASD. Thus, the emerging research on emotion regulation interventions is also reviewed. Finally, it is important to note that the treatment programs presented in this paper have almost exclusively been developed and delivered in university-based clinic settings. Recommendations for bridging the research to practice gap for youth with ASD are discussed.

AB This study describes the findings from quantitative examination of age and gender differences in psychological problems and health risk behaviour among 227 homeless youth. The findings indicated significant variations on health risk behaviours by gender. As compared to males, females were more likely to engage in survival sex, been victims of violence-rated sex, and more likely to have made a plan to commit suicide. While alcohol use decrease with age, marijuana use and having multiple sexual partners, on the other hand, increases with age. Approximately 87% of the participant's exhibit moderate-to-severe psychological problems, with males having significantly higher scores on the overall psychological well-being, emotional and hyperactivity problems than females. Age-group differences were also observed on overall psychological well-being, emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity. These findings from the study are discussed with reference to previous research and implications for interventions are provided.

AB Instruments comprising the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment are widely used worldwide to assess behavior problems in children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to assess the temporal stability of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), administered to parents and teachers of school-aged children, respectively. Temporal stability was assessed based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). High test-retest reliability was observed for both CBCL and TRF (0.87 - 0.91 and 0.62 - 0.8 for total behavior scale, respectively). These findings suggest that both instruments remained stable over the one-year period assessment, revealing the stability of the instrument and corroborating the findings of previous international studies.

AB Although the foster care systems in North America are set up with good intentions for best practices for foster children, in reality these systems are failing youth in care. Many foster children experience more psychological, social, educational, behavioural, and emotional problems as compared to children who are not in foster care, and this can continue into adulthood. Attachment theory can help to explain why some children experience these problems. Professionals who work with this population need to have a good understanding of foster children's unique experiences in order to help them as much as possible. Literature has addressed the problems that foster children have faced for decades, but there seems to be little change that happens to address and prevent these problems. There is no doubt that there is a great need for change in the current foster care systems in North America because current outcomes for many foster children are negative. This paper reviews the literature on foster care and explains the issues that foster children experience. It also addresses why the foster care system is failing youth, and gives practical suggestions for solutions.

AB The present study has examined the relationship between school based effort avoidance tendencies and problem behavior in children aged 9 to 16 years. Effort avoidance tendencies were assessed in 367 children with and without child care. Teachers and social workers rated children on behavioral and emotional problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results confirmed significant but low correlations between teacher ratings of behavior and emotional problems in children and selected subscales of self-reported effort avoidance in school, especially for children in child care institutions. For them "conduct problems" were significantly correlated with three of the four subscales and the total sum score of effort avoidance whereas "hyperactivity" was the only scale which was significantly associated with the fourth subscale. In the school sample only "hyperactivity" and "peer problems" were significantly correlated with one subscale of school-based effort avoidance. The findings suggest that more problem behavior is in relation to more school based effort avoidance tendencies.

AB Accommodative processes, which focus on flexible goal adjustment and nonintentional goal devaluation processes, have been extensively studied in adulthood. Empirical research, however, is primarily based on questionnaire data. With regard to accommodative coping skills in younger ages, only few studies have investigated adolescent samples and no studies have examined children's skills. In Study 1, comprising 38 7- to 8-year-old children (experimental group = 19, control group = 19), a new instrument was developed to assess disengagement and upgrading processes in a playful and age-appropriate way. In an experimental condition, previously induced goals were blocked. The children of this group differed significantly in goal devaluation scores and in the appreciation of alternative goals from the control group. In Study 2, accommodative coping was assessed by the piloted survey instrument in 85 7-to 8-year-old children and validated through the parents' report on their children's accommodative coping skills. Both survey instruments appear appropriate for measuring accommodative processes at primary school age.

AB The present study investigated differences in the adaptive and maladaptive regulation of negative emotions (anger, fear, sadness) between adolescents from different age groups, and between girls and boys. We assessed emotion regulation strategies using the German questionnaire FEEL-KJ in a sample of 843 girls and boys, aged between 10 and 18 years. We found that 16- to 18-year-old adolescents reported significantly more maladaptive strategies for emotion regulation in comparison with younger age groups. Girls reported using more maladaptive strategies to regulate their emotions than boys did. No gender or age group effects were found for adaptive emotion regulation strategies for anger, fear, and sadness. Our findings indicate that late adolescence may be a particularly vulnerable phase for dysfunctional emotion regulation, and that girls should be supported in their emotion regulation.

AB Survivors of moderate-severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are at risk for long-term cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems. This prospective cohort study investigated self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural problems in the late chronic phase of moderate and severe TBI, if demographic characteristics (i.e., age, years of education), injury characteristics (Glasgow Coma Scale score, MRI findings such as traumatic axonal injury (TAI), or duration of posttraumatic amnesia), symptoms of depression, or neuropsychological variables in the first year after injury predicted long-term self-reported function. Self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural functioning were assessed among individuals with moderate and severe TBI (N = 67, age range 15-65 years at time of injury) 2-5 years after TBI, compared to a healthy matched control group (N = 72). Results revealed significantly more attentional, emotional regulation, and psychological difficulties in the TBI group than controls. Demographic and early clinical variables were associated with poorer cognitive and emotional outcome. Fewer years of education and depressive symptoms predicted greater executive dysfunction. Younger age at injury predicted more aggressive and rule-breaking behaviour. TAI and depressive symptoms predicted Internalizing problems and greater executive dysfunction. In conclusion, age, education, TAI, and depression appear to elevate risk for poor long-term outcome, emphasising the need for long-term follow-up of patients presenting with risk factors.

AB Sexual urges and emotional attachments are not necessarily interrelated. Still, within romantic relationships, intimates typically function as both attachment figures and sexual partners, such that the attachment and sexual systems may influence one another. The present article reviews the reciprocal relation between these two systems. Specifically, previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of attachment processes to the appraisal of sexual interactions in adolescence and adulthood. Other studies have considered the reverse causal direction, focusing on the function of sex as a promoter of emotional bonds and on the circumstances under which this function is more pronounced. In doing so, some of these studies have investigated the role of attachment processes in linking sexuality with relationship quality and in shaping sexual responses to relationship-threatening events. More research is needed to explore the dual potential of sex as a relationship maintenance mechanism and as a force motivating people to pursue alternative partners.

AB Background: The psychological strain of migrants has been increasingly discussed in recent years. A special emphasis should be put on adolescents of second-generation immigrants, as they account for one third of the immigrant population in Germany. Objective: What is the degree of behavioral and emotional problems among Turkish migrant and German adolescents? Do perceived discrimination and acculturative stress have an impact on behavioral and emotional problems? Method: N-1 = 522 and N-2 = 91 adolescents (age = 14-17 years) were assessed regarding behavioral and emotional problems (Studies 1 and 2), acculturative stress, and perceived discrimination (Study 2). Results: In both studies, internalizing problems were reported significantly more often by girls than by boys. This finding was also observed for the Turkish group in the interview mode of Study 2. Perceived discrimination mediated the correlation between acculturative stress and behavioral and emotional problems. Conclusion: In the form of perceived discrimination, the cultural background of adolescents in Germany has an indirect impact on their mental health.

AB Mental health of girls at risk of homelessness is seriously affected by the vulnerable conditions in which they are involved. However, there are few studies that have addressed the issue worldwide. This study was conducted to explore the mental health of a sample of 26 girls at risk of homelessness, through differences by subjective well-being level and the effect of anxiety, depression, assertiveness and emotional regulation. The findings show significant discrepancies by subjective well-being grade in assertiveness and emotional regulation. Therefore, participants present mental health deficiency. The clinical benefit consists in taking action from the identified needs, in order to improve mental health conditions and consequently, the quality of life of the mentioned social group.

AB Second-generation Latin-American adolescents tend to show higher levels of various health-risking behaviors and emotional problems than first-generation Latin-American adolescents. This cross-sectional study of 40 mother-adolescent dyads examined the association of mother-youth acculturation gaps to youth adjustment problems. Intergenerational acculturation gaps were assessed as a bidimensional self-report component and a novel observational measurement component. The Latin-American adolescents were predominantly second-generation of Mexican descent (M-age = 13.42 years, SD = 0.55). Most of the mothers were born in Mexico (M-age = 39.18 years, SD = 5.17). Data were collected from mothers, adolescents, and coders, using questionnaires, structured interviews, and videotaped mother-youth interaction tasks. Findings revealed generally weak support for the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis. In addition, stronger relative adherence to their heritage culture by the adolescents was significantly (p < .05, ES = 0.15) related to less engagement in early health-risking sexual behaviors, possibly reflecting selective acculturation processes. Mother-youth acculturation gaps in orientation to the heritage culture were the most salient dimension, changing the focus on the original formulation of the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis.

AB Given the centrality of both parent-child attachment and emotion regulation in children's development and adjustment, it is important to evaluate the relations between these constructs. This article discusses conceptual and empirical links between attachment and emotion regulation in middle childhood, highlights progress and challenges in the literature, and outlines future inquiries. Studies have established that securely attached children internalize effective emotion regulation strategies within the attachment relationship and are able to successfully employ adaptive emotion regulation strategies outside the attachment relationship, when the attachment figure is not present. There are not enough studies to conclude yet that the insecure attachment patterns (ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized) may relate differentially with emotion regulation processes. Studies investigating whether there are unique links between the four attachment patterns and the various emotion regulation processes will advance the field considerably. Studies evaluating the associations between attachment and emotion regulation will benefit from a multimethod approach in measuring these constructs. Embedding the relation between parent-child attachment and emotion regulation within broader developmental models will further advance the research on this topic. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The goal of this research is to examine the mediator role of coping competence on the relationship between mindfulness and subjective happiness. Participants were 292 undergraduates who completed a questionnaire package that included the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, the Coping Competence Questionnaire, and the Subjective happiness Scale. Findings demonstrated that both coping competence and subjective happiness were predicted positively by mindfulness. Subjective happiness was predicted positively by coping competence. Also coping competence mediated on the relationship between mindfulness and subjective happiness. Together, the findings illuminate the importance of mindfulness on psychological and cognitive adjustment. The results were discussed in the light of the related literature and dependent recommendations to the area were given.

AB The Revenge Fantasy Inventory for Adolescents (RFI-J) is a paper-pencil-questionnaire that aims at assessing revenge fantasies of adolescents and facilitates an interpersonal comparison of revenge fantasies. The RFI-J assesses components concerning the subjective relevance of revenge fantasies, for example a coherence with emotion regulation and adolescent's attitudes towards revenge. In addition, the content of revenge fantasies is measured. The psychometric properties of revenge fantasies were analysed in two studies: In the first study an early concept of the instrument (consisting of two parts: assessment of subjective relevance of the fantasies and assessment of revenge fantasy content) was presented to 248 students (123 males) with an average age of 14.9 years (SD = 0.89; Range = 14-18 years). Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) both parts of the instrument were dimensionalised. Subsequently, scales were built and a first version of the inventory was developed. In a second study with another sample consisting of 88 students (48 males) with an average age of 14.9 years (SD = 0.72; Range = 14-17 years) four of the factors which had been found in the first study were replicated. Furthermore, correlations were found between the RFI-J and measures of aggression, measures of pro-sociality, as well as measures of physical and psychological complaints. The developed test in its current version consist of two parts (18 and 6 Items).

AB Purpose - Within the framework of Health Promoting Schools Up is an intervention using a whole school approach aimed at promoting mental health by strengthening social and emotional competence among schoolchildren. Social and emotional competence is an integral part of many school-based mental health interventions but only a minority of interventions measure changes in competences. The purpose of this paper is to present the intervention Up and document changes in social and emotional competence among schoolchildren before and after the intervention.
   Design/methodology/approach - Up consists of four components: education and activities for schoolchildren; development of staff skills; involvement of parents; and initiatives in everyday life at school. Up was implemented in two Danish schools in 2010-2011. Social and emotional competence was measured among 11-15-year old schoolchildren before (response rate 96.2 per cent, n = 589) and after (response rate 83.9 per cent, n = 532) the intervention.
   Findings - Changes in level of social competence were assessed by the prevalence of a high level of social and emotional competence before (33.3 per cent) and after (40.8 per cent) the intervention (p-value = 0.01).
   Research limitations/implications - Up provides valuable experiences for adapting evidence-based mental health promotion to the Danish school system which is characterized by democracy, autonomy and inclusion. Future research should study the implementation and effect of Up in larger scale studies.
   Practical implications - The comprehensive description of Up serves as important information for policymakers and practitioners working with mental health promotion.
   Originality/value - The whole school approach intervention Up has the potential to promote social and emotional competence and reduce socioeconomic differences in social and emotional competence among schoolchildren.

AB Parenting styles have been a central construct in the field of parenting and child development studies. Many decades of research have supported the impact of parenting styles on several aspects of the social and emotional adjustment of children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties and the factorial validity of the Portuguese version of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, through confirmatory factor analysis. Data were collected from 2081 participants (1085 mothers; 996 fathers) with children between 3 and 15 years old. Results replicated the original three-factor structure: authoritative, authoritarian and permissive. The results of confirmatory analysis indicated a good fit of the model. Authoritative and authoritarian factors showed good internal reliability coefficients, but the permissive factor presented values slightly below acceptable levels. Convergent and discriminant validity also showed appropriate values. In general, and despite the less acceptable levels of internal reliability demonstrated by the permissive factor, PSDQ revealed psychometric properties appropriate for research and clinical purposes. This instrument not only allows for the assessment of parenting styles, but also enables the measurement of parental dimensions and behaviors with a significant impact on child and adolescent well-being.

AB Emotion regulation when using the Internet is an increasingly important way to secure effective social functioning for adolescents. To develop a measure of emotion regulation for adolescents with reference to the network community and examine its reliability and validity, we recruited 535 young people as participants and performed item analysis, identification degree analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. Our results showed that the online emotion regulation of adolescents comprised the following 4 dimensions: positive emotion seeking, negative emotion experience, interpersonal emotion support, and mood awareness. Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the test-retest reliability met the benchmark psychometric standards, and the confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the scale had a good fit. Our results indicated that the developed scale was a valid and reliable measure of adolescents' online emotion regulation.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and impairing condition that was newly included in DSM-5 in the section III criteria for further research. Difficulties in emotion regulation play an important role in the development and maintenance of NSSI. This study investigated the emotion regulation in female adolescents with NSSI according to DSM-5 (n = 55), clinical control adolescents with mental disorders without NSSI (n = 30), and nonclinical control adolescents (n = 58) using self-report questionnaires and interviews. As expected, results indicated that adolescents with NSSI have significantly more difficulties in emotion regulation compared to healthy controls. In addition, adolescents with NSSI reported also significantly more difficulties in impulse control, lack of emotional clarity, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies compared to nonclinical and clinical controls. Adolescents with NSSI felt significantly more often sadness compared to clinical controls (d = 0.66) and compared to other emotions. Adolescents with NSSI indicated significantly less often happiness compared to nonclinical controls (d = 1.83). Results support that adolescents with NSSI have difficulties in emotion regulation and that these difficulties are even more pronounced than in adolescents with other mental disorders. Clinical implications will be discussed.

AB Our article reviews and celebrates Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's remarkable contributions to psychological and clinical science, focusing on her vast body of theoretical and empirical work and her influence on colleagues and students. Susan spent her career trying to understand how and why a style of regulating emotions called rumination increases vulnerability to depression and exacerbates and perpetuates negative moods. More broadly, we describe research by Susan and her colleagues on the predictors of depression in childhood and adolescence; gender differences in depression and rumination in adolescence and adulthood; roots, correlates, and adverse consequences of ruminative response styles; and rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor for not only depression but also a host of psychological disorders, including anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Susan's intellectual legacy is evident in her impressive publication and citation record, the clinical applications of her work, and the flourishing careers of the students she mentored.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) among Turkish adolescents. A total of 595 high school students (300 females and 295 males) whose ages ranged between 14 and 17 years participated in the study, and were administered the DERS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the six-factor structure of the DERS among adolescents. In addition, results indicated sound internal consistency as well as concurrent validity. It is concluded that the DERS is a valid age-appropriate measure for investigating emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents.

AB A grave injury, including a spinal one, affects not only the physical, but also the psychological condition of a person. An examination of 39 adolescents and young people with spinal injuries suffered at different times of their lives has shown an increase in negative attitudes in later stages of post-traumatic rehabilitation Patients suffer from depression, anxiety, fear of rejection. They no longer desire acceptance on the part of other people which points to a conflict in affiliation motivation. The authors have discovered a close connection between styles of emotional communication within the family, emotional maladjustment and negative interpersonal attitudes. High indices of family malfunction are linked to prevalence of fear of rejection and depression symptoms over aspiration for acceptance. The authors emphasize importance of psychological assistance to the family and its injured members in all stages of the rehabilitation process.

Participants were 314 undergraduate students at the University of Turin (Faculty of Agricultural Studies, School of Sport and Exercise Sciences and Faculty of Psychology). Correlational analysis identified several associations between emotion regulation strategies and defense mechanisms. A second-order factor model was tested in which each of the dimensions assessed by the defense mechanisms and emotion regulation instruments was assigned to either an adaptive or maladaptive latent dimension. The results suggested that the dimensions of adaptiveness and maladaptiveness may represent a key link between emotion regulation and defense mechanisms.

AB The effects of guilt, shame, and externalization of blame on aggressive behavior were investigated among a total of 307 Finnish fifth and sixth graders (M-age = 11.9 years). Self-reported proneness to feel guilt and shame was expected to reduce levels of peer-reported aggressive behavior, whereas self-reported externalization of blame was hypothesized to function as a moral disengagement mechanism with links to greater aggressive behavior. However, these associations were expected to be moderated by children's emotion-regulation capabilities and tendencies to experience negative emotionality (as reported by teachers). Results indicated that guilt and shame were associated with lower levels of aggression for children with poor emotion regulation (or high negative emotionality). For children with effective emotion regulation (or low negative emotionality), shame and externalization of blame were associated with higher levels of aggression. The results suggest that a dark side may be apparent in effective emotion regulation (and low negative emotionality) in that it enables children to disengage from the normally inhibiting functions of guilt and shame and to act aggressively in response to shame and externalization of blame.

AB This article addresses the challenges faced by youth in developing countries. Using India as an example of a fast-globalizing country, this article highlights the experience and challenges faced by adolescents and emerging adults as they search for their interpersonal and professional identities. The difficulties of defining identity in the context of rapid globalization where people are exposed to diverse cultural forces that may conflict with each other are particularly salient when dealing with anger Anger frequently results from thwarted wants and needs. In globalizing developing economies, young people often face inequitable access and opportunities that may be cause for distress anger and depression. However the skills to deal with anger are frequently culturally determined and may not be effective in situations where multiple cultural rules are operational. For example, India being a collectivist culture traditionally encourages the suppression of anger However situations and rules of conduct in a global economic order require the assertive expression of anger and the confrontation of conflict. Research that is methodologically and culturally appropriate is needed in exploring these issues and ameliorating distress associated with inequity, conflicts, and challenges.

AB Experiences of 298 children with their caregivers in after-school programs (ASPs) were examined as predictors of social-emotional functioning across the first through fifth grade. Moderating effects of previous social-emotional problems, child gender, family income, quantity of care, and program regulatable features were also estimated. On average, ASP experiences negatively predicted externalizing problems and positively predicted social selfcontrol and assertion. Interestingly, positive ASP experiences did not predict decreased externalizing behaviors, but instead children with negative experiences had higher levels of externalizing behavior problems. Changes in ASP experiences positively predicted changes in self-control scores, but only for boys. Finally, staff experience, staff wages, and changes in child-to-caregiver ratios predicted children's ASP experiences and levels of socialemotional development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prevention and early intervention programmes have been found to impede the transmission of mental illness from parents to children. However, the extant processes of change in such programmes are less clear. This study focuses on the impact of a peer support programme developed for children and adolescents who have a parent with a mental illness and examines the processes of change which might promote positive outcomes for youth. A mixed methods research approach was employed with participants aged between 8 and 12 years old; 69 completed pre- and post-questionnaires and 18 of these same participants engaged in telephone interviews post programme. Results demonstrate improved mental health knowledge and children reported that they were more likely to use an anonymous telephone helpline after attending the programme. Children indicated that the programme provided a place of respite from caring for their parent with a mental illness, an opportunity to connect with peers, and a positive change in perception of their parent's mental illness. The reported findings are moving towards an understanding of the process of change in programmes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Shame experiences have been suggested to be related with psychopathological symptoms and with self-relevant beliefs. Recent studies also suggest that avoidant-focused strategies (e.g., rumination, thought suppression and dissociation) mediate the impact of shame memories and depression symptoms. However, experiential avoidance has been found to mediate the relation between early experience of abuse and psychopathological symptoms. Our goal was to test the mediating effect of experiential avoidance in the relation between both the nature of shame experiences at the hands of caregivers and the centrality of shame memories with others, and depression symptoms.
   Method Using structural equation modelling, we assessed the frequency and nature of recalled shame experiences at the hands of caregivers, the centrality of shame experiences with others throughout childhood and adolescence, experiential avoidance and depression symptomatology in 161 participants from general population.
   Results Experiential avoidance mediates the impact of shame experiences with caregivers and depression symptoms. Experiential avoidance also mediated the association between the centrality of shame experiences with others and depression symptoms.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that shame memories with others do not per se impact on depression symptoms, but rather the unwillingness to experience them and the attempts to control them. Hence, our results emphasize the importance of addressing affect regulation processes such as avoidance when dealing with shame memories, particularly with patients who experience depression symptoms.

AB Purpose: This study examines psychosocial functioning in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and/or externalizing behavior problems (EBPs) as compared to children with neither condition. Methods: The longitudinal sample, drawn from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, included children who were 6 to 9 years old in Cycle 1 who were followed-up biennially in Cycles 2 and 3 (N = 3476). The associations between NDDs and/or EBPs, child and family socio-demographic characteristics and parenting behaviors (consistency and ineffective parenting), were examined across several measures of child psychosocial functioning: peer relationships, general self-esteem, prosocial behavior and anxiety-emotional problems. Results: Children with NDDs, EBPs, and both NDDs and EBPs self-reported lower scores on general self-esteem. Children with NDDs and both NDDs and EBPs reported lower scores on peer relationships and prosocial behavior. Lastly, children with both NDDs and EBPs self-reported higher scores on anxiety-emotional behaviors. After considering family socio-demographic characteristics and parenting behaviors, these differences remained statistically significant only for children with both NDDs and EBPs. Child age and gender, household income and parenting behaviors were important in explaining these associations. Conclusions: Psychosocial functioning differs for children with NDDs and/or EBPs. Children with both NDDs and EBPs appear to report poorer psychosocial functioning compared to their peers with neither condition. However, it is important to consider the context of socio-demographic characteristics, parenting behaviors and their interactions to understand differences in children's psychosocial functioning.

AB Two Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) profiles were correlated to poor self-regulation, Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) (elevation between 1 and 2 Standard Deviations (SD) in Anxiety/Depression, Aggression, Attention subscales), and Dysregulation Profile (DP) (elevation of 2 Standard Deviations or more). We explored youths with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) whether these profiles are associated with specific clinical features. The sample included 57 patients with DESR profile and 41 with DP profile, ages 9 to 15 years, all assigned to a non-pharmacological Multimodal Treatment Program. No differences resulted between groups in demographic features, diagnosis ratio, and comorbidities with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), and Anxiety Disorder. The DP group was associated with higher scores in Withdrawn, Social Problem, Thought, Rule Breaking, and Somatic CBCL subscales, and higher scores in Narcissism and Impulsivity (but not Callous-Unemotional (CU)), according to the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD). After treatment, patients with DESR improved their personality traits (Narcissistic and Callous-Unemotional, but not Impulsivity), while changes in CBCL scales were modest. Patients with DP improved scales of Attention, Aggression, Anxiety-Depression, Rule Breaking, With-drawal, Social Problem and Thought, while personality features did not change. These results suggest diagnostic implications of CBCL profiles, and indications for targeted treatment strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to determine if emotion regulation mediates the relationship between emotional maltreatment and disordered eating behavior in adolescents. Participants were 222 secondary school pupils (aged 14-18 years) from a state high school in the UK. Standardized questionnaire measures were used to gather self-report data on emotional abuse and emotional neglect, functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and disordered eating behavior. Results showed that disordered eating was associated with emotional abuse, dysfunctional emotion regulation and being female. Multiple mediation analysis found an indirect relationship between emotional abuse and disordered eating through dysfunctional emotion regulation. Interestingly, emotional neglect predicted lower levels of functional emotion regulation. The findings support previous research showing emotion regulation to mediate the relationship between childhood abuse and disordered eating in adults and a differential effect of abuse and neglect on emotion regulation. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the direction of relationships; however these data suggest that dysfunctional emotion regulation is a significant variable in the development of disordered eating and may be a useful target for intervention.

AB This is the first study to describe the relation between attachment security, emotion regulation, and symptom change in a sample of adolescents completing inpatient treatment in a naturalistic setting. We examined whether attachment security predicted symptom change, and whether emotion regulation capacities mediated this relation. A sample of n = 194 inpatient adolescents was assessed (65.5 % female, M (age) = 15.45 years, SD = 1.44) at admission and discharge and analyses were conducted in accordance with the aforementioned objectives including testing of moderation and mediation models. We found that securely attached adolescents experienced greater reduction in internalizing symptoms from admission to discharge, even when controlling for length of stay. Nonacceptance of emotional responses mediated the relation between maternal attachment security and internalizing symptom change. These findings did not hold for externalizing symptoms, nor when paternal attachment was explored. Attachment plays an important role in symptom change for internalizing problems, with nonacceptance of emotional responses partially mediating this link. Possible explanations for the absence of moderation for paternal attachment and externalizing problems are discussed, as are explanations for the mediating effect of emotion regulation.

AB Reflective function (RF) is an ability to think about one's own thoughts and feelings, as well as those of others. It imparts an awareness of one's self and others and forms the basis for self-construal and human relationships. Parental RF has been shown to play an important role in parenting and to promote the development of children's RF. Research on parental RF has been mostly restricted to mothers and to early stages of development. This article reviews the existing research on paternal RF and its role at later stages of development. Although there is a paucity of research on paternal RF, there is evidence that it is significant for children's development, particularly during adolescence, and that adolescence appears to be a significant period for the development of RF. However, there is also evidence for gender differences in RF, with fathers scoring lower than mothers. Various factors may impede RF, including emotional regulation and language skills, as well as social norms and socialization practices that may perpetuate gender differences in RF. Motivation seems to be a key factor in the realization of RF, and various interventions have been developed that appear to enhance RF. Our review underscores the need for further research on paternal RF, particularly in the context of adolescence, and on the factors that may impede its development and realization. In addition, there is a need for further development and assessment of intervention programs aimed at enhancing RF at the community, family, and individual levels.

AB The present study examined clinical and demographic risk factors associated with parent-rated emotional-behavioral and executive functioning in children and adolescents with epilepsy. The medical records of 152 children and adolescents with epilepsy referred for neuropsychological evaluation were reviewed. Results indicated that the sample displayed significantly elevated symptoms across the emotional-behavioral and executive domains assessed. Executive functioning and behavioral symptoms had the highest rates of clinically elevated scores, with lowest rates of elevated scores in internalizing and externalizing emotional problems. Only 34% of those participants with clinically significant emotional-behavioral or executive functioning difficulties had a history of psychological or counseling services, highlighting the underserved mental health needs of this population. In regard to clinical factors, themajority of seizure-related variables were not associated with emotional-behavioral or executive functioning. However, the frequency of seizures (i. e., seizure status) was associated with behavioral regulation aspects of executive functioning, and the age at evaluation was associated with externalizing problems and behavioral symptoms. Family psychiatric history (with the exception of ADHD) was associated with all domains of executive and emotional-behavioral functioning. In summary, emotional-behavioral and executive functioning difficulties frequently co-occur with seizures in childhood epilepsy, with both seizure-related and demographic factors contributing to the presentation of such neurobehavioral comorbidities. The present findings provide treatment providers of childhood epilepsy with important information to assist in better identifying children and adolescents who may be at risk for neurobehavioral comorbidities and may benefit from intervention.

AB Purpose: The aims of the study were to measure the social competence of well-functioning adolescents with epilepsy and compare it with that of their healthy peers as well as to analyze the effects of epilepsy-related variables on the social competence.
   Methods: Ninety well-functioning adolescents with epilepsy 12-19 years of age were compared with healthy controls using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report Questionnaire measures of social competence. Within the group with epilepsy, the impact of duration of epilepsy, etiology, seizure frequency, seizure type, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (monotherapy or polytherapy) on the above measures was also determined.
   Results: Twenty-five (27.8%) adolescents with epilepsy obtained Total Competence T scores in the clinical range, as opposed to only two (3.3%) of the healthy adolescents. There were statistically significant differences in the Activity and Social subscales and Total Competence T score between the group with epilepsy and the control group (p < 0.05). Comparing T scores for epilepsy-related variables in the group with epilepsy, we found that there were statistically significant differences in all the social competence subscales regarding the seizure control and seizure types. No significant differences were obtained for other epilepsy-related variables: duration of epilepsy, onset of epilepsy, etiology, and AEDs.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that adolescents with epilepsy are less active in clubs, socialize less with their friends, and have a poorer school performance compared with their healthy peers. This study shows that adolescents with epilepsy are at an increased risk of having difficulties in social competence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To analyze the psychological phenotype of ADHD, and the effect of ADHD on life satisfaction and personality in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Method: Adults with NF1 without (n = 26) and with ADHD (n = 22), and adults with ADHD only (n = 27) completed questionnaires on personality traits and life satisfaction. Differences between groups were analyzed. Results: Participants with NF1 and ADHD present an emotionally instable psychological phenotype similar to adults with ADHD only, which differed significantly from that in adults with NF1 only. Participants with NF1 and ADHD had significantly lower overall life satisfaction than NF1 participants without such symptoms, affecting general health, self-satisfaction, sexuality, and family. Conclusion: The authors' findings show that ADHD symptoms can persist through adulthood. These NF1 patients display problems similar to those of adults with ADHD only. This finding is highly relevant to understand the behavioral and psychological phenotype in adults with NF1 and to offer psychological and/or medical treatment.

AB BackgroundRecent studies have proposed the process of emotion regulation as a promising target to study the neurophysiological basis of adolescent depression. Emotion regulation has repeatedly been studied with emotional go/no-go paradigms. To date, no study has examined if the left-frontal hypoactivation associated with depression generalizes to active tasks. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the hemispheric asymmetry of the N2 component in depressed adolescents in an emotion regulation paradigm.
   MethodsTwenty-four adolescents diagnosed with major depression (age 11-18) and 30 healthy controls (age 11-18) performed two emotional go/no-go tasks exhibiting negative faces as go trials and positive faces as no-go trials and vice versa.
   ResultsOn the behavioral level, no significant group differences emerged. On the neural level, we found a more right-lateralized N2-amplitude in depressed subjects, while it was more left-lateralized in controls. Furthermore, both groups showed a less negative N2-amplitude to positive no-go stimuli.
   ConclusionThis study provides strong support for a general left-frontal hypoactivity in adolescent depression, which also applies to active emotional go/no-go paradigms. Furthermore, the less negative N2 to positive stimuli is consistent with a generally enhanced impulsivity of adolescents toward appetitive stimuli, which is possibly the base of the differential clinical pattern of adolescent in contrast to adult depression.

AB Objective: This study examines the prospective association of childhood abuse (physical and/or sexual abuse) with subsequent parenting practices in adulthood. Method: The sample is drawn from the Children in the Community Study, a prospective longitudinal study of children's mental health development in a community sample of children followed for approximately 30 years. The study uses a multimethod, multiinformant design (self-report, parent report, and official records) incorporating data from 3 generations to examine the influence of childhood maltreatment on parenting practices at M age 33, and the mediating effects of adolescent conduct disorder at M age 15 and adult psychopathology at M age 22. Results: Sexual abuse predicted lower availability, time spent with the child, satisfaction with the child, and higher perceived ineffectiveness; physical abuse predicted higher perceived ineffectiveness; and dual abuse predicted lower availability and harsh discipline. Conduct disorder mediated the association of sexual abuse with satisfaction and dual abuse with availability, whereas generalized anxiety disorder mediated the association of sexual abuse with time spent with the child. Conclusions: These results suggest that some mothers and fathers with a history of child abuse may benefit from parenting interventions that address difficulties with emotional disengagement. Specific attention could be paid to assist these parents with emotional regulation strategies to maximize their emotional and physical engagement with their child, so as to increase their capacity for availability, time spent with the child, and parental self-efficacy.

AB Parents of children with developmental disabilities (DD) are at increased risk of experiencing psychological stress compared to other parents. Children's high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems have been found to contribute to this elevated level of stress. Few studies have considered the reverse direction of effects, however, in families where a child has a DD. The present study investigated transactional relations between child behavior problems and maternal stress within 176 families raising a child with early diagnosed DD. There was evidence of both child-driven and parent-driven effects over the 15-year study period, spanning from early childhood (age 3) to adolescence (age 18), consistent with transactional models of development. Parent-child transactions were found to vary across different life phases and with different domains of behavior problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated whether associations exist between attachment dimensions toward mother and different forms of eating pathology (EP) in a group of early adolescent boys and girls, and whether these associations were mediated by maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies. Developmentally appropriate self-report questionnaires were administered to a community sample of 952 early adolescents ((X) over bar (age) = 12.19, 54.6% female). The results demonstrated associations between the insecure attachment dimensions and the different forms of EP. Moreover, the relationships between both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance toward mother on the one hand and restraint and EP concerns on the other hand, were partially mediated by maladaptive ER. These results assign an important role to maladaptive ER, in explaining the relationship between insecure attachment and EP. Future longitudinal research should replicate and elaborate on these findings.

AB Background: Parental characteristics can increase the risk of the development of adolescent depression. In this study, we focus on the parental factors of parents in a non-intact relationship, dissatisfaction with personal economy, physical illness or disability, and internalizing and externalizing problems. The aim is to examine which of these parental risk factors, separately for mothers and fathers, are associated with clinical depression in adolescents in a community sample. Methods: In the Youth and Mental Health study, 345 adolescents (mean age +/- standard deviation 15.0 +/- 0.6 years, range 13.8-16.6 years; 72.5% girls) and their parents (79% at least one parent) completed questionnaires and the diagnostic interview Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). Adolescents were classified into current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (n = 46), depression not otherwise specified (n = 48), or no depression (n = 251). The parental risk factors were based on interview and the Adult Self-Report. Risk factors associated with mothers (n = 267) and fathers (n = 167) were separately analyzed using ordinal logistic regression with current depression category as the dependent variable. All analyses were adjusted for youth sex and age. Results: Mothers' economical dissatisfaction, physical illness/disability, internalizing problems and externalizing problems were associated with adolescent current depression (P <= 0.02). Adjusting for all other factors, only mothers' internalizing problems (P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with adolescent depression. Fathers' risk factors were not associated with adolescent depression. Conclusion: Characteristics of mothers are associated with adolescent current depression. Mothers' internalizing problems is independently strongly associated with increased risk of current adolescent depression. Clinicians should assess mothers' mental health when treating depressed adolescents.

AB The articles in this series relate to research on the modification of cognitive processes thought to be causally related to behavioral or emotional problems. The examination of the effects of targeted cognitive interventions on specific cognitive processes and of the relationship of the modification of these processes to clinical outcome provides insight into mechanisms of behavior change. In contrast to intervention development research involving clinical trials that focus on efficacy testing without examining an intervention's mechanism of action, the intervention development research presented here is grounded in the examination of mechanism and can inform behavior change science regardless of whether or not an intervention exerts the hypothesized effect on clinical outcome. The potential for the utility of cognitive training interventions as clinical tools is discussed. Also highlighted is the potential for a mechanism-focused approach to serve as one model for progressive integrated basic science and clinical intervention development research.

AB Purpose: To examine the challenges faced by parents of teenagers with a disability to determine the need for a tailored parenting program for this population. Method: Focus groups were conducted with six parents and nine practitioners with experience supporting parents of teenagers with a disability. Results: An inductive thematic analysis revealed close agreement between parents and practitioners and eight understandable and relevant themes. The results indicated that parents have difficulty planning and facilitating transitions for their adolescent children, managing behavioural problems due to these problems being unique to this developmental period and because some of the parenting strategies that were useful when their children were younger were no longer applicable. High levels of stress and feelings of grief were also described. Conclusions: These results suggest that parents of adolescents with a developmental disability could benefit from a parenting program and that an existing evidence-based parenting program should be modified. Implications for program design for this population are discussed.

AB Theoretical views and empirical findings suggest interrelations among attachment security, emotion dysregulation and anxiety in childhood and adolescence. However, the associations among the three constructs have rarely been investigated in children, and no study has yet addressed these associations in adolescence. The aim of the present study was to test a model of the interrelations among the three factors on a sample of 673 youths (age 9-16), using structural equation modelling. In accordance with theoretical conceptualisations, it was hypothesised that attachment security would relate to anxiety and that emotion dysregulation would help explain the association between attachment security and anxiety. Results showed that more securely attached youths reported less emotion dysregulation and that youths who had fewer emotion regulation difficulties experienced less anxiety. The association between attachment security and anxiety was mediated by emotion dysregulation. The model was confirmed for both children and adolescents. Findings are discussed with respect to theoretical implications, as well as future directions.

AB Very preterm birth has become More frequent during the past decades due to progress in reproductive medicine, more frequent indicated preterm births due to maternal illnesses, and increasing Maternal age. Moreover, survival rate S of very preterm children have increased due to improved neonatal management. However, very preterm-born children, adolescents, and young adults are at increased risk for poor cognitive function and socio-emotional problems, which is of growing public health concern. Very premature birth has been Studied to Unravel consequences of a nonoptimal environment during a developmental period which under normal circumstances would be the last trimester of fetal development. For very preterm children, this developmental period partly occurs outside the womb, which leads to major distress for the immature newborn: For the cerebral cortex, the last trimester of pregnancy is a particularly sensitive period during which cortical folding takes place and the volume increases 4fold. During this period; even minor insults May cascade into disturbances of brain development. The most frequent complication after very preterm birth is related to insufficient functioning of the lungs, Which May lead to hypoxic-ischemic incidences and damage to nervous tissue. ThiS review presents evidence for long-term sequels Of very premature birth regarding neurocognitive, academic, socio-emotional, and mental health development Then it discuses possible underlying mechanisms including alterations in brain development, programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and circadian rhythmicity, as well as affected parent-Child interaction patterns in families With very preterm children. Finally, intervention approaches to improve outcomes after very preterm birth are discussed and directions for future research presented.

AB Middle adolescents (15-17 years old) are prone to increased risk taking and emotional instability. Emotion dysregulation contributes to a variety of psychosocial difficulties in this population. A discipline such as yoga offered during school may increase emotion regulation, but research in this area is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a yoga intervention on the emotion regulation of high school students as compared to physical education (PE). In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention, self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga group as compared to the PE group (F(1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta(2) = .19). No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion regulation and the proposed mediating variables. Preliminary results suggest that yoga increases emotion regulation capacities of middle adolescents and provides benefits beyond that of PE alone.

DE Emotional maturity; adjustment; first year; undergraduates
AB Entering into college is considered a time of stress and adjustment for any youth. The discrepancy between their expectations and the realities of the college contribute to lags in their emotional, academic, social, familial, sexual and health well-being. As a result of which they face difficulties in adjusting to the new college life. The primary purpose of the present study is to explore the relationship between adjustment and emotional maturity of first year undergraduate students. It also aimed at investigating if there exist any gender difference in emotional maturity and adjustment. The sample for the study consisted of 80 first year undergraduates from various colleges of Delhi University. The age ranged between 17-19 years. The sample was selected through incidental sampling technique. They were administered the Global Adjustment Scale(Student Form) by Sanjay Vohra and Emotional Maturity Scale by Singh and Bhargava to measure adjustment and emotional maturity, respectively. The results showed a significant positive correlation between emotional maturity and various dimensions of adjustment (namely, emotional, family, college and social adjustment) at. 01 and 0.05 level of significance. Also the t-test showed no significant difference in emotional maturity between the two genders. The study further revealed that there was no significant difference in the adjustment dimensions between boys and girls except for only the dimension of emotional adjustment, where females scored significantly higher than their male counterpart. Finally, few intervention techniques have been suggested along with implications to enable further research.

AB Mothers with elevated Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms demonstrate parenting deficits, as well as difficulties in emotion regulation (ER), which may further impact their ability to effectively parent. However, no empirical research has examined potential mediators that explain the relations between maternal ADHD symptoms and parenting. This prospective longitudinal study examined difficulties with ER as a mediator of the relation between adult ADHD symptoms and parenting among 234 mothers of adolescents recruited from the community when they were between the ages of nine to twelve. Maternal ratings of adult ADHD symptoms, difficulties with ER, and parenting responses to their adolescents' expressions of negative emotions were collected over the course of three years. We found that maternal ADHD symptoms were negatively associated with positive parenting responses to adolescents' negative emotions, and positively associated with harsh parenting and maternal distress reactions. Moreover, maternal ER mediated the relation between adult ADHD symptoms and harsh parenting responses, while controlling for adolescent ADHD and disruptive behavior symptoms. However, maternal ER did not mediate the relation between ADHD symptoms and positive or distressed parental responses. Thus, it appears that ER is one mechanism by which maternal ADHD symptoms are associated with harsh responses to their adolescents' expressions of negative emotion. These findings may have downstream implications for adolescent adjustment.

AB There is a critical need for the development, evaluation and implementation of evidence-based psychodynamic treatments for children and adolescents. Currently, there are no empirically supported, manualised psychodynamic treatments for children and adolescents with disruptive behaviour problems. The field of manualised psychodynamic treatments with measurable equivalence or superiority to other established forms of psychotherapy is in its nascent stage. This paper details a novel, manualised, time-limited psychodynamic treatment approach for children who manifest disruptive behaviours and emotional dysregulation. Regulation-Focused Psychotherapy for Children (RFP-C) conceptualises children's disruptive and acting out behaviours as expressions of maladaptive emotion regulation. Externalising symptoms are conceptualised as attempts to defend against painful emotions and thus protect the child from disturbing feelings such as sadness, shame and guilt. This paper provides the theoretical basis for the treatment approach and through the use of a clinical example demonstrates the systematic application of RFP-C in a single case.

AB ObjectiveThis study examined relations between repeated rumination trials and emotions in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and eating disorder behaviors (EDBs) within the context of the emotional cascade model (Selby, Anestis, & Joiner, ).
   MethodRumination was repeatedly induced in 342 university students (79.2% female, M-age = 18.61, standard error = .08); negative and positive emotions were reported after each rumination trial. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to examine the relations between NSSI and EDB history and changes in emotions.
   ResultsNSSI history associated with greater initial increases in negative emotions, whereas EDB history associated with greater initial decreases in positive emotions. Baseline negative emotional states and trait emotion regulation mediated the relation between NSSI/EDB history and emotional states after rumination.
   ConclusionAlthough NSSI and EDBs share similarities in emotion dysregulation, differences also exist. Both emotion dysregulation and maladaptive cognitive processes should be targeted in treatment for NSSI and EDBs.

AB Adaptations or alternative versions of cognitive psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are needed because even the most efficacious cognitive or cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies for PTSD do not retain or achieve sustained clinically significant benefits for a majority of recipients. Cognitive affective neuroscience research is reviewed which suggests that it is not just memory (or memories) of traumatic events and related core beliefs about self, the world, and relationships that are altered in PTSD but also memory (and affective information) processing. A cognitive psychotherapy is described that was designed to systematically make explicit these otherwise implicit trauma-related alterations in cognitive emotion regulation and its application to the treatment of complex variants of PTSD-Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET). TARGET provides therapists and clients with (a) a neurobiologically informed strengths-based meta-model of stress-related cognitive processing in the brain and how this is altered by PTSD and (b) a practical algorithm for restoring the executive functions that are necessary to make implicit trauma-related cognitions explicit (i.e., experiential awareness) and modifiable (i.e., planful refocusing). Results of randomized clinical trial studies and quasi-experimental effectiveness evaluations of TARGET with adolescents and adults are reviewed.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of psychopathy factors and gang membership on moral disengagement while controlling for age, ethnicity, having run away from home, family member and/or friend arrests, substance misuse, parental physical fights, violence exposure (victimization and witnessing), and maternal warmth and hostility.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on data collected from serious juvenile offenders (n = 769) as part of the Pathways to Desistance Study.
   Findings - Six independent variables made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model: gang membership, age, gender, violence exposure, and psychopathy Factors 1 and 2. Psychopathy Factor 1 was the strongest predictor of moral disengagement.
   Originality/value - Results indicate that youth with heightened psychopathic traits make greater use of strategies to rationalize and justify their harmful behaviour against others. Implications in relation to theory and previous studies are discussed.

AB Background: In this study, we examined perceptions regarding the causes of eating disorders, both among those with eating disorders as well as those without. By understanding the differences in perceived causes between the two groups, better educational programs for lay people and those suffering from eating disorders can be developed.
   Method: This study used open-ended questions to assess the beliefs of 57 individuals with self-reported eating disorders and 220 without. Participants responded to the questions, "What do you think was (were) the cause(s) of your eating disorder?" and "What do you think is (are) the cause(s) of eating disorders?".
   Results: A list of possible codes for the causes of eating disorders was created based on a thorough review of the literature. A manually-generated set of eight codes was then created from individuals' actual responses. Frequencies and chi square analyses demonstrated differences in rates of endorsement between those with eating disorders and those without. Participants with eating disorders most frequently endorsed psychological/ emotional and social problems, with genetics/biology and media/culture ideals least endorsed. Participants without eating disorders most frequently endorsed psychological/emotional problems and media/culture ideals, with traumatic life events and sports/health least endorsed. There was a difference between groups in the endorsement of the media as a cause of eating disorders, suggesting that those without eating disorders may overly attribute the media as the main cause while those with eating disorders may not be fully aware of the media's impact. Additionally, while both groups highly endorsed psychological/emotional problems, there was a noticeable stigma about eating disorders among those without eating disorders.
   Conclusions: There were noteworthy differences between samples; such differences suggest that there is a need for more education on the topic of eating disorders. Furthermore, despite empirical support for the effects of genetics, sports, and family factors, these were infrequently endorsed as causes of eating disorders by both groups. Our results suggest that there is a need for more education regarding the factors associated with eating disorders, in order to reduce the stigma surrounding these disorders and to potentially aid the treatment process.

TI Neural substrates of inhibitory and emotional processing in adolescents
   with traumatic brain injury
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Childhood brain disorder; brain imaging; executive functions; head
   injury; emotion; adolescence
AB PURPOSE: Disturbances of emotional regulation and social difficulties are common in children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent research suggests that developments within "socio-emotional" brain systems during early adolescence and more protracted development of "cognitive control" systems have implications for emotional and behavioral regulation during adolescence. However, few functional neuroimaging studies have directly examined the interaction of these neuropsychological processes in adolescents with TBI. The current study examined how affective processing might modulate inhibitory processing in an Emotional Go/NoGo paradigm.
   METHOD: The study uses a cross-sectional, age, gender, and maternal education matched design. A response inhibition paradigm (i.e., the Go/NoGo task with emotional faces) was used to examine emotional-cognition interaction in 11 adolescents with complicated mild to moderate TBI, at least 12 months post injury, and 14 typically-developing (TD) adolescents using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants saw adult facial expressions of emotions (happy, sad, fearful, and angry) and were instructed to respond ("go") on all expressions other than angry ("no-go").
   RESULTS: Preliminary results (p = 0.001 uncorrected, cluster size = 50) showed higher levels of inhibition-related activation in TD adolescents than in adolescents with TBI in several brain regions including anterior cingulate and motor/premotor regions.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TBI in adolescence might alter brain activation patterns and interrupt the development of brain networks governing emotion-cognition interactions.

AB Very preterm children are at higher risk to develop behavioral and emotional problems, poor sleep, and altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity (HPAA). However, knowledge on objective sleep and HPAA as well as their role for the development of behavioral and emotional problems in very preterm children is limited. Fifty-eight very preterm children (<32nd gestational week) and 55 full-term children aged 6-10 years underwent one night of in-home polysomnographic sleep assessment. HPAA was assessed with four saliva samples in the morning (morning cortisol secretion) and four saliva samples in the evening (evening cortisol secretion). Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess children's behavioral and emotional problems and a subscale of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire to assess sleep disordered breathing. Very preterm children showed more behavioral and emotional problems (SDQ total behavioral/emotional difficulties, emotional symptoms), poorer sleep (more nocturnal awakenings, more stage 2 sleep, less slow wave sleep), and faster decreasing evening cortisol secretion compared to full-term children. Across the whole sample, more stage 2 sleep and/or less slow wave sleep were associated with more SDQ total behavioral/emotional difficulties, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer problems. Lower morning cortisol secretion and lower evening cortisol secretion were associated with more conduct problems. In very preterm children, increased SDQ total behavioral/emotional difficulties was partially explained by less restorative sleep including more stage 2 sleep and less slow wave sleep. This result points to the importance of restorative sleep for the behavioral and emotional development of very preterm children during middle childhood. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The article presents the results of the empiric study of cognitive and personal factors of emotion regulation, risk of suicide, psychopathologic symptoms and self-injurious behavior. It is hypothesized that the risk of self-destructive behavior is connected to destructive cognitive strategics, dispositional factors of self-injurious and suicidal behavior and psychopathological symptoms. Participants: N=101, aged 13-21. Results: relations between scales of suicidal risk, psychopathological symptoms, self-injurious behavior and cognitive emotional regulation were revealed; differences between groups of instrumental and somatic self-injurers were shown; predictors of self-destructive behavior were defined by linear regression analysis. Summary: somatization, anxiety and psychoticism were related to factors of self-injurious behavior; connections between methods and factors of self-injurious behavior and factors of suicidal risk were discovered; cognitive emotional disregulation (rumination, self-accusation and accusation of others) were predictors of self- destructive behaviors and psychopathological symptoms.

AB Parents of children with significant externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems habitually report greater parenting stress compared to parents of children without these challenges. One avenue to alleviate parenting stress and ameliorate youth outcomes is youth mentoring, which includes a supportive adult paired with a child with the objective of engendering positive outcomes. The researcher sought to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of mentoring programs for children with significant externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems on parenting stress and youth outcomes and (b) explore moderator variables that may influence program effectiveness. Five studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Results revealed a small effect of these specialized mentoring programs on youth outcomes and parenting stress. Moderator analyses revealed program characteristics that enhance effectiveness. Mentoring programs that target children with significant behavioral and emotional problems may function as an additional service to improve youth outcomes and family functioning.

AB The importance of psychosocial factors in the management of bronchial asthma has long been recognized. This paper offers a review of research published in the English language related to psychosocial aspects of bronchial asthma in Arab countries. Several databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, ERIC, and PsychInfo) were searched using the following keywords: bronchial asthma, Arab countries, Algiers, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine (West Bank, Gaza), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Sudan, Somalia; United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Thirty-two studies were conducted in 9 Arab countries. Almost all studies found were published in the last fourteen years with an apparent increasing rate in the last five years. In descending order, these studies addressed: knowledge of and attitudes toward asthma, quality of life, behavioral and emotional problems and factors related to academic achievement.
   The main results of the studies reviewed were: (a) physicians', school staff's, and parents' knowledge of and attitudes toward asthma were generally unsatisfactory, (b) in-service asthma education programs significantly impacted parent and staff knowledge and attitudes, and asthma management practices, (c) quality of life in children and adolescents was significantly adversely affected by asthma, (d) asthma was a common cause of school absenteeism, and had a significant negative impact on academic achievement of students, and (e) students with asthma had significantly higher rates of behavioral and emotional difficulties compared to students without asthma. The paper concludes with a discussion about the implications of these results and a call for further research in this area.

AB Background: Perfectionism is understood as a set of personality traits such as unrealistically high and rigid standards for performance, fear of failure, and excessive self-criticism. Previous studies showed a direct association between increased perfectionism and poor sleep, though without taking into account possible mediating factors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that perfectionism was directly associated with poor sleep, and that this association collapsed, if mediating factors such as stress and poor emotion regulation were taken into account.
   Methods: Three hundred and forty six young adult students (M=23.87 years) completed questionnaires relating to perfectionism traits, sleep, and psychological functioning such as stress perception, coping with stress, emotion regulation, and mental toughness.
   Results: Perfectionism was directly associated with poor sleep and poor psychological functioning. When stress, poor coping, and poor emotion regulation were entered in the equation, perfectionism traits no longer contributed substantively to the explanation of poor sleep.
   Conclusion: Though perfectionism traits seem associated with poor sleep, the direct role of such traits seemed small, when mediating factors such as stress perception and emotion regulation were taken into account.

AB We examined the self-reported anxiety in different situations (social anxiety, cognitive fears, fears of injury) and the use of regulation strategies (problem orientation, problem avoidance and seeking social support) in a sample of N = 175 primary school children (mean age 8 years 4 months). At time of recruitment we oversampled for children with internalizing symptoms. In addition, mothers rated the overall anxiety of their children. According to their mothers 14.3 % of the children showed anxiety symptoms in an abnormal range which is comparable to prevalence rates of children from population samples. 19.4 % of the children described themselves as being anxious in an abnormal range. The correlations between different measures of children's self-reported anxieties were low to moderate. We found no significant correlations between mothers' and children's reports. The higher children's self-reported overall and cognitive anxiety, the more frequently they reported seeking social support in frightening situations. Girls reported more frequently pm cognitive fears than boys. Regarding regulation strategies we found that boys reported more problem orientation than girls whereas girls reported more social support seeking than boys. The results are discussed and practical implications are outlined.

ID PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Emotion regulation (ER) is extensively researched in the context of psychopathology It is quite controversial if deficits in ER are related to psychopathology across disorders or specifically linked to certain forms of psychopathology Furthermore, it appears unclear if there are differences in ER depending on the specific emotion to be regulated. There are only few studies comparing different forms of psychopathology in terms of ER, specifically in childhood and adolescence. We explored ER in a consecutive clinical sample seeking help in two outpatient university clinics (N = 129, age: 7-17 years, 45 % female). In a first step, the ER of all children and adolescents seeking professional help for emotional and behavioral problems was compared with the ER-characteristics of children and adolescents identified in school samples. In a second step, the clinical sample was divided into different groups of psychopathology, comparing the associations of different types of psychopathology with ER. ER in the clinical sample differed significantly from children and adolescents in school settings. The clinical sample was particularly characterized by a lack of adaptive strategies, and only partially by an increased use of maladaptive strategies. Further analysis revealed no specific deficits in the ER depending on types of psychopathology The findings suggest a transdiagnostic and emotion-overarching conceptualization of ER in childhood and adolescence.

AB From an attachment perspective, insecure attachment patterns in both infancy and adolescence are risk factors for the development of anxiety disorders in adolescence. Dysfunctional emotion regulation and biased social information processing are possible mediating processes. This study examines differences in emotion regulation, emotional vulnerability, and behaviour inhibition in adolescents with clinical diagnosis of anxiety disorder and healthy controls. Adolescents with anxiety disorder reported more maladaptive emotion regulation depending on the specific emotion and a higher incidence of reporting hurt feelings in social interactions. In contrast, behaviour inhibition did not explain additional variance. The results suggest that adolescents with anxiety disorders show a bias in the interpretation of social interactions as frequently emotionally hurting, and the use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists. The results are interpreted within attachment framework.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate family functioning in families with an adolescent survivor of a pediatric brain tumor. We explored whether adolescent, parent, disease and treatment factors, and demographic characteristics predicted family functioning.
   MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 45 adolescent survivors of pediatric brain tumors and their parents completed self-report questionnaires on family functioning, and emotional and behavioral problems. Parents completed questionnaires on their own mental health and the burden of treatment.
   ResultsCompared to general population norms, adolescents reported higher levels of cohesion, expressiveness, organization, control, family values and social orientation, and absence of conflict. Parents reported higher levels of social orientation and lower levels of conflict and family values. The only predictor of family functioning was current age of the adolescent; older adolescents reported less family conflict. No relation was found between family functioning and emotional and behavioral problems, disease- or treatment factors, and demographic variables.
   ConclusionsIn this exploratory study, adolescent survivors of a pediatric brain tumor characterized their families by higher levels of cohesion, expressiveness, organization, control, family values and social orientation, and absence of conflict, which differs from the more normative view held by their parents. A higher adolescent age predicted less family conflict, which may indicate deviant autonomy development in these survivors. Because of limitations of this study, conclusions should be considered provisional; they provide clues for further research in this area. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this overview the main focus will be the shame and emotion regulation based on definitions of the early development of the self. Even at the age of four first indication in social behavior of children could be observed such as shyness with strangers and withdrawal. The age in which social anxiety symptoms can be observed for the first time is the puberty. In the puberty the drive fear leads to a labialization of the self that impresses especially the narcissistic vulnerability. Feelings of shame signalize poorly integrated and incongruent parts of the self. Therefore, it can be concluded that is an extremely important dimension of the entire development process of the personality and the interpersonal regulation.

AB Background. Mothers' self-reported stroking of their infants over the first weeks of life modifies the association between prenatal depression and physiological and emotional reactivity at 7 months, consistent with animal studies of the effects of tactile stimulation. We now investigate whether the effects of maternal stroking persist to 2.5 years. Given animal and human evidence for sex differences in the effects of prenatal stress we compare associations in boys and girls.
   Method. From a general population sample of 1233 first-time mothers recruited at 20 weeks gestation we drew a random sample of 316 for assessment at 32 weeks, stratified by reported inter-partner psychological abuse, a risk indicator for child development. Of these mothers, 243 reported at 5 and 9 weeks how often they stroked their infants, and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 2.5 years post-delivery.
   Results. There was a significant interaction between prenatal anxiety and maternal stroking in the prediction of CBCL internalizing (p= 0.001) and anxious/depressed scores (p< 0.001). The effects were stronger in females than males, and the three-way interaction prenatal anxietyxmaternal strokingxsex of infant was significant for internalizing symptoms (p= 0.003). The interactions arose from an association between prenatal anxiety and internalizing symptoms only in the presence of low maternal stroking.
   Conclusions. The findings are consistent with stable epigenetic effects, many sex specific, reported in animal studies. While epigenetic mechanisms may be underlying the associations, it remains to be established whether stroking affects gene expression in humans.

AB Contributing to the current debate in the literature about the optimal educational parenting style that benefits the best psychosocial adjustment of children, the aim of this study was to analyze which parenting style is related to the best psychological adjustment among Spanish adolescents. Participants in the study were 772 adolescents, 358 males (46.4%) and 414 females (53.6%) between 12 and 17 years old (M = 14.95, SD = 1.59). Families were classified according to their parenting style (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, or neglectful). Self-concept and psychological maladjustment in their multidimensional measures were assessed as criteria. Results showed that indulgent style, fundamentally based on affection and not on parental imposition, is related to the best results on the criteria assessed. The importance of parental affective involvement in the socialization of their children for the adequate psychological and emotional adjustment of Spanish adolescents is highlighted.

AB The study aimed to know the learning difficulties presented by children and adolescents who received psychopedagogical assistance in a support service belonging to a university in rio grande do sul. Data were evaluated by bardin content analysis. Results point a high rate of affective and emotional difficulties in children. The findings show the importance of understanding the role of emotional processes in the development of learning disabilities. It also discusses the need for a proposal for teacher training of children whose files were analyzed. This training should not be limited to the appropriation of an instrumental technician that offers a prescription for efficiency, the development of a more appropriate schooling for children with emotional difficulties also involves the teacher-student relationship. It is necessary to construct a dialogue that respects the existence between the parties, characterized by listening to the other, the desire to discover, understand and respect the student as an individual who brings his story, its difficulties, but it also carries a set of potential to learn and develop.

For the duration of the course in three secondary schools in Hong Kong high dropout rate and low attendance rate among the participants were recorded. Interviews with the students revealed that most students were not interested in the mindfulness course because of the quiet and static nature of mindfulness activities. Based on these findings, possible ways of improving the course are proposed.

The present study investigated whether youth's anger regulation coping might attenuate the positive association between peer victimization and subsequent aggressive behavior. Longitudinal data from 485 7th-grade students (55% female, mean age = 12.84 years) and their teachers were collected in the fall and six months later. Teacher ratings of youth aggressive behavior at follow-up were the primary outcome, with statistical adjustments for baseline aggressive behavior and demographics. Results from multilevel models showed significant interactive effects of baseline anger regulation and peer victimization on residualized teacher-rated aggressive behaviors that were consistent with the hypothesis that anger regulation played a protective role: under high levels of peer victimization, youth with higher levels of anger regulation displayed lower levels of aggressive behavior than their counterparts with lower levels of anger regulation. These findings suggest that targeting and improving students' ability to regulate their anger may be protective in the face of peer victimization and reduce subsequent aggressive behavior.

Evoked facial affect was recorded whilst AN and control participants (n=34) viewed emotional films. Significantly less facial affect was found in AN adolescents, despite reporting no differences in subjective emotion experience. These findings correspond with previous studies in adults with AN. Altered facial affect may impair interpersonal functioning and contribute to illness maintenance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of this study is to examine emotional processing of infant displays in people with Eating Disorders (EDs).
   Background: Social and emotional factors are implicated as causal and maintaining factors in EDs. Difficulties in emotional regulation have been mainly studied in relation to adult interactions, with less interest given to interactions with infants.
   Method: A sample of 138 women were recruited, of which 49 suffered from Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 16 from Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and 73 were healthy controls (HCs). Attentional responses to happy and sad infant faces were tested with the visual probe detection task. Emotional identification of, and reactivity to, infant displays were measured using self-report measures. Facial expressions to video clips depicting sad, happy and frustrated infants were also recorded.
   Results: No significant differences between groups were observed in the attentional response to infant photographs. However, there was a trend for patients to disengage from happy faces. People with EDs also reported lower positive ratings of happy infant displays and greater subjective negative reactions to sad infants. Finally, patients showed a significantly lower production of facial expressions, especially in response to the happy infant video clip. Insecure attachment was negatively correlated with positive facial expressions displayed in response to the happy infant and positively correlated with the intensity of negative emotions experienced in response to the sad infant video clip.
   Conclusion: People with EDs do not have marked abnormalities in their attentional processing of infant emotional faces. However, they do have a reduction in facial affect particularly in response to happy infants. Also, they report greater negative reactions to sadness, and rate positive emotions less intensively than HCs. This pattern of emotional responsivity suggests abnormalities in social reward sensitivity and might indicate new treatment targets.

AB Mental illness is common amongst young people living in residential care, many of whom are reluctant to avail of therapeutic help. The potential value of computer games as therapeutic tools for these young people has received very little attention, despite indications of their potential for promoting engagement in therapeutic work and improving mental health outcomes. This study aimed to fill this research gap through the development, introduction, and preliminary evaluation of a therapeutic intervention in group care settings. The intervention incorporated a commercially available computer game (The SIMS Life StoriesTM) and emotion regulation skill coaching. Qualified residential social workers were trained to deliver it to young people in three children's homes in Northern Ireland, where therapeutic approaches to social work had been introduced. The research was framed as an exploratory case study which aimed to determine the acceptability and potential therapeutic value of this intervention. The evidence suggests that computer-game based interventions of this type may have value as therapeutic tools in group care settings and deserve further development and empirical investigation to determine their effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes.

AB Sibling relationships are a powerful influence on child development one that takes on particular significance in contexts of familial disruption or adversity. This study examined the effect of sibling co-placements during foster care on subsequent educational competence, occupational competence, housing quality, relational adjustment and civic engagement in a sample of 170 recently emancipated foster youth (66.5% female; Mage = 19.63). Analyses evaluated direct relations between the proportion of time spent with a sibling in foster placement and young adult adjustment outcomes, as well as indirect effects from sibling co-placement to later competence through youth's coherence displayed in a narrative of experiences in foster care. The coherence of life narratives develops in the context of primary relationships, including those with siblings, through co-constructed meaning making and emotional discourse, particularly regarding difficult life events. Emancipated foster youth's verbal narratives about their experiences in foster care were evaluated for narrative coherence based on the organization, complexity, and balance of youth's narratives. Analyses documented significant indirect effects of sibling co-placement on young adult competence through narrative coherence. Moreover, moderation analyses indicated that these effects were particularly robust among males. Findings are discussed with respect to relational mechanisms underlying resilience, and the potential for sibling co-placement to provide a relational context for risk and resilience among emancipated foster youth.

AB Anxiety is one of the most common clinical problems among children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet we know little about its etiology in the context of ASD. We posit that emotion regulation (ER) impairments are a risk factor for anxiety in ASD. Specifically, we propose that one reason why anxiety disorders are so frequently comorbid with ASD is because ER impairments are ubiquitous to ASD, stemming from socio-cognitive, physiological, and neurological processes related to impaired cognitive control, regulatory processes, and arousal. In this review, we offer a developmental model of how ER impairments may arise in ASD, and when (moderating influences) and how (meditational mechanisms) they result in anxiety. (C) 2014 ISDN.

AB The prevalence of depression is high in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), but its etiology has not yet been studied in this group. Emotion dysregulation is a well-known contributor to the development of depression in typically developing (TD) children, which might also apply to children with ASD. In this study, we examined the longitudinal relationship between three different ways of emotion regulation (approach, avoidance and worry/rumination) and depressive symptoms in children with ASD and a group of TD children which were compatible with the ASD group (age 9-15-years old). Children filled out self-report questionnaires at 3 time points (with a 9-month break between each session). To account for missing data multiple imputations were used. A regression model with clustered bootstrapping was used to establish which factors contributed to depression and to identify possible differences between the ASD and TD group. Approach and avoidant strategies prevented the development of depressive symptoms in both respective groups, whereas elevated levels of worry/rumination in turn increased children's depressive symptoms. Besides differences in absolute levels (children with ASD scored higher on symptoms of depression and lower on approach strategies than the TD group), no other differences between the groups emerged.

AB Despite considerable research on why antisocial behavior develops and interventions that reduce it, aspects of everyday family processes that may promote naturally occurring declines in antisocial behavior or that may result from such declines in most children without intervention are poorly understood. The current study explored family processes that may enable children to replace antisocial tendencies and the effects that declines in antisocial behavior may have on parenting and child regulatory processes. Longitudinal data from 1,022 children (54 months-6th grade) from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were examined. Findings demonstrated that naturally occurring declines in antisocial behavior both predicted and were predicted by maternal sensitivity, emotion regulation, and social skills. These declines predicted but were not predicted by declines in hostile attributions. The data revealed multiple indirect paths, which highlight the complex nature of these variables across development.

AB Individuals with gender dysphoria experience distress associated with incongruence between their biologic sex and their identified gender. Gender dysphoric natal males receive treatment with antiandrogens and estrogens to become feminized (transsexual females), whereas natal females with gender dysphoria receive treatment with androgens to become masculinized (transsexual males). Because of the permanence associated with cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT), adolescents diagnosed with gender dysphoria receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to suppress puberty. High rates of depression and suicide are linked to social marginalization and barriers to care. Behavior, emotional problems, depressive symptoms, and global functioning improve in adolescents receiving puberty suppression therapy. Gender dysphoria, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and sexual function improve in adults who receive CSHT. Within the first 6months of CSHT, changes in transsexual females include breast growth, decreased testicular volume, and decreased spontaneous erections, and changes in transsexual males include cessation of menses, breast atrophy, clitoral enlargement, and voice deepening. Both transsexual females and males experience changes in body fat redistribution, muscle mass, and hair growth. Desired effects from CSHT can take between 3 and 5years; however, effects that occur during puberty, such as voice deepening and skeletal structure changes, cannot be reversed with CSHT. Decreased sexual desire is a greater concern in transsexual females than in transsexual males, with testosterone concentrations linked to sexual desire in both. Regarding CSHT safety, bone mineral density is preserved with adequate hormone supplementation, but long-term fracture risk has not been studied. The transition away from high-dose traditional regimens is tied to a lower risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease, but data quality is poor. Breast cancer has been reported in both transsexual males and females, but preliminary data suggest that CSHT does not increase the risk. Cancer screenings for individuals of both natal and transitioned sexes should occur as recommended. More long-term studies are needed to ensure that CSHT regimens with the best outcomes can continue to be prescribed for the transsexual population.

AB The literature indicates increasing evidence showing the benefits of classroom-based, universal preventive interventions for mental health and the link between social and emotional learning and academic performance. The FRIENDS program has been extensively tested and has showed promising results not only for preventing childhood anxiety, but also for improving students' self-concept, social skills and coping skills. However, when it comes to communities in disadvantage, the results are mixed, with some studies reporting the need to include enhancements to the context in which the program is implemented to better support communities at risk. A combined intervention aiming to promote students' social-emotional skills was piloted in a school located in a low socio-economic status area. Teachers received training to teach social and emotional skills for students and a resilience program for themselves. Students' social-emotional outcomes were assessed at pre, post, 3 and 6 months following the intervention. Results showed that the intervention helped students to decrease their anxiety, and the intervention was well accepted by participants.

AB This study had two objectives: 1) evaluating the effects of an intervention program to develop social skills (communication, empathy, emotional regulation) in behavioral, cognitive and emotional variables; and 2) exploring whether the program affects differentially by gender. The sample comprised 148 adolescents, aged 13-16 years (83 experimental, 65 control). The study used a quasi-experimental repeated measures pretest-posttest design with a control group. Before and after the program four assessment instruments were administered: Social Attitudes and Cognitive Strategies (Moraleda et al. 1998/2004), Empathy Questionnaire (Merhabian & Epstein, 1972), Emotional Quotient Questionnaire (Bar-On & Parker, 2000), and Questionnaire of cognitive strategies of social interaction. The ANCOVAs pretest-posttest confirmed that the program significantly stimulated (p< .05) an increase in: 1) positive social behaviors (social conformity, help-collaboration, self-assurance-firmness), 2) empathy, 3) emotional intelligence (intrapersonal, interpersonal, general mood), and 4) cognitive strategies of social interaction assertive. The discussion focuses on the importance of implementing programs to promote social-emotional development during adolescence.

AB This paper reviews the empirical literature on the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression (i.e., unipolar depressive disorders and symptoms) among children and adolescents. Findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published on the co-occurrence of ADHD and depression were summarized and subjected to a meta-analysis. Results (k = 29, N = 8755; rbar = 0.22) indicated that ADHD and depression were positively related, but substantial variability existed across the studies. Subgroup analyses indicated medium positive effects for cross-sectional studies, studies that operationalized ADHD based on DSM-III or DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, and studies that did not include teacher report in the assessment of ADHD. Subgroup analyses showed a large positive effect for studies that operationalized ADHD based on DSM-III-R criteria and studies using clinic referred samples. In contrast, subgroup analyses indicated a small negative and/or unreliable association between ADHD and depression for longitudinal studies, studies using DSM-II diagnostic criteria for hyperkinetic reaction of childhood or used a dichotomous motor hyperactivity criterion, studies that used nonreferred samples, and studies including teacher report in the assessment of ADHD. When studies that used DSM-II diagnostic criteria were removed, a reliable medium effect was found for studies that included teacher report. Similarly when the study that used idiosyncratic methods of diagnosing ADHD was excluded, a reliable medium effect was found for studies that used nonreferred samples. Potential explanations for the findings are discussed, including explanations based on sampling and base rates, artifacts of diagnostic criteria, inaccurate diagnostic boundaries, and etiological relationships. Directions for future research and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the consistency of discrepancy scores between adolescent and parent reports across several psychosocial constructs (adolescent internalizing, externalizing, emotion regulation difficulties, parent rewarding responses to adolescent emotions, and parent depressive symptoms). Sixty-two adolescents (67.7% females; 76.7% African American) and one of their parents participated. Most of the associations among discrepancy scores were equivalent. There was one instance in which the association among two discrepancy scores (youth internalizing and externalizing) was stronger than the others and one instance in which the association was weaker than the others (youth internalizing and parent rewarding). These results suggest that discrepancies between adolescent and parent reports are not necessarily a stable characteristic of the dyad and depend on the construct under consideration.

AB This short-term longitudinal study investigated whether attitudes about academic helpseeking, social competence, and self-compassion mediated the relations between parental attachment and college student adjustment. Two hundred and four first-year students completed measures of parental attachment and the proposed mediators at the beginning of their first semester. At the end of the semester, students reported on their academic, social, and personal/emotional adjustment. Results showed that attitudes about academic helpseeking mediated the attachment-academic adjustment relation and social competence mediated the attachment-social adjustment relation. Personal/emotional adjustment largely was predicted by initial personal/emotional adjustment. These findings suggest that help-seeking attitudes and social competence could be fruitful targets of intervention for personnel working with college students who have strained parental relationships.

AB One in five adolescents in the United States has engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), one in eight have had serious thoughts of suicide, and one in 25 have attempted suicide. Research suggests that NSSI may increase risk for suicide attempt, yet little is known about the relationship between NSSI and suicidal ideation or attempts. In a primary care setting, 1,561 youth aged 14-24years completed a brief, comprehensive, mental health screen as part of a routine well visit to determine which factors were most likely to predict suicidal ideation and attempt among youth engaging in NSSI. Results of recursive partitioning revealed that current depression and history of alcohol use best differentiated youth engaging in NSSI with low versus high risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. This simple algorithm is presented as a clinical screening tool that might aid medical providers in determining which youth would benefit from more intensive assessment and intervention.

AB Exercise can be used as a mood regulator but, in the eating disorder literature, exercise has sometimes been found to be compulsive, detrimental to physical health, and regarded as one maladaptive strategy used to regulate emotions. This study examined longitudinal associations between emotion regulation styles and this compulsive exercise in 572 adolescents who completed measures of compulsive exercise and emotion regulation. Twelve months later they completed measures of compulsive exercise. Compulsive exercise was predicted by Internal Dysfunctional emotion regulation in girls and boys, even after controlling for initial levels of compulsive exercise. Adolescents displaying compulsivity to exercise may require intervention programmes to alter their emotion regulation strategies.

AB Objective: Youth in war-affected regions are at risk for poor psychological, social, and educational outcomes. Effective interventions are needed to improve mental health, social behavior, and school functioning. This randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based group mental health intervention for multisymptomatic war-affected youth (aged 15-24 years) in Sierra Leone. Method: War-affected youth identified by elevated distress and impairment via community screening were randomized (stratified by sex and age) to the Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI) (n = 222) or to a control condition (n = 214). After treatment, youth were again randomized and offered an education subsidy immediately (n = 220) or waitlisted (n = 216). Emotion regulation, psychological distress, prosocial attitudes/behaviors, social support, functional impairment, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed at pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. For youth in school, enrollment, attendance, and classroom performance were assessed after 8 months. Linear mixed-effects regressions evaluated outcomes. Results: The YRI showed significant postintervention effects on emotion regulation, prosocial attitudes/behaviors, social support, and reduced functional impairment, and significant follow-up effects on school enrollment, school attendance, and classroom behavior. In contrast, education subsidy was associated with better attendance but had no effect on mental health or functioning, school retention, or classroom behavior. Interactions between education subsidy and YRI were not significant. Conclusion: YRI produced acute improvements in mental health and functioning as well as longer-term effects on school engagement and behavior, suggesting potential to prepare war-affected youth for educational and other opportunities.

AB BackgroundConduct Disorder (CD) is among the most highly represented diagnostic problems in child and adolescent mental health treatment settings. There is a great deal of heterogeneity within the CD category, with potentially important implications for case conceptualization and treatment. The current review sought to detail forms of heterogeneity within CD, including callous-unemotional traits, comorbid Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), aggressive and nonaggressive antisocial behavior, and age of onset.
   MethodsThe current review summarizes research on etiological factors, correlates, and trajectories associated with distinguishable dimensions of CD, and considers how this heterogeneity should be incorporated into the assessment and treatment of CD.
   ResultsCallous-unemotional traits have been associated with a more severe and persistent form of CD, as have comorbid ADHD and child-onset CD. Aggressive antisocial behavior is a stable behavioral dimension that emerges in early childhood and is associated with high levels of neuroticism. Nonaggressive antisocial behavior demonstrates specific associations with impulsivity, is most frequent during adolescence, and evidences more moderate levels of stability.
   ConclusionsConduct disorder is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Although the clinical implications of this heterogeneity are discussed, future research is clearly needed to shore up our understanding of the clinical ramifications of the sub-dimensions within CD.

AB The aim of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of a new clinical program integrating psychology services within a pediatric outpatient cardiology clinic. Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) (n = 79) were referred for psychological services by their pediatric cardiologist. Parents completed the child behavior checklist, and the pediatric quality of life inventory generic core scales (PedsQL parent report). Teachers completed the teacher report form. Reasons for referral included: emotional problems (29 %); attention problems (25 %); learning problems (22 %); behavior problems (16 %); and developmental delay (8 %). Parents and teachers reported higher rates of behavior problems and lower quality of life scores than the general population. Psychological evaluation suggested that incorporating a psychologist within a pediatric cardiology clinic may be beneficial for children with CHD in order to optimize their psychosocial functioning. Practice implications for implementing psychology services within a pediatric outpatient cardiology program are discussed.

AB This study examined the effectiveness of 'Emotion-Based Social Skills Training (EBSST)' a manualised social-emotional intervention designed to improve emotional competence in school-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants were 217 children (aged 7-13 years) with ASD without Intellectual Disability attending 41 mainstream primary schools in NSW Australia. Data on emotional competence, social skills and mental health difficulties were collected using teacher and parent informant report questionnaires in a pre-test/post-test control group design. One hundred and six students took part in the treatment and 111 students were in the control group. School Counsellors delivered the 16 session treatment to groups of 3-8 students in their schools. Teachers and parents also received six sessions of EBSST in separate groups. Participants received a booster session at six months follow-up. EBSST improved teacher reported emotional competence as measured by the Emotions Development Questionnaire (EDQ). The effect size was large and improvements were sustained at 6 months follow-up. Parent reported emotional competence and more general measures of social skills and mental health were insensitive to change across informants. This study has important implications for students, teachers and parents and provides a valuable basis for further research and development of EBSST and the EDQ. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Social Emotional Health Survey (SEHS) was developed with the aim of assessing core cognitive dispositions associated with adolescents' positive psychosocial development. Using a new sample, the present study sought to extend previous SEHS research by coadministering it with the Behavioral Emotional Screening System (BESS). The sample included 2,240 students in Grades 9-12 from two comprehensive high schools located in a major west coast USA city. A majority of the students were of Latino/a heritage (72 %) and had experienced disadvantaged economic circumstances (80 % at school 1 and 68 % at school 2). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the original SEHS factor structure composed of the first-order constructs of belief-in-self, belief-in-others, emotional competence, and engaged living, which parsimoniously mapped on to a second-order "covitality" factor. Complete factorial invariance was found across four groups formed by crossing gender (male, female) and age (ages 13-15, ages 16-18). Latent means analysis found several small to moderate effects size differences, primarily for the belief-in-self and belief-in-others first-order latent traits. A SEM analysis found that the SEHS measurement model, including covitality was a significant negative predictor of psychological distress as measured by the BESS and was positively associated with students' end-of-semester grade point average. The discussion focuses on implications for conceptualizing the core psychological components of adolescents' positive quality of life and how schools can use the SEHS as part of a whole-school procedure to screen for students' complete mental health.

AB This paper reports on a prospective study exploring risk factors specifically related to the onset of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) during adolescence. We examined cumulative incidence and predictors of onset of NSSI over 1 year among 1,973 school-based adolescents (13-19 years old; M = 14.9, SD = 0.96) from five states in Australia. Data showed cumulative incidence of 3.8 % (95 % CI [3.0-4.7 %]) over 1 year. Multiple socio-demographic and psychosocial factors were assessed using sequential logistic regression models. Onset of NSSI was associated with being female (OR = 3.47, 95 % CI [1.48-8.18]), being born outside of Australia (OR = 3.05, 95 % CI [1.10-8.47]), not identifying as religious or spiritual (OR = 1.80, 95 % CI [1.04-3.10]), increased psychological distress (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI [1.08-1.16]), poor social support from family (OR = 0.89, 95 % CI [0.83-0.95]), poor self-esteem (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI [0.83-0.98]), and poor problem-solving coping (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI [0.82-0.99]). These findings may assist to better identify young people more likely to start self-injuring and also highlight issues to provide a focus for prevention initiatives.

AB In recent years, increasing concern regarding non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents has prompted investigation of factors that may prevent this behavior. This study examined the relationship between psychological distress and NSSI in a community sample of adolescents, and the moderating effect of both optimism and rumination on this association. Two thousand five hundred seventy-two participants (12-18 years) completed self-report questionnaires assessing psychological distress, cognitive, and emotional characteristics, and NSSI history. Ten percent of the sample reported a history of NSSI, and as hypothesized, optimism moderated the relationship between psychological distress and NSSI; the association was only evident when optimism was low. Rumination was not found to moderate the relationship between psychological distress and NSSI. These findings highlight the utility of considering optimism in NSSI prevention and early intervention programs.

AB Mental health problems in children and adolescents, especially those of immigrant backgrounds, have been of major concern in recent literature. Symptoms of emotional, conduct, or a combination of these problems, furthermore, can impact, and be impacted by, school-related outcomes, such as perceived school stress, classmate support, and teacher support. The present study assessed whether having high levels of such symptoms would predict these school outcomes in 2,248 Norwegian adolescent students between fifth and eighth grades, 51 % of whom were of immigrant background. Seventy-three percent of the immigrant students were second generation. Findings indicate that there are more similarities than differences between immigrant and non-immigrant youth. Immigrant and non-immigrant girls did not differ in prevalence of any symptom category, while immigrant and non-immigrant boys did not differ in conduct problems or comorbid emotional and conduct problems. More immigrant than non-immigrant boys in our sample were in the high-risk group of emotional problems, indicating that this may be a particularly vulnerable group. Our results indicate that disordered symptom groups better explained perceived school stress and classmate support than immigrant status. School stress and low support from classmates were associated with high risk for emotional, conduct, and comorbid problems for all youth, regardless of immigrant status. These findings are encouraging because they indicate that second generation immigrant youth in Norway may not be at greater risk for developing emotional and conduct problems when compared to their non-immigrant peers.

AB Youth with autism spectrum disorder often struggle to cope with co-occurring anxiety, depression, or anger, and having both internalizing and externalizing symptoms is a common clinical presentation. A number of authors have designed cognitive-behavioral interventions to address transdiagnostic factors related to multiple emotional problems, although none have applied this focus to youth with ASD. The current review article describes how a transdiagnostic emotion regulation framework may inform cognitive-behavioral interventions for youth with ASD, which until now have focused almost exclusively on anxiety. Research is needed to empirically test how a transdiagnostic intervention can address the processes of emotion regulation and assist youth with ASD to cope with their emotional disorders.

AB Recent research shows that children with motor coordination problems (or developmental coordination disorder - DCD) show deficits in not only cool executive function (EF), but also hot EF. We aimed to determine whether this deficit of hot EF is due to heightened sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, specifically, or to a general deficit of cognitive control, like inhibition. Using two versions of a go/no-go task, one with neutral facial expressions and the other with happy and fearful faces, we compared 12 children with DCD with 28 typically-developing children, aged 7-12 years. Like earlier studies, children responded faster to happy faces. Both groups showed comparable accuracy in response to go targets, and also had similar commission errors, except when the no-go stimulus was a happy face. Importantly, the DCD group made significantly more commission errors to happy faces failing to suppress their response on more than half of the no-go trials. These results suggest a heightened sensitivity to emotionally significant distractors in DCD; this type of impulsivity may undermine self-regulation in DCD, with possible implications for adaptive function and emotional well-being. We argue that the interaction of cognitive control and emotion processing networks may be disrupted in DCD or delayed in development.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of psychological problems Iranian children and adolescents have, using parent report form of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Methods: In a community-based study, 9636 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years were selected using the multistage cluster random sampling method from five provinces of Iran: Tehran, Isfahan, Fars, Razavi Khorasan and East Azerbaijan. The parents completed the SDQ, which consisted of five subscales including emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems and prosocial behaviors.
   Result: The results revealed 21.4% of emotional problems, 32.9% of conduct problems, 20% of hyperactivity, 25.6% of peer problems, 7.6% of problems in prosocial behaviors and 16.7% of total difficulties among Iranian children and adolescents. We found that emotional problems were more prevalent among girls, while conduct problems, hyperactivity, total difficulties and problems in prosocial behaviors were more prevalent among boys. High educational level of parents was a protective factor against some psychological problems.
   Conclusion: Considering the proportion of psychological problems in Iranian children and adolescents, we need to develop and implement special policies and programs to provide appropriate mental health services.

AB Objective: Nonhuman and human studies have documented the adverse effects of early life stress (ELS) on emotion regulation and underlying neural circuitry. Less is known about how these experiences shape social processes and neural circuitry. In this study, we thus investigated how ELS affects children's perception of, and neural response to, negative social experiences in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Method: Twenty-five foster or adopted children with ELS (age 10.6 +/- 1.8 years, 13 male and 12 female) and 26 matched nonseparated controls (age 10.38 +/- 1.7 years, 12 male and 14 female) took part in a Cyberball paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: During peer rejection, children with ELS reported significantly more feelings of exclusion and frustration than nonseparated controls. On the neural level, children with ELS showed reduced activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and reduced connectivity between dlPFC-dACC, areas previously implicated in affect regulation. Conversely, children with ELS showed increased neural activation in brain regions involved in memory, arousal, and threat-related processing (middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area) relative to controls during social exclusion. The number of separation experiences before entering the permanent family predicted reductions in fronto-cingulate recruitment. The relationship between early separations and self-reported exclusion was mediated by dlPFC activity. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ELS leads to alterations in neural circuitry implicated in the regulation of socioemotional processes. This neural signature may underlie foster children's differential reactivity to rejection in everyday life and could increase risk for developing affective disorders.

AB Growing interest in emotion regulation is reflected in the studies of cognitive and social development. However, the extant studies mainly highlight how emotion regulation develops based on a western value system. This study utilised a longitudinal design to examine the development of emotion regulation and explored the contributions of different regulatory strategies to emotion experience regarding the early adolescent development period in a Chinese population. A total of 303 Chinese adolescents (age range = 10-14 years) were followed up in a three-phase longitudinal study for 3 years. In each phase of the study, participants completed Adolescents Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and Daily Emotion Scale. Results of hierarchical linear regressions revealed that Chinese adolescents reported more down-regulation. Down-regulation is more effective than up-regulation in enhancing desirable emotion experience and reducing undesirable emotion experience during adolescents' development. Also, the adaptive functions of emotional regulatory strategies in Chinese background were discussed.

AB Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of disease and death in the United States, and smoking typically begins in adolescence. It is therefore important to understand factors that relate to increased risk for cigarette smoking during this stage of development. Adolescence is a period when emotion regulatory capacities are still emerging and a common affective state to be regulated is anger, which adult research has linked to nicotine use. Drawing from work suggesting that negative affect reduction motives are one of the most common reasons for cigarette smoking, the current study was designed to evaluate the indirect effects of negative affect reduction motives on the relation between anger dysregulation and nicotine use within a sample of 119 treatment-seeking adolescents enrolled in group-based residential therapy. Results were generally consistent with hypotheses, suggesting significant indirect effects of negative affect reduction smoking motives on the relation between anger dysregulation and smoking outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of negative affect reduction motives for cigarette use in the context of anger regulation among youths. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives To examine the prevalence of school bullying and to investigate the behavioral, emotional, socio-economic and demographic correlates of bullying behaviors among Indian school going adolescents
   . Methods Self-reports on bullying involvement were collected from 9th to 10th class students (N=209; Mean=14.82 y, SD=0.96) from Government and Private schools of a north Indian city. Four groups of adolescents were identified: bullies, victims, bully-victims, and non-involved students. The self concept of the child was measured by the Indian adaptation of the Piers Harris Children's Self Concept Scale (CSCS) and emotional and behavioral difficulties by the Youth self report measure of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results The overall prevalence of any kind of bullying behavior was 53 %. One-fifth (19.2 %) of the children were victims of bullying. Boys were more likely to be bully-victims (27.9 %) and girls were more likely to be victims (21.6 %). Bullying status was significantly related to the total self concept scores of the students (F=5.12, P=0.002). Victimized adolescents reported the lowest self concept scores. Bully-victims had a higher risk for conduct problems and hyperactivity and were the most likely to have academic difficulties. Bullies had relatively better school grades and high self esteem but had higher risk for hyperactivity and conduct problems as compared to controls.
   Conclusions Bullying and victimization was widespread among the Indian school going youth. Given the concurrent psychosocial adjustment problems associated with bullying, there is an urgent need for developing intervention programs and sensitizing school personnel.

AB Research suggests that adverse events in childhood, such as childhood physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, confer risk for later sexual assault. Psychological distress, coping strategies, and sexual behavior may help explain the path from childhood abuse to revictimization. The present study explored how the use of sex to regulate negative affect (SRNA) operates independently, and in combination with other psychosocial factors to increase college women's (N=541) risk of experiencing prospective adult sexual assault (ASA). Sequential multiple mediator models in Mplus were used to assess the effect of three different forms of childhood abuse on prospective ASA, both independently and while controlling for other forms of childhood abuse. The indirect effect of adolescent sexual assault (AdolSA), depressive symptoms, SRNA, and participants' response to a sex-related vignette was tested using bias-corrected bootstrapping. In the full path model, childhood emotional abuse and AdolSA predicted ASA, while childhood physical and sexual abuse were directly associated with AdolSA, but not ASA. Additionally, depressive symptoms and participants' estimate of their likely behavior in a sex-related vignette directly predicted prospective ASA. Results using bootstrapping revealed that a history of childhood abuse predicted prospective ASA via diverse direct and indirect paths, as well as through a similar multiple mediator path. Overall, findings suggest that a combination of affective, coping, and sexual expectancy factors contribute to risk for revictimization in adult survivors of childhood abuse. Future research directions and targets for risk-reduction programming are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anxiety disorders are associated with abnormalities in amygdala function and prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity. The majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have examined mean group differences in amygdala activation or connectivity in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders relative to controls, but emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in amygdala function are dependent on the timing of the task and may vary across the course of a scanning session. The goal of the present study was to extend our knowledge of the dynamics of amygdala dysfunction by examining whether changes in amygdala activation and connectivity over scanning differ in pediatric anxiety disorder patients relative to typically developing controls during an emotion processing task. Examining changes in activation over time allows for a comparison of how brain function differs during initial exposure to novel stimuli versus more prolonged exposure. Participants included 34 anxiety disorder patients and 19 controls 7 to 19 years old. Participants performed an emotional face-matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, and the task was divided into thirds in order to examine change in activation over time. Results demonstrated that patients exhibited an abnormal pattern of amygdala activation characterized by an initially heightened amygdala response relative to controls at the beginning of scanning, followed by significant decreases in activation over time. In addition, controls evidenced greater context-modulated prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity during the beginning of scanning relative to patients. These results indicate that differences in emotion processing between the groups vary from initial exposure to novel stimuli relative to more prolonged exposure. Implications are discussed regarding how this pattern of neural activation may relate to altered early-occurring or anticipatory emotion-regulation strategies and maladaptive later-occurring strategies in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.

AB Can atypical patterns of parasympathetic nervous system activity serve as endophenotypes for depression? Using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as an index of parasympathetic nervous system function, we examined this question in two studies: one involving mothers with and without depression histories and their offspring (at high and low risk for depression, respectively), and a further study of adolescent sibling pairs concordant and discordant for major depression. In both studies, subjects were exposed to sad mood induction; subjects' RSA was monitored during rest periods and in response to the mood induction. We used Gottesman and Gould's (2003) criteria for an endophenotype and a priori defined atypical and normative RSA patterns (combinations of resting RSA and RSA reactivity). We found that atypical RSA patterns (a) predicted current depressive episodes and remission status among women with histories of juvenile onset depression and healthy controls, (b) predicted longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms among high- and low-risk young offspring, (c) were concordant across mothers and their juvenile offspring, (d) were more prevalent among never-depressed youth at high risk for depression than their low-risk peers, and (e) were more concordant across adolescent sibling pairs in which both versus only one had a history of major depression. Thus, the results support atypical RSA patterns as an endophenotype for depression. Possible mechanisms by which RSA patterns increase depression risk and their genetic contributors are discussed.

AB Depression, which is characterized by low positive affect (PA) and high negative affect.(NA), is relatively common during late adolescence and young adulthood. During this period, interaction with an increasing social sphere gains importance, and interest in romantic companions assumes a central role. However, little is known about how PA and NA manifest in the daily lives of depressed youth, particularly in romantic settings. Current companionship, location, and affect were assessed 4 to 6 times per day over 2 weeks in 51 adolescents and young adults (mean age = 18 years) with clinically-significant depressive symptoms. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the associations of companionship and location with changes in the between-person mean effects as well as the within-person covariation effects of PA and NA. Generally, when alone versus with people, PA decreased, NA increased, and changes in the levels of PA and NA were relatively independent of each other. In the context of romantic companionship, in general, PA increased and NA decreased, but these changes were more strongly inversely linked. The implications for understanding the emotional experiences of depressed youth, as well as informing the development of treatments for this population, are discussed.

AB This study examined internal risk factors associated with deliberate self-harm (DSH) in a sample of treatment-seeking women with histories of childhood abuse, using a cumulative risk approach. Sixty-seven women with histories of DSH were compared with a group of one-hundred women with no history of DSH on measures of adult attachment, emotion regulation, alexithymia, dissociation, self-soothing abilities, and frequency of previous suicide attempts. Bivariate analyses revealed that women in the DSH group presented with significantly higher levels of emotion dysregulation, alexithymia, dissociation, and a higher frequency of previous suicide attempts than woman in the non-DSH group. Logistic regression analyses revealed that a cumulative risk index (CRI) comprised of these six internal risk factors reliably distinguished between women with and without a history of DSH. Risk for DSH was found to increase with each risk factor that was added to the CRI model. Women endorsing five or more risk factors were 37 times more likely to be in the DSH group. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study examined longitudinal trajectories of parental involvement across middle and high school, and how these trajectories related to adolescents' academic, behavioral, and emotional adjustment. In addition, ethnic and socioeconomic status differences in longitudinal associations and the potential moderating role of parental warmth were assessed. Longitudinal growth modeling technique was used to describe trajectories of different types of parental involvement and adolescent outcomes over 7th, 9th, and 11th grades (mean ages = 12.9, 14.3, and 17.2 years, respectively) on an ethnically and economically diverse sample of 1,400 adolescents (51% female, 56% African American, 39% European American, 5% others). Each aspect of parental involvement contributed differentially but significantly to adolescent outcomes. Finally, parental warmth moderated the associations between providing structure at home and adolescent grade point average and problem behavior.

AB Whereas US-based data have contributed to our understanding of family composition changes over the last decades, data on Canadian families are limited, and previous studies have stressed the need for in depth, longitudinal investigations. This article begins to fill this gap in the literature by providing a current and detailed portrait of family composition changes from 1996 to 2008 (Study 1). Additionally, we performed an analysis of the role of specific child, parent and family characteristics, in interaction with family composition and family transition, in predicting pre-school children's behavioral outcomes (Study 2). Using nationally-representative Canadian data collected from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), we focus our inquiry on a mean sample for 0-5-year-olds of 2,866 children at cycle 8 (2008). Results show increases in non-traditional family households over time, as well as significant relationships between child characteristics, household characteristics, and family processes in predicting three behavioral outcomes: emotional problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and physical aggression.

AB Objectives. Although theorists acknowledge that beliefs about emotions may play a role in age-related emotion behavior, no research has explored these beliefs. This research examined beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions across the life span, especially across the adult years.
   Methods. Younger and older adults rated the extent to which infants, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults were likely to experience and express a range of emotions.
   Results. Younger and older adults held similar beliefs about the course of emotions across the life span. Moreover, these beliefs differed across emotion categories. In particular, although older adults were believed to experience and express fewer highly charged, negative emotions, they were expected to be more likely to experience and express positive, low arousal emotions, as well as negative, low arousal emotions. The experience and expression of positive, high arousal emotions were seen as more characteristic of very young age groups as opposed to older age groups.
   Discussion. These findings beg questions about if and how beliefs about emotion may affect age-related emotion regulation strategies and other everyday emotion-focused behaviors, as well as social reactions to older adults observed experiencing and expressing particular types of emotions.

AB Across species, kin bond together to promote survival. We sought to understand the dyadic effect of exclusion by kin (as opposed to non-kin strangers) on brain activity of the mother and her child and their subjective distress. To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism.

AB Recent findings suggest that perfectionism is highly prevalent among children and adolescents, and perfectionism can be quite destructive in terms of its links with anxiety, depression, and suicide. In this article, we provide an overview of recent research illustrating the costs and consequences of perfectionism among children and adolescents. We also highlight the heterogeneity that exists among perfectionists and the need for a complex, nuanced approach to assessment and prevention that reflects the achievement and interpersonal concerns of perfectionists. We then summarize past research on the prevention of perfectionism and show that perfectionism is pernicious and resistant to change. Accordingly, interventions must be tailored to address the cognitive and emotion regulation vulnerabilities of perfectionists and their meta-cognitive beliefs about ability, the self, and the meaning of failure. We conclude by discussing why it is essential to proactively design and implement preventive programs with specific components designed to enhance resilience and reduce levels of risk among perfectionists. We outline several themes that should be incorporated in preventive and intervention efforts designed to address the needs of vulnerable perfectionists.

AB Growing up in an inner city environment can inhibit healthy development and have detrimental consequences for children and adolescents such as increased risks for many social and psychological problems. This article explores the role of community arts centers in fostering resilience among youth living in the inner city. A review of the literature of risk factors associated with growing up in an inner city environment provides a rationale for the need for interventions that promote resilience by creating a refuge from the surrounding poverty and violence, and which strengthen youth's personal and social resources. We examine the case of the Artists Collective, an inner city community arts center in Hartford, Connecticut, and propose that there are three components of community arts centers that contribute to youths' resilience. First, features of the physical space promote resilience. Second, they are a place where prosocial relationships and social capital contributing to resilient functioning can be formed. Finally, we hypothesize that learning about and participating in the arts fosters resilience through the development of person-level protective factors such as self-efficacy, improved emotional regulation, social skills, coping skills, and ethnic pride.

AB Preclinical research has demonstrated the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on brain regions involved in emotional regulation, motivational control, and addiction vulnerability-eg, the ventral striatum (VS), anterior cingulate (ACC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, little is known about the function of these regions in human adolescents with PCE. Twenty-two adolescents with PCE and 22 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched non-cocaine exposed (NCE) adolescents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during exposure to individually personalized neutral/relaxing, stressful, and favorite-food cues. fMRI data were compared using group-level two-tailed t-tests in the BioImage Suite. In comparison with NCE adolescents, PCE adolescents had reduced activity within cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the VS, ACC, and medial and dorslolateral PFC during exposure to favorite-food cues but did not differ in neural responses to stress cues. Subjective food craving was inversely related to dorsolateral PFC activation among PCE adolescents. Among PCE adolescents, subjective anxiety ratings correlated inversely with activations in the orbitofrontal cortex and brainstem during the stress condition and with ACC, dorsolateral PFC, and hippocampus activity during the neutral relaxing condition. Thus adolescents with PCE display hypoactivation of brain regions involved in appetitive processing, with subjective intensities of craving and anxiety correlating inversely with extent of activation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which PCE might predispose to the development of addictions and related disorders, eg, substance-use disorders and binge-eating.

   DEPRESSION; INADEQUATE SLEEP
AB Purpose of review
   Extensive scientific efforts have been made in an attempt to identify early markers of behavioral and emotional problems. In this context, sleep has received considerable research attention, as it appears to be closely linked to developmental psychopathology. The present review synthesizes some of the most recent findings regarding the concurrent and longitudinal associations between psychopathology and behavioral manifestations of sleep in childhood and adolescence.
   Recent findings
   Recent evidence suggests that compromised sleep is associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems in childhood and adolescence. Moreover, sleep problems have been shown to predict the development of various emotional and behavioral problems, including depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, risk-taking and aggression. Yet, inconsistencies are apparent, particularly among findings that are based on objective sleep measurement.
   Summary
   Taken together, most recent findings suggest that poor sleep in childhood and adolescence constitutes a risk factor for psychopathological symptoms. Accordingly, the importance of early detection and intervention should be a primary goal in clinical settings. In the research domain, the underlying mechanism of these associations should receive future research attention, in an attempt to broaden the understanding of the relationship between sleep and psychopathology.

AB Prosociality represents an important aspect of social functioning in adolescents and is related to the risk of psychological problems. The current paper describes the development and psychometric testing of two new short-form versions of prosocial perceptions named the Brief Adolescent Prosocial Perceptions Scale Self- (BAPPS-S) and Parent-report (BAPPS-P). Parent and child dyads (N = 3,976; 89 % White; aged 11-17 years) took part in a large cross-sectional survey. The BAPPS were completed alongside other measures of prosociality, social support and emotional and behavioural problems. Exploratory (n = 1,988) and confirmatory (n = 1,988) factor analysis supported a single factor solution that is related to, although separate from, conduct disorders. The scales showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity. Moreover, the BAPPS demonstrated incremental validity by accounting for significant variance in clinical outcome measures over and above that explained by existing measures of prosociality. The study demonstrated that the BAPPS have good initial psychometric properties. Potential clinical uses are discussed, including providing valuable information on young people's strengths and resiliencies that can inform clinical formulation and intervention.

AB Scant research has examined links between particular emotion socialization processes and child emotion functioning cross-nationally. In this study, we assessed a sample of 55 families from the United States (U.S.; 28 boys and 27 girls) and 49 families from China (27 boys and 22 girls) on family emotional expressiveness and children's emotional experiences and regulation. Results indicated that children and families from the U.S. reported greater emotional expressiveness than their Chinese counterparts. Children from the U.S. also reported greater undercontrolled emotion than Chinese youth. Family expression of positive emotion was related to effortful emotion regulation in U.S. youth only, whereas family expression of negative emotion was associated with undercontrolled emotion for both U.S. and Chinese children. Our findings advance context-specific models of emotional development by illustrating similarities and differences in emotional functioning among U.S. and Chinese families. From a clinical perspective, the findings suggest that practitioners should consider the cultural variations of emotion communication within families when conducting both assessment and therapy.

AB Maternal expressed emotion (EE), including maternal criticism and emotional over-involvement, is considered an index of family emotional climate that is critical for children's psychological well-being. Limited research investigates how each element of EE differentially contributes to child behavior problems, or explores the mechanisms, such as child emotion dysregulation, through which parental EE influences child psychosocial outcomes. This study examined maternal EE, child emotion dysregulation, and child behavior problems among 60 mother-child dyads from a community sample, utilizing multi-method and multi-reporter assessment. Findings indicated that maternal expressed criticism toward the child was positively associated with child externalizing symptoms through its relation to increased child emotion dysregulation, whereas maternal emotional over-involvement was negatively associated with child externalizing symptoms through its negative relation to child emotion dysregulation. These results provided increased support for a model in which maternal criticism remains negatively associated with child psychosocial outcomes, but the construct of emotional over-involvement is not necessarily associated with youth psychosocial problems. This study also illustrated one pathway through which maternal EE influence child psychosocial functioning, thus placing EE research in the broader context of research on family emotion socialization.

AB Taking a family systems perspective, several research studies have shown that the family context (especially maternal well-being) predicts psychological adjustment in children with autism. This work has mainly focused on dyadic relationships in the family (especially parent-child reciprocal effects). In the present study, we extended a systems perspective in autism family research to a triad involving the child with autism, their mother, and a sibling, and also adopted a longitudinal design. Mothers from 60 families of children with autism reported on their own depression, and the behavior problems and pro-social behavior of their child with autism and a sibling. Results from longitudinal regression models suggested that earlier levels of maternal depression and sibling pro-social behavior did not have an independent effect on the behavior problems or pro-social behavior of children with autism 2.5-3 years later. Earlier levels of sibling behavior problems were associated with increased behavior problems of the child with autism 2.5-3 years later. Although replication is required, these are the first data to suggest that outcomes for children with autism may be affected by their siblings' psychological adjustment. The methodology of longitudinal family systems analysis of triadic relationships has important research and practical implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about what factors predict the formation of reciprocal same-sex friendships during early adolescence. To examine whether social-emotional competencies aid in establishing and maintaining these friendships at the beginning and end of seventh grade, 380 German youth (mean age = 12.6 years; 49 percent boys; 100 percent White) reported on their peer support networks and on three broad categories of social-emotional competencies (i.e., non-constructive anger regulation, constructive anger regulation, emotional awareness, and expression disclosure). Regression analyses indicated the number of reciprocal friendships at Time 2 (T2) was predicted by adolescents' constructive anger regulation through redirection of attention, and social support when angry at the friend, even after controlling for Time 1 number of friends and peer acceptance. Among girls, willingness to self-disclose marginally predicted their number of reciprocal friends at T2. Results are discussed in terms of the specific social-emotional competencies that facilitate involvement in reciprocal friendships.

AB Alcoholic patients with multiple detoxifications/relapses show cognitive and emotional deficits. We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging and examined performance on a cognitive flexibility task (intra-extradimensional set shift and reversal; IED). We also presented subjects with fearful, disgust and anger facial emotional expressions. Participants were abstaining, multiply detoxified (MDTx; n = 12) or singly detoxified patients (SDTx; n = 17) and social drinker controls (n = 31). Alcoholic patients were less able than controls to change their behavior in accordance with the changing of the rules in the IED and they were less accurate in recognizing fearful expressions in particular. They also showed lower gray matter volume compared with controls in frontal brain areas, including inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and insula that mediate emotional processing, inferior parietal lobule and medial frontal cortex that mediate attentional and motor planning processes, respectively. Impairments in performance and some of the regional decreases in gray matter were greater in MDTx. Gray matter volume in IFC in patients was negatively correlated with the number of detoxifications, whereas inferior parietal lobule was negatively correlated with the control over drinking score (impaired control over drinking questionnaire). Performance in IED was also negatively correlated with gray matter volume in IFC/BA47, whereas recognition of fearful faces was positively correlated with the IFC gray matter. Repeated episodes of detoxification from alcohol, related to severity of dependency, are coupled with altered brain structure in areas of emotional regulation, attention and motor planning. Such changes may confer increased inability to switch behavior according to environmental demands and social incompetence, contributing to relapse.

AB ObjectivesBipolar disorder (BD) has been associated with dysfunctional brain connectivity and with family chaos. It is not known whether aberrant connectivity occurs before illness onset, representing vulnerability for developing BD amidst family chaos. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural network dysfunction in healthy offspring living with parents with BD and healthy comparison youth.
   MethodsUsing two complementary methodologies [data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) and hypothesis-driven region-of-interest (ROI)-based intrinsic connectivity], we examined resting-state fMRI data in 8-17-year-old healthy offspring of a parent with BD (n=24; high risk) and age-matched healthy youth without any personal or family psychopathology (n=25; low risk).
   ResultsICA revealed that, relative to low-risk youth, high-risk youth showed increased connectivity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) subregion of the left executive control network (ECN), which includes frontoparietal regions important for emotion regulation. ROI-based analyses revealed that high-risk versus low-risk youth had decreased connectivities between the left amygdala and pregenual cingulate, between the subgenual cingulate and supplementary motor cortex, and between the left VLPFC and left caudate. High-risk youth showed stronger connections in the VLPFC with age and higher functioning, which may be neuroprotective, and weaker connections between the left VLPFC and caudate with more family chaos, suggesting an environmental influence on frontostriatal connectivity.
   ConclusionsHealthy offspring of parents with BD show atypical patterns of prefrontal and subcortical intrinsic connectivity that may be early markers of resilience to or vulnerability for developing BD. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these patterns predict outcomes.

   DIFFICULTIES; ADOLESCENTS
AB Objective: Deficits in emotion regulation have been implicated in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) by both theory and research. Research indicates that NSSI is commonly performed as an emotion regulation strategy, as it often decreases the experience of negative affect. People who engage in NSSI often report greater emotion dysregulation than those without an NSSI history. Further, interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing NSSI involve a focus on emotion regulation skills. Given the important role of emotion regulation in NSSI, research should continue to develop our understanding of this construct.
   Methods: We conducted a review of relevant research in emotion regulation and dysregulation and specific emotion regulation strategies in NSSI.
   Results: First, we provide an overview of current research on emotion regulation and dysregulation in NSSI. Second, we discuss the application of a specific emotion regulation model to NSSI research, and review research on NSSI supporting the use of this model.
   Conclusion: NSSI has been associated with an emotion regulation function and trait emotion dysregulation among people who self-injure. Relevant research provides initial support for the applicability of a specific model of emotion regulation to NSSI. We suggest directions for future research to continue to cultivate our understanding of emotion regulation in NSSI.

AB Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of bodily tissue without the intent to die, is associated with various negative outcomes. Although basic and epidemiologic research on NSSI has increased during the last 2 decades, literature on effective interventions targeting NSSI is still emerging. Here, we present a comprehensive, systematic review of existing psychological and pharmacological treatments designed specifically for NSSI, or including outcome assessments examining change in NSSI.
   Method: We conducted a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases to retrieve relevant articles that met inclusion criteria; specifically, uncontrolled and controlled trials that 1) presented quantitative outcome data on NSSI, and 2) clearly differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-injury (SSI). Consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, definition of NSSI, we excluded studies examining populations with developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic disorders.
   Results: Several interventions appear to hold promise for reducing NSSI, including dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion regulation group therapy, manual-assisted cognitive therapy, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole), naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (with or without cognitive-behavioural therapy). Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies investigating treatment efficacy for NSSI.
   Conclusions: Structured psychotherapeutic approaches focusing on collaborative therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and directly addressing NSSI behaviours seem to be most effective in reducing NSSI. Medications targeting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid systems also have demonstrated some benefits. Future studies employing controlled designs as well as a clear delineation of NSSI and SSI will improve knowledge regarding treatment effects.

AB Background: Difficulty regulating emotions is a symptom of many psychological disorders yet little research has examined the longitudinal relations of particular facets of emotion regulation (ER) that may differentiate between internalizing symptoms. Method: At-risk youth (n = 102; 44.1% boys, 77.5% Black; M-age = 9.65) and caregivers (n = 74; 87.1% mothers) participated in a 2-year longitudinal study. Children reported on their ER, and children and caregivers on symptomatology. Results: Different patterns, varying by emotion facet (dysregulation, inhibition, coping) and type (anger, sadness, worry), predicted anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression are entities with distinct patterns of emotion-related antecedents.

AB Multiple behavioral and health outcomes, including internalizing symptoms, may be predicted from prenatal maternal anxiety, depression, or stress. However, not all children are affected, and those that are can be affected in different ways. Here we test the hypothesis that the effects of prenatal anxiety are moderated by genetic variation in the child's brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children population cohort. Internalizing symptoms were assessed from 4 to 13 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (n = 8,584); a clinical interview with the adolescents was conducted at age 15 years (n = 4,704). Obstetric and psychosocial risk and postnatal maternal symptoms were included as covariates. Results show that prenatal maternal anxiety predicted internalizing symptoms, including with the diagnostic assessment at 15 years. There was a main effect of two BDNF polymorphisms (rs6265 [val66met] and rs11030104) on internalizing symptoms up to age 13. There was also genetic moderation of the prenatal anxiety effect by different BDNF polymorphisms (rs11030121 and rs7124442), although significant effects were limited to preadolescence. The findings suggest a role for BDNF gene-environment interactions in individual vulnerability to the effects of prenatal anxiety on child internalizing symptoms.

AB Objective: Eating disorders (EDs) present across a broad age range, yet little is known about the characteristics and outcome of midlife patients compared to younger patients. Among patients seeking ED treatment who were stratified by age at initial assessment (IA), this study aimed to (1) discern sociodemographic and clinical differences, (2) determine outcome rates, and (3) identify predictors of poor outcome including death.
   Method: Participants [219 females (12 years or older, 94.1% Caucasian) who completed outcome assessment and 31 known decedents] were stratified by age at IA (<18 as youth, 18-39 as young adult, and >= 40 years as midlife adult). Analyses of variance and chi-square tests identified group differences; ordered logistic regression with stepwise selection identified factors predicting outcome.
   Results: Midlife adults were more significantly compromised at follow-up compared to youths and young adults, including psychological and physical quality of life, ineffectiveness, interpersonal concerns, and general psychological maladjustment. Midlife adults had the highest rates of poor outcome or death; good outcome was achieved by only 5.9% of midlife adult compared to 14.0% of young adult and 27.5% of youth patients. Older age at IA, alcohol and/or drug misuse, endocrine concerns, and absence of family ED history predicted poor outcome or death.
   Discussion: Midlife adults seeking ED treatment have more complex medical and psychological concerns and poorer outcomes than youths and young adults; further exploration is needed to improve treatment outcome. Specialized treatment focusing on quality of life, comorbid medical concerns, interpersonal connection, and emotion regulation is encouraged. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Purpose: To investigate whether parents' previous physical aggression (PPA) exhibited during early adolescence is associated with adolescents' subsequent parent-directed aggression even beyond parents' concurrent physical aggression (CPA) and to investigate whether adolescents' emotion dysregulation and attitudes condoning child-to-parent aggression moderate associations.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 93) and their parents participated in a prospective longitudinal study. Adolescents and parents reported at waves 1-3 on four types of parents' PPA (mother to adolescent, father to adolescent, mother to father, and father to mother). Wave 3 assessments also included adolescents' emotion dysregulation, attitudes condoning aggression, and externalizing behaviors. At waves 4 and 5, adolescents and parents reported on adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression, property damage, and verbal aggression and on parents' CPA.
   Results: Parents' PPA emerged as a significant indicator of adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.55; p = .047), property damage (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5, p = .002), and verbal aggression (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15-1.6, p < .001) even controlling for adolescents' sex, externalizing behaviors, and family income. When controlling for parents' CPA, previous mother-to-adolescent aggression still predicted adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression (OR: 5.56, 95% CI: 1.82-17.0, p = .003), and father-to-mother aggression predicted adolescents' parent-directed verbal aggression (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.0-3.3, p = .036). Emotion dysregulation and attitudes condoning aggression did not produce direct or moderated the effects.
   Conclusions: Adolescents' parent-directed aggression deserves greater attention in discourse about lasting, adverse effects of even minor forms of parents' physical aggression. Future research should investigate parent-directed aggression as an early signal of aggression into adulthood. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, glutamate plays a critical role in normal brain function; thus, its dysregulation could lead to psychopathology in youth. A growing body of literature has investigated the role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of childhood psychiatric disorders through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The aim of this study was to review the existing literature to gauge the specificity of such findings.
   Data Sources: PubMed was searched for all scientific, peer-reviewed articles published in English that included MRS measurements of glutamatergic metabolites in pediatric psychiatric populations through August 14, 2013.
   Study Selection: 50 articles were included in this review. These studies included measurements of glutamate or related metabolites with MRS in children with psychiatric disorders.
   Data Extraction: All relevant data (eg, population; number, sex, and age of subjects; method of comparison; treatment history; MRS Tesla; brain regions of interest; glutamatergic findings; other findings; and comorbidities) were extracted from the included articles. The direction and significance of glutamate dysregulation and brain region(s) examined were used to compare the studies.
   Results: Most consistently, increases in glutamatergic metabolites were found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other regions in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Limited data suggested increases in glutamatergic metabolites in youth with autism spectrum disorders, emotional dysregulation, and high risk for schizophrenia and decreases in youth with major depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There was limited but consistent evidence for normalization of glutamatergic levels with treatment, particularly in bipolar disorder and ADHD.
   Conclusions: A relatively small number of studies have examined the role of glutamatergic dysregulation in pediatric psychiatric disorders. Some consistencies can be found, but interpretation of the data is limited by differences in methodology, including age of subjects, severity of current symptoms, treatment, and scanning parameters.

AB Previous neuroimaging studies of youth with bipolar disorder (BD) have identified abnormalities in emotion regulation circuitry. Using data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms Cohort (a clinical sample recruited for behavioral and emotional dysregulation), we examined the impact of BD and medication on activation in these regions. Functional neuroimaging data were obtained from 15 youth with BD who currently were unmedicated with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic (U-BD), 19 youth with medicated BD (M-BD), a non-bipolar clinical sample with high rates of disruptive behavioral disorders (non-BD, n = 59), and 29 healthy controls (HC) while they were shown task-irrelevant morphing emotional faces and shapes. Whole brain analysis was used to identify clusters that showed differential activation to emotion vs. shapes across group. To assess pair-wise comparisons and potential confounders, mean activation data were extracted only from clusters within regions previously implicated in emotion regulation (including amygdala and ventral prefrontal regions). A cluster in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed group differences to emotion vs. shapes (159 voxels, corrected p <.05). Within this cluster, U-BD youth showed decreased activation relative to HC (p =.007) and non-BD (p =.004) youth. M-BD also showed decreased activation in this cluster relative to HC and non-BD youth, but these differences were attenuated. Results were specific to negative emotions, and not found with happy faces. IFG findings were not explained by other medications (e.g. stimulants) or diagnoses. Compared to both HC and a non-BD sample, U-BD is associated with abnormally decreased right IFG activation to negative emotions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mature amygdala-prefrontal circuitry regulates affect in adulthood but shows protracted development. In altricial and semialtricial species, caregivers provide potent affect regulation when mature neurocircuitry is absent. The present investigation examined a potential mechanism through which caregivers provide regulatory influences in childhood. Children, but not adolescents, showed evidence of maternal buffering, such that maternal stimuli suppressed amygdala reactivity. In the absence of maternal stimuli, children exhibited immature amygdala-prefrontal connectivity. However, in the presence of maternal stimuli, children's connectivity was more mature, resembling adolescents' connectivity. Children showed improved affect-related regulation in the presence of their mothers. Individual differences emerged, with greater maternal influence on amygdala-prefrontal circuitry associated with stronger mother-child relationships and maternal modulation of behavioral regulation. These findings suggest a neural mechanism through which caregivers modulate children's regulatory behavior by inducing more mature connectivity and buffering against heightened reactivity. Maternal buffering in childhood, but not adolescence, suggests that childhood may be a sensitive period for amygdala-prefrontal development.

AB Background: Associations between self-control in adolescence and adult mental health are unclear in the general population; to our knowledge, no study has investigated self-control in relation to psychotic-like symptoms. Aims: To investigate the relationship between adolescent self-control and the midlife mental health outcomes of anxiety and depression symptoms and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), controlling for the effect of adolescent conduct and emotional problems and for parental occupational social class and childhood cognition. Methods: A population-based sample, the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort) was contacted 23 times between ages 6 weeks and 53 years. Teachers completed rating scales to assess emotional adjustment and behaviors, from which factors measuring self-control, behavioral, and emotional problems were extracted. At age 53 years, PLEs were self-reported by 2918 participants using 4 items from the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire; symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the scaled version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Results: After adjustment for the above covariates, poor adolescent self-control was associated with the presence of PLEs in adulthood, specifically hallucinatory experiences at age 53 years, even after adjustment for GHQ-28 scores. Conclusions: Lower self-control in adolescence is a risk factor for hallucinatory experiences in adulthood.

AB Adolescence is a crucial period for the development of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Despite the fact that structural maturation of the prefrontal cortex during adolescence is often assumed to underlie the maturation of emotion regulation strategies, no longitudinal studies have directly assessed this relationship. This study examined whether use of cognitive reappraisal strategies during late adolescence was predicted by (i) absolute prefrontal cortical thickness during early adolescence and (ii) structural maturation of the prefrontal cortex between early and mid-adolescence. Ninety-two adolescents underwent baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans when they were aged approximately 12 and 16 years, respectively. FreeSurfer software was used to obtain cortical thickness estimates for three prefrontal regions [anterior cingulate cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)]. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was completed when adolescents were aged approximately 19 years. Results showed that greater cortical thinning of the left dlPFC and left vlPFC during adolescence was significantly associated with greater use of cognitive reappraisal in females, though no such relationship was evident in males. Furthermore, baseline left dlPFC thickness predicted cognitive reappraisal at trend level. These findings suggest that cortical maturation may play a role in the development of adaptive emotion regulation strategies during adolescence.

AB The goal of this study was to examine how aspects of self-regulation and negative emotionality predicted children's co-operative and prosocial behavior concurrently and longitudinally using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Mothers completed measures of children's temperamental proneness to negative emotionality and self-regulation at 54 months. Teachers and parents completed measures of children's co-operative and prosocial behavior at 54 months, first grade, and third grade. A latent profile analysis of the temperamental variables revealed four profiles of children: those high in regulation and low in negative emotionality, those moderate in regulation and moderate in negative emotionality, those low in regulation and high in negative emotionality, and finally those who were very low in regulation but high in anger emotionality. Generally, children with profiles that were high or moderate in terms of regulation and low or moderate in terms of negative emotionality were rated as the most prosocial and co-operative. Children with profiles that were less well regulated and who were high in negative emotionality (particularly anger proneness) were rated as less co-operative and prosocial by parents and teachers.

AB Purpose: A meta-analysis of empirical studies performed in Korea was conducted to systematically investigate the associations between the indices of Internet addiction (IA) and psychosocial variables. Materials and Methods: Systematic literature searches were carried out using the Korean Studies Information Service System, Research Information Sharing Service, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and references in review articles. The key words were Internet addiction, (Internet) game addiction, and pathological, problematic, and excessive Internet use. Only original research papers using Korean samples published from 1999 to 2012 and officially reviewed by peers were included for analysis. Ninety-five studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Results: The magnitude of the overall effect size of the intrapersonal variables associated with Internet addiction was significantly higher than that of interpersonal variables. Specifically, IA demonstrated a medium to strong association with "escape from self' and "self-identity" as selfrelated variables. "Attention problem", "self-control", and "emotional regulation" as control and regulation-relation variables; "addiction and absorption traits" as temperament variables; "anger" and "aggression" as emotion and mood and variables; "negative stress coping" as coping variables were also associated with comparably larger effect sizes. Contrary to our expectation, the magnitude of the correlations between relational ability and quality, parental relationships and family functionality, and IA were found to be small. The strength of the association between IA and the risk and protective factors was found to be higher in younger age groups. Conclusion: The findings highlight a need for closer examination of psychosocial factors, especially intrapersonal variables when assessing high-risk individuals and designing intervention strategies for both general IA and Internet game addiction.

During the screening phase, 8848 children (90.23%) and their mothers and teachers were interviewed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). During the diagnostic phase, 1129 children with a positive SDQ and 804 randomly selected children with a negative SDQ (11%), and their mothers and teachers, were interviewed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA).
   Results: The overall prevalence of DSM-IV disorders was 9.49% (95% CI = 8.10-11.10%). Anxiety disorders were the most common (6.06%, 95% CI = 4.92-7.40), followed by depression (1.32%, 95% CI = 0.91-1.92%), oppositional defiant disorder (1.21%, 95% CI = 0.77-1.87) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.84%, 95% CI = 0.52-1.36%). Of the 805 children with a psychiatric disorder, 15.2% had two or more comorbid disorders.
   Conclusions: Approximately one in ten Chinese school children has psychiatric disorders involving a level of distress or social impairment likely to warrant treatment. Prevention, early identification and treatment of these disorders are urgently needed and pose a serious challenge in China.

AB Structural and functional brain studies on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have primarily examined anatomical abnormalities in the prefronto-striatal circuitry (especially, dorsal and lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum). There is, however, increased evidence that several temporal lobe regions could play an important role in ADHD. The present study used MRI-based measurements of cortical thickness to examine possible differences in both prefrontal and temporal lobe regions between medication-naive patients with ADHD (N=50) and age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (N=50). Subjects with ADHD exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the right temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) relative to healthy comparison subjects. These differences remained significant after controlling for confounding effects of age, overall mean cortical thickness and comorbid externalizing conditions, such as oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. These results point to the involvement of the temporal pole and OFC in the neuropathology of ADHD. Moreover, present findings add evidence to the assumption that multiple brain regions and psychological processes are associated with ADHD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ARCHIVES OF BUDO

ID VIOLENCE PREVENTION; YOUTH; JUDO
AB Background & Study Aim: Combat sports and martial arts are very popular among young people and adults. Some researchers indicate numerous advantages that come from training, including reduced level of aggressiveness or improved emotional self-control. Other authors present disparate results. The aim of this study was the level of aggressiveness among people practising combat sports and martial arts, compared to their peers, who are not involved in training.
   Material & Methods: The research involved 150 males (for 50 participants from each type of the training) practising capoeira, boxing and ju-jitsu. Moreover, a group of 150 non-practising secondary school and university students with the Physical Education major was also examined. In the research, the aggression questionnaire by A.H. Buss, M. Perry was used. Results: Achieved results show differences in aggressiveness levels among the group involved in training. The highest aggressiveness level was recorded in the group practising boxing, whereas the lowest was observed in the group of ju-jitsu athletes. The generation of contemporary Polish boxers is characterized by higher level of the aggressiveness than the earlier generation. The highest level of aggressiveness was expressed in the form of verbal aggression. The overall aggressiveness result should be considered as the most significant one and its highest level was recorded in the control group.
   Conclusions: Combat sports and martial arts training gives the possibility to diffuse emotions and relieve tension, which may result in decreasing the level of aggressiveness. Research participants of the control group, being deprived of such possibility, were characterized by the highest aggressiveness level among the researched groups. The aggressiveness level can be conditioned by the specificity of the training, but first of all by the coach qualifications.

AB Background: Young adults with Down syndrome experience increased rates of emotional and behavioural problems compared with the general population. Most adolescents with Down syndrome living in Western Australia participate in sheltered employment as their main day occupation. Relationship between day occupation and changes in behaviour has not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore any relationship between post school day occupations and changes in the young person's behaviour.
   Methods: The Down syndrome Needs Opinion Wishes database was used for case ascertainment of young adults aged 15 to 32 years with Down syndrome. Families of 118 young people in this population-based database completed questionnaires in 2004, 2009 and 2011. The questionnaires addressed both young person characteristics such as age, gender, presence of impairments, behaviour, functioning in activities of daily living, and family characteristics such as income and family functioning. Post-school day occupations in which the young people were participating included open and sheltered employment, training and day recreation programs. Change in behaviour of young adults who remained in the same post-school day occupation from 2009 to 2011 (n = 103) were examined in a linear regression model adjusting for confounding variables including age, gender, prior functioning and behaviour in 2004 and family income.
   Results: In comparison to those young adults attending open employment from 2009 to 2011, those attending day recreation programs were reported to experience worsening in behaviour both in the unadjusted (effect size -0.14, 95% CI -0.24, -0.05) and adjusted models (effect size -0.15, 95% CI -0.29, -0.01).
   Conclusions: We found that the behaviour of those participating in open employment improved compared to those attending other day occupations. Further examination of the direction of this association is required.

AB Executive dysfunction of adults with ADHD is often associated with poor self-awareness of problems, such as in emotional competence, emotional recognition, and driving competence. However, with regard to cognitive functioning, little is known about how adults with ADHD evaluate their own cognitive performance. A total of 77 adults with ADHD and 116 healthy adults were assessed with self-report scales measuring several aspects of cognition. Significance and effect sizes as well as the proportion of patients perceiving impairments were calculated. Further analysis was carried out on the frequency of patients perceiving various types of impairments. Adults with ADHD perceived themselves to have significant and severe dysfunction in all areas of cognition assessed as a group. Furthermore, the majority of patients reported multiple impairments in attention, memory and executive functioning. The present study demonstrated that adults with ADHD are aware of problems in cognitive functioning as shown by considerable perceived neuropsychological impairment in the majority of patients. Patients with ADHD tended to report cognitive impairments in multiple domains rather than impairments in specific functions.

AB The late positive potential (LPP), which is reduced following the use of reappraisal, is a potential neurosignature for emotion regulation capacity. This sensitivity of the LPP to reappraisal is rarely studied in children. We tested whether, in 26 typically developing seven- to nine-year-olds, LPP amplitudes were reduced following reappraisal and whether this effect varied with age and anxiety. For the full sample, LPPs were not significantly reduced following reappraisal. As predicted, reductions in the LPP following reappraisal were greater for older children and those showing less anxiety. The utility of the LPP as a neurosignature for emotion regulatory capacity is discussed.

AB SYNOPSIS
   Objective. Previous research has examined the developmental consequences, particularly in early childhood, of parents' supportive and unsupportive responses to children's negative emotions. Much less is known about factors that explain why parents respond in ways that may support or undermine their children's emotions, and even less is known about how these parenting processes unfold with adolescents. In the present study, researchers examined the associations between mothers' attachment styles and their distress, harsh, and supportive responses to their adolescents' negative emotions two years later and whether these links were mediated by maternal emotion regulation difficulties. Design. Mothers in a longitudinal study (n = 230) reported on their attachment style, difficulties regulating their emotions, and their hypothetical responses to their adolescents' negative emotions, respectively, at consecutive laboratory visits one year apart. Results. Mothers who reported greater attachment-related avoidance and anxiety reported having greater difficulties with emotion regulation one year later. Emotion dysregulation, in turn, predicted more distressed, harsher, and less supportive maternal responses to adolescents' negative emotions the following year. In addition, greater avoidance directly predicted harsher maternal responses two years later. Conclusions. These findings extend previous research by identifying maternal attachment style as a predictor of responses to adolescent distress and by documenting the underlying role of emotion dysregulation in the link between adult attachment style and parenting.

A recent study of the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) indicated good sensitivity but relatively low specificity for identifying emotional problems in youth with ASD. The current study examined the extent to which variance in the CBCL's Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Internalizing Domain, and Total Problems scales was accounted for by symptoms of emotional problems relative to ASD symptoms. Correlation and multiple regression analyses indicated that these scales measured anxiety and depression but a small statistically significant proportion of variance in Total Problems scores was also accounted for by ASD symptoms. Results contribute to the emerging evidence base for the inclusion of the CBCL in assessment protocols for assessing emotional and behavioral problems in youth with ASD.

AB Neglect and physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse during childhood and adolescence are frequently responsible for long-term sequelae such as somatic and psychopathological disorders, cognitive and emotional problems and changes of brain structure and brain function. Investigations using modern imaging techniques have produced a huge amount of data. However, these data have so far only identified correlations between certain events and alterations of the brain: pathophysiological pathways relating to brain structure and function are still missing.
   The type and severity of sequelae vary in relation to the genetic endowment of the individuals and their interaction with the environment (vulnerability versus resilience).
   Environmental factors have a significant influence on the manifestation of all kinds of abuse and are important for the development of preventive measures.

AB Epilepsy is defined as two or more unprovoked seizures. Epileptic patients have intellectual disability and behavioral co-morbidities to the tune of up to 25 and 75% respectively. Various factors like underlying etiology, socioeconomic environment at home, age at onset, seizure semiology, seizure descriptors like duration, severity and frequency, therapy related adverse effects secondary to antiepileptic drugs and epilepsy surgery have been implicated for the causation of cognitive and behavioral impairment in epilepsy. Cognitive epilepsy has emerged as a specific entity. This may manifest as a transient behavioral or cognitive change, insidous onset subacute to chronic encephalopathy or more catastrophic in the form of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Cognitive impairment seen in epileptic children include difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving as well as concept formation. Anxiety, depression and attention deficit hyperkinetic disorders are the most common psychiatric comorbidities seen. Investigating a child with epilepsy for cognitive and behavioral impairment is difficult as these tests would require cooperation from the patient's side to a significant extent. A rational approach towards treatment would be judicious selection of antiepileptic drugs, treatment of underlying cause, appropriate management of behavioral comorbidities including psychopharmacotherapy and a trial of immunotherapy (particularly in cognitive epilepsies), wherever appropriate.

AB Objection: We aimed to assess and compare the behavioural and emotional outcomes of school-aged children after surgery or transcatheter closure for ventricular septal defect and investigate the risk factors for developing abnormal behavioural problems with the condition. Methods: In this study, we included 29 children, including 20 boys, with ventricular septal defect who underwent surgery and 35 children, including 21 boys, who underwent transcatheter closure (6-13 years old) and their age-and sex-matched best friends (n = 56) and their parents. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to obtain standardised parents' reports of behavioural and emotional problems in children. The 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire was used to assess parents' psychological distress. Pearson correlation and logistic regression were used to analyse risk factors for developing behaviour problems. Results: Behavioural problems were greater for boys and girls undergoing surgery or transcatheter closure than controls. The behavioural problems were mainly depression, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal for boys and thought problems, depression, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal for girls. Depression and somatic complaints were greater for boys undergoing surgery than for boys undergoing transcatheter closure. Behavioural problems did not differ between treatment groups for girls. Risk factors for developing behavioural problems were age at the time of ventricular septal defect repair (p = 0.03; odds ratio = 2.35), skin scar (p = 0.04; odds ratio = 3.12), post-operative atrioventricular block (p = 0.03; odds ratio = 2.81), and maternal anxiety(p < 0.01; odds ratio = 4.5). Conclusion: School-aged children who underwent repair of ventricular septal defect regardless of the type of treatment (surgery or transcatheter closure) exhibit internalising behavioural problems. Risk factors for developing problems are young age, scarring, post-operative atrioventricular block, and maternal anxiety. In particular, maternal anxiety is the most important risk factor.

AB The present longitudinal study described developmental patterns of perceived psychological need satisfaction (PNS) from the end of elementary school to the end of high school and their contribution to school adjustment at the end of high school. The first goal thus consisted in estimating whether developmental trajectories of perceived PNS were homogeneous (i.e., all students reported similar developmental patterns) or heterogeneous (i.e., there were several distinct developmental trajectories). The second goal involved comparing trajectory groups on dimensions of school adjustment (social, academic, and emotional personal). A stratified sample of 609 students (277 boys, 332 girls) was surveyed annually on a 6-year period, from the end of elementary school until the end of high school. Results of group-based trajectory modeling (Nagin, 1999, 2005) revealed that developmental trajectories of PNS were heterogeneous for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. For each need, four distinct developmental patterns were identified. These trajectories varied in shape, composition, and magnitude such that some students reported increasing PNS over time while others reported stable or decreasing PNS. Results from multivariate analyses revealed that students in upper trajectories (e.g., reporting higher levels of PNS, either stable or increasing) generally reported higher levels of academic, social, and personal emotional adjustment at the end of high school. Results are discussed with respect to their implications for research and interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) represent the most common congenital malformations of the midfacial region. Although these patients show differences in their facial appearance, we hypothesize that CLP-affected individuals do not show an alteration in their emotion regulation abilities compared to unaffected individuals. This is because of the strong biological basis of facial emotion and expression that is inherent and receives little influence from external factors.
   Material and methods: The present study evaluated various aspects of emotion regulation in 25 adults with CLP and an equally sized control group of unaffected volunteers. The study was divided into three parts. First, we investigated emotion regulation strategies. Here, each participant was asked to complete the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Ambivalence over Emotional Expressiveness Questionnaire G 18 (AEQ-G18). Second, we examined the recognition of facially expressed basic emotions (FEEL test). Third, we evaluated the expression of an emotion induced by an odor sample.
   Results: Habitual emotion regulation, measured by ERQ and AEQ-G18, was not different between CLP and controls subjects for all of the sub-scales. Recognition of facially expressed basic emotions was also the same for both groups. Facial emotion encoding did not differ for both groups.
   Conclusions: To summarize, the findings suggest that individuals with an orofacial cleft show undisturbed emotion regulation and recognition. This may be explained by the strong biological basis of facial emotion recognition and regulation as well as by the healthy emotional resilience and social functioning of CLP patients.

AB BackgroundAlmost half of children with an inhibited temperament will develop social anxiety disorder by late adolescence. Importantly, this means that half of children with an inhibited temperament will not develop social anxiety disorder. Studying adults with an inhibited temperament provides a unique opportunity to identify neural signatures of both risk and resilience to social anxiety disorder.
   MethodsFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activation during the anticipation of viewing fear faces in 34 young adults (17 inhibited, 17 uninhibited). To identify neural signatures of risk, we tested for group differences in functional activation and connectivity in regions implicated in social anxiety disorder, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and insula. To identify neural signatures of resilience, we tested for correlations between brain activation and both emotion regulation and social anxiety scores.
   ResultsInhibited subjects had greater activation of a prefrontal network when anticipating viewing fear faces, relative to uninhibited subjects. No group differences were identified in the amygdala. Inhibited subjects had more negative connectivity between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the bilateral amygdala. Within the inhibited group, those with fewer social anxiety symptoms and better emotion regulation skills had greater ACC activation and greater functional connectivity between the ACC and amygdala.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that engaging regulatory prefrontal regions during anticipation may be a protective factor, or putative neural marker of resilience, in high-risk individuals. Cognitive training targeting prefrontal cortex function may provide protection against anxiety, especially in high-risk individuals, such as those with inhibited temperament.

AB ObjectiveIndividuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit heightened amygdala reactivity and atypical activation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in response to negative emotional information. It is unknown whether these aspects of neural function are risk factors for PTSD or consequences of either trauma exposure or onset of the disorder. We had a unique opportunity to investigate this issue following the terrorist attacks at the 2013 Boston Marathon and the ensuing manhunt and shelter in place order. We examined associations of neural function measured prior to the attack with PTSD symptom onset related to these events.
   MethodsA sample of 15 adolescents (mean age = 16.5 years) who previously participated in a neuroimaging study completed a survey assessing posttraumatic symptoms related to the terrorist attack. We examined blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to viewing and actively down-regulating emotional responses to negative stimuli in regions previously associated with PTSD, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC, as prospective predictors of posttraumatic symptom onset.
   ResultsIncreased BOLD signal to negative emotional stimuli in the left amygdala was strongly associated with posttraumatic symptoms following the attack. Reduced bilateral hippocampal activation during effortful attempts to down-regulate emotional responses to negative stimuli was also associated with greater posttraumatic symptoms. Associations of amygdala reactivity with posttraumatic symptoms were robust to controls for pre-existing depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms and prior exposure to violence.
   ConclusionsAmygdala reactivity to negative emotional information might represent a neurobiological marker of vulnerability to traumatic stress and, potentially, a risk factor for PTSD.

AB Background: Understanding suicidal ideation may help develop more effective suicide screening and intervention programs. The interpersonal and the cognitive-deficit theories seek to describe the factors leading to suicidal behavior. In the military setting it is common to find over- and under-reporting of suicidal ideation. This study sought to determine the relationship between these two models and determine to what degree their components can indirectly predict suicidal ideation.
   Methods: Suicide attempters (n = 32) were compared with non-suicidal psychologically treated peers (n = 38) and controls (n = 33), matched for sex and age (mean 19.7 years). Pearson's analysis was used to quantify the relationship between the variable from the two models and hierarchal regression analysis was used to determine the explanation of suicidal ideation variance by these variables.
   Results: Suicide attempters have more difficulties in problem-solving, negative emotion regulation and burdensomeness compared with their peers (P < .001). These variables are all closely correlated with each other and to suicide ideation (r > +/- 0.5; P < .001). Prior suicide attempt, loneliness and burdensomeness together explain 65% (P < .001) of the variance in suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is strongly correlated with components of interpersonal and cognitive difficulties. In addition to assessing current suicidal ideation, clinicians should assess past suicide attempt, loneliness and burdensomeness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Little is known about the clinical characteristics and motivations for engaging in non-suicide self-injury (NSSI) behaviors in adolescence. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, characteristics and functions of NSSI among adolescents in community settings, and to explore risk factors related to this behavior.
   Subjects and methods: Two hundred and seventy-five adolescents aged 12 to 17 were recruited randomly from different High Schools in Israel. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI (Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory), depression (Children's Depression Inventory - CDI) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-II).
   Results: In the past year, 20.7% of the participants reported engaging NSSI at least once. Among them, 42.1% declared they are still engaging in NSSI at the present. Motives for NSSI were internal emotion regulation reasons, external emotion regulation reasons for social influences. In addition, the NSSI group reported significantly higher levels of depressive, impulsivity and suicidal ideations. Depressive symptoms were found as significant predictors of NSSI in the future.
   Discussion and conclusions: High rates of NSSI among community adolescents were found. Depression, impulsivity and suicidal ideation were found significantly related to NSSI. Mental health professionals in schools and in primary care should routinely assess NSSI among adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID ONTARIO-CHILD-HEALTH; OUTCOMES; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PREVALENCE
AB The prevalence of suicidal ideation/behavior in 1983 or 1987 and its association with future mental health in 2001 were evaluated in a provincially representative sample of Canadian adolescents (n=1,248) aged 12 to 16years. Approximately 13.3% (95% CI=11.5-15.3) of adolescents self-reported suicidal ideation/behavior. Adolescent agreement with parent (=.07) and teacher (=.05) reports at baseline was low because adults identified so few subjects. In adulthood, the associations between adolescent self-reports of suicidal behavior/ideation and major depression and other mental health indicators were explained by respondent sex and adolescent emotional problems reported in 1983/1987. Adolescents with suicidal behavior/ideation often are not recognized by their parents and teachers and may be at risk for persistent psychiatric problems attributable to coexisting mental health problems early-on.

AB Background: Very preterm (VP) infants are at greater risk for cognitive difficulties that may persist during school-age, adolescence and adulthood. Behavioral assessments report either effortful control (part of executive functions) or emotional reactivity/regulation impairments.
   Aims: The aim of this study is to examine whether emotional recognition, reactivity, and regulation, as well as effortful control abilities are impaired in very preterm children at 42 months of age, compared with their full-term peers, and to what extent emotional and effortful control difficulties are linked.
   Study design: Children born very preterm (VP; <29 weeks gestational age, n = 41) and full-term (FT) aged-matched children (n = 47) participated in a series of specific neuropsychological tests assessing their level of emotional understanding, reactivity and regulation, as well as their attentional and effortful control abilities.
   Results: VP children exhibited higher scores of frustration and fear, and were less accurate in naming facial expressions of emotions than their aged-matched peers. However, VP children and FT children equally performed when asked to choose emotional facial expression in social context, and when we assessed their selective attention skills. VP performed significantly lower than full terms on two tasks of inhibition when correcting for verbal skills. Moreover, significant correlations between cognitive capacities (effortful control) and emotional abilities were evidenced.
   Conclusions: Compared to their FT peers, 42 month-olds who were born very preterm are at higher risk of exhibiting specific emotional and effortful control difficulties. The results suggest that these difficulties are linked. Ongoing behavioral and emotional impairments starting at an early age in preterms highlight the need for early interventions based on a better understanding of the relationship between emotional and cognitive difficulties.

AB This study investigated the mediating role of perceived stress in the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence and depressive symptoms in adolescence. A total of 661 high school Spanish students participated in the study. The analyses indicated that the effects of each of the perceived emotional intelligence sub-scales (namely, Attention, Clarity and Repair) on depressive symptomatology were partially mediated by perceived stress. Specifically, the mediating effect was negative for Clarity and Repair, but positive for attention. The analysis also showed that the direct effects were positive for all sub-scales. These results suggest that the promotion of stress management skills may be core in the development of prevention and treatment programs for depression in adolescents, and possibly more beneficial than the promotion of emotion regulation skills. Our findings, along with previous evidence, suggest that emotional attention, as measured in the present study, may be targeting a pathological type of attention.

AB Etiological models identify difficulties in emotion regulation as potential contributors to the development and maintenance of anxiety. To date, studies with adolescents have not tested whether different types of anxiety symptoms are related to different emotion regulation difficulties. The current study aimed to examine specificity of associations between emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of social and generalized anxiety in early adolescence. Ninety adolescents (ages 11-14 years) completed measures of emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms. Social and generalized anxiety symptoms showed similar bivariate correlations with emotion regulation. However, when controlling for generalized anxiety, social anxiety symptoms were uniquely related to emotion understanding, acceptance, evaluation, and reactivity. Generalized anxiety symptoms were uniquely related to emotion modification. The current study suggests that social and generalized anxiety symptoms have both common and unique associations with emotion regulation difficulties in early adolescence, and has implications for which emotion regulation skills to target in clinical interventions.

ID PEER VICTIMIZATION; QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Objective: Relationships between bully victimization and symptoms of depression/anxiety were examined. In addition, it was studied whether this relationship was moderated by specific cognitive coping strategies.
   Methods: Participants were 582 secondary school students who filled out online self-report questionnaires on bully victimization, cognitive coping, and depression/anxiety. (Moderated) Multiple Regression analysis was performed.
   Results: Strong relationships were found between bully victimization and symptoms of depression and anxiety. On top of that, two cognitive coping strategies moderated the relationship between bullying and depression, i.e. rumination (strengthening) and positive refocusing (reducing). Cognitive coping strategies that moderated the effect of bullying on anxiety symptoms were rumination, catastrophizing (strengthening) and positive reappraisal (reducing).
   Conclusion: The results provide possible targets for intervention: when helping adolescents who have been bullied, maladaptive cognitive coping strategies could be assessed and challenged, while more adaptive strategies could be acquired.

AB Objective To examine whether individual differences and intraindividual (within-person day-to-day) fluctuations in late adolescents' self-regulation were associated with daily adherence to the type 1 diabetes regimen. Methods 110 school seniors (M age = 17.78 years) and their mothers assessed adolescents' skills underlying self-regulation (executive function, attention, self-control, behavioral inhibition and activation, emotion regulation) and adherence, with glycosylated hemoglobin from medical records. Teens completed daily diaries reporting self-regulation failures surrounding monitoring blood glucose, adherence, and number of blood glucose checks each day for 14 days. Results Hierarchical Linear Models indicated that better daily adherence was associated with teen and mother reports of better self-regulation skills and teens' reports of fewer daily self-regulation failures. Daily adherence was unrelated to temperamental differences in behavioral inhibition and activation. Conclusions Results indicate that both individual and intraindividual differences in self-regulation contribute to daily adherence highlighting the importance of daily self-regulatory challenges to adherence.

Rational (i.e., expert opinion and mathematical) procedures grouped BACAH problem item responses from 1,465 youth, parent, and teacher informants into eight cross-informant scales labeled Anxiety-, Attention/Hyperactive-, Conduct-, Depression-, Hypomania/Mania-, Oppositional-Defiance-, Self-Destructive-, and Reality-Contact-Problems. Data analyses showed no response bias across child gender, socioeconomic status, or age groupings, but bias emerged across informant type, referral status, and rating scale type (i.e., presence and magnitude vs. concern levels regarding problems). Item linking reduced this bias. Items on each BACAH scale discriminate well for problem levels they assess and capably measure children's problem levels, ranging from moderately below to above the mean. This study's foundation and findings provide professionals and their test respondents with culturally valid, user friendly, economical, and highly flexible, clinical/research tools to assess Black children's functioning.

AB High performance expectations are central to perfectionism, but because most participants endorse high standards, it becomes difficult for practitioners and researchers to accurately screen for perfectionists. We addressed problems linked to the measurement and classification of perfectionism by testing various strategies aimed at broadening the range and skew of scores on the Standards subscale from the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney, Mobley, Trippi, Ashby, & Johnson, 1996). Randomly assigned participants (N = 506) completed the APS-R following standard instructions or 1 of 2 variations, one prompting participants to consider their responses in light of a normal distribution of scores and another in which participants used a visual analog (slider) scale. The visual analog scale produced more differentiated scores, but range restrictions and skewed distributions remained for all 3 variations. Statistical transformations improved skew. Factor mixture modeling was conducted using transformed and nontransformed perfectionism scores along with criterion indicators of emotion regulation (reappraisal or suppression), perceived stress, and depression. Results supported a 3-class model, although more balanced distributions of classes emerged than were previously reported. Perfectionists were differentiated from nonperfectionists by their higher standards scores. Maladaptive perfectionists scored highest among the classes on most self-critical perfectionism indicators, suppression, perceived stress, and depression. Adaptive perfectionists had the lowest levels of perceived stress and depression and scored highest on reappraisal. Both perfectionist classes had generally comparable concerns about mistakes, but criterion indicators suggested those were more problematic for maladaptive perfectionists. Results supported the value of incorporating adaptive and maladaptive criterion indicators in classification models.

AB The role of Aristotelian eudaimonic (moral) values in healthy psychosocial development is a rapidly growing area of enquiry that crosses the disciplines of philosophy and developmental psychology. The purpose of this study was to examine prospective relationships between adolescence eudaimonic values development and indicators of emotional competence and psychopathology in young adulthood. We tested two related hypotheses: (1) that eudaimonic behaviours in adolescence (indicated by activities aimed at benefiting other individuals, the community or society) would predict greater emotional competence in young adulthood (indicated by sense of responsibility, autonomy, planfulness and self-control); and (2) that emotional competence in young adulthood would reduce risk for anxious-depressive symptoms at the same age after controlling for prior emotional distress in adolescence. Data were drawn from an on-going 15 wave population-based longitudinal study of health and development, initially recruited at birth in 1983. SEM was used to model relationships and was based on data from 991 participants (384 male and 607 female). Consistent with expectations, adolescent eudaimonic behaviours were associated with higher emotional competence in young adulthood which, in turn, was inversely associated with anxious-depressive symptoms at the same age. Interventions that focus on opportunities for the eudaimonic development in adolescence may play a role in promoting emotional competence in emerging adulthood.

AB Objective: The present study examined the longitudinal relations between illness perceptions and asthma control and emotional problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress), respectively, in adolescents with asthma. Furthermore, the mediating effects of asthma-specific coping strategies on these relations were examined, as specified in the Common Sense Model (CSM).
   Methods: In 2011, 2012, and 2013, adolescents (aged 10-15) with asthma were visited at home (N = 253) and completed questionnaires about their illness perceptions, asthma-specific coping strategies, asthma control, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and perceived stress. Path analyses were used to examine the direct relations of illness perceptions with asthma control and emotional problems and the mediating effects of coping strategies cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
   Results: Perceptions of less perceived control and attributing more complaints to asthma were associated with better asthma control. Perceptions of more concern, less coherence, and increased influence of asthma on emotional well-being were associated with more emotional problems. Longitudinally, perceptions of more treatment control and fewer concerns predicted less emotional problems over time. More worrying mediated the cross-sectional relation between perceiving more concern about asthma and less asthma control and the longitudinal relation between perceiving more concern about asthma and more emotional problems.
   Conclusion: Illness perceptions were associated with asthma control and emotional problems; however, over time, illness perceptions only predicted changes in emotional problems. Most coping strategies did not mediate the relation between illness perceptions and outcomes. Interventions aimed to change illness perceptions in adolescents with asthma could decrease emotional problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using both traditional composites and novel profiles of anger, we examined associations between infant anger and preschool behavior problems in a large, longitudinal data set (N = 966). We also tested the role of life stress as a moderator of the link between early anger and the development of behavior problems. Although traditional measures of anger were largely unrelated to later behavior problems, profiles of anger that dissociated typical from atypical development predicted behavior problems during preschool. Moreover, the relation between infant anger profiles and preschool behavior problems was moderated such that, when early life stress was low, infants with atypical profiles of early anger showed more preschool behavior problems than did infants with normative anger profiles. However, when early life stress was high, infants with atypical and normative profiles of infant anger did not differ in preschool behavior problems. We conclude that a discrete emotions approach including latent profile analysis is useful for elucidating biological and environmental developmental pathways to early problem behaviors.

AB The current study investigated concurrent relations between emotional and social functioning in youth with anxiety disorders using a multi-reporter (i.e., children, parents, teachers) assessment strategy. Ninety youth (M age = 8.98 years, SD = 1.68) with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder, and a parent participated. Regression analyses indicated that positive affect and emotion regulation coping were related to adaptive measures of social functioning, whereas positive affect, negative affect, reluctance to share emotional experiences with peers, and lability/negativity were related to maladaptive measures of social functioning in the expected directions. For youth high in lability/negativity and low in emotion regulation coping, the relationship between diagnostic severity and social problems was exacerbated. This research contributes to our understanding of the interplay of social and emotional variables and suggests that efforts to facilitate child emotional functioning may improve social functioning for anxious youth, or vice versa.

AB The current study compared the differential effects of early adolescents' perceived maternal and paternal psychological control (as well as their discrepancy) on adolescent anxiety. It also tested whether psychological control leads to deficits in youths' ability to regulate their negative emotions, and if, in turn, such deficits lead to anxiety. Sixth- and seventh-grade students (n = 214; 59 % girls; 60 % Caucasian) completed measures of perceived psychological control, regulation of negative emotions, and anxiety symptoms. The discrepancy between perceived mothers' and fathers' control was also calculated. Although perceptions of mothers' control, fathers' control, and their discrepancy were each bivariately related to adolescent anxiety, when considered together, only a larger discrepancy in parents' psychological control was uniquely associated with higher self-reported anxiety. Further, adolescents' dysregulation of negative emotions partially explained the relation of both maternal psychological control and the discrepancy in parental control to anxiety. Implications for understanding family-based etiological correlates of anxiety are discussed.

AB Carrying a short allele in the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) while experiencing stressful environments is linked to elevated risk for depression. What might offset this risky combination of genes and environment? We hypothesized that individual-level factors may play a protective role. Specifically, we examined whether individuals' ability to decrease their stress responses via effective emotion regulation may be an important moderating factor and addressed this hypothesis in a socioeconomically diverse sample of 205 children aged 9-15 years. At-risk children (short-allele carriers in high-stress contexts) exhibited more depressive symptoms than other groups. Importantly, at-risk children who used effective emotion regulation did not exhibit increased depressive symptoms. These results have important implications for the basic science of understanding risk and resilience: in addition to genes and environment, individuals' agentic ability to self-regulate may need to be considered as a critical third factor. Given that emotion regulation is learnable, these results also have strong public-health implications.

AB People typically want to feel good. At times, however, they seek to maintain or enhance negative affect or to dampen positive affect. The prevalence of such contrahedonic motivation has been related to simultaneous experiences of positive and negative (i.e., mixed) affect. We investigated the role that implicit mental representations of affect valence may play in this regard in a study with N = 400 participants aged 11-88 years. Results demonstrated the age-fairness and reliability of the affect-valence Implicit Association Test, a newly developed implicit measure of interindividual differences in mental representations of affect valence. The older participants were, the more distinctively they implicitly associated happiness with pleasantness and/or unhappiness with unpleasantness. Participants furthermore carried mobile phones as assessment instruments with them for 3 weeks while pursuing their daily routines. The phones prompted participants on average 54 times to report their momentary affective experience and affect-regulation motivation. Contrahedonic motivation and mixed affect were most prevalent among adolescents and least prevalent among older adults, and thus showed a similar pattern of age differences as the affect-valence Implicit Association Test. Furthermore, the more distinctive participants' implicit associations of happiness with pleasantness, and/or unhappiness with unpleasantness, the less likely participants were to report contrahedonic motivation and mixed affect in their daily lives. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the mixed-affect perspective on contrahedonic motivation by demonstrating the respective role of implicit affect-valence representations.

AB A number of studies have found that broadband internalizing and externalizing factors provide a parsimonious framework for understanding the structure of psychopathology across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. However, few of these studies have examined psychopathology in young children, and several recent studies have found support for alternative models, including a bi-factor model with common and specific factors. The present study used parents' (typically mothers') reports on a diagnostic interview in a community sample of 3-year old children (n = 541; 53.9 % male) to compare the internalizing-externalizing latent factor model with a bi-factor model. The bi-factor model provided a better fit to the data. To test the concurrent validity of this solution, we examined associations between this model and paternal reports and laboratory observations of child temperament. The internalizing factor was associated with low levels of surgency and high levels of fear; the externalizing factor was associated with high levels of surgency and disinhibition and low levels of effortful control; and the common factor was associated with high levels of surgency and negative affect and low levels of effortful control. These results suggest that psychopathology in preschool-aged children may be explained by a single, common factor influencing nearly all disorders and unique internalizing and externalizing factors. These findings indicate that shared variance across internalizing and externalizing domains is substantial and are consistent with recent suggestions that emotion regulation difficulties may be a common vulnerability for a wide array of psychopathology.

AB Children of parents with a mental illness are often found to be at high risk of developing psychological problems themselves. Little is known about the role of family factors in the relation between parental and adolescent mental health. The current study focused on parent-child interaction and family environment. This cross-sectional questionnaire study included 124 families with a mentally ill parent and 127 families without a mentally ill parent who at the time of the study had children aged 11-16 years old. Parents completed questionnaires about their mental health, parent-child interaction (i.e., parental monitoring and parental support), and family environment (i.e., cohesion, expressiveness, and conflict). Adolescents reported their internalizing and externalizing problems. Path analyses were used to examine the direct associations between parental mental illness and adolescent problems as well as the indirect relations via parent-child interaction and family environment. The results showed that interaction between parents with a mental illness and their child was significantly worse compared to parents without a mental illness. The family environment of parents with mental illness was also more negative. Mentally ill parents monitored their adolescents less, which in turn related to more externalizing problems of the adolescents. No factors mediated the relation between parental mental health and adolescent internalizing problems. Moreover, no direct effects of parental support, family cohesion, and family expressiveness with externalizing problems were found. These findings imply that parental monitoring should get a specific focus of attention in existing interventions designed to prevent adolescents with a mentally ill parent from developing problems.

AB Several studies have shown deficits in emotion recognition in children with Down syndrome (DS). However, most of these studies required the understanding of verbal labels of emotion in their instructions, which may have been a disadvantage for these children, given their common language difficulties. This study addressed this issue by investigating the abilities of children with DS to recognize emotion from emotional terms, using the same visual material as in a previous nonverbal study with which they had no difficulty. Their performance was compared to that of typically developing children (TD) and children with nonspecific intellectual disability (NSID) of the same developmental age, during a 3-year longitudinal follow-up. Results showed that the abilities of children with DS were significantly poorer and developed slower than those of TD children, but not children with NSID. These cross-sectional and longitudinal data tend to show that children with DS have a lack of understanding of emotional verbal labels. The implications of these findings for future emotion recognition studies in these children, notably the need to design nonverbal experiments using dynamic stimuli, are discussed. The consequences of a potential deficit affecting the emotional lexicon are also raised with a view to orienting therapeutic and educational support.

AB Emotional lability, or sudden strong shifts in emotion, commonly occurs in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although these symptoms are impairing and disruptive, relatively little research has addressed their treatment, likely due to the difficulty of reliable and valid assessment. Promising signals for symptom improvement have come from recent studies using stimulants in adults, children and adolescents. Similarly, neuroimaging studies have begun to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying stimulants' impact on emotion regulation capacities. Here, we review these recent clinical and neuroimaging findings, as well as neurocognitive models for emotional lability in ADHD, issues of relevance to prescribers and the important role of psychiatric comorbidity with treatment choices.

AB The emotion regulation (ER)-specificity hypothesis assumes that a specific psychological problem is characterized by a specific maladaptive ER strategy. This hypothesis will be investigated for six child-DSM symptom clusters (Study 1) and for depressive symptoms (Study 2). We also investigated whether certain emotion regulation strategies can be detected through different forms of symptom clusters. Study 1 includes 432 school aged non-referred youngsters (60 % girls; age range between 8 and 18 years) and Study 2 includes 128 school aged non-referred youngsters (55 % girls; age range between 10 and 14 years). A self-report questionnaire, FEEL-KJ investigates a wide range of adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies. DSM symptom clusters (affective, anxiety, somatic, conduct, oppositional and ADHD problems) were measured by parent report on the Child Behaviour Checklist; depressive symptoms were measured with the Child Depression Inventory. Youngsters with emotional problems have specifically less adaptive ER strategies. The relation with maladaptive ER strategies can only be detected with self-reported depressive symptoms. ER strategies problem-oriented action and acceptance are transdiagnostically related to both internalizing and externalizing problems. For affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems the ER-specificity hypothesis is confirmed. Investigating ER strategies could be of clinical relevance specifically in children with affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems. Next, training deficits in the ER strategies Problem-oriented action and Acceptance can be considered as important in the treatment of all children with emotional problems.

AB Despite substantial clinical and anecdotal evidence for emotion dysregulation in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), little is known about the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon. We sought to explore neural mechanisms for cognitive reappraisal in children and adolescents with ASD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied 16 youth with ASD and 15 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) comparison youth. Participants were instructed in the use of cognitive reappraisal strategies to increase and decrease their emotional responses to disgusting images. Participants in both groups displayed distinct patterns of brain activity for increasing versus decreasing their emotions. TD participants showed downregulation of bilateral insula and left amygdala on decrease trials, whereas ASD participants showed no modulation of insula and upregulation of left amygdala. Furthermore, TD youth exhibited increased functional connectivity between amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared to ASD participants when downregulating disgust, as well as decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. These findings have important implications for our understanding of emotion dysregulation and its treatment in ASD. In particular, the relative lack of prefrontalamygdala connectivity provides a potential target for treatment-related outcome measurements. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined the roles of cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, and rumination in first episode non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents, and the impact of age-related differences in emotion regulation use. Adverse life events and psychological distress played a significant role in NSSI onset. Being male and less use of cognitive reappraisal contributed to NSSI risk but only in regard to 12-month incidence; this effect was not observed when predicting 24-month incidence. Neither expressive suppression nor rumination was related to NSSI onset in our sample. Age-related differences in emotion regulation were found, but did not modify the above relationships. Findings hint at the possible impact of developmental changes in adolescents' cognitive-emotional processing and their subsequent risk of NSSI. Results support further investigation into prevention and early intervention initiatives aimed at assisting adolescents cope with acute life stressors to prevent/delay first episode NSSI.

AB Objective: This study examined associations among family environment, coping, and emotional and conduct problems in adolescents attending therapeutic day schools due to mental health problems.
   Methods: Adolescents (N = 417; 30.2% female) ages 13-20 (M = 15.25) reported on their family environment (affective involvement and functioning), coping (emotion-focused support-seeking, cognitive restructuring, avoidant actions), and emotional and conduct problems.
   Results: Poorer family environment was associated with less emotion-focused support-seeking and cognitive restructuring, and more emotional and conduct problems. Emotional problems were negatively associated with cognitive restructuring, and conduct problems were negatively associated with all coping strategies. Cognitive restructuring accounted for the relationship between family environment and emotional problems. Cognitive restructuring and emotion-focused support-seeking each partially accounted for the relationship between family functioning and conduct problems, but not the relationship between family affective involvement and conduct problems.
   Conclusions: Findings implicate the role of coping in the relationship between family environment and adolescent mental health. (C) 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Behavioral and emotional problems comprising internalizing, externalizing and mixed disorders consist of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescents. Prevalence rates of 83% for preschoolers, 12.2% for preadolescents and 15.0% for adolescents have been reported from around the world. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders in 7-11 year-old school children studying in Kandy District Sri Lanka which was a first for the geographic area.
   Method: This was a community based study at the primary section of the selected schools. The questionnaire, Child behavior Checklist-Sinhala (CBCL-S) was administered in a group setting to the main caregiver of 562 subjects selected randomly. The questionnaire identified problems in 8 subscales under three main sub categories : internalizing, externalizing and other. Data were analyzed using The Syndrome Scales for Boys and Girls developed for analyzing the questionnaire CBCL
   Results: Indicated a prevalence of 13.8% of emotional and behavioral problems in the study population. 8.8% of children showed internalizing problems and 8.8% externalizing problems. These findings are in line with the prevailing rates from previous studies of the world. Children in school types 1AB and 1C had less emotional and behavioral problems compared to type 2 and 3 schools.
   Limitations: Only 20 schools in KEZ and Sinhala speaking population of the Kandy were studied.
   Conclusions: This study showed the extent of childhood emotional and behavioral problems and also confirms that the schools with advanced level classes have lesser problems amongst primary children. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ANTERIOR CINGULATE; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS; SOCIAL PHOBIA; WORRY;
   ACTIVATION; AMYGDALA; CONNECTIVITY; ADOLESCENTS; REACTIVITY
AB Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder, but its neurobiological basis has been poorly studied. A few cognitive models have been proposed for understanding GAD development and maintenance. The aim of this study is to review functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) studies conducted with GAD patients and evaluate if they support and underpin the theoretical cognitive models proposed for this anxiety disorder.
   Methods: A literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no time limits.
   Results: From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the "emotional dysregulation model", showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one study explored the "conditioned fear overgeneralization theory", other the "intolerance of uncertainty model" and two studies were unspecific (worry induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and post-treatment with antidepressants or "mindfulness".
   Limitations: The studies' methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common finding.
   Conclusion: Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex-amygdala functional connectivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) may be an important transdiagnostic factor for understanding mental and behavioral health given its association with several psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is limited research on ER in ASD, particularly using biomarkers such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). The aim of the current study was to examine RSA among school-aged children with ASD in relation to symptoms of anxiety, executive functioning, and adaptive socialization skills. Results showed decreased RSA in children with ASD (relative to typically developing controls), reflecting decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity. In addition, decreased RSA was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and lower socialization skills. These findings emphasize the need for interventions targeting emotional and arousal regulation in ASD.

AB Background: There are an increasing number of reports on time trends in child and adolescent psychological problems but none from low-and middle-income countries, and very few covering the preschool period. The aim was to investigate changes in preschool behavioral/emotional problems in two birth cohorts from a middle-income country born 11 years apart. Methods: We analyzed data from the 1993 and 2004 Pelotas birth cohort studies from Brazil. A subsample of 4-year olds from the 1993 cohort (634) and all 4-year olds from the 2004 cohort (3750) were assessed for behavioral/emotional problems through maternal report using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Response rates in these two population-based cohorts were above 90%. Results: We found a significant increase in CBCL total problems, internalizing and externalizing mean scores over the 11-year period. For 1993 and 2004 Pelotas cohorts, respectively, CBCL mean values (SE) total problems scores were 27.9 (0.8) and 34.7 (0.3); for internalizing scores, 5.7 (0.2) and 6.3 (0.1) and for externalizing scores, 12.4 (0.4) and 15.5 (0.1). After adjusting for confounding variables, the largest increase from 1993 to 2004 was identified in the aggressive behavior syndrome score (Cohen's d = .50), followed by the externalizing problem score (Cohen's d = .40) and CBCL total problem score (Cohen's d = .36), respectively. The rise in child psychological problems was more marked in children from families with fewer assets and with less educated mothers. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for a substantial increase in preschool behavioral problems among children in Brazil over an 11-year period.

AB Children enter foster care with many forms of adversity and trauma beyond maltreatment that impact their short- and long-term physical, mental, and developmental health and their adaptation to their new care environment. Applying an understanding of the impact of toxic stress on the developing brain and body allows the health care provider to understand findings in this vulnerable population. Complex trauma alters immune response, neurodevelopment, and the genome, resulting in predictable and significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical consequences. Pediatric care of children in foster care must be trauma informed to meet their medical, mental health, and developmental needs.

ID QUESTIONNAIRE; PROFILE
AB AimThe parent form of the 113-item Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is widely utilized by child psychiatrists and psychologists. This report examines the reliability and validity of a recently developed abbreviated version of the CBCL, the Brief Problem Monitor (BPM).
   MethodsCaregivers (n=567) completed the CBCL online and the 19 BPM items were examined separately.
   ResultsInternal consistency of the BPM was high (Cronbach's alpha=0.91) and satisfactory for the Internalizing (0.78), Externalizing (0.86), and Attention (0.87) scales. High correlations between the CBCL and BPM were identified for the total score (r=0.95) as well as the Internalizing (0.86), Externalizing (0.93), and Attention (0.97) scales. The BPM and scales were sensitive and identified significantly higher behavioral and emotional problems among children whose caregiver reported a psychiatric diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, developmental disabilities, or autism spectrum disorders relative to a comparison group that had not been diagnosed with these disorders. BPM ratings also differed by the socioeconomic status and education of the caregiver. Mothers with higher annual incomes rated their children as having 38.8% fewer total problems (Cohen's d=0.62) as well as 42.8% lower Internalizing (d=0.53), 44.1% less Externalizing (d=0.62), and 30.9% decreased Attention (d=0.39). A similar pattern was evident for maternal education (d=0.30-0.65).
   ConclusionOverall, these findings provide strong psychometric support for the BPM, although the differences based on the characteristics of the parent indicate that additional information from other sources (e.g., teachers) should be obtained to complement parental reports.

AB This paper analyzes the influence of parents' educational practices on aggressive behavior during the last phase of primary education and the first cycle of secondary education, as well as the agreement between different measures of aggressiveness in a group of 326 male and female students aged 10 to 16 from a number of schools and high schools in Jaen (Spain). Educational practices analysed include affection/rejection by parents and three types of discipline-inductive, strict and indulgent. Aggressiveness in turn has been assessed from three tell-tale ways: the adolescent, their classmates and their teacher. The results of the study indicate that aggressiveness is better predicted by negative educational practices such as critique-rejection and rigid and indulgent discipline approaches. High levels of agreement are also found in aggressive behavior between different informants especially teacher and classmates. Copyright (C) 2012, Konrad Lorenz University Foundation.

AB Our literature review aims to identify risks for pediatric bipolar disorder in youth in the presence of symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This issue is of clinical and scientific significance as these two disorders share multiple characteristics, as well as high rates of comorbidity with disruptive behavior disorders. Family studies validate that these disorders often co-exist and suggest that a family history heightens the risk for the development of bipolar disorder. Elevated emotional dysregulation scores on the Child Behavioral Check List present another risk factor that is associated with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in youth. In addition, ADHD children initially presenting with depression are at an increased risk for manic switches; a switch can be predicted by the presence of a family history of mood disorders, emotional and behavioral dysregulation, subthreshold manic symptoms, and psychosis. Taken together, these risk factors can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis of mania in youth with ADHD.

AB The literature on positive psychology and resilience demonstrates that individuals utilize their personal strengths and environmental resources to facilitate positive adaptation. Using a qualitative approach, we investigated how these frameworks operated as self-protective strategies for female sex workers to maintain their psychological and physical well-being under stressful socioeconomic and work-related conditions. Twenty-three female sex workers in Hong Kong participated in in-depth interviews. We used the grounded theory approach for data analysis. The informants reported negative feelings in response to financial burden, clients' demands, threats to physical health, and stigma. Some female sex workers showed their resilience by being able to rationalize their role, believe their ability to make a change in life, and stay optimistic. They adopted strategies including emotional regulation and acceptance of their responsibility and limits to cope with stressful life events. The results help us understand the role of positive psychology and resilience in this vulnerable population.

AB The present study challenges the popular notion that overly controlling or restrictive parenting is the primary pathway to academic achievement for Chinese Americans. Although traditional Chinese values require parents to make good choices for their children by supervising and asserting strict limits using guan (safeguarding) and jiao xun (demandingness of excellence), such parental duties do not preclude the use of autonomy support or noncoercive discipline to promote children's academic success. In this study, we examined the processes or mechanisms underlying the linkages between parental autonomy support, emotion-related self-regulation, adaptive skills, and academic achievement in 92 Chinese American adolescents (mean age = 16 years, SD = 1.4) and their first-generation immigrant parents. Study results indicate that parental autonomy support and emotion-related self-regulation are both promotive factors in adaptive and academic competencies. We propose that guan, or safeguarding, and jiao xun, or demandingness of excellence, represent parental strictness-supervision, which when counterbalanced by autonomy support, could be considered the yin and yang in parenting that promotes adolescents' academic success without harming their social-emotional or psychological well-being.

AB This study explored the relationships between adolescents' perceptions of their capacity for social-emotional regulation and generalized problematic Internet use (GPIU). It further examined if maladaptive thoughts from undue academic-related stress mediated this relationship in a school-going population in Singapore where educational achievement is heavily emphasized and expected from the family and school, and the pressure to succeed and do well academically is more acutely felt than that experienced in western contexts. A total of 1437 8th and 9th graders participated in a survey questionnaire. The results showed that adolescents who perceived higher regulatory competence were more likely to use the Internet to deal with the negative consequences of Internet use in appropriate ways. Also, the study found maladaptive thoughts that came from perceived academic expectations of parents and teachers partially mediated the effects of social-emotional regulatory competence and these youngsters' ability to control their online social interactions. Of interest was the unexpected finding that the respective relationships between social-emotional regulatory competence and compulsive Internet use, and withdrawal from Internet use became salient when such maladaptive thoughts were taken into account, suggesting the possibility of suppression rather than mediational effects. Implications arising from the study will be discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neuroimaging studies have documented differences in neural responses to food cues in obese versus lean samples but little is known about weight status differences in responsiveness to other key features of obesogenic environments, particularly cues reflecting physical activity. To address this gap, patterns of activation related to visual depictions of sedentary activities and vigorous physical exercise were assessed in overweight (O-W) and average weight (A-W) samples via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   METHODS: Thirteen O-W and 13 A-W Chinese women were instructed to imagine engaging in 90 physical exercise activities and 90 sedentary activities and to watch 90 landscape images presented during three runs of an fMRI scan within a cross-sectional design.
   RESULTS: Behavioral results indicated O-W women endorsed more negative attitudes toward physical activity than A-W did. Imaging analyses indicated that body mass index had a significant negative association with activation of the right putamen and a positive correlation with activation in the right medial frontal gyrus, specifically Brodmann Area 10 in the exercise-sedentary image contrast condition. For the sedentary-control contrast, significantly less activation in an insula area related to negative affect was observed for the O-W group. Finally, for the exercise-control contrast, O-W women also displayed comparatively weaker activation in a cingulate gyrus area implicated in kinesthetic memory of body movements and the re-experiencing real events.
   CONCLUSION: Together, results supported contentions that exposure to depictions of physical exercise corresponds to reduced activation of reward centers and heightened activation in regions associated with negative affect regulation among O-W women compared with leaner peers.

AB The Bird's Nest Drawing (BND) (Kaiser, 1996. The Arts in Psychotherapy, 23, 333-340) is an art-based technique to assess attachment security. In the past 15 years, several studies have tested the validity of the END mainly in adult clinical populations. In an attempt to strengthen the validity of the measure in children, the current study examined the associations between the BND and two other frequently used assessment techniques evaluating attachment security: Kaplan and Main's (1986. Instructions for the classification of children's family drawings in terms of representation of attachment. Berkeley, CA: University of California) Family Drawing Coding System and the Attachment Security Questionnaire (Kerns et al., 1996. Developmental Psychology, 32, 457-466) on a sample of elementary-school age children (n = 81) in Israel. BNDs were scored using specific indicators as well as global rating scales. The findings point to associations between the children's self-reported security score, and the BND indicators and global scales. Similarly, scores on both the specific indicators and global scales in family drawings were correlated with the BND global scales. Levels of BND scales varied as a function of the children's attachment orientations derived from their family drawings. Associations were also found between attachment orientations based on family and BND drawings. Results were interpreted as supporting the use of a global approach of rating in addition to a sign-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Little is known regarding demographic and/or clinical characteristics associated with the use of lithium among adolescents with bipolar disorder (BP) in naturalistic clinical settings. We therefore examined factors associated with lithium among adolescents with BP presenting to a tertiary outpatient clinic.
   Methods: Participants were 100 adolescents 13-19 years of age, with BP-I, BP-II, or BP not otherwise specified (BP-NOS). Diagnoses and lifetime medication exposure were determined using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL). Analyses examined for demographic and clinical correlates of lifetime lithium exposure.
   Results: Twenty percent of participants reported lifetime lithium use. Participants with, versus those without, lifetime lithium use were significantly older and significantly more likely to have BP-I, lifetime history of psychiatric hospitalization, and psychosis. Lithium-treated participants were significantly more likely to report use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and antimanic anticonvulsants. In contrast, participants with lithium exposure were significantly less likely to have BP-II, self-injurious behavior, and a family history of depression. Adolescents with lithium exposure had significantly less parent-reported family conflict and mood lability, and significantly less self-reported impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, identity confusion, and interpersonal problems. In multivariable analyses, lithium use was associated with greater lifetime SGA use, lower parent-reported family conflict, and lower adolescent-reported interpersonal problems.
   Conclusions: Lithium was infrequently used among adolescents with BP in this sample. Although constrained by retrospective methodology and a single site, our findings suggest that clinicians may be deferring lithium use until late in treatment. The fact that there are lower rates of lithium use among adolescents with suicidal ideation, impulsivity, mood lability, and family history of depression suggests potential missed opportunities for use of lithium among high-risk adolescents with BP.

AB Background: Prior studies have assessed relationships between gang membership and health-related factors. However, the existing literature has largely failed to consider how individual and broader social contextual factors might be related to such gang involvement among African American females. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify empirically driven correlates of gang involvement and then better understand the relationship between gang membership and health-related behaviors for African American females, after controlling for covariates of gang involvement.
   Methods: Data were collected from a convenience sample of detained African American adolescents females, between the ages of 13-17, currently incarcerated in a short-term detention facility in Atlanta, Georgia (n = 188). After obtaining written informed assent and parental permission, participants answered survey questions using A-CASI procedures that assessed socio-contextual factors and health-related behaviors.
   Results: Multiple logistic regression models controlling for age and SES documented that low self-esteem, emotional dysregulation, trauma history, deviant peers, low parental monitoring, infrequent parental communication, housing instability and poor neighborhood quality were correlates of gang involvement. In addition, multiple linear and logistic regression models, controlling for these constructs, revealed that gang involvement was independently associated with lower STD prevention knowledge, a higher likelihood of having a gang-involved boyfriend, a greater risk of having current casual sexual partnerships, higher rates of substance abuse, higher incidences of condom misuse and a lower likelihood of ever having been tested for HIV.
   Conclusions: These results provide information that can help service providers target certain profiles of African American females who may be at risk for joining gangs and address the health risk behaviors that may be associated with such memberships. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavioral functioning in pediatric patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). A cross-sectional study was conducted in 132 Dutch children and adolescents with HS and aged 8-18 years of whom 48 underwent splenectomy prior to the study. HRQoL was assessed using the KIDSCREEN-27, and behavioral functioning was evaluated using the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Scores of pediatric patients with HS were compared to a Dutch norm population. Additionally, the effects of three factors were assessed: fatigue, self-image, and parents' perceived vulnerability (measured with the checklist individual strength, the self-perception profile for children and adolescents, and the child vulnerability scale). Both unsplenectomised and splenectomised pediatric patients reported lower HRQoL on the domain physical well-being (KIDSCREEN-27) compared to Dutch peers. For behavioral functioning, parents of both groups reported more emotional problems (SDQ) compared to the norm population. Pediatric patients with lower scores on physical well-being experienced more fatigue. The patients' perceived social acceptance and parents' perceived vulnerability appeared as determinants of emotional problems. Conclusion: Pediatric patients in the current study generally report few complaints, and the results suggest that these patients overall have a strong ability to cope with HS. Despite these few complaints, fatigue and parents' perceived vulnerability seem to be important determinants for lower HRQoL and more emotional problems. Therefore, screening on these factors could serve as an addition to the treatment of HS, to help pediatric patients who are at risk for lower HRQoL or more emotional problems.

AB There is a high degree of comorbidity between anxiety and depressive disorders among treatment-seeking adolescents. Comorbid youth often present with greater diagnostic severity, worse social functioning, and more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, compared with anxiety-disordered youth without depression. However, the degree to which these populations may differ in underlying affect and emotion regulation (ER) is largely unknown. This study compared 44 anxiety-disordered adolescents (ages 12-18 years) with a comorbid depressive disorder (ANX + DEP) and 32 anxiety-disordered adolescents without a comorbid depressive disorder (ANX) on several clinical and emotion-related variables. Results indicated that ANX + DEP adolescents were assigned higher clinician-rated diagnostic severity ratings, and reported greater functional impairment and more severe social anxiety and depressive symptoms, compared with ANX adolescents. In addition, ANX + DEP adolescents demonstrated higher levels of negative affect, lower levels of positive affect, and poorer self-reported and parent-reported ER. Implications for assessment and treatment, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.

AB The mediating effects of emotion regulation (reappraisal and suppression) were examined in the relationship between music engagement and well-being. Emotion regulation strategies (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; Gross & John, 2003) and styles of music engagement (Music Use questionnaire; Chin & Rickard, 2012) were assessed in a large diverse sample of 637 participants. A battery of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being measures (International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form; Thompson, 2007; Satisfaction With Life Scale; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985; Mental Health Continuum-Short Form; Keyes et al., 2008) was also administered. Results demonstrated that the path of mediation was dependent on the type of emotion regulation strategy utilized, as well as the way in which one engages with music. Findings provide initial evidence that engaging with music for the purposes of cognitive and emotion regulation may enhance wellbeing primarily through the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal. In contrast, various other aspects of music engagement (music listening, engaged production, and social connection) if coupled with a tendency to regulate emotions and thoughts by expressive suppression may yield undesirable wellbeing outcomes. This study highlights the important role emotion regulation plays in the complex relationship between music engagement and well-being.

AB The intersection of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and executive functioning (EF) in children and adolescents is an emerging topic in the current literature. Spurred by the consistent association between increased EF deficits and higher adult obsessive-compulsive severity, a few initial studies have replicated this relationship in pediatric OCD samples and also have found preliminary evidence that EF deficits are associated with worse response to first-line psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatments for pediatric OCD. This study aimed to extend the literature by providing the first comprehensive investigation of how multiple EF domains, measured repeatedly over the course of treatment, impact pediatric obsessive-compulsive severity and response to multimodal treatment. Multi-level modeling results found that deficits in shifting, inhibition, emotional control, planning/organizing, monitoring and initiating all predicted higher average obsessive compulsive severity across treatment. Interestingly, out of the eight domains of EF investigated, only emotional control moderated treatment outcome such that those with worse emotional control experienced less of a reduction in obsessive-compulsive severity during treatment. The findings generally align with previous theories for the link between EF and OCD and indicate that emotional control has important implications in the treatment of pediatric OCD. In fact, emotional control may provide one explanation for why factors such as disgust sensitivity, oppositional behavior, and third-wave behavioral treatment techniques have all been linked to pediatric OCD treatment outcome. Future research should investigate augmentation strategies that target emotional control in children and adolescents.

AB The following review article examines the value of a dimensional approach to research in relation to recent findings of child and adolescent emotion dysregulation. With the publication of the DSM-5, it is important to keep in mind that difficulties in pinpointing causal mechanisms may result from the collective grouping of different emotional deficits by diagnoses. Evidence available from studies examining pediatric emotion dysregulation indicate strengths in the dimensional approach for research, especially in light of developmental changes to neural activations of emotion regulation. Use of a dimensional approach in research appears to be an effective tactic that could pave the way for a better understanding of pediatric emotion dysregulation and thereby elucidate better treatments and outcomes for those with this behavioral deficit, regardless of diagnosis.

AB Background. Neuroimaging measures of behavioral and emotional dysregulation can yield biomarkers denoting developmental trajectories of psychiatric pathology in youth. We aimed to identify functional abnormalities in emotion regulation (ER) neural circuitry associated with different behavioral and emotional dysregulation trajectories using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and neuroimaging.
   Method. A total of 61 youth (9-17 years) from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms study, and 24 healthy control youth, completed an emotional face n-back ER task during scanning. LCGA was performed on 12 biannual reports completed over 5 years of the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item Mania Scale (PGBI-10M), a parental report of the child's difficulty regulating positive mood and energy.
   Results. There were two latent classes of PGBI-10M trajectories: high and decreasing (HighD; n=22) and low and decreasing (LowD; n=39) course of behavioral and emotional dysregulation over the 12 time points. Task performance was >89% in all youth, but more accurate in healthy controls and LowD versus HighD (p<0.001). During ER, LowD had greater activity than HighD and healthy controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key ER region, and greater functional connectivity than HighD between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (p's<0.001, corrected).
   Conclusions. Patterns of function in lateral prefrontal cortical-amygdala circuitry in youth denote the severity of the developmental trajectory of behavioral and emotional dysregulation over time, and may be biological targets to guide differential treatment and novel treatment development for different levels of behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth.

AB Background: Common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been shown to influence social and affective behavior and to moderate the effect of adverse experiences on risk for social-affective problems. However, the intermediate neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Although human functional neuroimaging studies have reported that oxytocin effects on social behavior and emotional states are mediated by amygdala function, animal models indicate that oxytocin receptors in the ventral striatum (VS) modulate sensitivity to social reinforcers. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate OXTR-dependent brain mechanisms associated with social-affective problems.
   Methods: In a sample of 1445 adolescents we tested the effect of 23-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms across the OXTR region and stressful life events (SLEs) on functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent activity in the VS and amygdala to animated angry faces. Single nucleotide polymorphisms for which gene-wide significant effects on brain function were found were then carried forward to examine associations with social-affective problems.
   Results: A gene-wide significant effect of rs237915 showed that adolescents with minor CC-genotype had significantly lower VS activity than CT/TT-carriers. Significant or nominally significant gene x environment effects on emotional problems (in girls) and peer problems (in boys) revealed a strong increase in clinical symptoms as a function of SLEs in CT/TT-carriers but not CC-homozygotes. However, in low-SLE environments, CC-homozygotes had more emotional problems (girls) and peer problems (boys). Moreover, among CC-homozygotes, reduced VS activity was related to more peer problems.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that a common OXTR-variant affects brain responsiveness to negative social cues and that in "riskcarriers" reduced sensitivity is simultaneously associated with more social-affective problems in "favorable environments" and greater resilience against stressful experiences.

AB Background: Resilience is essential for the psychological adjustment of adolescents experiencing difficulty. Comparing differences in resilience between adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents may help identify factors related to resilience in adolescents. Objective: The purpose of this study was to clarify how illness impacts the normative development of adolescent survivors of brain tumors by comparing them to healthy adolescents in terms of resilience and how it is affected by various health problems. Methods: This cross-sectional, case-control study used convenience sampling to recruit 13- to 18-year-old adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents matched by school level, gender, and living area. Data were collected by structured questionnaires. Results: The sample included 60 adolescent survivors and 120 healthy adolescents. Participants in both groups were predominantly male adolescents (63.3%) and junior high school students (55%). The 2 groups did not differ significantly in resilience, but survivors without emotional problems had a higher mean resilience score than did healthy adolescents and survivors with emotional problems (F = 8.65, P < .01). Conclusions: Our results identify emotional problems as a risk factor for resilience in both adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents. In addition, the impact of emotional problems on resilience was more severe in brain tumor survivors than in healthy adolescents. Implications for Practice: Our results suggest that pediatric oncology nurses design interdisciplinary school-based interventions to reduce the impact of emotional problems on resilience in both healthy adolescents and those who survived brain tumors.

AB Asymmetry of frontal cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in children is influenced by the social environment and considered a marker of vulnerability to emotional and behavioral problems. To determine the reliability of these associations, we used meta-analysis to test whether variation in resting frontal EEG asymmetry is consistently associated with (a) having experienced psychosocial risk (e.g., parental depression or maltreatment) and (b) internalizing and externalizing behavior outcomes in children ranging from newborns to adolescents. Three meta-analyses including 38 studies (N=2,523) and 50 pertinent effect sizes were carried out. The studies included in the analyses reported associations between frontal EEG asymmetry and psychosocial risk (k=20; predominantly studies with maternal depression as the risk factor) as well as internalizing (k=20) and externalizing (k=10) behavior outcomes. Psychosocial risk was significantly associated with greater relative right frontal asymmetry, with an effect size of d=.36 (p<.01), the effects being stronger in girls. A non-significant relation was observed between right frontal asymmetry and internalizing symptoms (d=.19, p=.08), whereas no association between left frontal asymmetry and externalizing symptoms was observed (d=.04, p=.79). Greater relative right frontal asymmetry appears to be a fairly consistent marker of the presence of familial stressors in children but the power of frontal asymmetry to directly predict emotional and behavioral problems is modest.

AB There have been significant advances made towards understanding the processes mediating extinction of learned fear. However, despite being of clear theoretical and clinical significance, very few studies have examined fear extinction in adolescence, which is often described as a developmental window of vulnerability to psychological disorders. This paper reviews the relatively small body of research examining fear extinction in adolescence. A prominent finding of this work is that adolescents, both humans and rodents, exhibit a marked impairment in extinction relative to both younger (e.g., juvenile) and older (e.g., adult) groups. We then review some potential mechanisms that could produce the striking extinction deficit observed in adolescence. For example, one neurobiological candidate mechanism for impaired extinction in adolescence involves changes in the functional connectivity within the fear extinction circuit, particularly between prefrontal cortical regions and the amygdala. In addition, we review research on emotion regulation and attention processes that suggests that developmental changes in attention bias to threatening cues may be a cognitive mechanism that mediates age-related differences in extinction learning. We also examine how a differential reaction to chronic stress in adolescence impacts upon extinction retention during adolescence as well as in later life. Finally, we consider the findings of several studies illustrating promising approaches that overcome the typically-observed extinction impairments in adolescent rodents and that could be translated to human adolescents.

AB In this study, we aimed to investigate age related changes in systems implicated in top down attention and the implications of this for amygdala responses to emotional distracters. Fifty-one healthy subjects including 18 children (aged 10-14), 15 adolescents (aged 14-18), and 18 young adults (aged 18-25) completed the affective Stroop paradigm while undergoing functional MRI. While achieving comparable behavioral performance, children, relative to adolescents and adults, showed increased activation in areas including anterior cingulate gyrus and precentral gyrus in task relative to view trials. In addition, children showed increased activation within the amygdala and fusiform gyrus in response to emotional stimuli. Notably, the group difference within the amygdala was particularly pronounced during task trials. Also children showed increased connectivity between amygdala and superior frontal gyrus and bilateral postcentral gyrii in response to negative task trials. These data are consistent with previous work indicating less consolidated functional integrity in regions implicated in top down attention in children relative to older participants and extend this work by indicating that this less consolidated functional integrity leads to reduced automatic emotion regulation as a function of top down attention. Given that reduced automatic emotion regulation as a function of top down attention is considered a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, these data may contribute to an understanding of the increased risk for the development of these disorders at this age.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is increasingly common in young psychiatric patients. It is unclear why pain, which should be aversive, becomes reinforcing in this context. We hypothesized that pain- and/or reward-processing neurocircuitry would be abnormal in NSSI patients compared with non-NSSI patients Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we administered a painfully cold and comparison cool stimulus under two conditions: self-administered and experimenter-administered (as a control). Participants comprised 13 NSSI patients and 15 non-NSSI control patients, who were matched for sex, age, medications, symptoms, and diagnoses. Whole-brain analyses of main effects, as well as correlational analyses with subjective pain and "relief' (suggesting reward), were performed. Significant main effects of group showed greater blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response for NSSI than controls in right midbrain/pons; culmen; amygdala; and parahippocampal, inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri; as well as orbital frontal cortex (OFC). The correlation between BOLD signal and "relief' was greater in NSSI patients in areas associated with reward/pain and addiction including thalamus, dorsal striatum and anterior precuneus. Post hoc analysis showed reduced functional connectivity between right OFC and anterior cingulate cortex in NSSI youth, implying possible deficits in the neuroregulation of emotional behavior. These findings help inform how pain is associated with reward for NSSI patients but not for non-NSSI patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research in psychology and affective neuroscience often relies on film as a standardized and reliable method for evoking emotion. However, clip validation is not undertaken regularly. This presents a challenge for research with adolescent and young adult samples who are exposed routinely to high-definition (HD) three-dimensional (3D) stimuli and may not respond to older, validated film clips. Studies with young people inform understanding of emotional development, dysregulated affect, and psychopathology, making it critical to assess whether technological advances improve the study of emotion. In the present study, we examine whether 3D film is more evocative than 2D using a tightly controlled within-subjects design. Participants (n = 408) viewed clips during a concurrent psychophysiological assessment. Results indicate that both 2D and 3D technology are highly effective tools for emotion elicitation. However, 3D does not add incremental benefit over 2D, even when individual differences in anxiety, emotion dysregulation, and novelty seeking are considered.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the current leading causes of disability worldwide. Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of depression, with MDD affecting 8-20% of all youth. Traditional treatment methods have not been sufficiently effective to slow the increasing prevalence of adolescent depression. We therefore propose a new model for the treatment of adolescent depression - Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA) - that is based on current understanding of developmental and depression neurobiology. The TARA model is aligned with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health. In this article, we first address the relevance of RDoC to adolescent depression. Second, we identify the major RDoC domains of function involved in adolescent depression and organize them in a way that gives priority to domains thought to be driving the psychopathology. Third, we select therapeutic training strategies for TARA based on current scientific evidence of efficacy for the prioritized domains of function in a manner that maximizes time, resources, and feasibility. The TARA model takes into consideration the developmental limitation in top-down cognitive control in adolescence and promotes bottom-up strategies such as vagal afference to decrease limbic hyperactivation and its secondary effects. The program has been informed by mindfulness-based therapy and yoga, as well as modern psychotherapeutic techniques. The treatment program is semi-manualized, progressive, and applied in a module-based approach designed for a group setting that is to be conducted one session per week for 12 weeks. We hope that this work may form the basis for a novel and more effective treatment strategy for adolescent depression, as well as broaden the discussion on how to address this challenge.

AB The aim of this study was to examine cognitive emotion regulation strategies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A clinical sample of 191 MDD outpatients and a non-clinical sample of 267 general adults were recruited. Nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed in all participants (aged 21-65 years). Results showed that MDD participants had significantly higher scores on the following strategies: self-blame, acceptance, rumination, catastrophizing, and blaming others, but lower scores on positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, and putting in perspective strategies than general populations. In addition, self-blame, acceptance, and catastrophizing positively correlated and positive reappraisal negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in MDD populations. Further logistic regression analyses indicated that five strategies have significant and independent contributions to the prediction of MDD group membership (a higher reported use of self-blame, catastrophizing, and acceptance, and a lower reported use of positive refocusing, and putting in perspective). The results suggest that cognitive emotion regulation strategies may be a useful target for psychological assessment and treatment in patients with MDD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Sertraline (SEAT) is a clinically effective Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) known to increase and stabilize serotonin levels. This neurotransmitter plays an important role in adolescent brain development in both rodents and humans, and its dysregulation has been correlated with deficits in behavior and emotional regulation. Since prenatal stress may disturb serotoninergic homeostasis, the aim of this study was to examine the long-lasting effects of exposure to SERT throughout adolescence on behavioral and physiological developmental parameters in prenatally stressed Wistar rats. SERI was administered (5 mg/kg/day p.o.) from the age of 1-3 months to half of the progeny, of both sexes, of gestating dams stressed by use of a restraint (PS) or not stressed. Our data reveal that long-term SEAT treatment slightly reduced weight gain in both sexes, but reversed the developmental disturbed "catch-up" growth found in PS females. Neither prenatal stress nor SERT treatment induced remarkable alterations in behavior and had no effects on mean startle reflex values. However, a sex-dependent effects of PS was found: in males the PS paradigm slightly increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field, while in females, it impaired startle habituation. In both cases, SERT treatment reversed the phenomena. Additionally, the PS animals exhibited a disturbed leukocyte profile in both sexes, which was reversed by SERI The present findings are evidence that continuous SERI administration from adolescence through adulthood is safe in rodents and lessens the impact of prenatal stress in rats.

AB Objective: There is growing evidence that children's early relational environment has lasting implications for physical and mental health. In this paper, we test whether attachment insecurity in early childhood is associated with increased responsivity to risk factors for eating disorders (EDs; e.g. pubertal weight gain, maternal negative affect) during adolescence.
   Design: Hypotheses were tested with longitudinal data from 447 girls (final mean age = 15.1 years) over a 12-year period. Tests of direct effects, moderation and moderated mediation were conducted using nested structural equation models and bootstrapped estimates of direct and indirect effects.
   Results: Early attachment quality was not directly associated with disordered eating attitudes and behaviours (DEABs), but did moderate relations between adolescent ED risk factors and DEABs. Specifically, among girls with an insecure attachment history, higher BMI at age 15 directly predicted more DEABs, while maternal negative affect and pubertal weight gain indirectly predicted DEABs via greater preoccupation with parental relationships. These same direct and indirect paths did not emerge among adolescent girls with a secure attachment history.
   Conclusion: Results delineate one way early attachment quality may contribute to EDs among some adolescent girls, and support recent efforts to incorporate relational components into obesity and ED prevention programmes.

AB Foster youth often experience considerable adversity both in and out of foster care, including histories of abuse and/or neglect, and further stressors within the foster system. These adverse experiences often occur at key developmental periods that can compromise emotional functioning and lead to posttraumatic symptomatology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and emotion dysregulation. In the face of difficult histories and ongoing mental health challenges, youth transitioning into adulthood may be particularly vulnerable to increases in depressive symptoms. We explored the trajectory of depressive symptoms in foster youth from age 17 to 19 using a piecewise linear growth model, examining the effects of PTSD and emotion dysregulation on youth's depressive symptoms over time. Results revealed depressive symptoms decreased from age 17 to 18 but increased from 18 to 19. PTSD and emotion dysregulation predicted greater baseline depressive symptoms and decreases in symptoms from age 17 to 18, whereas only PTSD predicted increases in depressive symptoms from 18 to 19. Females reported higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to males. Additionally, emotion dysregulation was a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms for females than males. Implications for service delivery for foster youth transitioning into adulthood are discussed.

AB Emerging adulthood is the period of greatest risk for problematic substance use. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between a broad measure of child maltreatment and several key outcomes for a large clinical sample of emerging adults (n = 858) and adolescents (n = 2,697). The secondary aim was to examine the extent to which the relationship between child maltreatment and treatment outcomes differed between emerging adults and adolescents. Multilevel latent growth curve analyses revealed emerging adults and adolescents who experienced child maltreatment reported significantly greater reductions over time on several treatment outcomes (e.g., substance use, substance-related problems, and emotional problems). Overall, analyses did not support differential relationships between child maltreatment and changes over time in these substance use disorder treatment outcomes for emerging adults and adolescents. The one exception was that although emerging adults with child maltreatment did reduce their HIV risk over time, their improvements were not as great as were the improvements in HIV risk reported by adolescents who had experienced child maltreatment.

AB This longitudinal study examines the extent to which changes in the use of cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, and rumination impact on frequency, duration, and medical severity of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. Data from 3,143 predominantly female high school students recruited from 40 Australian secondary schools were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling. Significant differences in the psychological factors between the 555 participants with a history of NSSI and non-self-injurers were reported at baseline. Self-injurers experienced significantly greater accumulation of life stressors over time compared with non-self-injurers. After controlling for adverse life events, psychological distress and other emotion regulation strategies, use of cognitive reappraisal at baseline was associated with less severe NSSI presentations, and slower growth in medical severity of NSSI over time. Findings indicate that while both cohorts have similar emotion regulation trajectories, adolescents who self-injure start off at a disadvantage and have a propensity to engage in less helpful processes that tend to heighten negative emotional states. Results recommend increasing focus on improving adolescents' frequency and skills in use of cognitive reappraisal in efforts to reduce NSSI among this population.

AB This research tested a multilevel structural equation model of associations between 3 aspects of affective functioning (state affect, trait affect, and affective lability) and 3 alcohol outcomes (likelihood of drinking, quantity on drinking days, and dependence symptoms) in a sample of 263 college students. Participants provided 49 days of experience sampling data over 1.3 years in a longitudinal burst design. Within-person results: At the daily level, positive affect was directly associated with greater likelihood and quantity of alcohol consumption. Daily negative affect was directly associated with higher consumption on drinking days and with higher dependence symptoms. Between-person direct effects: Affect lability was associated with higher trait negative, but not positive, affect. Trait positive affect was inversely associated with the proportion of drinking days, whereas negative affectivity predicted a greater proportion of drinking days. Affect lability exhibited a direct association with dependence symptoms. Between-person indirect effects: Trait positive affect was associated with fewer dependence symptoms via proportion of drinking days. Trait negative affect was associated with greater dependence symptoms via proportion of drinking days. The results distinguish relations of positive and negative affect to likelihood versus amount of drinking and state versus trait drinking outcomes, and highlight the importance of affect variability for predicting alcohol dependence symptoms.

AB The effects of video games on youths have been subject to debate. Some researchers have linked video games to behavioral and emotional problems, while others have found no adverse effects. The behavioral and emotional problems experienced by some gamers may be linked to certain types of video games. We hypothesized that Mexican American youths with lower socioeconomic status and who play "aggressive" video games have more emotional and behavioral problems than those who do not play such games. We examined a total of 579 youths using the Child Behavior Checklist and analyzing the games played within the last 6 months. Youths who played aggressive video games had higher scores and more emotional and behavioral problems compared with those who did not play aggressive video games.

AB BackgroundThe aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency and correlates of a variety of sleep problems in adolescents.
   MethodsA representative school-based sample of 3485 8th-12th graders was selected according to the cluster sampling technique. A sleep questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were completed by the students along with their parents. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent variables of insomnia, parasomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).
   ResultsInitiation insomnia, maintenance insomnia, non-restorative sleep (NRS) and EDS were described by 12.4%, 10.7%, 9% and 9.7%, respectively. At least one parasomnia with a frequency above the median was reported by 23.4% (nightmare, 12.8%; sleep terror, 3.6%; sleepwalking, 2.5%; bruxism, 2.5%; and sleep talking, 10.9%). Insomnias and parasomnias were highly associated with each other. Female gender was related to maintenance insomnia, NRS and night terror. Emotional problems correlated with initiation insomnia, maintenance insomnia, NRS, EDS, nightmares and bruxism; hyperactivity/inattention with initiation insomnia, NRS and sleep talking. Conduct problems were associated with NRS, whereas poor school performance was associated with initiation insomnia.
   ConclusionSelf-reported sleep problems were prevalent and highly associated with each other and behavioral and emotional difficulties in Turkish adolescents.

AB The current study examined whether distress tolerance and negative urgency moderate the link between depressive symptoms and binge eating frequency, and between disordered eating attitudes and binge eating frequency. Young adult women (N = 186) completed questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, cognitive restraint, eating, shape and weight concerns, distress tolerance, impulsivity (including negative urgency), and binge eating. After controlling for body mass index, race/ethnicity, and other domains of impulsivity, negative urgency was significantly associated with binge eating above and beyond the influence of disordered eating attitudes and depressive symptoms. Distress tolerance, in contrast, was not associated with binge eating. In addition, neither negative urgency nor distress tolerance moderated the associations between disordered eating attitudes and binge eating frequency, or between depressive symptoms and binge eating. Results support the additive role of difficulties responding adaptively to distress in binge eating frequency, above and beyond the influence of emotional distress. Findings highlight the potential value of focusing on negative urgency in targeted treatments for binge eating among women. Importantly, results from the current study differ from those of previous research; these discrepancies could be the result of variations in sample characteristics and approaches to the assessment of binge eating behavior. Additional research, including longitudinal studies and research using "real-time," assessment strategies, such as ecological momentary assessment, is necessary to elucidate further the role of various emotion regulation strategies in maintaining binge eating behavior in adult women.

AB Biopsychosocial conceptualizations of eating disorders (EDs) suggest the combination of an individual's emotional vulnerability and invalidating environment increases the likelihood of developing pervasive emotion dysregulation, and subsequent use of ED behaviors to regulate emotion (Haynos & Fruzetti, 2011; Safer, Teich, & Chen, 2009). The current study aimed to provide initial support for this model in adolescent EDs, through examining the interaction between an adolescent's emotional vulnerability, indexed by attentional biases for emotions, and an invalidating family environment Specifically, we examined the ability of this interaction to discriminate youth with EDs from a comparison group of youth with chronic pain diagnoses, who were used to control for the presence of non-specific effects of having any illness. Fifty adolescent girls (25 with EDs and 25 with chronic pain) completed an emotional dot-probe task assessing attentional biases for emotional faces, and parents completed the Emotions as a Child Scale (Magai, 1996; Klimes-Dougan et al., 2007) to assess response to teen emotion. Results showed that teen angry attentional bias moderated the relationship between parental response to sadness and teen ED status: for teens with high attention bias towards angry faces, maladaptive parental response to sadness predicted increased odds of ED status versus chronic pain status.

AB Although several cross-sectional surveys have shown that certain traits such as extraversion and neuroticism are related to emotion regulation, few studies have explored the nature of this relationship. The present study tried to explore the longitudinal relation between traits, and emotion regulation strategies. The Interpersonal Self-Support Scale for Middle School Students (ISSS-MSS) and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were administrated to 374 middle school students two times across a 6-month interval. A path analysis via structural equation modeling of the five interpersonal self-support traits and the two emotion regulation strategies was tested. The results showed that interpersonal independence predicted expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal, and that interpersonal initiative also predicted reappraisal, while reappraisal predicted interpersonal flexibility and interpersonal openness 6 month later. These results support the hypotheses that some personality traits influence certain emotion regulation strategies, while other traits may be influenced by specific emotion regulation strategies.

AB This study investigated whether different components of trait emotional intelligence (or trait emotional self-efficacy) were uniquely related to traditional bullying and cyberbullying in a sample of 529 preadolescents (mean age of 12 years and 7 months), while controlling for the other forms of bullying/victimization. Binary logistic regressions showed that the dimension of emotional intelligence concerning the regulation and use of emotions was negatively related both to traditional bullying and cyberbullying; however, this association did not emerge when traditional bullying was controlled for cyberbullying, whilst it still emerged when cyberbullying was controlled for traditional bullying and both forms of victimization. Differently, the dimensions concerning appraisal of own and others' emotions were not deficient in children performing bullying and/or cyberbullying behaviors. Despite high co-occurrence between traditional and electronic bullying, our results suggested that these two forms are distinct phenomena, involving different personality traits. Implications for interventions are discussed. (C) 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study tested theories regarding differences in emotion processing among youth characterized by primary versus acquired callous-unemotional (CU) traits in a sample of 417 detained adolescents (306 boys, 111 girls). Mixture modeling identified 2 groups of youth high in CU, but with different levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms consistent with theoretical conceptualizations of acquired CU as being linked to trauma. Differences between the 2 groups of youth were investigated regarding 3 dimensions of emotion processing: emotion regulation, numbing, and recognition. Compared to youth classified in the primary group, youth classified as acquired CU demonstrated greater difficulty with lack of clarity (OR = 0.53), and nonacceptance of emotions, (OR = 0.57), general numbing of emotions (OR = 0.87), and recognition of disgust (OR = 0.18). Differences in emotion processing reported by youth in the 2 groups are consistent with theories regarding acquired callousness as related to emotional detachment in the aftermath of posttraumatic distress. The results of the current study have implications for the classification of primary and acquired CU, as well as the clinical treatment of youth with these characteristics.

AB According to the self-determination theory, experiencing autonomy support in close relationships is thought to promote adolescents' well-being. Perceptions of autonomy support from parents and from best friends have been associated with lower levels of adolescents' depressive symptoms. This longitudinal study examines the relative contribution of perceived autonomy support from parents and best friends in relation to adolescents' depressive symptoms and changes in these associations from early to late adolescence. Age and gender differences were also investigated. Questionnaires about mother, father, and a best friend were filled out by 923 early adolescents and 390 middle adolescents during five consecutive years, thereby covering an age range from 12 to 20. Multi-group cross-lagged path analysis revealed concurrent and longitudinal negative associations between perceived parental autonomy support and adolescents' depressive symptoms. No concurrent and longitudinal associations were found between perceived best friends' autonomy support and adolescents' depressive symptoms. Results were similar for early and middle adolescent boys and girls. Prevention and treatment programs should focus on the bidirectional interplay during adolescence between perceptions of parental autonomy support and adolescents' depressive symptoms.

AB A cross-sectional school-based survey study (N = 13,284; 53% females; mean age 15.8 +/- 0.7) of 14-17-year-old adolescents was conducted in seven European countries (Greece, Spain, Poland, Germany, Romania, the Netherlands, and Iceland). The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of Internet addictive behavior (IAB) and related psychosocial characteristics among adolescents in the participating countries. In the study, we distinguish two problematic groups: adolescents with IAB, characterized by a loss of control over their Internet use, and adolescents "at risk for IAB," showing fewer or weaker symptoms of IAB. The two groups combined form a group of adolescents with dysfunctional Internet behavior (DIB). About 1% of adolescents exhibited IAB and an additional 12.7% were at risk for IAB; thus, in total, 13.9% displayed DIB. The prevalence of DIB was significantly higher among boys than among girls (15.2% vs. 12.7%, p < 0.001) and varied widely between countries, from 7.9% in Iceland to 22.8% in Spain. Frequent use of specific online activities (e. g., gambling, social networking, gaming) at least 6 days/week was associated with greater probability of displaying DIB. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that DIB was more frequent among adolescents with a lower educational level of the parents, earlier age at first use of the Internet, and greater use of social networking sites and gaming sites. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that externalizing (i.e., behavioral) and internalizing (i.e., emotional) problems were associated with the presence of DIB.

AB This short-term longitudinal study examined the associations between relational and physical victimization and depressive symptoms, and the moderating role of school-aged children's relational-interdependent self-construals in these associations. The participants were 387 children (51.8% boys) who were in the fifth grade (M = 10.48 years, SD = 0.55) in Taiwan and followed at two time points (a 6-month interval) during a calendar year. A multiple-informant approach was used where forms of peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and relational-interdependent self-construals were assessed via peer nominations, teacher reports, and child reports, respectively. All measures had favorable psychometric properties. The results of a multigroup cross-lagged model demonstrated that relational victimization (not physical victimization) was positively predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms, and the effect was evidenced for highly interdependent children only. The opposite link was also significant, such that depressive symptoms predicted subsequent relational victimization (not physical victimization) for children who exhibited low and high levels of relational-interdependent self-construals. In contrast, physical victimization predated a lower level of depressive symptoms for highly interdependent children. These effects were unaffected by the gender of the child. The findings, especially the interactive effects of relational victimization (as a contextual factor) and relational-interdependent self-construals (as an individual vulnerability) on depressive symptoms, are discussed from a developmental psychopathology perspective.

AB In the current study, we addressed several issues related to the forms (physical and relational) and functions (reactive and proactive) of aggression in community (n = 307), voluntary residential (n = 1,917), and involuntarily detained (n = 659) adolescents (ages 11-19 years). Across samples, boys self-reported more physical aggression and girls reported more relational aggression, with the exception of higher levels of both forms of aggression in detained girls. Further, few boys showed high rates of relational aggression without also showing high rates of physical aggression. In contrast, it was not uncommon for girls to show high rates of relational aggression alone, and these girls tended to also have high levels of problem behavior (e.g., delinquency) and mental health problems (e.g., emotional dysregulation and callous-unemotional traits). Finally, for physical aggression in both boys and girls, and for relational aggression in girls, there was a clear pattern of aggressive behavior that emerged from cluster analyses across samples. Two aggression clusters emerged, with one group showing moderately high reactive aggression and a second group showing both high reactive and high proactive aggression (combined group). On measures of severity (e.g., self-reported delinquency and arrests) and etiologically important variables (e.g., emotional regulation and callous-unemotional traits), the reactive aggression group was more severe than a nonaggressive cluster but less severe than the combined aggressive cluster.

AB Although there is considerable evidence that relational victimization is associated with depressive symptoms in youth, our understanding about the mechanisms by which victimization and depressive symptoms are linked is limited. The current study explored ruminating about victimization experiences as a potential mechanism that might contribute to an understanding of the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms. We also tested the specificity of the proposed models by controlling for and testing parallel models of a highly related behavior: relational aggression. A sample of 499 adolescents from sixth through eighth grades participated. Teacher reports were used to assess relational victimization and relational aggression. Self-reports were used to assess depressive symptoms and rumination. The results showed that rumination partially mediated the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms. No moderation effect was found. In contrast, rumination moderated the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms. Specifically, relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms for those adolescents who were also ruminators. Thus, ruminating about victimization experiences appears to be an important mechanism that functions differently for relational aggression and relational victimization in conferring risk for depressive symptoms. The findings offer important practical implications for those working with adolescents and also lay the groundwork for future research.

AB The association between mothers' psychological control and their children's emotional adjustment problems is well documented. However, processes that may explain this association are not well understood. The present study tested the idea that relational aggression and psychological control within the context of the sibling relationship may help to account for the relation between mothers' psychological control and adolescents' internalizing symptoms. Older (M = 16.46, SD = 1.35 years) and younger (M = 13.67, SD = 1.56 years) siblings from 101 dyads rated the psychological control they received from mothers and siblings, and the relational aggression they received from siblings. Despite some similarities between psychological control and relational aggression, confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence that the two sibling processes are distinct. Maternal psychological control was related to psychological control and relational aggression within the sibling relationship, which were related to adolescents' anxiety and depressed mood. In addition, sibling relational aggression was a more powerful mediator of the relationship between maternal psychological control and adolescent adjustment than sibling psychological control.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common behavior among females that has been shown to confer risk for continued self-injury and suicidal attempts. NSSI can be viewed conceptually as behavior that is pathognomonic with aggression and/or depression. Empirical research on concurrent correlates supports this concept: numerous and diverse factors are shown to be significantly associated with self-harm, including depression, emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, and aggression and other conduct problems, as well as environmental stressors such as bullying, harsh parenting, and negative life events. In the present study, we test hypotheses regarding developmental precursors (measured from ages 8 to 12 years) to NSSI in young adolescent girls (ages 13-14 years), specifically whether aggression, depression, and environmental stressors distinguish girls with and without self-harm, and whether there is evidence for multiple developmental pathways to NSSI. Data were derived from the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study. In this community sample of girls, the prevalence of NSSI at ages 13 or 14 years of age was 6.0%. Initial levels in dimensions measured within the depression, aggression, and environmental stressor domains accounted for variance in NSSI in early adolescence. Changes over time in relational aggression and assertiveness were also significantly associated with risk for NSSI. To a large extent, adolescent NSSI was predicted by psychological deficits and stress exposure that began early in childhood. Risk indices were calculated using the 85th or 15th percentile. Close to 80% of girls who engaged in NSSI during adolescence were identified by at least one risk domain in childhood. A sizable proportion of adolescent girls who later engaged in NSSI had childhood risk scores in all three domains; the remaining girls with adolescent NSSI were relatively evenly distributed across the other risk domain profiles. The observation that multiple pathways to NSSI exist suggests that deficits underlying the behavior may vary and require different modes of prevention.

AB Borderline personality (BPD) and complex posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) are both powerfully associated with the experience of interpersonal violence during childhood and adolescence. The disorders frequently co-occur and often result in pervasive problems in, e.g., emotion regulation and altered pain perception, where the endocannabinoid system is deeply involved. We hypothesize an endocannabinoid role in both disorders. We investigated serum levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol and related fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs) in BPD, PTSD, and controls. Significant alterations were found for both endocannabinoids in BPD and for the FAE oleoylethanolamide in PTSD suggesting a respective link to both disorders.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Objective: Despite the significant prevalence of adolescent depression, little is known about the neuroanatomical basis of this disorder. Functional dysregulation in frontolimbic circuitry has been suggested as a key neural correlate of adult and adolescent depression impeding emotional regulation. However, less is known about whether this dysregulation is overlaid on impaired white matter microstructure. Guided by neuroimaging findings, we test the a priori, hypotheses that adolescent depression is associated with alterations in white matter microstructure in the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and cingulum bundles. Method: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data were obtained on 52 unmedicated adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 42 matched controls. We calculated fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for bilateral UF and cingulum. We also completed a voxelwise comparison of participants with depression and control participants using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: Adolescents with depression had significantly lower FA and higher RD in bilateral UF; no significant differences were observed in cingulum. TBSS results additionally revealed lower FA values in the white matter associated with the limbic cortical striatal thalamic circuit, corpus callosum, and anterior and superior corona radiata. Conclusion: Unmedicated adolescent depression is associated with reduced fractional anisotropy in emotion regulatory networks, which may underlie the functional differences in frontolimbic circuitry characterizing depressive disorder. Given the relatively recent onset of depression in our sample, our findings in the context of the current literature provide preliminary evidence that reduced fractional anisotropy in the UF could be a predisposing risk factor for depression.

AB Considerable evidence suggests that genetic factors combine with environmental influences to impact on the development of aggressive behavior. A genetic variant that has repeatedly been reported to render individuals more sensitive to the presence of adverse experiences, including stress exposure during fetal life, is the seven-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene.
   The present investigation concentrated on the interplay of prenatal maternal stress and DRD4 genotype in predicting self-reported aggression in young adults. As disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system has been discussed as a pathophysiological pathway to aggression, cortisol stress reactivity was additionally examined.
   As part of an epidemiological cohort study, prenatal maternal stress was assessed by maternal interview 3 months after childbirth. Between the ages of 19 and 23 years, 298 offspring (140 males, 158 females) completed the Young Adult Self-Report to measure aggressive behavior and were genotyped for the DRD4 gene. At 19 years, 219 participants additionally underwent the Trier Social Stress Test to determine cortisol reactivity.
   Extending earlier findings with respect to childhood antisocial behavior, the results revealed that, under conditions of higher prenatal maternal stress, carriers of the DRD4 seven-repeat allele displayed more aggression in adulthood (p = 0.032). Moreover, the same conditions which seemed to promote aggression were found to predict attenuated cortisol secretion (p = 0.028).
   This is the first study to indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress exposure on the cortisol stress response depending on DRD4 genotype.

AB Factor structure, internal consistency, and construct validity of the Dutch version of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) were studied in two samples of school children and adolescents (n=275, 10-12 years and n=560, 13-16 years) from The Netherlands, using principle factor analysis. In both samples, a single component showed a good fit. However, evidence was also found for a solution with two components in both samples. That is, for children as well as adolescents, a main component referring to "present-moment non-judgmental awareness" arose, but for children a second component of "suppressing or avoiding thoughts and feelings" arose whereas for adolescents "distractibility or difficulty paying attention" became apparent as a second component. The ten-item CAMM showed satisfactory internal consistency (alpha=0.71 for children, and alpha=0.80 for adolescents). As hypothesized, we found significant, moderate to strong positive correlations for the child and adolescent samples between the CAMM and measures of happiness, healthy self-regulation, and quality of life. We further found significant, moderate to strong negative correlations with stress, rumination, self-blame, and catastrophizing. Only the expected positive correlation with acceptance was not found. There was no difference between children with or without meditation experience on the CAMM; however, adolescents with meditation experience showed a significantly lower score on the CAMM than those without this experience. Overall, good psychometric properties were demonstrated and were comparable with the original CAMM. Mindful awareness and being non-judgmental appears a measurable concept in children and adolescents and can be considered an important protective construct in the mental health of not only adults, but also of children and adolescents.

AB This study tested the associations of both resting vagal tone and vagal response to stress with anxiety control beliefs, anxiety, and aggression among 80 youths (aged 11-17 years). Measures included physiological assessments of emotion regulation along with youth self-report of anxiety control beliefs, anxiety, and aggression and caregiver reports of their child's anxiety and aggression. Resting vagal tone was positively related to anxiety control beliefs, but negatively associated with anxiety. Conversely, higher levels of anxiety and aggression were associated with increased vagal tone during a cognitive stress task. Findings suggest associations between physiological and self-report of emotion regulation (anxiety control beliefs) and that anxiety and aggression may have specific and nonspecific relations with physiological indices of emotion regulation.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) occurs in approximately 10 % of adolescents. To establish effective prevention and intervention initiatives, it is important to understand onset, maintenance and cessation of NSSI. We explored whether the relationships between interpersonal factors (i.e. attachment, social support) and NSSI were mediated by intrapersonal factors (i.e. emotion regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy). Participants were 1973 students (1414 female and 559 male) aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 13.89, SD = 0.97) recruited from 40 Australian high schools. Participants completed a questionnaire at two time-points with a 12-month interval. At baseline, 8.3 % of adolescents engaged in NSSI, increasing to 11.9 % at follow-up. Family support was most salient in onset, maintenance and cessation of NSSI. Attachment anxiety was related to NSSI onset. Of the intrapersonal variables, self-esteem and self-efficacy were significant in predicting onset of NSSI. Self-esteem, self-efficacy and cognitive reappraisal mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and NSSI onset. A combination of interpersonal and intrapersonal variables contributes to the onset, maintenance and cessation of NSSI in adolescence. Perceived family support appears to be an important safeguard against NSSI. Strategies targeting family functioning and teaching cognitive reappraisal techniques to adolescents may reduce the number engaging in NSSI.

AB We evaluate caregiver and adolescent concordance on adolescent mental health severity in war-affected Northern Uganda. Data were collected from 628 caregiver-adolescent dyads in two internally displaced persons' camps. Internalizing and externalizing-type mental health problems were assessed using locally-developed scales. To evaluate concordance, mean caregiver and adolescent scores on each scale were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficients and within-pair-differences were compared by subtracting caregiver from adolescent responses and using t tests to assess whether these differed from 0. Mental heath problem type and youth/caregiver gender and age were investigated as potential indicators of group differences. Adolescents consistently rated their problems as more severe for internalizing problems and less severe for externalizing problems compared with caregivers. Mothers' reports exhibited better concordance for internalizing problems while fathers' and other caregivers' exhibited better concordance of externalizing problems. Results suggest researchers and program implementers need to be aware of respondent differences when planning studies and services.

AB The youth self-report (YSR), which is theoretically based in the field of developmental psychopathology and follows a dimensional approach, is an important instrument to assess the behavioral and emotional problems and the psychosocial competencies of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 years in both clinical and research contexts. Our main aims were to propose a short form of the YSR, conduct a first validation study, and compare the short-form YSR with the full version of the Portuguese YSR. We conducted the first study (Study 1) in a sample of 1,266 Portuguese community adolescents between the ages of 11 and 21 years to analyze the factor structure of the YSR. We conducted the second study (Study 2) in a sample of 302 community adolescents between the ages of 11 and 21 years to validate the factor structure of the short form of the YSR, which consisted of 33 items that focused on the dimensions of internalization-depression, internalization-anxiety, externalization-destructiveness and externalization-exhibitionism. Our findings confirmed that the YSR-SF provides a good fit to the data, explains similarly the variance on several criteria compared with the longer version, and is sensitive to sex and age differences.

   EXPRESSIONS
AB Objective: In this critical review, the authors appraise neuroimaging findings in bipolar disorder in emotion-processing, emotion-regulation, and reward-processing neural circuitry in order to synthesize the current knowledge of the neural underpinnings of bipolar disorder and provide a neuroimaging research road map for future studies.
   Method: The authors examined findings from all major studies in bipolar disorder that used functional MRI, volumetric analysis, diffusion imaging, and resting-state techniques, integrating findings to provide a better understanding of larger-scale neural circuitry abnormalities in bipolar disorder.
   Results: Bipolar disorder can be conceptualized, in neural circuitry terms, as parallel dysfunction in prefrontal cortical (especially ventrolateral prefrontal cortical)hippocampal-amygdala emotion-processing and emotion-regulation circuits bilaterally, together with an "overactive" left-sided ventral. striatal-ventrolateral and orbitofrontal cortical reward-processing circuitry, resulting in characteristic behavioral abnormalities associated with bipolar disorder: emotional lability, emotional dysregulation, and heightened reward sensitivity. A potential structural basis for these functional abnormalities is gray matter volume decreases in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, the amygdala, and the hippocampus and fractional anisotropy decreases in white matter tracts connecting prefrontal and subcortical regions.
   Conclusions: Neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder clearly demonstrate abnormalities in neural circuits supporting emotion processing, emotion regulation, and reward processing, although there are several limitations to these studies. Future neuroimaging research in bipolar disorder should include studies adopting dimensional approaches; larger studies examining neurodevelopmental trajectories in youths with bipolar disorder or at risk for bipolar disorder; multimodal neuroimaging studies using integrated systems approaches; and studies using pattern recognition approaches to provide clinically useful individual-level data. Such studies will help identify clinically relevant biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment decision making for individuals with bipolar disorder.

AB Over the past decades, ample empirical evidence has been collected about the factors linked to internalizing problems during adolescence. However, there is a lack of research that use holistic approaches to study the joint analysis of a series of contextual and personal variables considered to be related to internalizing problems.
   This cross sectional study analyzes the relationship between internalizing problems during adolescence and a constellation of contextual (parenting and peer relationships) and personal variables, some of which are linked to the control and regulation of emotions.
   The sample consisted of 2,400 adolescents (1,068 boys and 1,332 girls) between 12 and 17 years of ages, who were selected in twenty secondary schools located in western Andalusia (Spain). They completed questionnaires in their classrooms.
   The results showed significant differences depending on the gender of the participant with girls scoring higher than boys in internalizing problems. This gender difference in the prevalence of problems increased with age. Also, significant relationships were discovered among most of the personal and contextual variables analyzed and internalizing problems, both in boys and girls. Our data showed an interesting moderating effect, because empathy was positively associated with internalizing problems, but only for girls with low scores on emotional clarity.
   The results of this study provide an interesting contribution to the knowledge of contextual and personal factors regarding internalizing problems during adolescence. Among contextual protective factors, the importance of parental affection and attachment to the peer group must be emphasized, while parental psychological control had negative effects. The results also underscore the importance of certain personal variables, such as risk or protection factors, as well as the moderation relationships established between some of them, including the moderating effect of emotional clarity on the relationship between empathy and internalizing problems, although only in the case of girls.

AB Psychological understanding of psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) occurring in childhood is limited, with no recognised conceptual framework to guide appropriate intervention. We examined the contribution to PLE severity of emotional, cognitive and socio-environmental mechanisms thought to influence the development and maintenance of psychosis. Forty 8-14 year olds referred to a community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service completed a battery of questionnaires and assessments measuring severity of PLEs, emotional problems, cognitive biases, and negative life events. 85 % of children assessed reported having experienced a PLE over the previous year; and 55 % reported more than one. 60 % had experienced at least one in the previous fortnight. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that each of the variables made a significant and independent contribution to PLE severity, after adjusting for verbal ability and age, accounting together for more than half of the variance (reasoning B = 6.324, p = .049; emotion B = 1.807, p = .005; life events B = 4.039, p = .001). PLEs were common in this clinical sample of children. Psychological factors implicated in the development and maintenance of psychosis in adults were also associated with PLE severity in these children. PLE severity may be reduced by targeting each of these factors in cognitive therapy, at this very early stage. Any improvements in emotional wellbeing and functioning may then increase future resilience.

AB Objective: Irrespective of their cardiovascular findings, quality of life in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is good or even superior to that in healthy controls. The sense of coherence (SOC), a psychological resource that focuses on factors that support human health and well-being, was suggested to act as a potential pathway for maintaining and improving quality of life independently from the disease status.
   Patients and methods: From April 2010 to May 2011, we consecutively included 546 young adults (236 female, median age 26.9 years, aged from 16 to 71 years) with various CHD into the study. Patients completed the SOC-13 questionnaire and the health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36. Afterwards they performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test.
   Results: In adults with CHD, SOC was slightly enhanced compared with reference values (CHD: median 74.0 [IQR: 63.8; 81.0] vs. reference value: 69.7 [68.5; 69.7]; p < 0.001) corresponding to 106.1% [91.8; 116.7%] of predicted reference value. SOC was not associated with the underlying heart defect (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.565) or heart defect severity (Spearman r = 0.044; p = 0.301). It was moderately related to all dimensions of quality of life (r = 0.260 to r = 0.686; p < 0.001) except to health transition. It was only poorly associated with exercise capacity (r = 0.098; p = 0.023) and age (r = -0.097; p = 0.023).
   Conclusions: Adults with CHD have an enhanced SOC. SOC is moderately correlated with quality of life, and seems to be a stronger predictor of health-related life quality than exercise capacity. SOC might explain the rather good quality of life in patients with CHD despite their reduction in exercise capacity.

AB Children 9 to 13 years old exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) reported on their violence exposure, attachment to both parents, temperament (negative emotionality and emotion regulation), perceived quality of life, and health complaints. Half of the children perceived their quality of life as good and did not have recurrent health complaints. When controlling for socioeconomic status, health complaints were associated with higher IPV exposure and negative emotionality, whereas quality of life was associated with attachment security, higher capacity for emotion regulation, and lower negative emotionality. These results underscore the importance of increasing and supporting the capacity of children exposed to IPV to handle and express their emotions, as well as making school nurses and other primary care practitioners more attentive to IPV as a possible background factor in children's health complaints.

AB Background: Emotion dysregulation is a unifying dimension of several psychopathological symptoms such as prolonged dysphoria, labile mood, high anger, persistent fear and excessive worry. Deficits in emotion regulation (ER), or emotion dysregulation, appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and promising treatment target in a broad range of mental disorders. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is the most comprehensive measure of emotion dysregulation to date, but the Spanish version has not been validated in adolescents. Method: A community sample of 642 Spanish adolescents aged 12-18 responded to the DERS. Results: Factor analysis suggested a six-factor solution, and strict measurement invariance across sex was achieved. Internal consistency for the subscales was moderate to satisfactory (.71-.88), except for Awareness (alpha =.62). We found some sex differences on subscale scores, with small effect sizes. Conclusions: The results obtained for the Spanish version of the DERS are promising for investigating emotion dysregulation in Spanish adolescents.

AB Although depression and self-harm are common mental health problems in adolescents, there are barriers to accessing help. Using a community-based sample, this study investigates predictors of service contacts for adolescents at high risk of depression and self-harm.
   Three thousand seven hundred and forty-nine (3,749) 12- to 16-year-olds in UK secondary (high) schools provided baseline and 6 months' follow-up data on mood, self-harm and service contacts with a range of primary and secondary healthcare services.
   Although most adolescents at high risk of depression or self-harm had seen their general practitioner (GP) in the previous 6 months, less than one-third had used primary or secondary healthcare services for emotional problems. 5 % of adolescents who reported self-harm had seen specialist child and adolescent mental health services in the previous 6 months. In longitudinal analyses, after adjustment for confounders, both depression and self-harm predicted the use of any healthcare services [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.34 (95 % CI 1.09, 1.64); AOR = 1.38 (95 % CI 1.02, 1.86), respectively] and of specialist mental health services [AOR = 5.48 (95 % CI 2.27, 13.25); AOR = 2.58 (95 % CI 1.11, 6.00), respectively]. Amongst those with probable depression, 79 % had seen their GP and 5 % specialist mental health services in the preceding year.
   Most adolescents at high risk of depression or self-harm see their GP over a 6-month period although only a minority of them access specialist mental health services. Their consultations within primary care settings provide a potential opportunity for their identification and for signposting to appropriate specialist services.

AB An essential component of youths' successful development is learning to appropriately respond to emotions, including the ability to recognize, identify, and describe one's feelings. Such emotional competence is thought to arise through the parent child relationship. Yet, the mechanisms by which parents transmit emotional competence to their children are difficult to measure because they are often implicit, idiosyncratic, and not easily articulated by parents or children. In the current study, we used a multifaceted approach that went beyond self-report measures and examined whether parental neural sensitivity to emotions predicted their child's emotional competence. Twenty-two adolescent parent dyads completed an fMRI scan during which they labeled the emotional expressions of negatively valenced faces. Results indicate that parents who recruited the amygdala, VLPFC, and brain regions involved in mentalizing (i.e., inferring others' emotional states) had adolescent children with greater emotional competence. These results held after controlling for parents' self-reports of emotional expressivity and adolescents' self-reports of the warmth and support of their parent relationships. In addition, adolescents recruited neural regions involved in mentalizing during affect labeling, which significantly mediated the associated between parental neural sensitivity and adolescents' emotional competence, suggesting that youth are modeling or referencing their parents' emotional profiles, thereby contributing to better emotional competence.

TI The development of human amygdala functional connectivity at rest from 4

AB Functional connections (FC) between the amygdala and cortical and subcortical regions underlie a range of affective and cognitive processes. Despite the central role amygdala networks have in these functions, the normative developmental emergence of FC between the amygdala and the rest of the brain is still largely undefined. This study employed amygdala subregion maps and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the typical development of human amygdala FC from age 4 to 23 years old (n = 58). Amygdala FC with subcortical and limbic regions was largely stable across this developmental period. However, three cortical regions exhibited age-dependent changes in FC: amygdala FC with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increased with age, amygdala FC with a region including the insula and superior temporal sulcus decreased with age, and amygdala FC with a region encompassing the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate also decreased with age. The transition from childhood to adolescence (around age 10 years) marked an important change-point in the nature of amygdala-cortical FC. We distinguished unique developmental patterns of coupling for three amygdala subregions and found particularly robust convergence of FC for all subregions with the mPFC. These findings suggest that there are extensive changes in amygdala-cortical functional connectivity that emerge between childhood and adolescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Parent-teacher cross-informant agreement, although usually modest, may provide important clinical information. Using data for 27,962 children from 21 societies, we asked the following: (a) Do parents report more problems than teachers, and does this vary by society, age, gender, or type of problem? (b) Does parent-teacher agreement vary across different problem scales or across societies? (c) How well do parents and teachers in different societies agree on problem item ratings? (d) How much do parent-teacher dyads in different societies vary in within-dyad agreement on problem items? (e) How well do parents and teachers in 21 societies agree on whether the child's problem level exceeds a deviance threshold? We used five methods to test agreement for Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF) ratings. CBCL scores were higher than TRF scores on most scales, but the informant differences varied in magnitude across the societies studied. Cross-informant correlations for problem scale scores varied moderately across societies studied and were significantly higher for Externalizing than Internalizing problems. Parents and teachers tended to rate the same items as low, medium, or high, but within-dyad item agreement varied widely in every society studied. In all societies studied, both parental noncorroboration of teacher-reported deviance and teacher noncorroboration of parent-reported deviance were common. Our findings underscore the importance of obtaining information from parents and teachers when evaluating and treating children, highlight the need to use multiple methods of quantifying cross-informant agreement, and provide comprehensive baselines for patterns of parent-teacher agreement across 21 societies.

AB Affective Theory of Mind (ToM), an important aspect of ToM, involves the understanding of affective mental states. This ability is critical in the developmental phase of adolescence, which is often related with socio-emotional problems. Using a developmentally sensitive behavioral task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated the neural development of affective ToM throughout adolescence. Eighteen adolescent (ages 12-14 years) and 18 young adult women (aged 19-25 years) were scanned while evaluating complex affective mental states depicted by actors in video clips. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed significantly stronger activation in adolescents in comparison to adults in the affective ToM condition. Current results indicate that the vmPFC might be involved in the development of affective ToM processing in adolescence.

AB The objectives of the present study were to analyze the relationship between victimization and psychological maladjustment in adolescents and the role of self-compassion as a mediator in this relationship. The sample was composed of 109 adolescents aged from 15 to 18 years old with poor school performance. The participants filled out a battery of questionnaires made up of: a socio-demographic data questionnaire; the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ); the Youth Self-Report (YSR); and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Results indicated that victimization was positively associated with psychological maladjustment. Moreover, adolescents reporting poly-victimization showed significantly higher level of psychological maladjustment and different types of victimization show different effects on adolescents' psychological maladjustment. Self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between victimization and psychological maladjustment and reduced negative consequences in adolescents who reported having been victimized. Adolescence is a time of development and search for identity in which strengthening personal protective factors could help overcome any traumas experienced. Therefore, developing self-compassion in adolescence could be a good way to help young people recover from bad experiences and protect themselves against future negative experiences. As self-compassion can be improved with practice it could be included in adolescent intervention and prevention programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated whether children's performance on working memory (WM) and delayed retrieval (DR) tasks decreased after stress exposure, and how physiological stress responses related to performance under stress. About 158 children (83 girls; M-age = 10.61 years, SD = 0.52) performed two WM tasks (WM forward and WM backward) and a DR memory task first during a control condition, and 1 week later during a stress challenge. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol were assessed during the challenge. Only WM backward performance declined over conditions. Correlations between physiological stress responses and performance within the stress challenge were present only for WM forward and DR. For WM forward, higher cortisol responses were related to better performance. For DR, there was an inverted U-shape relation between cortisol responses and performance, as well as a cortisol x sAA interaction, with concurrent high or low responses related to optimal performance. This emphasizes the importance of including curvilinear and interaction effects when relating physiology to memory.

AB Background: There have been mixed findings on the temporal relation between anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders (AUDs), suggesting that the pathway to AUDs may differ among individuals. The aim of the current study was to test whether parental support moderated the association between anxiety disorders and the development of AUDs. We also tested whether our effects differed as a function of age of AUD onset.
   Methods: 817 individuals were assessed for lifetime diagnoses of psychopathology during 4-waves between adolescence (mean age = 16) and adulthood (mean age = 30).
   Results: Proportional hazards model analyses indicated that baseline anxiety disorders interacted with baseline perceived maternal support to prospectively predict onset of AUDs. At high levels of maternal support, anxiety disorders were associated with a reduced risk for AUD onset (HR = 0.74, 95%. CI = 0.55-1.00). However, this effect was more robust for AUDs that developed prior to age 20. At low levels of maternal support, anxiety disorders were associated with an increased risk for AUD onset (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.21-2.26). This effect was present for AUDs that developed across adolescence and adulthood. Paternal support was not associated with AUDs and did not interact with anxiety disorders.
   Conclusions: Prevention and intervention efforts targeted at maternal support in adolescents with anxiety disorders may be valuable, as this may represent a factor that has a significant impact on the developmental course of AUDs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Despite international guidelines being available, not all gender clinics are able to face gender dysphoric (GD) youth population needs specifically. This is particularly true in Italy. Centers offering specialized support are relatively few and a commonly accepted Italian approach to GD youth has still not been defined. The aim of the present Position Statement is to develop and adhere to Italian guidelines for treatment of GD adolescents, in line with the "Dutch Approach", the Endocrine Society (ES), and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines.
   Methods An in-depth brainstorming on the application of International guidelines in the Italian context was performed by several dedicated professionals.
   Results A staged approach, combining psychological support as well as medical intervention is suggested. In the first phase, individuals requesting medical help will undergo a psycho-diagnostic procedure to assess GD; for eligible adolescents, pubertal suppression should be made available (extended diagnostic phase). Finally, from the age of 16 years, cross-sex hormonal therapy can be added, and from the age of 18 years, surgical sex reassignment can eventually be performed.
   Conclusions The current inadequacy of Italian services offering specialized support for GD youth may lead to negative consequences. Omitting or delaying treatment is not a neutral option. In fact, some GD adolescents may develop psychiatric problems, suicidality, and social marginalization. With access to specialized GD services, emotional problems, as well as self-harming behavior, may decrease and general functioning may significantly improve. In particular, puberty suppression seems to be beneficial for GD adolescents by relieving their acute suffering and distress and thus improving their quality of life.

AB Purpose/Objectives: To explore the symptom experience, coping strategies, and children's descriptions of their quality of life (QOL) after treatment for a brain tumor.
   Research Approach: An interpretive descriptive qualitative study.
   Setting: A pediatric hospital setting in Ontario, Canada.
   Participants: 12 children aged 9-18 years.
   Methods: Content analysis of semistructured interviews was guided by interpretive description methodology
   Findings: Children described symptoms including feeling tired, pain, headaches, emotional problems, difficulty thinking and remembering, problems with sleep, physical problems, and weight changes. Symptoms interfered with physical activity, keeping up with school, maintaining appearances, and communication. Coping strategies included reconditioning, taking breaks, taking medication, challenging themselves, volunteering, maintaining friendships, laughing, and using aids.
   Conclusions: Survivors experienced multiple symptoms that had an effect on their life, but overall, they described good QOL.
   Interpretation: Caregivers need to understand the complexity of their patient's symptom experience and its impact on his or her daily life. Coping strategies can be identified to help mitigate potentially negative QOL outcomes.

AB Escape and avoidance behaviors play a prominent role in the maintenance and possibly development of panic disorder, yet the literature regarding the etiology of these emotion-regulation strategies is relatively underdeveloped. The current study experimentally tests hypotheses that parental modeling of escape during a well-established panic-relevant biological challenge increases panic-relevant escape and avoidance among offspring. Fifty physically and psychologically healthy early adolescents (28 females; M-age = 11.58; 86% Caucasian), stratified by gender, were randomly assigned to observe one of their parents (39 females; M-age = 40.04): either (a) model completing a 3-min voluntary hyperventilation exercise (no escape modeling group) or (b) model premature termination of a similar procedure (escape modeling group). Offspring in the escape modeling group demonstrated a stronger escape response by discontinuing their own challenge sooner than those in the no-escape modeling group (r = .70). No group differences emerged in terms of avoidance responding, as indexed by nearly identical responding in terms of delay time before initiating the challenge, respiration rate, and self-reported willingness to engage in a second proposed challenge. Results suggest that parental behaviors may play an important role in the development of some forms of panic-relevant responding. These preliminary findings may have important implications for future prevention programs targeting parents and at-risk youth.

AB This study investigated the relationship between the development of effortful control (EC), a temperamental measure of self-regulation, and concurrent development of three regions of the prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate cortex, ACC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC) between early- and mid-adolescence. It also examined whether development of EC mediated the relationship between cortical maturation and emotional and behavioral symptoms. Ninety-two adolescents underwent baseline assessments when they were approximately 12 years old and follow-up assessments approximately 4 years later. At each assessment, participants had MRI scans and completed the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised, as well as measures of depressive and anxious symptoms, and aggressive and risk taking behavior. Cortical thicknesses of the ACC, dlPFC and vlPFC, estimated using the FreeSurfer software, were found to decrease over time. EC also decreased over time in females. Greater thinning of the left ACC was associated with less reduction in EC. Furthermore, change in effortful control mediated the relationship between greater thinning of the left ACC and improvements in socioemotional functioning, including reductions in psychopathological symptoms. These findings highlight the dynamic association between EC and the maturation of the anterior cingulate cortex, and the importance of this relationship for socioemotional functioning during adolescence.

AB When used effectively, cognitive reappraisal of distressing events is a highly adaptive cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategy, with impairments in cognitive reappraisal associated with greater risk for psychopathology. Despite extensive literature examining the neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal in healthy and psychiatrically ill adults, there is a dearth of data to inform the neural bases of CER in children, a key gap in the literature necessary to map the developmental trajectory of cognitive reappraisal. In this fMRI study, psychiatrically healthy schoolchildren were instructed to use cognitive reappraisal to modulate their emotional reactions and responses of negative affect after viewing sad photos. Consistent with the adult literature, when actively engaged in reappraisal compared to passively viewing sad photos, children showed increased activation in the vIPFC, dIPFC, and dmPFC as well as in parietal and temporal lobe regions. When children used cognitive reappraisal to minimize their experience of negative affect after viewing sad stimuli they exhibited dampened amygdala responses. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of identifying and characterizing neural processes underlying adaptive CER strategies in typically developing children in order to understand how these systems go awry and relate to the risk and occurrence of affective disorders.

AB The current study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire (ERSSQ), a rating scale designed specifically to assess the social skills of young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The participants were 84 children and young adolescents with ASD, aged between 7.97 and 14.16 years with a mean IQ score of 90.21 (SD = 18.82). The results provide evidence for the concurrent and criterion validity of the ERSSQ Parent form, and the concurrent validity of the ERSSQ Teacher form. The clinical and theoretical implications are discussed, including the necessity of ratings across multiple contexts and the potential use of the ERSSQ in identifying individuals most in need of intervention and for planning and assessing the outcomes of social skills interventions.

AB Background By emphasizing the importance of emotions, the affect revolution' in how human behavior is conceptualized has inspired a new generation of studies on dysphoric experience and its regulation in clinical depression, and novel efforts to characterize the precursors of affective disorders in juveniles at familial risk for depression. Method We review clinical, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging studies of dysphoric experience and its regulation in depressed children and adolescents, and in juvenile offspring of parents with histories of clinical depression. We discuss the implication of the literature in the context of maternal depression. Results Findings confirm the high rate of clinically significant dysphoria in depressed children and adolescents and reveal notable affective lability in daily life as a function of context and activity. Findings also show that depressed youngsters have problems in attenuating dysphoria. Similarly, never-depressed offspring at familial risk for depression display problems in mood repair and impaired mood repair mechanisms. Brain neuroimaging findings indicate that, overall, depressed, and high-risk youngsters differ from never depressed controls in neural functioning (activation, connectivity) both at rest and in response to emotion triggers. Conclusion The evaluation of depressed youngsters should include questions about reactivity of dysphoric mood to the changing contexts of daily life and about how they manage (respond to) their own sadness and distress. The resultant information may help the clinician to restructure a young patient's day for the better and identify helpful mood repair responses. Evidence of impaired mood repair mechanisms in youngsters at high-risk for depression suggests the need for early intervention. But interventions must consider that many depressed and high-risk children have depressed mothers, who may be constrained in their ability to help offspring's emotion regulation efforts. To optimize treatment response of offspring, mothers of depressed children should therefore be routinely screened for depression and treated, as warranted.

AB As evidence-based practice is becoming integrated into children's mental health services as a means of improving outcomes for children and youth with severe behavioral and emotional problems, therapeutic foster care (TFC; a specialized treatment approach for such youth) is one of few community-based programs considered to be evidence-based. "Together Facing the Challenge" (TFTC) which was tested in a randomized trial of TFC has been identified as an evidence-based model. We describe the experiences reported by one of the agencies that participated in our study and how they have incorporated TFTC into their on-going practice. We highlight key implementation strategies, challenges faced, and lessons learned as the agency moved forward towards full implementation of TFTC.

AB This study reports on the preliminary development and validation of the Social and Emotional Health Survey (SEHS) with a sample of 4,189 (51 % female) California students in Grades 8, 10, and 12. The SEHS was designed to measure the psychological building blocks of adolescents' positive mental health and is operationalized in the present study by a theoretical model comprised of 12 measured indicators that form four first-order domains (belief-in-self, belief-in-others, emotional competence, and engaged living) that, in turn, contribute to one underlying, second-order meta-construct called covitality. This study was the first to investigate the validity and utility of the adolescent covitality construct, which is conceptualized as the synergistic effect of positive mental health resulting from the interplay among multiple positive-psychological building blocks. Findings from confirmatory factor analyses, invariance analysis, and latent means testing all supported the theoretical model underlying the SEHS, indicating that the second-order covitality model was the best fit for both males and females. Results from a path-modeling analysis indicated that covitality was a strong predictor of students' subjective well-being (operationalized as a composite of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect), and findings from additional concurrent validity analyses indicated that adolescents' covitality level was significantly associated with self-reported academic achievement, perceptions of school safety, substance use, and experiences of depressive symptoms. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.

AB Child and adolescent mental health problems burden not only the individual, but also their families and their social environment and may, therefore, be regarded as a highly relevant public health issue. The data on mental health problems of children and adolescents from the KiGGS Wave 1 study (sample period 2009-2012) make it possible to report on both current prevalence rates and time trends over the 6-year period beginning with the KiGGS baseline survey (2003-2006). The assessment of emotional and behavioral problems in KiGGS Wave 1 was carried out with the symptoms questionnaire of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a telephone interview with 10,353 guardians of children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. Moreover, using the SDQ impact supplement, the KIGGS Wave 1 data provide information on psychosocial impairment following child and adolescent mental health problems. Subjects with a borderline or abnormal SDQ score, according to German normative data, were considered at risk. A total of 20.2 % (95 % CI: 18.9-21.6 %) of the study subjects were identified as being at risk for a mental health disorder, compared with 20.0 % (19.1-20.9 %) during the KiGGS baseline study (age-standardized based on population from 12 December 2010). Thus, no significant changes over time in the prevalence of mental health problems were detected. Also, there were no statistically significant differences in prevalence by sex, age group, or socioeconomic status between the KiGGS baseline survey and KiGGS Wave 1. The statistical comparison of the subscale mean values for both girls and boys showed higher values with respect to the subscales for emotional problems, behavioral problems, and prosocial behavior and lower mean values for the peer problems subscale in KiGGS Wave 1. These partly small temporal trends, however, may be due to possible mode effects (written questionnaire in the KiGGS baseline study versus telephone interview in KiGGS Wave 1). The hyperactivity subscale remained stable across the two sample periods. Regarding impairments following mental health problems at the second sample period, boys were more affected in the areas of chronicity, family burden, and impact score. The high and stable prevalence rates and magnitude of emotional and behavioral problems should prompt increased preventive efforts.

AB This research examined respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSAR) as a moderator of the association between parent coping suggestions, or socialization of coping, and youths' responses to stress in emerging adulthood. Emerging adults (N = 156) reported their parents' coping suggestions and their own responses to interpersonal stress; RSAR was monitored as participants completed two laboratory challenges. Results revealed that emerging adults' sensitivity to parental encouragement to engage versus disengage from stress varied as a function of RSAR. Importantly, the RSAR profile (withdrawal vs. augmentation) associated with heightened sensitivity to coping suggestions varied as a function of the nature (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) of the laboratory challenge. In some cases, coping suggestions also predicted responses to stress independently of RSAR This study extends previous work with children and adolescents and provides novel evidence that parasympathetic stress reactivity moderates the effects of parenting in emerging adulthood.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between emotion dysregulation and the core features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which include social/communication deficits, restricted/repetitive behaviors, and sensory abnormalities. An 18-item Emotion Dysregulation Index was developed on the basis of expert ratings of the Child Behavior Checklist. Compared to typically developing controls, children and adolescents with ASD showed more emotion dysregulation and had significantly greater symptom severity on all scales. Within ASD participants, emotion dysregulation was related to all core features of the disorder, but the strongest association was with repetitive behaviors. These findings may facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies targeting emotion dysregulation in order to optimize long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD.

AB The present study was aimed at validating the Italian version of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Full Form (TEIQue-AFF), as well as at exploring its incremental validity over emotional maladjustment. To this end, a sample of 351 (163 males) Italian adolescents was collected. Overall, the Italian TEIQue-AFF both replicated the original-English four-factor structure (Well-Being, Self-Control, Emotionality, Sociability), and its construct validity was confirmed. However, reliability coefficients for eight facets and two factors were low. In addition, at all levels of analysis (i.e., global, factor, facet) the TEIQue-AFF was found to be a significant incremental predictor of adolescent's emotional maladjustment, over and above gender. IQ and the Big Five personality dimensions. At the factor level, significant effects were related to the contribution of the factor Well-Being thus supporting perspectives arguing for a further refinement of trait El content domain. Implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Victims of bullying are at risk for psychotic experiences in early adolescence. It is unclear if this elevated risk extends into late adolescence. The aim of this study was to test whether bullying perpetration and victimization in elementary school predict psychotic experiences in late adolescence.
   Method. The current study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective community-based study. A total of 4720 subjects with bullying perpetration and victimization were repeatedly assessed between the ages of 8 and 11 years by child and mother reports. Suspected or definite psychotic experiences were assessed with the Psychosis-Like Symptoms semi-structured interview at age 18 years.
   Results. Controlling for child's gender, intelligence quotient at age 8 years, childhood behavioural and emotional problems, and also depression symptoms and psychotic experiences in early adolescence, victims [child report at 10 years: odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-3.4; mother report: OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3], bully/victims (child report at 10 years: OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.8; mother: OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.0) and bullies (child report at 10 years: OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-17.7; mother: OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.46-3.1, N.S.) had a higher prevalence of psychotic experiences at age 18 years. Path analysis revealed that the association between peer victimization in childhood and psychotic experiences at age 18 years was only partially mediated by psychotic or depression symptoms in early adolescence.
   Conclusions. Involvement in bullying, whether as victim, bully/victim or bully, may increase the risk of developing psychotic experiences in adolescence. Health professionals should ask routinely during consultations with children about their bullying of and by peers.

AB Mindfulness programs for schools are popular. We systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the effects of school based mindfulness interventions on psychological outcomes, using a comprehensive search strategy designed to locate both published and unpublished studies. Systematic searches in 12 databases were performed in August 2012. Further studies were identified via hand search and contact with experts. Two reviewers independently extracted the data, also selecting information about intervention programs (elements, structure etc.), feasibility, and acceptance. Twenty-four studies were identified, of which 13 were published. Nineteen studies used a controlled design. In total, 1348 students were instructed in mindfulness, with 876 serving as controls, ranging from grade 1 to 12. Overall effect sizes were Hedge's g=0.40 between groups and g=0.41 within groups (p<0.0001). Between group effect sizes for domains were: cognitive performance g=0.80, stress g=0.39, resilience g=0.36, (allp<0.05), emotional problems g=0.19 third person ratings g=0.25 (bothn. s.). All in all, mindfulness-based interventions in children and youths hold promise, particularly in relation to improving cognitive performance and resilience to stress. However, the diversity of study samples, variety in implementation and exercises, and wide range of instruments used require a careful and differentiated examination of data. There is great heterogeneity, many studies are under powered, and measuring effects of Mindfulness in this setting is challenging. The field is nascent and recommendations will be provided as to how interventions and research of these interventions may proceed.

AB The existing literature on the role of emotion regulation circuits (amygdala-prefrontal cortex) in the adolescent brain yields mixed results, particularly on the role of these regions in the context of reward sensitivity and risk taking behavior sensitivity and risk-taking behavior. Here, we examined functional connectivity in the resting state in 18 risk-taking (RT) adolescents compared with 18 non-risk-taking (NRT) adolescents as defined by the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Separate seed-based correlations with bilateral amygdala and bilateral nucleus accumbens used as the seed were performed to determine functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed greater connectivity between the amygdala (seed region) and the right middle frontal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, left precuneus and right inferior parietal lobule in RT adolescents than in NRT adolescents. Likewise, there was greater connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (seed region) and the right middle frontal gyrus in RT adolescents compared with NRT adolescents. These findings suggest that risk-taking behavior in adolescents is associated with hyperconnectivity during the resting state in networks associated with emotion regulation, reward sensitivity, executive control, and the default mode.

AB Background: Pain is common in otherwise healthy adolescents. In recent years widespread musculoskeletal pain, in contrast to single site pain, and associating factors has been emphasized. Musculoskeletal pain has not been examined in Arctic indigenous adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of widespread musculoskeletal pain and its association with psychosocial factors, with emphasis on gender- and ethnic differences (Sami vs. non-Sami), and the influence of pain related functional impairment.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study based on The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study; a school-based survey responded by 4,881 10th grade students (RR: 83%) in North Norway, in 2003-2005. 10% were indigenous Sami. Musculoskeletal pain was based on reported pain in the head, shoulder/neck, back and/or arm/knee/leg, measured by the number of pain sites. Linear multiple regression was used for the multivariable analyses.
   Results: The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was high, and significantly higher in females. In total, 22.4% reported 3-4 pain sites. We found a strong association between musculoskeletal pain sites and psychosocial problems, with a higher explained variance in those reporting pain related functional impairment and in females. There were no major differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in Sami and non-Sami, however the associating factors differed somewhat between the indigenous and non-indigenous group. The final multivariable model, for the total sample, explained 21.2% of the variance of musculoskeletal pain. Anxiety/depression symptoms was the dominant factor associated with musculoskeletal pain followed by negative life events and school-related stress.
   Conclusions: Anxiety/depression, negative life events, and school-related stress were the most important factors associated with musculoskeletal pain, especially in those reporting pain related functional impairment. The most important sociocultural aspect is the finding that the indigenous Sami are not worse off.

AB Background: Adolescent'psychosocial problems associate with unhealthy behaviors, but data on co-occurring patterns is sparse. We investigated 1) whether adolescents could be categorized into meaningful subgroups with respect to psychosocial and lifestyle factors, 2) whether the prevalence of physical inactivity, overweight and smoking vary within the subgroups and 3) whether these unhealthy behaviors persist in a two-year follow-up.
   Methods: The study was based on a subgroup of the 1986 Northern Finland Birth Cohort, which consisted of adolescents who replied to a postal questionnaire at 16 years (n = 6792) and a subgroup of this sample at 18 years (n = 1552). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to establish clusters at 16 years.
   Results: Smoking co existed with emotional and behavioral problems in both genders. Boys with the most inactive lifestyle slept poorly, whereas multiple problems co-occurred among girls. Those with a high body mass index (BMI) separated as groups of their own. Different combinations of adverse lifestyle and emotional and behavioral problems were relatively common in both sexes as only 51% of boys and 67% of girls belonged to the reference cluster with low probability for these findings. Physical inactivity, high BMI and smoking tended to persist over the two-year follow-up.
   Conclusions: It seems that lifestyle and psychosocial factors divide adolescents into distinct subgroups in which unhealthy lifestyle patterns remain between the ages of 16 and 18. This may indicate problems in other life areas and expose them to an increased risk of future health problems.

AB This paper discusses the use of an alternative instrument to assess the social-emotional competence (SEC) of secondary school students in Singapore. The instrument was used in a larger study to explore an approach to infuse social-emotional learning in the curriculum for children in school. The design of this research instrument is based on the Rest's (Development in judging moral issues. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1979) Defining Issues Test (DIT) originally developed based on Kohlberg's moral dilemma (Kohlberg in child psychology and childhood education: a cognitive developmental view. Longman, New York, 1987). The modified DIT instrument which focuses specifically on social-emotional development presents scenarios that are most likely encountered by adolescents and seeks the students' responses to five open-ended questions related to the scenarios. The verbatim written responses were coded and categorized to assess their SECs. The instrument was able to elicit the self-management strategies of the secondary students, which was not as easily assessable with alternative instruments measuring SECs. The findings also highlighted the psychosocial developmental stage and moral development of the adolescents in the study from the SEC responses that they made.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the association between depressive symptoms and several psychosocial constructs (insight into autism symptoms, rumination, desire for social interaction, and satisfaction with social support) that may play a role in the development or maintenance of depression in verbally fluent adolescents and adults with ASD. Participants included 50 individuals with ASD and verbal IQ70, aged 16-35 (sample size varied by measure). Elevated depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II), were associated with greater self-perceived, autism-related impairments (n=48), greater rumination (n=21), and lower perceived social support (n=37). Rumination tended to moderate the association between self-perceived autism symptoms and BDI-II scores (n=21), and was significantly associated with ASD-related insistence on sameness behaviors (n=18). An unexpected relationship between depressive features and social participation and motivation will need to be clarified by longitudinal research. These and similar findings contribute to our understanding of the phenomenology of depression in ASD, which is critical to the development of practical prevention and treatment.

AB The theory of 'psychosomatogenic family types' is often used in treatment of somatizing adolescents. This study investigated the validity of distinguishing 'psychosomatogenic family types' based on parents' self-reported family features. The study included a Flemish general population sample of 12-year olds (n = 1428). We performed cluster analysis on 3 variables concerning parents' self-reported problems in family functioning. The distinguished clusters were examined for differences in marital problems, parental emotional problems, professional help for family members, demographics, and adolescents' somatization. Results showed the existence of 5 family types: 'chaotic family functioning,' 'average amount of family functioning problems,' 'few family functioning problems,' 'high amount of support and communication problems,' and ' high amount of sense of security problems' clusters. Membership of the 'chaotic family functioning' and 'average amount of family functioning problems' cluster was significantly associated with higher levels of somatization, compared with 'few family functioning problems' cluster membership. Among additional variables, only marital and parental emotional problems distinguished somatization relevant from non relevant clusters: parents in 'average amount of family functioning problems' and 'chaotic family functioning' clusters reported higher problems. The data showed that 'apparently perfect' or 'enmeshed' patterns of family functioning may not be assessed by means of parent report as adopted in this study. In addition, not only adolescents from 'extreme' types of family functioning may suffer from somatization. Further, professionals should be careful assuming that families in which parents report average to high amounts of family functioning problems also show different demographic characteristics.

AB Previous research has demonstrated that positive emotions help build psychological resources and facilitate adaptation to stress, yet few studies have considered the possible negative effects of positive emotions on stress. This study examined the relationship between high arousal, positive and negative affect, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among 503 Israeli adolescents following a period of escalated missile attacks on their city. Our findings revealed that not only negative affect, but also positive affect at very high levels exhibited 2 weeks following missile attacks were independently associated with PTSD symptoms 2 1/2 months later (eta(2) = .09, eta(2) = .02, respectively). Although the literature recognizes the risk factor of negative affect on the development of PTSD, we suggest that also positive affect at high levels immediately after such experiences may be a case of emotion context insensitivity and thus a maladaptive response to trauma. Further research should examine the mechanisms associated with positive emotions and PTSD.

AB THIS STUDY EXPLORES DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF music in everyday life among diagnostic groups of a psychiatric population (n = 180) in reference to a group of healthy subjects (n = 430). The results indicate that patients with mental disorders use music more for emotion modulation than healthy controls. In particular, patients with substance abuse and those with personality disorders used music mainly for cognitive problem solving and the reduction of negative activation, whereas patients with substance abuse in addition used music not often to stimulate themselves positively. Patients suffering from schizophrenia and personality disorders more often applied music for relaxation than the subjects of the reference group. Furthermore, the degree of severity of the psychiatric disorder correlated with the increased use of music for emotion modulation, i.e., for relaxation and cognitive problem solving. Thus, the results demonstrate an increased use of music for emotion modulation in patients with mental disorders in association with the severity of the disorder.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine intellectual, behavioral, and emotional functioning of children who have syndromic craniosynostosis and to explore differences between diagnostic subgroups.
   METHODS: A national sample of children who have syndromic craniosynostosis participated in this study. Intellectual, behavioral, and emotional outcomes were assessed by using standardized measures: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/6-18, Disruptive Behavior Disorder rating scale (DBD), and the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.
   RESULTS: We included 82 children (39 boys) aged 6 to 13 years who have syndromic craniosynostosis. Mean Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) was in the normal range (M = 96.6; SD = 21.6). However, children who have syndromic craniosynostosis had a 1.9 times higher risk for developing intellectual disability (FSIQ < 85) compared with the normative population (P <.001) and had more behavioral and emotional problems compared with the normative population, including higher scores on the CBCL/6-18, DBD Total Problems (P < .001), Internalizing (P < .01), social problems (P < .001), attention problems (P < .001), and the DBD Inattention (P < .001).
   Children who have Apert syndrome had lower FSIQs (M = 76.7; SD = 13.3) and children who have Muenke syndrome had more social problems (P < .01), attention problems (P < .05), and inattention problems (P < .01) than normative population and with other diagnostic subgroups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although children who have syndromic craniosynostosis have FSIQs similar to the normative population, they are at increased risk for developing intellectual disability, internalizing, social, and attention problems. Higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems were related to lower levels of intellectual functioning.

AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) in young people is a clinical and social problem related to early maltreatment but with little specificity in type of care or abuse determined. A community sample of 160 high-risk young people (aged 16-30) were the offspring of mothers' previously interviewed as vulnerable to major depression. The youth were interviewed to determine DSH (both suicidal and nonsuicidal), childhood maltreatment (using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse interview) and major depression (using SCID for DSM-IV) before age 17. Around one fifth reported DSH; equal proportions were suicidal and nonsuicidal with a fourth of these with both. DSH was highly related to family context (single mother upbringing and family discord) and poor parental care (including antipathy, neglect, inadequate supervision, and role reversal). Highest odds ratios were for role reversal (OR = 17) and neglect (OR = 11). DSH was unrelated to any type of abuse. Logistic regression showed that role reversal, inadequate supervision, and teenage depression all modeled DSH. There was some specificity, with single mother upbringing, role reversal, and inadequate supervision predicting nonsuicidal DSH, and neglect and role reversal alone predicting suicidal DSH. Role reversal remained a key predictor for both types of DSH when controls were applied. Poor childhood care, which has implications for problematic emotion regulation and empoverished social development, needs to be understood to improve interventions and treatment for DSH in young people.

ID ABORTION; QUESTIONNAIRE; DISORDERS; ILLNESS; ALCOHOL
AB Purpose: To compare social and emotional adjustment including educational attainment and substance use in women who had a child, pregnancy termination, or miscarriage by young adulthood.
   Methods: Data were from a population-based longitudinal study of the health and well-being of 1,943 young Australians (Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study) followed from 15 to 24 years of age. The sample was restricted to female participants and based on pregnancies reported by age 24 years. Analyses were adjusted for early teenage depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, and parent socioeconomic context.
   Results: A total of 208 pregnancies (in 170 women) were reported from a sample of 824 young women by 24 years of age. Compared with those who had never been pregnant, those who had a child had lower tertiary education completion and a higher risk of nicotine dependence; those who terminated a pregnancy were more commonly single and had a higher risk of smoking and alcohol use as well as nicotine and alcohol dependence; and those who had a miscarriage had a higher risk of depressive symptomatology and binge drinking as well as nicotine and cannabis dependence.
   Conclusions: Young women who have been pregnant by their mid-twenties report a range of difficulties in social and emotional adjustment that vary across the different pregnancy outcomes. Broad-based psychosocial health care is essential not only for young women whose pregnancies proceed to live birth, but also for those whose pregnancies end with miscarriage or induced abortion.

AB Memory processes are commonly thought to relate to a host of personality systems. The current study specifies a particular way that memory relates to personality. Highly-valenced, identity-rich memories - high and low point episodes in the life story - were analyzed to see if aspects of these memories predicted self-reports of emotion regulation two years later. Meaning making in high and low points predicted emotion regulation. Moreover, valence mattered. Positive meaning making in high and low point stories predicted positive emotion regulation while negative meaning making in low point stories predicted negative emotion regulation. These relationships held while controlling for baseline extraversion, neuroticism, and memory word count. Limitations due to study design are discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The processes of coping with stress and the regulation of emotion reflect basic aspects of development, and play an important role in models of risk for psychopathology and the development of preventive interventions and psychological treatments. However, research on these two constructs has been represented in two separate and disconnected bodies of work. We examine possible points of convergence and divergence between these constructs with regard to definitions and conceptualisation, research methods and measurement, and interventions to prevent and treat psychopathology. There is clear evidence that coping and emotion regulation are distinct but closely related constructs in all of these areas. The field will benefit from greater integration of methods and findings in future research.

AB The primary aim of this study was to describe how preschoolers (4-5 years old, N=94) cope with stress based on parent ratings on the Children's Coping Scale Revised. A second aim was to investigate how coping in preschoolers may be associated with the anxiety level of the child and controllability of the stressor, as measured by parent ratings on the Spence Preschool Anxiety Scale and children's coping in two different situations of varying controllability. Three distinct dimensions of coping were identifiedpositive coping, negative coping-emotional expression, and negative coping-emotional inhibition. As predicted, preschoolers rated higher on anxiety were more likely to engage in negative forms of coping while less anxious preschoolers were more likely to engage in a positive form of coping. This suggests an early pattern of maladaptive coping among more anxious children. Contrary to adult and adolescent models, preschoolers in general were more likely to use negative coping in a more controllable situation and to use positive coping in a less controllable situation. Possible explanations for these findings and suggestions for future research are proposed.

ID INTERPARENTAL CONFLICT; MARITAL CONFLICT; ACCEPTANCE-REJECTION; CHILD
   ADJUSTMENT; METAANALYSIS; APPRAISALS; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; VIOLENCE;
   STRESS
AB One prominent theory has proposed that rejection and other negative parenting practices prompt children's emotional sensitivity to the threat of rejection, often referred to as rejection sensitivity (RS). This emotional sensitivity is thought to result in social and emotional maladjustment. In the present study, we tested this model of parenting, emotional sensitivity, and maladjustment with 659 early adolescents (aged 9-13 years). The findings confirmed that adolescents who reported more negative parenting practices had elevated depression and social anxiety symptoms, heightened levels of RS, and more elevated sadness and withdrawal responses to rejection threat. In a final structural equation model, RS and withdrawal were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms, and RS, sadness, and withdrawal were uniquely associated with social anxiety. Moreover, negative parenting had significant associations with symptoms both directly and indirectly via RS, sadness, and/or withdrawal, with the effects mostly direct for depressive symptoms and mostly indirect for social anxiety symptoms. Interparental conflict was also implicated in adolescents' RS, reactions to rejection threat, and symptoms, but these correlational effects were almost entirely indirect via parenting practices. An alternate model of depression and anxiety predicting sensitivity to rejection threat was tested and found to be equally viable. The findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the links between rejection and adolescent emotional adjustment.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
DE appraisal; coping; preadolescents; temperament
ID EMOTION REGULATION; SELF-REGULATION; CHILDREN; DEPRESSION; STRESS
AB Temperament, appraisal, and coping are known to underlie emotion regulation, yet less is known about how these processes relate to each other across time. We examined temperamental fear, frustration, effortful control, and impulsivity, positive and threat appraisals, and active and avoidant coping as processes underpinning the emotion regulation of pre-adolescent children managing stressful events. Appraisal and coping styles were tested as mediators of the longitudinal effects of temperamental emotionality and self-regulation on adjustment using a community sample (N=316) of preadolescent children (8-12 years at T1) studied across 1 year. High threat appraisals were concurrently related to high fear and impulsivity, whereas effortful control predicted relative decreases in threat appraisal. High fear was concurrently related to high positive appraisal, and impulsivity predicted increases in positive appraisal. Fear was concurrently related to greater avoidant coping, and impulsivity predicted increases in avoidance. Frustration predicted decreases in active coping. These findings suggest temperament, or dispositional aspects of reactivity and regulation, relates to concurrent appraisal and coping processes, and additionally predicts change in these processes. Significant indirect effects indicated that appraisal and coping mediated the effects of temperament on adjustment. Threat appraisal mediated the effects of fear and effortful control on internalising and externalising problems, and avoidant coping mediated the effect of impulsivity on internalising problems. These mediated effects suggest that one pathway through which temperament influences adjustment is pre-adolescents' appraisal and coping. Findings highlight temperament, appraisal, and coping as emotion regulation processes relevant to children's adjustment in response to stress.

AB Previous studies in adults have revealed that attentional distraction modulates the late positive potential (LPP) during emotion regulation. To determine whether early visual components reflect developmental changes in attentional distraction during adolescence, we collected event-related potentials from 20 young adolescents, 18 older adolescents, and 18 young adults as they performed a distraction task (counting) while viewing affective images. Consistent with previous findings obtained in distraction studies, the distraction task (counting) reduced emotional modulation of the LPP. At an early-stage of processing, counting reduced emotional mbdulation of P1 and increased the negativity bias of early frontal negativity (eFN) for negatively valenced pictures compared to simple viewing with no distraction. sLO-RETA analyses further revealed eFN indexing of rostral prefrontal cortical activation, a cortical area that has been shown in recent fMRI studies to be activated by distraction. Moreover, P1 amplitudes in young and older adolescents did not differ but were both larger than the P1s in young adults. In addition, eFN amplitudes significantly decreased with age. The dissociable distraction patterns between the posterior P1 and eFN provide evidence not only for the timing hypothesis of emotion regulation but also for different developmental trajectories of visual processing areas and the prefrontal cortex during affective processing in adolescence.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate how music-related mood regulation relates to psychopathology - specifically depression, anxiety, and stress - in young people, through examining the nature of the relationships between individual music-related mood regulation strategies and psychopathology. The sample consisted of 146 (53 male and 93 female) university students aged between 17 and 24 years. Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing levels of psychopathology, music-related mood regulation behaviours, and personal music-related information. Results indicated that, as a whole, music-related mood regulation predicted levels of psychopathology. High use of the mood regulation strategy Discharge (venting of negative emotion through music) predicted high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress; Diversion (distraction from worries and stress) predicted high levels of anxiety and stress; and Entertainment (happy mood maintenance and enhancement) predicted low levels of depression. The results suggest that music-related mood regulation may perform a maladaptive function in certain individuals that promotes psychopathology; however, it is equally plausible that young people experiencing psychopathology are more likely to employ music in an attempt to reduce their symptoms. These are avenues for consideration in future research. The present study has practical implications for the use of music as a self-therapeutic resource and in the treatment of young people with psychopathology in music therapy settings.

AB Background Although DSM-IV attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, uncertainties exist about how much these associations are mediated temporally by secondary co-morbid disorders.
   Method The US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a national survey of adolescents aged 13-17 years (n=6483 adolescent-parent pairs), assessed DSM-IV disorders with the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Statistical decomposition was used to compare direct effects of ADHD with indirect effects of ADHD through temporally secondary mental disorders (anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior, substance disorders) in predicting poor educational performance (suspension, repeating a grade, below-average grades), suicidality (ideation, plans, attempts) and parent perceptions of adolescent functioning (physical and mental health, interference with role functioning and distress due to emotional problems).
   Results ADHD had significant gross associations with all outcomes. Direct effects of ADHD explained most (51.9-67.6%) of these associations with repeating a grade in school, perceived physical and mental health (only girls), interference with role functioning and distress, and significant components (34.5-44.6%) of the associations with school suspension and perceived mental health (only boys). Indirect effects of ADHD on educational outcomes were predominantly through disruptive behavior disorders (26.9-52.5%) whereas indirect effects on suicidality were predominantly through mood disorders (42.8-59.1%). Indirect effects on most other outcomes were through both mood (19.8-31.2%) and disruptive behavior (20.1-24.5%) disorders, with anxiety and substance disorders less consistently important. Most associations were comparable for girls and boys.
   Conclusions Interventions aimed at reducing the adverse effects of ADHD might profitably target prevention or treatment of temporally secondary co-morbid disorders.

AB Recent conceptualizations of child anxiety disorders have implicated emotion dysregulation in the development, maintenance, and/or exacerbation of these conditions. Assessment of emotion regulation in children often relies upon self-reports, but research suggests a multi-informant approach is optimal in the assessment of youth. The current study evaluates the preliminary psychometric properties of a parent-report adaptation of the Emotion Expression Scale for Children (EESC-P) in a sample of parents (n = 78) seeking treatment for their child's anxiety disorder (M (child age) = 11.04, SD = 2.96, 46.8 % female). Findings support the internal consistency and predictive validity of the EESC-P. Parent-child concordance was low-to-moderate within a subset of participants whose children completed the EESC. Scores on the EESC-P did not differ as a function of age or gender. Results preliminarily support the use of the EESC-P as part of a multi-informant assessment of emotional awareness in children with anxiety disorders.

AB Objectives. - Adolescence is a crucial period involving numerous acquisitions of social skills. These skills were experienced in peer relationships. In this context, assertivity is a fundamental ability allowing individuals to act in function of their own interests and defend their point of view without denying the rights of others. However, for some adolescents such acquisition is not easy. Thus, anxiety, social withdraw or emotion regulation difficulties impaired the socialization process. More specifically, psychiatric illness (such as mood disorder, anxiety or psychosis disorder) during this period interferes dramatically with such acquisition. However, training targeting social skills improvement, in a population presenting psychiatric disorders may help to enhance interpersonal functioning. In this perspective, the present study aimed (1) to assess the effect on assertivity of the training and (2) to specify the patient's type which reports the most benefit of such training.
   Materials and methods. - Thirty-eight adolescents (19 suffering from anxiety/mood disorders and 19 suffering from psychotic disorders) participated in a social skill training. Their assertivity was assessed with the Rathus assertivity scale which is a 30-item self-report questionnaire. The participant respond on a Likert scale composed of 6 points (from "totally true" to "totally false"). The Rathus assertivity scale allows to differentiate adolescents in: Inhibited, assertive, assertive-aggressive. The scale was administered before and after the social skills training.
   Results. - A general improvement on assertivity after the social skills training (partial eta square (eta 2) = 0.131: moderate effect size) was observed. More specifically, adolescents suffering from anxiety/mood disorder (partial eta square (eta 2) = 0.206, moderate effect size) and the "inhibited" adolescents (eta 2 = 0.311, strong effect size) showed the higher benefit from the social skills training.
   Conclusions. - The social skill training was reported by the adolescents to be an effective treatment allowing enhancing the assertivity of these population. Furthermore, the patients with anxiety/mood disorders reported the highest benefit compared to the patients with psychosis. This result raised the question about the usefulness of self-report questionnaire, as the patients with psychosis were observed, at a clinical level, to have better social abilities after the treatment, but did not report such effect on the self-assessment. In addition, the inhibited patients reported the highest benefits of such treatment. Three main factors could help us to interpret the results: (a) the composition of the groups, (b) the therapeutic approach, and (c) the team giving the social skill training. Firstly, the composition of the groups is heterogeneous like in the social reality of the youths. Thus, the heterogeneity of the psychopathologies composing the groups involved that the youths experienced a wide variety of social interactions with peers. Furthermore, some adolescents could experiment to be a model for others. However, related to our results, we could assume that adolescents with anxious/mood disorders benefit the most from the heterogeneity of the groups and the fact to be a model for others. Secondly, the therapeutic tools used seem also to be an important factor. Indeed, the training is based on cognitive and behavioral approach (using tools like psycho-education, cognitive restructuration, etc.) and social learning which are frequently used in this type of training. Thus, psycho-education allows acquiring new knowledge about their difficulties, for example. In particular, we could understand the most important increase in adolescents with anxiety/mood disorders by the fact that relaxation exercises could reduce their symptoms and so increase their assertivity. In contrast, for adolescent with psychosis disorders, this is not sufficient. Perhaps, their dysfunctional believes had to be reduced before they could benefit from the social skills training. Thirdly, the team giving the social skill training is also important. They all receive a complete training and have a lot of experience in working with such population. More generally, learning new social abilities in protected context, through experiencing positive social interaction may be beneficial for interpersonal function of the patients.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with poor emotional control and psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Emotion regulation (ER) is a potential contributing factor, but there has been limited research on ER and its role in comorbid psychopathology in ASD. In this study, we compared self-reported ER with self- and parent reports of psychopathology in 25 high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 23 age- and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-matched typically developing controls. Contrary to expectations, both groups reported similar levels of adaptive, voluntary forms of ER (problem solving, acceptance, etc.). However, the ASD group reported significantly greater use of involuntary forms of ER that are typically maladaptive, including remaining focused on the stressor (e.g. rumination and emotional arousal) and shutting down (e.g. emotional numbing and being unable to think or act). Associations between ER and psychopathology were generally more robust using self-report rather than parent report. For both groups, greater endorsement of involuntary ER strategies was associated with higher ratings of psychopathology, whereas voluntary ER strategies focused on changing or adapting to the situation were significantly associated with lower levels of psychopathology. The magnitude and direction of association between ER types and psychopathology were similar for measures of depression and anxiety. These findings can help guide the development of psychosocial treatments targeting dysfunctional ER in adolescents with ASD. Interventions focused on ER as a transdiagnostic process may be a more robust method to improve emotional control and decrease emotional distress in ASD than disorder-specific interventions.

AB Longitudinal studies have provided mixed findings regarding the relationship between emotional problems and subsequent poor school attainment. A meta-analysis of 26 community-based studies of children and adolescents was performed. Results revealed a prospective association between emotional problems and poor school attainment. More consistent associations were found for depression than anxiety. Moderator analyses indicated that some of the heterogeneity between studies may be due to age and gender, with reduced heterogeneity particularly notable for school grades during early adolescence and for anxiety by gender. Findings suggest that early identification and provision of support for young people with emotional problems may be helpful for improving academic outcomes such as school attainment.

AB The study of emotional intelligence (El) and its association with psychological maladjustment in adolescence is a new and active area of research. However, the diverse range of El measurements and aspects of psychological maladjustment examined make it difficult to synthesize the findings and apply them to practice. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the relationship between El and adolescents' emotional problems, eating disorder symptoms, addictions, and maladaptive coping. Using English and Spanish keywords, we identified 32 studies that found a negative association between El and internalizing problems, depression, and anxiety. El was also associated with less substance abuse and with better coping strategies. These associations differed slightly depending on whether El was evaluated based on self-reporting or by testing maximum performance. We highlight methodological limitations in the literature on El and adolescence, and we discuss potentially important areas for future research.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify sociodemographic, child, parent, and day care provider factors at age 4 that predict Norwegian children's service use for mental health problems at age 7.
   METHOD: Two birth cohorts of 4-year-old children and their parents living in the city of Trondheim, Norway, were invited (82% consented). We successfully interviewed 995 parents among 1250 drawn to participate using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment to set diagnoses and record parental burden and service use. Information concerning sociodemographics, child impairment, parental social support, and child need for mental health services according to parents, day care teacher, and health nurse were obtained.
   RESULTS: Rate of service use among those with a behavioral or emotional disorder was 10.7% at age 4 and 25.2% at age 7. Behavioral disorders (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, confidence interval [CI] 1.3-5.3), but not emotional disorders, predicted service use. When adjusted for incapacity (OR 1.3, CI 1.2-1.6), disorders were no longer predictive. Incapacity, in turn, was not predictive once parental burden (OR 1.1, CI 1.0-1.1) and parents' (OR 2.7, CI 1.0-7.9) and day care teachers' (OR 2.1, CI 1.4-3.2) judgment of child need of help were included. Lower socioeconomic status predicted more service use over and beyond these factors (OR 3.0, CI 1.5-6.1).
   CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral disorders may instigate service use if they result in impairment, and such impairment may operate via increased parental burden and parent and caregiver problem recognition. Service use may be increased through effective screening programs and efforts to increase day care teachers' recognition of emotional problems.

AB The identification of early markers has become a focus for early intervention in bipolar disorder. Using a retrospective, qualitative methodology, the present study compares the early experiences of participants with bipolar disorder to those with unipolar depression up until their first diagnosed episode. The study focuses on differences in early home and school environments as well as putative differences in personality characteristics between the two groups. Finally we a compare and contrast prodromal symptoms in these two populations. Thirty-nine participants, 20 diagnosed with unipolar depression and 19 diagnosed with bipolar disorder, took part in the study. A semi-structured interview was developed to elicit information about participants' experiences prior to their first episode. Participants with bipolar disorder reported disruptive home environments, driven personality features, greater emotion dysregulation and adverse experiences during the school years, whereas participants with depression tended to describe more supportive home environments, and more compliant and introvert personality traits. Retrospective data collection and no corroborative evidence from other family members. No distinction was made between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder nor between melancholic and non-melancholic depression in the sample. Finally the study spanned over a 12-month period which does not allow for the possibility of diagnostic reassignment of some of the bipolar participants to the unipolar condition. These findings indicate that there may be benefits in combining both proximal and distal indicators in identifying a bipolar disorder phenotype which, in turn, may be relevant to the development of early intervention programs for young people with bipolar disorder.

AB Research has clearly demonstrated that behavior problems are common among children with ASD. These co-occurring behavior problems place children with ASD and their families at risk for a range of negative outcomes. This questionnaire study aimed to investigate whether and how age, gender, and communication difficulties at the child level and parenting behaviors at the family level are associated with externalizing and internalizing problems among children with ASD (n = 206) and without ASD (n = 187) aged 6-12 years. Results indicated that pragmatic language difficulties of the child and negative controlling parenting behaviors both made a significant and unique contribution to externalizing behavior problems for the ASD group. In the control group, chronological age and pragmatic language difficulties were the most robust concurrent predictors of externalizing problems. With regard to internalizing problems, pragmatic language difficulties and ASD adapted parenting behaviors were significant predictors for both the ASD and control group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A plethora of research on the psychological consequences of community violence exposure among youth has conceptualized and measured community violence as a single, homogenous construct that indiscriminately gives rise to a wide range of outcomes. However, it is increasingly recognized that community violence exposure is comprised of many disparate characteristics. Thus, a more dimensional theoretical approach to the study of community violence exposure is proposed; such an approach will more precisely clarify how community violence exposure is differentially associated with specific outcomes. In particular, the dimensions of type, severity, physical proximity, relational proximity (familiarity with the persons involved), and chronicity of community violence exposure are suggested as potential moderating factors that may each, individually and in interaction, differentially impact youths' well-being. In order to account for greater contextual complexity in children's experiences of community violence, several recommendations for new methodological approaches and research directions are proposed and discussed. Such a theoretical shift is critical to advance our understanding of the processes underlying the links between community violence exposure and youth outcomes, as well as to inform more targeted and effective interventions for youth exposed to community violence.

AB Published prevalence estimates of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among nonclinical samples are highly heterogeneous, raising concerns about their reliability and hindering attempts to explore the alleged increase in NSSI over time. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of methodological factors on heterogeneity in NSSI prevalence estimates, explore changes over time, and estimate overall international NSSI prevalence. Results showed that methodological factors contributed over half (51.6%) of the heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, and, after adjusting for these factors, NSSI prevalence did not increase over time. Overall, pooled NSSI prevalence was 17.2% among adolescents, 13.4% among young adults, and 5.5% among adults. Clearly, development of standardized methodology in NSSI research is crucial if accurate estimates are desired.

AB A lack of perceived control over anxiety-related situations is theorized to be characteristic of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. In the current study we tested several theoretical predictions and developmental variation with the Dutch translation of the Anxiety Control Questionnaire for Children (ACQ-C). The theoretical factor structure of anxiety control was tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in 548 non-referred children (8-18 years old, M = 12.5 years; 50.7 % girls). The incremental predictive validity of perceived control for anxiety status was assessed using logistic regression in 141 clinically anxious children (age M = 12.6 years; 56.7 % girls) and 298 non-referred non-anxious children (age M = 12.6 years; 52.7 % girls). CFA showed that both a one-factor model and two-factor model (perceived control over internal reactions and external events) fit well. The one-factor model proved invariant across age and gender. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .93). Two-month test-retest reliability was adequate. The ACQ-C was able to incrementally predict diagnostic status, even after controlling for age, gender and self-reported anxiety symptoms. Finally, both younger children and girls reported less perceived control, independent of anxiety level. Findings advance the understanding of the psychometric properties of the ACQ-C, the role of control in childhood anxiety and point to the potential utility of the ACQ-C in both clinical and community samples. The Dutch translation of the ACQ-C demonstrated sound psychometric properties.

AB There is growing application of school-based screening to identify post-traumatic distress in students following exposure to trauma. The consensus method is based on self-report questionnaires that assess posttraumatic symptoms, functional impairment, depression or anxiety.
   The current research explored the possibility of using a model, based on the assessment of protective factors, as a screening method for identifying youth who may suffer from posttraumatic distress and need professional help in the aftermath of war.
   Participants were 482 Israeli high-school students who were exposed to ongoing missile attacks during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2008. The data collected included symptom scales and three protective factor scales assessing perceived self-efficacy, cognitive-emotion regulation and flexibility in the use of various coping strategies.
   The results showed that all three protective factors were significant predictors of symptom severity. The protective-factor-based model utilized logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics analysis. The model correctly classified 84 % of adolescents presenting with probable post traumatic stress disorder, identifying them as distressed. Cross-validation was conducted to assess the stability and reliability of the model, which were found to be acceptable.
   The protective factors based model could be important as a part of preliminary triage before referral for intervention and for identification of distressed adolescents. School based screening which focuses on assessing protective factors may facilitate cooperation by both adolescent students and the education system.

AB Anxiety and depression are the most commonly reported mental health problems amongst Australian children and adolescents. The Aussie Optimism: Program-Positive Thinking Skills (AOP-PTS) is a universal intervention program based on cognitive and behavioral strategies and aimed to prevent anxiety and depression in the middle primary school children aged 9-10 years old. 370 students randomly assigned to the intervention and control condition participated in the 42 and 54 months follow-up study. The intervention group received the AOP-PTS 10-week program and the control group received the regular health education curriculum. Students were assessed on anxiety, depression and attribution style at school whilst parents reported on their child's externalizing and internalizing problems at home. Results showed there were no significant reductions across groups in the depressive and anxiety symptoms, and attribution style at either 42 or 54 months follow-up. These findings suggest that AOP-PTS has short and medium term effects but were not sustained in longer term period. Future strategies to achieve the desirable outcomes in a longitudinal study are discussed.

AB Emotions play a crucial role in appraisal of experiences and environments and in guiding thoughts and actions. Moreover, executive function (EF) and emotion regulation(ER) have received much attention, not only for positive associations with children's social-emotional functioning, but also for potential central roles in cognitive functioning. In one conceptualization of ER(Campos et al., 2004), processes of ER, and those of emotional expression and experience(here after referred to as emotionality) are highly related and reciprocal; yet, there has been little research on young children's EF that focuses on emotionality, although it is easily observed within a classroom. The two goals of the study were to:( 1) investigate the relatively unexplored role of emotionality in the development of EF in early childhood and (2) assess the relations between an observational rating of EF obtained after direct assessment with a standardized EF rating scale. We predicted that observed emotionality and EF would both demonstrate stability and predict one another within and across time. 175 children aged 35-60 months were recruited from Head Start and private childcare centers. Using partial least squares modeling, we chose T1 emotionality as the exogenous variable and tested pathways between emotionality and EF across two time points, 6 months apart. Results showed that both T1 observed EF and emotionality predicted their respective T2 counterparts, supporting the idea that both constructs build upon existing systems. Further, T1 emotionality predicted T1 observed EF and the T2 BRIEF-Pcomposite. In turn, T1 observed EF predicted emotionality and the T2 BRIEF-P composite. These findings fit with literature on older populations in which EF and emotionality have been related, yet are the first to report such relations in early childhood. Last, T1 observed EF's positive prediction of the T2 BRIEF-P composite lends credence to the use of both EF measures in applied and research settings.

AB A history of childhood abuse has been consistently linked to heightened risk for subsequent difficulties across the lifespan, including problematic alcohol use and adolescent sexual assault (ASA). Researchers have begun to explore the added role of a lack of self-compassion in the pathway from childhood abuse to later alcohol-related problems. The present study sought to further examine these relationships in a sample at risk for problematic alcohol consumption, undergraduate females (N=667). It was hypothesized that a history of three forms of childhood abuse (i.e., sexual, emotional, and physical) would directly predict subsequent alcohol problems, as well as indirectly via a history of ASA and low levels of self-compassion. Using path analysis, we found that a history of childhood sexual abuse (B=.24, z=2.17, p<.05) and childhood physical abuse (B=.16, z=3.50, p<.05), directly predicted later alcohol problems, whereas a history of childhood emotional abuse (CEA) was indirectly related to alcohol problems via low levels of self-compassion (B=.03, z=2.18, p<.05). Findings support the emerging literature on the impact of self-compassion in relation to trauma exposure, and suggest that compassion-based skills training may be a worthwhile treatment target for individuals with a history of CEA and comorbid substance use.

AB The present study examined the contribution of early reactivity and regulation on externalizing behavior in pre-adolescence. Moreover, subcomponents of attentional control (i.e., attention shifting and attention focusing) and negative reactivity (i.e., sadness and anger) were examined individually to test whether a specific combination of factors uniquely contributed to the outcome. A subset of data were utilized from the ongoing, longitudinal RIGHT Track project (N = 404), in which parents reported on individual factors at age 4 and teachers reported on externalizing behavior at age 10. A hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between anger reactivity and attention shifting when controlling for early externalizing behavior, where children with high levels of anger and low levels of attention shifting experienced the greatest increase in externalizing behavior overtime. An increased focus on specificity is needed in research on the interplay between reactivity and regulation in the prediction of externalizing behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goals of this study were to longitudinally examine the association between social and emotional competence (SEC) and academic achievement in early adolescence, exploring the moderating role of gender in this relation. Using a short-term longitudinal design, self- and teacher-reported indicators of SEC were used to predict early adolescents' (N = 461, Mean age = 12.02 years, SD = 0.41,47% female) achievement in math and reading on a standardized achievement test in grade 7. As hypothesized, teacher-reported SEC in sixth grade significantly predicted higher scores in math and reading on the standardized test in seventh grade. A significant interaction between self-reported SEC and gender in predicting reading scores indicated that SEC was a significant positive predictor for reading outcomes in boys only. Self-reported SEC was not significantly related to math achievement. Results are discussed in line with the literature and practical implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Bipolar disorder in youths is a severe psychiatric disorder that potentially results in high-relapse rates and disrupts the normal psychosocial development. Many adults with bipolar disorder identify the onset of their symptoms in childhood and adolescence, indicating the importance of early accurate diagnosis and treatment. The lifetime prevalence is estimated in adolescence at 0.1% for bipolar I disorder and 1% for all bipolar spectrum disorders. "Classic" bipolar disorder with well-delineated episodes is rare among prepubertal children. The treatment of bipolar disorder in youths raises challenges and difficulties. Lithium is recommended as one of the first-line treatment options of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents with FDA approval as early as 12 years. Lithium prescription is approved in France for bipolar disorder only for adolescents older than 16 years old. This comprehensive literature review incorporates research studies evaluating the effectiveness of lithium in children and adolescents with pediatric bipolar disorder (randomized controlled trials, open-label studies and retrospective chart reviews). Lithium was evaluated as a monotherapy, as well as part of a combination treatment, in the acute and maintenance phases. The effectiveness of a lithium monotherapy is moderate with response rates of approximately 35 to 63%. Its efficacy is similar to valproate and carbamazepine; however, lithium appears to be superior in case of psychotic symptoms. A recent study reported the superiority of risperidone over lithium in bipolar mania with a comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. While it is ideal to use the lowest possible dose of monotherapy medication to decrease adverse side effects, most patients require adjunctive medication treatment for the stabilization of bipolar symptoms. Data suggest that a combined treatment with lithium (using valproate, carbamazepine or risperidone) may provide a better remission of symptoms, with response rates between up to 70 and 90%. The relapse rate in lithium monotherapy is high (37 to 56%); nevertheless, very few studies have measured the long-term effects of the medication in pediatric bipolar disorder. The data from the available pharmacological studies need to be interpreted cautiously because of the controversy surrounding the definition and diagnosis of bipolar disorder in youths. The continuity between childhood-onset bipolar disorder and the current adult-oriented DSM-IV criteria in adolescence is currently debated. The diagnostic framework has evolved to distinguish the diagnoses of "Severe Emotional Dysregulation" (or "Temper Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria" in DSM-V) in children from bipolar I disorder in adolescents. Research samples often include both of these clinical pictures. This heterogeneity in the patient population introduces a major caveat towards the interpretation of the available literature addressing treatment strategies. The distinction between these two forms is even more relevant given the fact that preliminary studies have shown various clinical courses, family psychiatric histories, different prognoses, as well as therapeutic responses. Even if the safety profile of lithium is reassuring, the reported side effects seem to be a more frequent in youths than in adults, especially if the child is young. The most commonly reported (> 20%) adverse events were nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, tremor and pollakiuria.
   Weight gain and acne are side effects that are perceived to be particularly shameful during adolescence. No data on long-term side effects are available. The limited studies examining the pharmacokinetics of lithium may indicate the need for vigilance in the variability induced by the weight in pediatric patients. Very few studies have examined predictors and moderators in the treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. Being younger or suffering from comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have been associated with a poorer response to lithium. The aims of future researches in bipolar disorder in youths may establish some evidence-based strategies for lithium especially: (i) by examining the acute efficacy in mania and also in bipolar depression with a particular attention to age-specific aspects and diagnosis at inclusion, (ii) by investigating the long-term effectiveness of lithium treatment, (iii) by characterizing the long-term safety of lithium, (iv) by identifying pretreatment variables associated with the effectiveness and tolerability of lithium, (v) by studying adherence concerns in adolescents.

AB Adults with substance use disorders (SUDS) report a high prevalence of childhood abuse. Research in the general population suggests specific types of abuse lead to particular negative outcomes; it is not known whether this pattern holds for adults with SUDs. We hypothesized that specific types of abuse would be associated with particular behavioral and emotional outcomes among substance users. That is, childhood sexual abuse would be associated with risky sex behaviors, childhood physical abuse with aggression, and childhood emotional abuse with emotion dysregulation. 280 inpatients (M age = 43.3; 69.7% male; 88.4% African American) in substance use treatment completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), HIV Risk-Taking Behavior Scale, Addiction Severity Index, Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS), and Affect Intensity and Dimensions of Affiliation Motivation (AIM). Consistent with our hypotheses, the CTQ sexual abuse subscale uniquely predicted exchanging sex for cocaine and heroin, number of arrests for prostitution, engaging in unprotected sex with a casual partner during the prior year, and experiencing low sexual arousal when sober. The physical abuse subscale uniquely predicted number of arrests for assault and weapons offenses. The emotional abuse subscale uniquely predicted the DERS total score, AIM score, and DTS score. Among substance users, different types of abuse are uniquely associated with specific negative effects. Assessment of specific abuse types among substance users may be informative in treatment planning and relapse prevention. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that childhood maltreatment is an important predictor of marijuana use, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The current study examines marijuana motives as mediators of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and marijuana use in a sample of young adults. In addition, pathways from childhood maltreatment to emotion dysregulation, coping motives, and marijuana use were explored. Participants were 125 young adults (ages 19-25, 66.9% female) recruited through online community advertising. All participants completed questionnaires assessing childhood maltreatment, emotion dysregulation, marijuana motives, past year and past three-month marijuana use, and marijuana problems. Correlational analyses revealed bivariate relationships between childhood maltreatment, emotion dysregulation, marijuana motives and marijuana problems (rs =.24-.50). Mediation analyses revealed that coping motives mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and marijuana problems, and emotion dysregulation was associated with marijuana problems both directly and indirectly via coping motives. The present findings highlight emotion dysregulation and coping motives as important underlying mechanisms in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and marijuana problems.

AB This study examined associations between uncertainty about sexual orientation, rumination, and psychological distress in university students. We hypothesized that increased rumination would mediate associations between higher sexual orientation uncertainty and greater psychological distress. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these associations might differ for self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) versus heterosexual emerging adults. A sample of 207 university students completed questionnaires assessing sexual orientation uncertainty, rumination, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and aggression. Path analyses indicated that higher sexual orientation uncertainty was associated with greater rumination, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Furthermore, rumination mediated associations between sexual orientation uncertainty and all measures of psychological distress across the entire sample. However, multi-group analyses indicated that these associations emerged for LGB participants but not for heterosexuals. Results suggest that rumination may constitute a common but maladaptive coping response for sexual minorities facing sexual orientation uncertainty. Interventions for this population should focus on decreasing rumination.

AB Objective: This study examined the growth pattern in physical aggression over a five-year period among South Korean early adolescents and the effects of temperament (anger/frustration and emotion regulation) and parenting (harsh parenting and parental monitoring) on early adolescents' physical aggression.
   Design: A five-year longitudinal design was used to explore the growth pattern in physical aggression.
   Method: Participants were 2844 early adolescents (1320 girls and 1524 boys; M age = 9.86 years, SD = 0.35 at wave 1) in the Korea Youth Panel Study (KYPS), a national representative of Korean children and adolescents. The latent growth curve model (LGM) was used for data analysis.
   Results: There was a significant linear growth over time in physical aggression during early adolescence. However, there were significant individual differences of developmental trajectories of adolescent aggression. The initial level of aggression in early adolescence was positively associated with anger/frustration, and the rate of change in aggression was negatively related to emotion regulation. Parenting variables, which were harsh parenting and parental monitoring, were not related to the initial level and rate of change in physical aggression.
   Conclusion: Temperament variables (anger/frustration, emotion regulation) cause the individual differences in initial level of aggression and rate of change in aggression.

AB Stuttering requires a multidimensional perspective given that, in recent years, researchers have shown the impact of the disorder to reach far beyond the surface components with demonstrated psychosocial and anxiety effects for the individual living with a stutter. This article explores the impact a stuttering disorder has on the individual (child, adolescent, and adult) and on their family members (siblings, parents, and partners). These experiences include behavioral and social difficulties, self-awareness, reactions to stuttering, communication difficulties in daily situations, and overall quality of life. The influence of stuttering on the most intimate relationships of the person who stutters is presented. An overview of stuttering across the life span is discussed in terms of stuttering in children and adolescents, and the significant levels of adverse impact as a result of living with a stutter are described. In addition, the impact that the stuttering disorder has on the parents and siblings of children who stutter is also detailed through significant findings pertaining to lack of attachment and trust between the young people and their parents. The responsibilities and demands on parents and siblings in the family context are highlighted. Focus is also placed on the experience of living with a person who stutters from the perspective of their life partner. Perceived quality of life is explored with unexpected differences recounted between the quality of life experienced by the adult who stutters and their partner's perceptions of this disorder. Finally, the potential for a novel Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for individuals who stutter is presented.

AB IMPORTANCE Identifying associations between preschool-aged children's electronic media use and their later well-being is essential to supporting positive long-term outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate possible dose-response associations of young children's electronic media use with their later well-being.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The IDEFICS (Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants) study is a prospective cohort study with an intervention component. Data were collected at baseline from September 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, and at follow-up from September 1, 2009, through May 31, 2010, in 8 European countries participating in the IDEFICS study. This investigation is based on 3604 children aged 2 to 6 years who participated in the longitudinal component of the IDEFICS study only and not in the intervention.
   EXPOSURE Early childhood electronic media use.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The following 6 indicators of well-being from 2 validated instruments were used as outcomes at follow-up: Peer problems and Emotional problems subscales from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Emotional well-being, Self-esteem, Family functioning, and Social networks subscales from the KINDLR (Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents-Revised Version). Each scale was dichotomized to identify those children at risk for poorer outcomes. Indicators of electronic media use (weekday and weekend television and electronic game [e-game]/computer use) from baseline were used as predictors.
   RESULTS Associations varied between boys and girls; however, associations suggested that increased levels of electronic media use predicted poorer well-being outcomes. Television viewing on weekdays or weekends was more consistently associated with poorer outcomes than e-game/computer use. Across associations, the likelihood of adverse outcomes in children ranged from a 1.2- to 2.0-fold increase for emotional problems and poorer family functioning for each additional hour of television viewing or e-game/computer use depending on the outcome examined.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher levels of early childhood electronic media use are associated with children being at risk for poorer outcomes with some indicators of well-being. Further research is required to identify potential mechanisms.

AB The present study examined sense of identity (assessed using the Identity subscale of the Psychosocial Maturity Inventory) as a moderator of associations between stressful life events, behavioral/emotional problems, and substance abuse in a sample of 187 college undergraduates (67% female). Correlations showed evidence for positive associations between life stress and behavioral and emotional problems, negative associations between identity and life stress/behavioral and emotional problems, and a positive association between identity and GPA. For three outcomes-anxious/depressed problems, thought problems, and aggressive behavior-identity moderated the association, such that individuals with a stronger sense of identity reported fewer problems even when experiencing high levels of life stress. Primary results remained significant when controlling for age, global self-worth, and broad personality variables, and did not differ by gender.

AB Background. Little is known about the perception of health-related quality of life of short statured children, adolescents and young adults with achondroplasia.
   Aim. The objective of this study was the identification of physical and socio-emotional problems and resources of young patients with achondroplasia.
   Material and methods. The quality of life of the 34 patients (age range 8-28 years) and 21 parents of children and adolescents aged 8-18 years was examined and compared using qualitative analyses of focus group discussions.
   Results. A difference between the children's and parent's perception could be shown. Patients talked about a variety of problems which have a specific impact on their quality of life. However, many also showed adaptive coping strategies in dealing with their diseases and older patients in particular were better adapted and reported less difficulties.
   Conclusion. The results of this study show the importance of research in this area. In particular, the socio-emotional consequences for affected families from the particular circumstances described in this project indicate a need of adequate support.

AB Background: From a population based study of epilepsy in Swedish children a subgroup designated well-functioning with an epilepsy diagnosis in 1997 was worked up from a medical point of view 10 years later.
   Aim: To describe the psychological and social outcome in this subgroup.
   Methods: Thirty-one patients aged 11-22 years and their parents/partners responded to a questionnaire according to Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) to evaluate behavioural and emotional problems, and social competence.
   Results: Active epilepsy, diagnosed in 32%, was related to attention problems, somatic complaints, and school problems. Polytherapy, used in 16%, was related to attention problems and aggressive behaviour. School problems were found in six of seven children younger than 18 years. Internalizing, externalizing, and 'other' syndromes were found in 29% of the individuals, but a grouping of these syndromes in the clinical range only in two (6.5%), a girl with generalized tonic clonic seizures alone, and a boy with structural focal epilepsy. Both had active epilepsy and were treated with polytherapy. All ten individuals with Rolandic epilepsy were classified as normal. The answers to the ASEBA questionnaire of individuals and parents/partners were inconsistent, and parents generally stated more problems than the individuals.
   Summary.: This 10-year follow-up study of psychological and social outcome in well-functioning children and adolescents with childhood onset epilepsy shows some emotional, behavioural, and social problems. Thus, early information to increase knowledge about epilepsy and associated psychological co-morbidities in order to decrease risk of low self-esteem, social anxiety, and depression later in life is of importance.

AB Introduction: This study examined the importance of self-perceptions as determinants of psychosocial adjustment reported by adolescents with heart disease and compared adolescents with heart disease to healthy norms.
   Methods: Ninety-two adolescents with heart disease from a single Midwestern institution provided reports of self-perceptions (health, self-worth, competence, and importance), internalizing behavior problems (IPs; e. g., anxiety and depression) and externalizing behavior problems (EPs; e. g., attention problems and aggression), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the impact of self-perceptions, as well as clinical factors (e. g., illness severity, time since last hospitalization, and medications) and demographic characteristics on outcomes.
   Results: Self-perceptions explained the most variance in behavioral and HRQOL outcomes (R-adj(2) = 0.34 for IP, 0.24 for EP, and 0.33 for HRQOL, p < .001). Male gender and lower household income were associated with more behavior problems. Clinical variables were only related to HRQOL. Compared with healthy norms, IPs were significantly more common in male adolescents and HRQOL was lower (p < .001).
   Discussion: Adolescents with heart disease are at risk for internalizing behavior problems and reduced HRQOL; however, positive self-perceptions appear to be protective. Self-perceptions are critical and should be addressed by clinicians.

AB Affect dysregulation, defined as the impaired ability to regulate or tolerate negative emotional states, has been associated with interpersonal trauma and posttraumatic stress. Affect-regulation difficulties play a role in many psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders, and especially major depression in youth and bipolar disorder throughout the life span. Exposure to traumatic events and interpersonal trauma in childhood is associated with wide-ranging psychosocial, developmental, and medical impairments in children, adolescents, and adults, with emotional dysregulation being a core feature that may help to account for this heightened risk. In order to understand how the developmental effects of childhood maltreatment contribute to emotional dysregulation and psychiatric sequelae, we review emotional regulation and its developmental neurobiology, and examine the research evidence of associations between childhood trauma, emotional dysregulation, and psychiatric comorbidities in children, adolescents, and adults.

AB Social and emotional problems have been implicated in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (ED).This paper reviews the facets of social processing in ED according to the NIMH Research and Domain Criteria (NIMH RDoC) 'Systems for Social Processes' framework. Embase, Medline, Psyclnfo and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles published by March 2013. One-hundred and fifty four studies measuring constructs of: attachment, social communication, perception and understanding of self and others, and social dominance in people with ED, were identified. Eleven meta-analyses were performed, they showed evidence that people with ED had attachment insecurity (d=1.31), perceived low parental care (d=.51), appraised high parental overprotection (d=0.29), impaired facial emotion recognition (d=.44) and facial communication (d=2.10), increased facial avoidance (d=.52), reduced agency (d=.39), negative self-evaluation (d=2.27), alexithymia (d=.66), poor understanding of mental states (d=1.07) and sensitivity to social dominance (d=1.08). There is less evidence for problems with production and reception of non-facial communication, animacy and action. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Children's emotional reactivity may interact with their regulatory behaviors to contribute to internalizing problems and social functioning even early in development. Ninety-one preschool children participated in a longitudinal project examining children's reactivity and regulatory behaviors as predictors of internalizing problems, and positive and negative social behavior in the classroom. Children who paired negative emotion expression with disengagement during a laboratory task showed higher levels of internalizing problems and more negative social behavior in the classroom 6 months later. Positive emotion expression paired with engagement during a laboratory task predicted more positive social behavior in the classroom 6 months later. Physiological reactivity and regulation also predicted children's social behavior in the classroom. Findings suggest that preschool children with maladaptive reactivity and regulatory patterns may be at greater risk for internalizing problems even in early childhood.

AB Research in child development suggests that parents' emotional competence and emotion socialization practices are related to children's emotional functioning, including child internalizing difficulties. This research has not yet been translated into intervention or prevention programs targeting parents of older children and adolescents. The current study examined the efficacy of the Tuning in to Teens parenting program in improving emotion socialization practices in parents of preadolescents and reducing youth internalizing difficulties. Schools were randomized into intervention and control conditions. Data were collected from 225 parents and 224 youth during the young person's final year of elementary school (sixth grade) and again 10 months later in their first year of secondary school (seventh grade). Multilevel analyses showed significant improvements in parental emotion socialization and reductions in youth internalizing difficulties for the intervention condition. This study provides support for the efficacy of the TINT parenting program with a community sample.

TI Predictors of immigrant children's mental health in Canada: selection,

AB A previous publication from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study, a national study of immigrant children and youth in Canada, showed a gradient of levels of emotional distress with children from Hong Kong (HK) at the most severe end, Filipino children at the least severe, and children from the People's Republic of China (PRC) in between. Based on the premise that country of origin can be regarded as an index for differing immigration trajectories, the current study examines the extent to which arrival characteristics, resettlement contingencies and cultural factors account for country of origin variations in immigrant children's mental health. Arrival characteristics included child's age at arrival, parental education, parental fluency in English or French, and assistance from family at arrival. Resettlement contingencies included parental mental health, intra-familial conflict, settlement stress, separations from parents and child's age when mother started working outside the home. Cultural factors included one-child family composition and parenting styles.
   A national survey of 2,031 families with at least one child between the ages of 4 and 6 or 11 and 13 from HK, the PRC and the Philippines was conducted with the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) in snowball-generated samples in 6 different cities across Canada. Predictors of the dependent variable, emotional problems (EP), were examined in a hierarchical block regression analysis. EP was regressed on ethnic and country of origin group in model 1; arrival characteristics were added in model 2; resettlement contingencies in model 3 and cultural factors in model 4.
   The final set of predictor variables accounted for 19.3 % of the variance in EP scores among the younger cohort and 23.2 % in the older. Parental human and social capital variables accounted for only a small amount of the overall variance in EP, but there were statistically significant inverse relationships between EP and PMK fluency in English or French. Settlement contingencies accounted for a significant increase in the explanatory power of the regression equation, net of the effects of country of origin and selection characteristics. This block of variables also accounted for the Filipino mental health advantage. Levels of parent's depression and somatization, harsh parenting, intrafamilial conflict, and resettlement stress each varied directly with levels of children's EP. Cultural variables made a significant contribution to explaining the variance in EP scores. Harsh parenting was significantly associated with increased levels of EP in both age groups, and supportive parenting was a mental health protective factor for younger children.
   Immigrant family human and social capital, according to which immigrants are selected for admission to Canada, play a relatively small role in determining children's mental health. These effects are overshadowed by resettlement contingencies and cultural influences. Concentrating on trying to find a formula to select the "right" immigrants while neglecting settlement and culture is likely to pay limited dividends for ensuring the mental health of children.

AB Objective: This study describes an empirically derived approach to diagnosing adolescent personality pathology that is clinically relevant and empirically grounded. Method: A random national sample of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists (N = 950) described a randomly selected adolescent patient (aged 13-18 years, stratified by age and gender) in their care using the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-II-A for Adolescents (SWAP-II-A) and several additional questionnaires. Results: We applied a form of factor analysis to identify naturally occurring personality groupings within the patient sample. The analysis yielded 10 clinically coherent adolescent personality descriptions organized into 3 higher-order clusters (internalizing, externalizing, and borderline-dysregulated). We also obtained a higher-order personality strengths factor. These factors and clusters strongly resembled but were not identical to factors similarly identified in adult patients. In a second, independent sample from an intensive day treatment facility, 2 clinicians (the patients' treating clinician and the medical director) independently completed the SWAP-II-A, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a measure of adaptive functioning. Two additional clinicians, blinded to the data from the first 2 clinicians, independently rated patients' ward behavior using a validated measure of interpersonal behavior. Clinicians diagnosed the personality syndromes with high agreement and minimal comorbidity among diagnoses, and SWAP-II-A descriptions strongly correlated in expected ways with the CBCL, adaptive functioning, and ward ratings. Conclusion: The results support the importance of personality diagnosis in adolescents and provide an approach to diagnosing adolescent personality that is empirically based and clinically useful.

AB The use of psychotropic medications is a significant factor in the overall effort to respond to detained youth with mental illness, yet there are very few studies of psychotropic medication use in juvenile detention settings. It is important to understand the factors that influence the use of mental health services and psychoactive medications in these settings since youth with emotional problems are overrepresented in them. This paper addresses the proportion of youth in these settings who receive mental health services and psychoactive medications. In addition, the impact of a major statewide policy change-the shift of juvenile placement responsibility from the state to local government-on these proportions was examined using 8 years of publicly available data from county probation departments. Multivariate regression analyses of 1,760 observations of quarterly reports from 55 counties showed that the use of both mental health services and psychoactive medications in detention facilities increased concurrently with the policy change. While these proportions had already been gradually increasing in these facilities, it appears that after the policy change they increased even more. This contradicts the aim of most juvenile justice planners-to divert non-violent youth offenders with emotional problems away from incarceration settings and towards community based treatment alternatives. If adequately available, these support services could provide diversion alternatives to prevent inappropriate detentions, and to provide post-detention treatment to prevent lapses in continuity of care and, ultimately, to prevent reoffending.

AB Background
   Sexual development plays a vital part in young people's emotional adjustment.
   Method
   This study compared the sexual understanding of 30 adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) and 30 non-disabled adolescents, along with their reports of where they obtained sexual information, and the nature of their social networks and support.
   Results
   As expected, the non-disabled young people had superior levels of knowledge. However, an interaction was found between group and gender. The non-disabled young women had a better grasp of sexual matters than men, whereas the opposite was the case for those with ID. The non-disabled young people reported more formal and informal sources of sexual information and described larger social networks than those with ID.
   Conclusions
   These findings highlight the need to tackle the barriers to sexual knowledge faced by young people with ID, and the need to take account of the broader social context of their lives when doing so. This includes the attitudes to the developing sexuality of young women with ID in particular.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, emotion regulation (ER) ability, and depressive symptoms within a diverse community sample of 277 youth, ages 9-12 (56 % male). Participants were drawn from a larger study examining adolescent risk behaviors, and completed annual assessments over 3 years. Youth ADHD symptoms were assessed at Time 1 (T1) using the parent-reported Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale, ER was assessed with the parent-reported Emotion Regulation Checklist at Time 2 (T2), and youth depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-reported Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales at Time 3 (T3). Analyses examined T2 ER as a mediator between T1 ADHD symptoms (including the unique contributions of inattentive [IA] versus hyperactive/impulsive [HI] symptoms) and T3 depressive symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated the path model specified provided an excellent fit to the data. Tests of indirect effects suggested that T2 ER appears to be a significant mechanism that underlies the relationship between T1 ADHD and T3 depression, even when accounting for T1 oppositional defiant and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, while both T1 IA and HI symptoms had significant indirect effects on T3 depression through the mechanism T2 ER, HI proved a more robust predictor of T2 ER than IA. Results of this prospective study support cross-sectional findings pointing to ER as a potential mechanism linking ADHD and depressive symptoms in youth. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Hyperventilation has been linked to emotional distress in adults. This study investigates end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate variability (HRV) in adolescent girls with emotional disorders and healthy controls. ETCO2, RR, HRV, and ratings of emotional symptom severity were collected in adolescent female psychiatric patients with emotional disorders (n = 63) and healthy controls (n = 62). ETCO2 and RR differed significantly between patients and controls. ETCO2, HR, and HRV were significant independent predictors of group status, that is, clinical or healthy, while RR was not. ETCO2 and RR were significantly related to emotional symptom severity and to HRV in the total group. ETCO2 and RR were not affected by use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It is concluded that emotional dysregulation is related to hyperventilation in adolescent girls. Respiratory-based treatments may be relevant to investigate in future research.

AB This article presents data on the psychometric properties of a new measure, the Adolescent Quality of Life Mental Health Scale (AQOL-MHS), designed to measure quality of life in clinical samples of Latino adolescents aged 12-18 years. Participants were recruited in Puerto Rico to have one of five prevalent mental health disorders. The initial instrument development was achieved through a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews.
   We conducted two stages of exploratory factor analyses (EFA) on 60 candidate items. The first stage was to establish the number of factors to extract, and the second was to improve the model by selecting the best items. A final EFA model retained 31 items and 3 factors labeled Emotional Regulation (11 items), Self-Concept (10 items) and Social Context (10 items).
   The instrument showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. The hypotheses-driven validity tests were all supportive of the AQOL-MHS. There was evidence for convergent validity and discriminant validity, and results for known-groups' validity were overwhelmingly supportive of the ability of the instrument to identify differences between groups.
   These preliminary findings support our conceptual model and the use of the AQOL-MHS domain and overall scores. We believe that this instrument will provide clinicians additional insight into the different aspects of quality of life that are important to adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, we consider the AQOL-MHS a vital patient-centered outcome measure for assessment strategies in the prevention and treatment of this population.

AB Developmental or fetal programming has emerged as a major model for understanding the early and persisting effects of prenatal exposures on the health and development of the child and adult. We leverage the power of a 14-year prospective study to examine the persisting effects of prenatal anxiety, a key candidate in the developmental programming model, on symptoms of behavioral and emotional problems across five occasions of measurement from age 4 to 13 years. The study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort, a prospective, longitudinal study of a large community sample in the west of England (n = 7,944). Potential confounders included psychosocial and obstetric risk, postnatal maternal mood, paternal pre- and postnatal mood, and parenting. Results indicated that maternal prenatal anxiety predicted persistently higher behavioral and emotional symptoms across childhood with no diminishment of effect into adolescence. Elevated prenatal anxiety (top 15%) was associated with a twofold increase in risk of a probable child mental disorder, 12.31% compared with 6.83%, after allowing for confounders. Results were similar with prenatal depression. These analyses provide some of the strongest evidence to date that prenatal maternal mood has a direct and persisting effect on her child's psychiatric symptoms and support an in utero programming hypothesis.

AB In this review, we evaluate developmental and personality research with the aim of determining whether the personality trait of conscientiousness can be identified in children and adolescents. After concluding that conscientiousness does emerge in childhood, we discuss the developmental origins of conscientiousness with a specific focus on self-regulation, academic motivation, and internalized compliance/ internalization of standards. On the basis of the accumulated body of evidence, we conclude that self-regulation fosters conscientiousness later in life, both directly and via academic motivation and internalized compliance with norms. We argue that elements of conscientiousness are evident by early childhood; self-regulation skills are likely a core developmental component of conscientiousness; and despite the contribution of heredity to the aforementioned aspects of functioning, environmental factors likely contribute to conscientiousness.

AB Objective: This study was designed to examine the prospective relations of harsh parenting during preadolescence, anger across adolescence, and a health phenotype at late adolescence among African American youths living in the rural South. A second purpose was to determine whether, for genetic reasons, some youths will be more sensitive than others to a harsh parenting to anger to poor health pathway. Method: Participants were 368 youths (age 11.2 at the first assessment) who provided data on receipt of harsh parenting during preadolescence (ages 11 to 13), anger across adolescence (ages 16 to 18), and a health phenotype consisting of C Reactive Protein, depressive symptoms, and health problems at age 19. Youths were genotyped at the 5-HTTLPR at age 16. Results: The data analysis revealed that (a) harsher parenting was associated positively across time with anger and poor health, (b) anger across adolescence also was associated positively across time with poor health, (c) anger served as a mediator connecting harsh parenting and poor health, and (d) the harsh parenting to anger to poor health pathway was significant only for youths carrying one or two copies of a short allele at the 5-HTTLPR. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that harsh parent-child interactions presage health through effects on emotion regulation, particularly anger. This mediational pathway pertained only to youths carrying a gene that confers sensitivity and reactivity to harsh family processes and the negative emotional states they occasion.

AB For gender dysphoric children and adolescents, the school environment may be challenging due to peer social ostracism and rejection. To date, information on the psychological functioning and the quality of peer relations in gender dysphoric children and adolescents has been studied via parental report, peer sociometric methods, and social interactions in laboratory play groups. The present study was the first cross-national investigation that assessed behavior and emotional problems and the quality of peer relations, both measured by the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), in a sample of 728 gender dysphoric patients (554 children, 174 adolescents), who were referred to specialized gender identity clinics in the Netherlands and Canada. The gender dysphoric adolescents had significantly more teacher-reported emotional and behavioral problems than the gender dysphoric children. In both countries, gender dysphoric natal boys had poorer peer relations and more internalizing than externalizing problems compared to the gender dysphoric natal girls. Furthermore, there were significant between-clinic differences: both the children and the adolescents from Canada had more emotional and behavioral problems and a poorer quality of peer relations than the children and adolescents from the Netherlands. In conclusion, gender dysphoric children and adolescents showed the same pattern of emotional and behavioral problems in both countries. The extent of behavior and emotional problems was, however, higher in Canada than in the Netherlands, which appeared, in part, an effect of a poorer quality of peer relations. Per Bronfenbrenner's (American Psychologist, 32, 513-531, 1977) ecological model of human development and well-being, we consider various interpretations of the cross-national, cross-clinic differences on TRF behavior problems at the level of the family, the peer group, and the culture at large.

AB Background
   Peer relations is a vulnerable area of functioning in children with specific language impairment (SLI), but little is known about the developmental trajectories of individuals.
   Methods
   Peer problems were investigated over a 9-year period (from 7 to 16years of age) in 171 children with a history of SLI. Discrete factor growth modelling was used to chart developmental trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors associated with group membership.
   Results
   Four distinct developmental trajectories were identified: low-level/no problems in peer relations (22.2% of participants), childhood-limited problems (12.3%), childhood-onset persistent problems (39.2%) and adolescent-onset problems (26.3%). Risk of poor trajectories of peer relations was greater for those children with pragmatic language difficulties. Prosocial behaviour was the factor most strongly associated with trajectory group membership. Overall, the more prosocial children with better pragmatic language skills and lower levels of emotional problems had less difficulty in developing peer relations.
   Conclusions
   Analysis of developmental trajectories enriches our understanding of social development. A sizeable minority in the present sample sustained positive relations through childhood and adolescence, and others overcame early difficulties to achieve low levels of problems by their early teens; the majority, however, showed childhood-onset persistent or adolescent-onset problems.

AB Pediatric bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSDs) are serious conditions associated with morbidity and mortality. Although most treatment research has examined pharmacotherapy for pediatric BPSDs, growing literature suggests that psychosocial interventions are also important to provide families with an understanding of symptoms, course, and treatment of BPSDs; teach youth and parents methods for coping with symptoms (e.g., problem solving, communication, emotion regulation, cognitive-behavioral skills); and prevent relapse. Thirteen psychosocial intervention trials for pediatric BPSDs were identified via a comprehensive literature search and evaluated according to the Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures guidelines. All interventions were examined adjunctive to pharmacotherapy and/or treatment as usual (TAU). No well-established or questionably efficacious treatments were identified. Family psychoeducation plus skill building was probably efficacious (i.e., Multi-Family Psychoeducational Psychotherapy, Family-Focused Treatment); cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was possibly efficacious. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) were experimental. Limited research precluded subdivision of treatments by format and age. Only single- and multiple-family psychoeducation plus skill building and CBT were evaluated with children. Only single-family psychoeducation plus skill building and DBT, and individual (commonly with limited familial involvement) CBT and IPSRT were evaluated with adolescents. In conclusion, psychosocial interventions that involve families, psychoeducation, and skill building may offer added benefit to pharmacotherapy and/or other TAU. Limitations of current research include few outcome studies, small samples, and failure to use stringent control conditions or randomization. The review concludes with a discussion of mediators and moderators, recommendations for best practice, and suggestions for future research.

AB Background
   Adolescent mental health problems are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adulthood but little is known about the effects on adult parenting practices. This study aimed to examine prospective associations between adolescent conduct and emotional problems and subsequent parenting behaviours in adulthood.
   Methods
   The study sample comprised 1110 members from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Prospective data were collected from teacher reports of conduct and emotional problems at age 13 and 15 years and adult outcome measures of parenting included intellectual environment, cognitive stimulation, coercive discipline, parental interest and parental aspiration.
   Results
   In regression models adjusted for the confounding effects of social background, cognition and education, adolescent conduct problems predicted coercive parenting behaviours in adulthood. The effects of adolescent emotional problems on the development of coercive discipline practices were explained by covariates. Likewise, the inability of parents who displayed conduct problems in adolescence to provide an intellectually stimulating home environment was fully explained by the adjustment for education.
   Conclusions
   Adolescents who exhibit conduct problems are more likely to develop coercive styles of parenting.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs frequently and may result in deficits in concentration, fatigue, attention, aggression and emotion regulation; significantly impacting an individual's ability to function. This study examined reports of TBI among mothers identified as having high risk for child abuse/maltreatment. Participants were 206 Mothers referred to a child abuse prevention programme (The Family Help Trust, Christchurch, New Zealand) between 2003 and 2010 (n = 206); TBI prevalence of 36.4 % (n = 75). One-third had experienced multiple TBI (n = 24), and 58.7 % (n = 44) of those reporting TBI had experienced their first injury prior to age 16. TBI in at-risk mothers was more than three times the TBI found in community samples, with many injuries occurring in childhood. Given the increased prevalence of TBI among mothers at high risk of child abuse, there is a need for greater information regarding the long-term outcomes of TBI, particularly for vulnerable groups requiring assistance to manage life roles.

AB Objective: While adolescents use various types of care for behavioral and emotional problems, evidence on age trends and determinants per type is scarce. We aimed to assess use of care by adolescents because of behavioral and emotional problems, overall and by type, and its determinants, for ages 10-19 years.
   Methods: We obtained longitudinal data on 2,230 adolescents during ages 10-19 from four measurements regarding use of general care and specialized care (youth social care and mental healthcare) in the preceding 6 months, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report, and child and family characteristics. We analyzed data by multilevel logistic regression.
   Results: Overall rates of use increased from 20.1% at age 10/11 to 32.2% at age 19: general care was used most. At age 10/11 use was higher among boys, at age 19 among girls. Use of general care increased for both genders, whereas use of specialized care increased among girls but decreased among boys. This differential change was associated with CBCL externalizing and internalizing problems, school problems, family socioeconomic status, and parental divorce. Preceding CBCL problems predicted more use: most for mental health care and least for general care. Moreover, general care was used more frequently by low and medium socioeconomic status families, with odds ratios (95%-confidence intervals): 1.52 (1.23; 1.88) and 1.40 (1.17; 1.67); youth social care in case of parental divorce, 2.07 (1.36; 3.17); and of special education, 2.66 (1.78; 3.95); and mental healthcare in case of special education, 2.66 (1.60; 4.51).
   Discussion: Adolescents with behavioral and emotional problems use general care most frequently. Overall use increases with age. Determinants of use vary per type.

AB The aim of the study was to describe the development and predictors of psychological adjustment during community-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. Forty-two adolescent and adult individuals with TBI (mean age 32 years, 88% male, median post-traumatic amnesia 11 days) participated in a single-group, longitudinal design study. The main measures used were the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory, Adjustment subscale; Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and Self-awareness of Deficits Interview. At rehabilitation start, individuals differed significantly from each other with respect to their level of psychological adjustment. Individual trajectories of psychological adjustment were highly variable. However, for the sample as a whole, psychological adjustment did not change during the course of rehabilitation (multilevel regression models; p > .05). Good psychological adjustment was related to low levels of emotional distress and a small discrepancy between current and aspired functional status. Poor functional status had a more minor impact on psychological adjustment in individuals with poor self-awareness than in individuals with high levels of self-awareness. The results confirm parts of theoretical models of psychological adjustment to acquired brain injury, especially the importance of goal refinement. However, the results need to be treated cautiously, given the limited sample size.

AB Insomnia can be lethal, increasing the risk of suicide and accidental death by overdose. In this review we present a synthesis of the literature investigating the insomnia-suicide link and the psychological mechanisms underpinning the association. Specifically, we review the findings of prospective epidemiological studies demonstrating the insomnia-suicide link in adult and adolescent community populations. Robust associations between insomnia and suicide are observed in clinically depressed and anxious populations, and there are indications across a number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that these linkages are attributable to a disrupted sleep pattern, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and nightmares, independent of depression and anxiety symptoms. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and chronic pain (CP) are highlighted as high-risk subgroups given the elevated rates of insomnia and suicidality in both conditions. Aside from the influence of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, emerging evidence has identified impulsivity and emotional dysregulation as possible mechanisms driving the insomnia-suicide link in BPD, and catastrophizing and the sense of defeat/entrapment as potential cognitive pathways through which insomnia aggravates suicidality in CP. Screening for, and interventions that tackle, insomnia and these associated psychological mechanisms, offer a novel avenue for reducing suicidality across a range of clinical and non-clinical populations.

AB While studies have documented significant associations between insecure attachment, emotion dysregulation, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) features, no research to date has empirically delineated the specific mechanisms by which these constructs are related. The present study brings together 2 lines of research that have hitherto separately examined attachment disturbance and emotion dysregulation as they respectively manifest in the pathogenesis of BPD, and explores the complex relations between the 2 well-established correlates of borderline traits in a clinical sample of adolescents (N = 228). We examined the adolescents' use of positive and negative emotion regulation strategies, along with their maternal and paternal attachment security. Results indicated that positive and negative emotion regulation strategies were differentially implicated in the link between attachment insecurity and BPD features. Attachment security functioned as a buffer against adolescent BPD by enhancing positive emotion regulation strategies, while negative emotion regulation strategies served to dilute the protective effect of attachment and positive regulation strategies, culminating in clinically significant levels of borderline traits. Findings are discussed with regard to interventions in the developmental trajectory of BPD as it unfolds during adolescence.

AB Background There is growing evidence that early childhood education (ECE) interventions can reduce the loss of developmental potential of disadvantaged children in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC). Less attention has been paid to the potential of these programmes to prevent child mental health problems and promote child well-being.
   Methods Peer-reviewed journal articles describing controlled evaluations of ECE interventions in LAMIC were reviewed to identify studies with child mental health outcomes. Studies with proximal outcomes for child mental health including caregiver practices and caregiver mental health were also reviewed.
   Results Of 63 studies identified, 21 (33.33%) included child mental health outcomes; 12 of 16 studies with short-term measures showed benefits; 6 studies included a longer-term follow-up and all found benefits; 25 studies included caregiver outcomes: consistent benefits were found for caregiver practices (21 studies) and 6 of 9 studies that measured caregiver mental health reported benefits. Gains to child mental health may be most likely when ECE interventions include three main elements: (i) activities to increase child skills including cognition, language, self-regulation and social-emotional competence; (ii) training caregivers in the skills required to provide a cognitively stimulating and emotionally supportive environment; and (iii) attention to the caregivers' mental health, motivation and self-efficacy. Recommendations for the design and implementation of programmes are provided.
   Conclusion ECE interventions are an important component of mental health prevention and promotion in LAMIC, and promoting child and caregiver well-being is a fundamental aspect of interventions to improve child development.

AB Many depressed adolescents experience difficulty in regulating their emotions. These emotion regulation difficulties appear to emerge in part from socialization processes within families and then generalize to other contexts. However, emotion dysregulation is typically assessed within the individual, rather than in the social relationships that shape and maintain dysregulation. In this study, we evaluated concordance of physiological and observational measures of emotion dysregulation during interpersonal conflict, using a multilevel actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Participants were 75 mother-daughter dyads, including 50 depressed adolescents with or without a history of self-injury, and 25 typically developing controls. Behavior dysregulation was operationalized as observed aversiveness during a conflict discussion, and physiological dysregulation was indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Results revealed different patterns of concordance for control versus depressed participants. Controls evidenced a concordant partner (between-person) effect, and showed increased physiological regulation during minutes when their partner was more aversive. In contrast, clinical dyad members displayed a concordant actor (within-person) effect, becoming simultaneously physiologically and behaviorally dysregulated. Results inform current understanding of emotion dysregulation across multiple levels of analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional approaches to the study of children's expressions of anger rely on tightly controlled study environments to test hypotheses about outcomes and correlates of expression characteristics. An unexplored area in the study of emotion expression is a naturalistic examination of school-age children's spontaneously occurring expressions of emotion in their real, uncontrolled family contexts. This observational study describes the naturally occurring characteristics and contexts of 8- to 12-year-old children's anger expressions with family members. Thirty-one families were videotaped for 2 days at home and in community settings. Children's expressions of anger were identified and coded for angry facial, vocal and physical behaviors, and for the expressions' instigating situational contexts. The majority of anger expressions were of mild intensity and brief duration, and most often contained vocal behavioral characteristics (e. g., loud voice, whining). The most common cause of an anger expression was a verbal disagreement; other frequently occurring situational causes included homework, requests for compliance, and reprimands. Patterns in the angry behaviors children exhibited in response to specific situational causes support a functionalist perspective on emotion expression in that children engaged in behaviors that appeared to be attempts to get their needs met. Few differences were observed between mothers' and fathers' rates of instigating children's anger expressions, and between boys' and girls' expression characteristics and contexts. This study offers an ecologically valid, uniquely naturalistic methodology to describe children's observable expressions of anger as they occur in family contexts.

AB Distress tolerance is defined behaviorally as the ability to maintain goal-directed behavior while experiencing physical or psychological distress. Distress tolerance is closely related to emotion regulation and is a clinically relevant construct contributing to psychopathology across adults and adolescents, yet limited research has examined the development of this construct. A number of studies suggest the importance of parenting in the emergence of emotion regulation capacities in childhood and adolescence. In the current study, we utilize a behavioral measure of distress tolerance to examine whether maternal distress tolerance is related to adolescent distress tolerance, and whether this association differs as a function of gender. We also examine the influence of family emotional climate, namely maternal response to adolescent distress and adolescent attachment. Results indicate a significant maternal distress tolerance by adolescent gender interaction, such that maternal distress tolerance predicts adolescent distress tolerance in daughters, but not sons. The family emotional climate variables were unrelated to maternal or adolescent distress tolerance. Taken together, data indicate that maternal distress tolerance is significantly related to the distress tolerance of adolescent daughters and indicates the potential utility of addressing maternal distress tolerance in clinical work with adolescents.

AB Objective and methods: Current research has focused on the impact of difficulties in emotional recognition and regulation and deficits in social cognition (ToM) in the predisposition and maintenance of eating disorders EDs. Though most studies have assessed adult patients, few studies have examined these characteristics in adolescent patients. This study assessed difficulties in emotional recognition and ToM in 48 adult and adolescent patients (39 Anorexia Nervosa patients, and 9 Bulimia Nervosa patients) of varying degrees of severity, who were compared with a group of healthy controls using the TAS-20, and the RME.
   Results: The results substantiate the initial working hypothesis that difficulties in emotional recognition would be greater in both AN and BN patients as compared to controls. Moreover, these difficulties were modulated by age and the severity of the disorder i.e., severely affected adult patients had more difficulties in emotional recognition than less severely affected adolescent patients. No differences were observed according to diagnosis or BMI.
   Contrary to expectation in terms of the functioning of social cognition (theory of mind), both adult and adolescent AN and BN patients maintained their ability to infer the mental state of others, and performance in mentalizing task was similar to controls. Performance was slightly lower, but not statistically significant, in long-term previously treated patients than in controls. No relationship with low BMI or eating symptoms was observed.
   Conclusion: Since all of the ED patients exhibited emotional difficulties, techniques designed to enhance emotional recognition are vital for successful treatment. As difficulties become more acute as the disorder progresses, the treatment of adolescent patients must entail early therapeutic interventions designed to arrest further deterioration. In terms of ToM, the results suggest difficulties in social cognition can neither be generalized to all AN patients nor to those suffering from severe malnutrition. In long-term patients mentalization was slightly low and apparently poorly associated to difficulties in therapeutic link. These results do not lend support to the hypothesis that AN patients share the characteristics of patients affected by autistic spectrum disorders, at least not in terms of all the dimensions of ToM. These, and other controversial fmdings in the social cognition of EDs suggest that difficulties in mentalization cannot be generalized to all ED patients, which underscores the need for further research on the differential characteristics of AN patients with ToM disorders that goes beyond the emotional difficulties observed.

AB This study examined the relationship between school adjustment and emotional engagement in late childhood. Participants were Grade 5 and 6 Japanese children (N = 304; 164 boys, 200 girls). The School Liking and Avoidance Questionnaire (SLAQ) was used to measure children's emotional adjustment to school. The School Adjustment Scale, which was used to assess emotional engagement, consists of four factors: "friendships," "school work," "teacher-child relationships," and " school in general." The last factor was used to measure school belonging.

TI Relational Victimization, Loneliness and Depressive Symptoms: Indirect

AB Theory suggests that aversive social experiences generate emotional maladjustment because they prompt the development of a hypersensitivity to perceiving and overreacting to rejection. The primary aim of this study was to test hypothesized direct and indirect (via rejection sensitivity) links of overt/relational victimization and friendship conflict with early adolescents' loneliness and depressive symptoms. Participants were 366 Australian early adolescents age 10-14 years (50.5% girls). Using both a self-report and peer-report measure of rejection sensitivity, no difference was found when comparing the significant correlations of each measure with loneliness and depressive symptoms. Tests of direct and indirect associations with structural equation modeling showed that adolescents higher in relational victimization reported more loneliness and depressive symptoms and part of this association was by way of their greater self-reports of rejection sensitivity and their peers' identification that they were higher in rejection sensitivity. Additionally, relational victimization was the only unique correlate of emotional maladjustment, and adolescents who reported more overt victimization were identified by their peers as higher in rejection sensitivity. Finally, gender and rejection sensitivity were tested as moderators. No gender moderation was found, but friendship conflict was associated more strongly with emotional maladjustment for adolescents low, rather than high, in rejection sensitivity. These findings identify relational victimization as particularly salient for emotional maladjustment both directly and indirectly via links with elevated rejection sensitivity. They show how rejection sensitivity and aversive experiences may contribute independently and jointly to emotional maladjustment for both boys and girls.

AB This longitudinal study investigated the links between adolescents' perceptions of attachment security in their relationships with their mothers and fathers and developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms in a community sample of 414 adolescents (45% males). The participants were followed annually from age 11 (end of elementary school) to 16 (end of high school). Group-based trajectory modeling analyses conditional on risk and protective factors identified four trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence: moderate stable (MS; 54.57% of the sample), low stable (LS; 27.16%), moderate increasing (MI; 11.30%), and high declining (HD; 6.97%). Membership in the HD versus LS trajectory group was predicted by attachment security to both the mother and father at baseline (age 11), whereas attachment security to the mother increased the odds of belonging to the MS and MI groups. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for gender, anxiety symptoms, and academic competence. The findings are discussed with respect to their contribution to attachment theory and the research on the complementary contributions of mothers and fathers to the prevention of depressive symptomatology during adolescence.

AB Parenting is often implicated as a potential source of individual differences in youths' emotional information processing. The present study examined whether parental affect is related to an important aspect of adolescent emotional development, response to peer evaluation. Specifically, we examined relations between maternal negative affect, observed during parent-adolescent discussion of an adolescent-nominated concern with which s/he wants parental support, and adolescent neural responses to peer evaluation in 40 emotionally healthy and depressed adolescents. We focused on a network of ventral brain regions involved in affective processing of social information: the amygdala, anterior insula, nucleus accumbens, and subgenual anterior cingulate, as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Maternal negative affect was not associated with adolescent neural response to peer rejection. However, longer durations of maternal negative affect were associated with decreased responsivity to peer acceptance in the amygdala, left anterior insula, subgenual anterior cingulate, and left nucleus accumbens. These findings provide some of the first evidence that maternal negative affect is associated with adolescents' neural processing of social rewards. Findings also suggest that maternal negative affect could contribute to alterations in affective processing, specifically, dampening the saliency and/or reward of peer interactions during adolescence.

AB Aims
   To explore the relationship among perceived family functioning, emotional competence and suicidal ideation and to examine the moderating role of emotional competence in suicidal ideation.
   Background
   Previous studies have highlighted that poor family relationships and emotional symptoms are significant predictors of suicidal ideation. However, the roles of perceived family functioning and emotional competence in predicting suicidal ideation have not been given adequate attention.
   Design
   A cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling.
   Method
   A questionnaire was administered to 302 university students from February-April in 2011 in Hong Kong. The means, standard deviations and Cronbach's alphas of the variables were computed. Pearson correlation analyses and hierarchical regression analyses were performed.
   Results
   Hierarchical regression analyses showed that perceived high family functioning and emotional competence were significant negative predictors of suicidal ideation. Further analyses showed that parental concern, parental control and creative use of emotions were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. Emotional competence, specifically creative use of emotions, was found to moderate the relationship between perceived family functioning and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion
   The findings support the family ecological framework and provide evidence for emotional competence as a resilience factor that buffers low family functioning on suicidal ideation. Suggested measures to decrease suicidal ideation include enhancing parental concern, lessening parental control, developing students' awareness, regulation and management of their own emotions, fostering empathy towards others' emotional expression, enhancing social skills in sharing and influencing others' emotions and increasing the positive use of emotions for the evaluation and generation of new ideas.

AB Background: Studies about changes in the prevalence of emotional and behaviour problems across time are lacking, especially among younger children. Aim: To determine if the level of parent-reported emotional and behaviour problems and competencies in young Norwegian school children had changed across a 16-year time interval. Methods: We compared parent reports obtained by the Child Behavior Checklist in two samples of children aged 7-9 years from the general population assessed in 1991 and 2007. Results: The results demonstrated overall stability or slight decreases of emotional and behaviour problems and a significant increase in competencies, mainly due to increased activity and social competence scores in the 2007 sample. Boys obtained higher scores than girls in Total Problems, Externalizing and Attention problems at both time points and there was a high stability of the rank order of items. Conclusions: The findings suggest stability in child emotional and behaviour problems, and an increase of competencies across the period.

AB Background and aim: The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for significant changes in emotional and behavioural problem load in a community-based cohort of Danish children aged 9-16 years, the risk factors being seven parental and two child-related adverse life events. Methods: Data on emotional and behavioural problems was obtained from parents filling in the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) when the child was 8-9 and again when 15 years old. Data on risk factors was drawn from Danish registers. Analysis used was logistic regression for crude and adjusted change. Results: Parental divorce significantly raised the odds ratio of an increase in emotional and behavioural problems; furthermore, the risk of deterioration in problem behaviour rose significantly with increasing number of adverse life events. By dividing the children into four groups based on the pathway in problem load (increasers, decreasers, high persisters and low persisters), we found that children with a consistently high level of behavioural problems also had the highest number of adverse life events compared with any other group. Conclusions: Family break-up was found to be a significant risk factor. This supports findings in previous studies. The fact that no other risk factor proved to be of significance might be due to lack of power in the study. Children experiencing high levels of adverse life events are at high risk of chronic problem behaviour. Thus these risk factors should be assessed in daily clinical practice.

AB Studies on the efficacy of parent training programs have mostly been conducted with preadolescents, with only a few studies investigating family treatment models in adolescents. In this article, a study is described that evaluates Standard Teen Triple P (Positive Parenting Program), a behavioural family intervention for parents of 11- to 16-year-old teenagers. Participants were 46 families with a teenager who was experiencing detectable behavioural and emotional problems. Compared to parents in the waitlist control condition, parents participating in the intervention condition reported decreased levels of teen disruptive behaviours and parent adolescent conflict, as well as a reduction in the use of ineffective parenting strategies and conflict over child-rearing issues. These positive changes were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Results suggest that Standard Teen Triple P is a promising parenting intervention for tackling adolescent externalising problems.

AB Objective: This study investigated adolescent and caregiver reports of ADHD symptoms in a sample of clinically referred inner-city adolescents. Method: Participants (N = 168) included youth ages 12-18 (54% male, 98% ethnic minority) and their caregivers who each completed diagnostic interviews of ADHD symptoms and assessments of perceived need for ADHD treatment and correlated behavior problems. Results: Informants showed poor agreement on DSM-IV diagnostic categories and also dimensional scales, Inattention/Disorganization (I/D) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (H/I). Both caregiver and adolescent reports of I/D symptoms, but not H/I symptoms, were related to perceived need for ADHD treatment. Caregiver reports were linked to behavioral correlates typically associated with ADHD: I/D symptoms correlated with planning/organization and socioemotional deficits, and H/I symptoms correlated with externalizing and behavior regulation deficits. In contrast, adolescent reports of I/D were related to internalizing and externalizing problems, and their reports of H/I correlated with externalizing only. Few gender effects were found. Conclusion: Study results underscore the developmental salience of I/D symptoms and have implications for ADHD diagnosis and treatment planning for adolescents.

It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with various difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multi-modal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; child abuse and neglect; conduct problems (including childhood behavioural difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, delinquency and drug misuse); emotional problems (including anxiety, depression, grief, bipolar disorder and self-harm); eating disorders (including anorexia, bulimia and obesity); somatic problems (including enuresis, encopresis, medically unexplained symptoms and poorly controlled asthma and diabetes) and first episode psychosis.

AB This study examined the relationship between Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) participation with treatment engagement, retention, and satisfaction, and with substance use and emotional problem outcomes. Participants had substance use disorders (SUD) only or co-occurring substance use and psychiatric problems. Those with co-occurring problems reported more days of substance use and emotional problems at intake to treatment than those with SUD only. All groups received equivalent exposure to A-CRA during treatment implementation. At the 12-month follow-up, adolescents classified as externalizers (n = 468) or those with both externalizing and internalizing problems (n = 674) had significantly greater improvement in their days of abstinence and substance problems relative to adolescents with substance use disorders only (n = 666). Additionally, adolescents reporting symptoms of internalizing (n = 154), externalizing, or both externalizing and internalizing disorders had significantly greater improvements in days of emotional problems relative to adolescents with SUD only.

AB Stress has been hypothesised to be involved in obesity development, also in children. More research is needed into the role of lifestyle factors in this association.
   This study investigates the cross-sectional relationship between stress and body composition and, more importantly, the possible moderating or mediating role of lifestyle factors.
   A total of 355 Belgian children (5-10 years old) participating in the baseline 'Children's Body composition and Stress' survey were included in this study. The following variables were studied: psychosocial stress (i.e. stressful events, emotions and behavioural/emotional problems, salivary cortisol), stress-related lifestyle factors (high-caloric snack consumption frequency, screen exposure time and sleep duration) and body composition parameters [BMI z-score, waist to height ratio (WHtR)]. Using linear regression analyses (adjusted for sex, age and socio-economic status), the relation between stress and body composition and, more importantly, the possible moderating or mediating role of lifestyle factors was tested.
   No association was observed between body composition and negative emotions, conduct and emotional problems and salivary cortisol. However, negative life events were positively and happiness was negatively associated with BMI z-score and WHtR. Peer problems and WHtR were positively associated in girls only. These associations were not significantly reduced after correction for lifestyle factors. Nevertheless, all lifestyle parameters moderated one or more stress-body composition associations, resulting in even more significant relations after subgroup analysis.
   Childhood stress was positively related to both overall and central adiposity measures with lifestyle factors acting as moderators but not as mediators. Thus, lifestyle could be a vulnerability factor in stress-induced adiposity, creating a perspective for multi-factorial obesity prevention, targeting stress and lifestyle factors in parallel.

AB OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the role of emotion regulation in the relation between parental rejection and emotional eating of obese youngsters.
   METHOD: Participants were 110 obese youngsters between the ages of 10 and 16 years who were referred to a Belgian treatment centre for obesity. Participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal and paternal rejection, emotion regulation strategies and emotional eating during their intake at the treatment centre. Bootstrapping procedure was used to test if emotion regulation mediated the relationship between maternal and paternal rejection on the one hand and emotional eating of the youngster on the other hand.
   RESULTS: Results revealed that the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the relation between maternal rejection and emotional eating. Paternal rejection was neither associated with the emotion regulation nor with the emotional eating of the youngster.
   DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the importance of assessing the emotional bond between mother and child and the emotion regulation of the youngster in the treatment of pediatric obesity.

AB Several survey studies among adolescents have shown increasing rates of depressive symptoms over the last two to three decades. We know however little about mechanisms that might explain this increase. The present study uses data from three nationwide representative surveys of 16-17 year-old Norwegian adolescents that were conducted according to identical procedures in 1992, 2002, and 2010 (response rates 97.0, 91.0, 84.3 %, respectively). At each time point, approximately 3,000 adolescents participated (48.8 % girls and 51.2 % boys). Questionnaire data on depressive symptoms and a variety of potential risk and protective factors that might explain time trends in such symptoms were assessed at all time points. The results showed that the prevalence of high scores on depressive symptoms increased significantly between 1992 and 2002 among both boys and girls. No significant changes were observed between 2002 and 2010. The increase from 1992 to 2002 among girls and boys could be partially attributed to increases in eating problems and cannabis use, while reduced satisfaction with own appearance among girls contributed as well. Although the study does not provide information about the causal direction between putative risk factors and depressive symptoms, the results provide some indication that eating problems, cannabis use, and appearance related factors may contribute in explaining secular trends in depressive symptoms.

AB The transition into adolescence involves a number of changes that for many adolescents result in increased negative affect and internalizing symptoms, especially for females. In the current study we examined the direct and indirect effects of emotional awareness on internalizing symptoms by exploring the extent to which certain emotion regulation strategies influence this relationship. Participants were 123 female adolescents aged 13-16 years (M = 14.51 years) who completed measures of emotional awareness, emotion regulation (emotional reappraisal and expressive suppression), and symptoms of depression and social anxiety. Two multiple indirect effect models were conducted including both reappraisal and suppression (one for each of the dependent variables, depression and social anxiety) via the bootstrapping method. Results found that reappraisal accounted for the effect of emotional awareness on depressive symptoms but suppression accounted for the effect of emotional awareness on social anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that emotion regulation strategies play an important role in determining depressive and social anxiety symptoms and are associated with an adolescent's level of emotional awareness.

AB Objective
   While major theories of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) emphasize the behavior's role in emotion regulation, little is known about the daily emotional experiences of self-injurers. This study investigated the specific emotions that are characteristic of those who engage in NSSI.
   Method
   University students (n = 84) with either no history or a recent history of NSSI completed daily diary and retrospective measures of emotional experience. To evaluate generalizability of findings, the retrospective measure was also administered to a diverse sample of U.S. adults (n = 92) with and without histories of NSSI.
   Results
   Results indicate that self-injurers experience greater negative emotionality, particularly self-dissatisfaction, compared to individuals with no NSSI history. Self-injurers also reported less positive emotion, but these effects were smaller. The pattern of results was similar when controlling for Axis I psychopathology and borderline personality disorder symptoms.
   Conclusions
   Individuals who engage in NSSI experience more negative emotions, generally, and more self-dissatisfaction, specifically. Findings contribute to the growing literature on the role of emotion in the etiology and functions of NSSI.

AB Mentoring programs rely on adult volunteers to offer disadvantaged children friendship, role modeling, and insight into the way others relate. However, with the increasing numbers of children requiring mentors, programs are finding it difficult to attract enough volunteers. This study investigates (a) community awareness of an Australian youth mentoring program, (b) the proportion of the population who would consider becoming a mentor in future, and (c) whether those who would consider it differ significantly in their psychological characteristics. While awareness of the program is low, consideration of mentoring is relatively high. Those who would consider volunteering for the program have distinct psychological characteristics, indicating that customized marketing strategies are likely to be effective in attracting them. Findings demonstrate the potential for marketing techniques to be used effectively in the youth mentoring arena and give practical guidance as to how effective campaigns could boost numbers of mentors.

A recent population-based study reports that suicide in acne is related to the psychosocial burden of substantial acne, rather than medication effects. As suicidality is not always directly related to acne severity, factors other than acne's direct psychosocial burden also likely contribute to the suicide risk. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of childhood and adolescence that is associated with increased suicidality. We examined the frequency of ADHD in acne versus all other dermatology-related patient visits, after controlling for age and other factors. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study of epidemiologic databases (NAMCS and NHAMCS) representing 55 825 dermatology outpatient visits from 1995 to 2009. Results: In comparison to other dermatologic disorders, acne was over two times more likely to be associated with ADHD (odds ratio = 2.34, 95%CI 1.06-5.14) after controlling for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, stimulant medications, comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and atopic dermatitis, a condition previously associated with ADHD. Discussion: Our preliminary findings suggest a significant association of acne with ADHD, which could contribute to the increased psychological morbidity and suicidality in some acne patients.

TI Associations of Housing Mobility Interventions for Children in
   High-Poverty Neighborhoods With Subsequent Mental Disorders During
   Adolescence
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

DT Article
ID OPPORTUNITY; PREVALENCE; SAMPLE; YOUTH
AB IMPORTANCE Youth in high-poverty neighborhoods have high rates of emotional problems. Understanding neighborhood influences on mental health is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To perform an exploratory analysis of associations between housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Moving to Opportunity Demonstration from 1994 to 1998 randomized 4604 volunteer public housing families with 3689 children in high-poverty neighborhoods into 1 of 2 housing mobility intervention groups (a low-poverty voucher group vs a traditional voucher group) or a control group. The low-poverty voucher group (n=1430) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods with enhanced mobility counseling. The traditional voucher group (n=1081) received geographically unrestricted vouchers. Controls (n=1178) received no intervention. Follow-up evaluation was performed 10 to 15 years later (June 2008-April 2010) with participants aged 13 to 19 years (0-8 years at randomization). Response rates were 86.9% to 92.9%.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of mental disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) within the past 12 months, including major depressive disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional-defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and conduct disorder, as assessed post hoc with a validated diagnostic interview.
   RESULTS Of the 3689 adolescents randomized, 2872 were interviewed (1407 boys and 1465 girls). Compared with the control group, boys in the low-poverty voucher group had significantly increased rates of major depression (7.1% vs 3.5%; odds ratio (OR), 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]), PTSD (6.2% vs 1.9%; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.4]), and conduct disorder (6.4% vs 2.1%; OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.7-5.8]). Boys in the traditional voucher group had increased rates of PTSD compared with the control group (4.9% vs 1.9%, OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.2-5.8]). However, compared with the control group, girls in the traditional voucher group had decreased rates of major depression (6.5% vs 10.9%; OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9]) and conduct disorder (0.3% vs 2.9%; OR, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.4]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Interventions to encourage moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with increased rates of depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced rates of depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes.

AB A number of theorists, as well as plain common sense, suggest that future-oriented thinking (FOT) should be involved in decision making; therefore, the development of FOT should be related to better quality decision making. FOT and quality of the decision making were measured in adolescents as well as adults in 2 different experiments. Though the results of the first experiment revealed an increase in quality of decision making across adolescence into adulthood, there was no relationship between FOT and decision making. In the second experiment, FOT predicted performance on a more deliberative decision-making task independent of age, but not performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Performance on the IGT was instead related to emotion regulation. The study's findings suggest that FOT can be related to reflective decision making but not necessarily decision making that is more intuitive.

SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION POLICY

DE critical analysis; state
ID CHARACTER EDUCATION; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; EMOTIONAL ASPECTS; CURRICULUM;
   BEHAVIOR; YOUTH
AB Resilience' has become a popular goal in research, social policy, intervention design and implementation. Reinforced by its conceptual and political slipperiness, resilience has become a key construct in school-based, universal interventions that aim to develop it as part of social and emotional competence or emotional well-being. Drawing on a case study of a popular behavioural programme used widely in British and American primary schools, this paper uses a critical social understanding that combines bio-scientific and social constructionist ideas in order to evaluate key challenges for policy, research and practice framed around resilience. The paper argues that although critical social perspectives illuminate important contemporary manifestations of old problems with behavioural interventions, and challenge narrow, moralising definitions of risk' and vulnerability', they coalesce with behavioural perspectives in a search for better state-sponsored responses to the shared question of how to build resilience amongst vulnerable' groups and individuals. Instead, we argue that critical sociologists need to resist responses that offer more sophisticated behavioural interventions and generate new forms of governance and subjectivity.

AB The first aim of this study was to test whether immigrant adolescents are more prone to psychological and socio-cultural adaptation problems than their national Australian peers. The second aim of the study was to profile the socio-demographic factors underlying adaptation problems. The study utilised stratified surveys conducted by the New South Wales Ministry of Health during the years 2005-2008. The surveys collected information on socio-demographics, psychological problems (i.e. emotional problems), and socio-cultural problems (i.e. peer problems and conduct problems) where parents/caregivers acted as proxies to their 11-15 year old adolescents (n = 638 immigrant adolescents, n = 5054 nationals). Logistic regression analyses, taking observations' weights into account, were used for the adaptation problems outcomes. The two groups did not differ in their psychological and socio-cultural adaptation problems. Adolescents' sex was associated with emotional problems and conduct problems among national adolescents. In addition, mothers' education was associated with conduct problems and household income was associated with peer problems among national adolescents. In conclusion, this study shows that immigrant adolescents do not seem maladaptive. In addition, certain socio-demographic factors play a differential role in the emergence of adaptation problems among immigrant and national adolescents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MAJOR DEPRESSION; PSYCHOTHERAPY; RELAXATION; PREVENTION; TRIAL
AB Since the 1980's cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been developed and tested with adolescents experiencing depression. Early studies demonstrated that CBT was more effective than no intervention for young people with depressive symptoms. Beginning in the 1990's CBT has been proven to be efficacious for adolescents with diagnosed depressive disorders, specifically Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). A series of increasingly challenging and methodologically rigorous trials showed that CBT was an effective intervention for mild to moderate MDD, and enhanced the benefits of anti-depressant medication, even for those adolescents who had already failed to respond to an initial medication. Simultaneously, some limitations of CBT were suggested by these studies. Results of CBT alone were not encouraging with severely depressed adolescents, and the combination of CBT plus medication was not uniformly supported. As CBT investigators worked with more challenging, complex clinical cases, such as depressed adolescents who were abusing substances or engaging in suicidal or self-harm behaviors, standard components of CBT were augmented by increased emphasis placed on emotion regulation, safety planning, and by more intensive outpatient treatment models. Newer developments include "third wave'' models, which have shown initial promise.

AB Application of mindfulness based interventions for youth is growing exponentially within clinical and educational settings. Proponents emphasize benefits in reduction of a wide range of psychopathology including internalizing and externalizing disorders, as well as enhancement of functioning and skills in attentional focus and concentration, emotion regulation, social and academic performance, adaptive coping, frustration tolerance, self-control, and self-esteem. Findings to date are encouraging, though research design reflects the nascent nature of the field and continues to be insufficient to confirm treatment efficacy or mechanisms of change. This article is aimed at providing the clinical practitioner with a review of the current state of the field with regard to application of mindfulness for youth, placing it in context of the broader history of the CBT movement. Specifically mindfulness based stress reduction, mindfulness based cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy treatments for youth are critically reviewed, and mindfulness as a technique and as a unifying mechanism of action in "third-wave'' youth psychotherapies discussed. Developmental considerations are highlighted, and the application of mindfulness as a universal preventative health measure versus tertiary treatment intervention examined, with consideration for future directions.

AB Background: Emotion-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (ECBT) is a new form of CBT with emotion regulation components. This form of treatment is suggested to be employed to improve dysregulation of anxiety and other kind of emotions in anxious children. This study observed and compared the effectiveness of CBT and ECBT on anxiety symptoms; sadness and anger management; and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in children with separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Materials and Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial. Subjects were 30 children from 9 to 13-years-old (15 girls and 15 boys) with diagnosis of SAD, being randomly assigned to CBT, ECBT, and control groups (five girls and five boys in each group). Subject children in CBT group participated in 10-h weekly sessions within Coping Cat manual; whereas, subject children in ECBT group contributed in 12-h weekly sessions within ECBT. The control group received no treatment. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED; child and parent forms), Children's Emotion Management Scale (CEMS; anger and sadness forms), and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) tests administered to all subjects in pretest, posttest, and the follow-up measurement (3 months later). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) repeated measure and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to analyze data by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software package (v. 20). Results: CBT and ECBT; demonstrated no significant difference in reducing separation anxiety and total anxiety symptoms from parent and children's reports. ECBT effectively increased anger coping and decreased negative cognitive strategies and dysregulation of anger in children, both in posttest and follow-up. Also, ECBT reduced sadness dysregulation and increased sadness coping, though these significant advantages were lost in 3 months later follow-up. CBT reduced negative cognitive strategies in follow-up and increased sadness coping in posttest. None of treatments affected on anger and sadness inhibition and positive cognitive coping in separation anxious children. Conclusion: ECBT, in comparison with CBT; effectively improved emotion regulation strategies in children with separation anxiety.

This mode of therapy addresses maladaptive behavior by teaching emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, core mindfulness, and self-management skills.
   Methods: This paper reviewed DBT treatment for anger and aggressive or violent behavior. The literature search included articles from 1998 to September 2013. A total of 21 peer-reviewed articles studying the effects of DBT on anger and aggressive behavior were reviewed.
   Results: Adaptations or modifications were made to standard DBT to accommodate the specific needs of the variety of populations across studies. Nine studies attempted to understand the efficacy of DBT for anger and aggressive behavior while twelve studies measured the efficacy of DBT within the context of a BPD diagnosis. There are nine randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing DBT to reduce anger and aggressive behavior.
   Conclusion: Research has shown that there are potentially clinically significant results when using DBT to treat anger and aggression in various samples. Findings from this review suggest that treatments, even when modified show a positive impact on the reduction of anger and aggressive behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the relationship between parent support and peer support as predictors of depression and self-esteem in college students. Several competing models of parental and peer influence were compared including a mediational model in which peer support was hypothesized to mediate the effects of parental support on adjustment. The results supported a model of mutual influence in which both parental support and peer support contributed equally to adjustment, and a mediational model in which peer support mediated the effect of parental support. Both of these models were tested using student self-reports of the measured constructs. To further validate the mediational model, mother-reported parental support was used in place of student-reported parental support; this mixed-reporter mediational model was not supported. Further investigation reaffirmed the existence of complexities in evaluating internal working models from an outsider's perspective. Gender effects were modest and indicated differences in symptomatology, but not in supportive relationships. Multiple factors affect attachment in college students, including contact and residential status. Campus policies and services that promote support from parents may improve the transition to college and student adjustment.

AB The protective role of strength of group identity was examined for youth in a context of protracted political conflict. Participants included 814 adolescents (M-age=13.61, SD=1.99 at Time 1) participating in a longitudinal study in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, the results show that the effect of exposure to sectarian antisocial behaviors has a stronger effect on youth emotion problems for older adolescents. The results also show that youth with higher strength of group identity reported fewer emotion problems in the face of sectarian antisocial behavior but that this buffering effect is stronger for Protestants compared to Catholics. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of social identity in postaccord societies.

AB ObjectivesThis study explored how cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, and facets of ruminative thinking could be brought together in a model to explain non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in the context of experiencing stressful life events and psychological distress.
   MethodsData from 2,507 participants aged 12-18years (68% female, mean age 13.93years) recruited from 40 Australian secondary schools were analysed, including 254 participants with a history of NSSI (72% female, mean age 14.21years). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing the constructs of interest.
   ResultsAlthough meeting minimum fit indices, our hypothesized model showed poorer fit compared to an empirically derived model. There was little evidence for the mediating role of psychological distress in NSSI, and we found adverse life events, psychological distress, emotion regulation, and two facets of ruminative thinking (counterfactual thinking and anticipatory thoughts) had direct, though weak, relationships with NSSI. Among the subsample of adolescents with a history of NSSI, anticipatory rumination moderated the relationship between psychological distress and NSSI, while cognitive reappraisal demonstrated a direct, although weak relationship with NSSI.
   ConclusionsOur observations suggest that, among adolescents, contextual, social, and behavioural factors may have a strong influence on NSSI and this may suggest that prevention and treatment efforts for NSSI among adolescents need to focus on contextual, social, and behavioural factors.
   Practitioner points Emotion regulation and repetitively dwelling on current problems and concerns are implicated in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) only to the extent they increase or reduce the experience of psychological distress. Prevention and treatment efforts for NSSI among adolescents would be better focused on contextual, social, and behavioural factors than cognitive factors. The cross-sectional nature of the research suggests interpretations regarding the influence of these psychological factors on NSSI can only be speculative and further research is warranted to establish causality. Replication with a larger, more representative sample is warranted.

AB In this article, we address how and why parent-child attachment is related to anxiety in children. Children who do not form secure attachments to caregivers risk developing anxiety or other internalizing problems. While meta-analyses yield different findings regarding which insecurely attached children are at greatest risk, our recent studies suggest that disorganized children may be most at risk. Insecure attachment itself may contribute to anxiety, but insecurely attached children also are more likely to have difficulties regulating emotions and interacting competently with peers, which may further contribute to anxiety. Clinical disorders occur primarily when insecure attachment combines with other risk factors. In this article, we present a model of factors related to developing anxiety.

AB Social cognition matures dramatically during adolescence and into early adulthood, supported by continued improvements in inhibitory control. During this time, developmental changes in interpreting and responding to social signals such as facial expressions also occur. In the present study, subjects performed a Go No-Go task that required them to respond or inhibit responding based on threat or safety cues present in facial expressions. Subjects (N = 112) were divided into three age groups: adolescent (12-15years), emerging adult (18-25years) and adult (26-44years). Analyses revealed a significant improvement in accuracy on No-Go trials, but not Go trials, during both safe and threat face conditions, with changes evident through early adulthood. In order to better identify the decision-making processes responsible for these changes in inhibitory control, a drift diffusion model (DDM) was fit to the accuracy and reaction time data, generating measures of caution, response bias, nondecision time (encoding + motor response), and drift rate (face processing efficiency). Caution and nondecision time both increased significantly with age while bias towards the Go response decreased. Drift rate analyses revealed significant age-related improvements in the ability to map threat faces to a No-Go response while drift rates on all other trial types were equivalent across age groups. These results suggest that both stimulus-independent and stimulus-dependent processes contribute to improvements in inhibitory control in adolescence with processing of negative social cues being specifically impaired by self-regulatory demands. Findings from this novel investigation of emotional responsiveness integrated with inhibitory control may provide useful insights about healthy development that can be applied to better understand adolescent risk-taking behavior and the elevated incidence of related forms of psychopathology during this period of life.

AB Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder characterized by severe pain episodes or "vaso-occlusive crises" that may require hospitalization. This study examined the associations among emotion regulation, somatization, positive and negative affect, and hospitalizations for pain crises in youth with sickle-cell disease. Multivariate analyses indicated that emotional suppression and somatization were significantly associated with more frequent hospitalizations for pain crises in the previous year after controlling for sickle-cell disease type and pain. These results suggest that efforts to reduce emotional suppression and somatization may assist in decreasing the frequency of hospitalizations for pain crises among youth with sickle-cell disease.

AB Objective: The purpose is to determine some clinical features of self-injurious behavior, family functions and self-esteem in self-injurious adolescents in comparison to a control group. Apart from that, one purpose is to evaluate the relationships between self-esteem and some clinical features regarding self-injurious behavior in the case group. Methods: A group of 70 adolescents with self-injurious behavior who admitted to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic were included in the study as well as another group of 70 adolescents with similar age and gender distribution to the case group who does not have self-injurious behavior. Self-injurious behavior information form, Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale and Family Assessment Device are applied to both the case and control groups. Results: The present study suggests that low self-esteem, unhealthy family functions and smoking are independent risk factors for self-injurious behavior. It has been found out that the adolescents who injure themselves more frequently and more seriously in the case group have lower self esteem. It has been found out that the presence of self-injurious family member or friend does not create a significant difference in the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale total point average of the adolescents in the case group. Besides, it has been revealed that alcohol consumption and smoking in the adolescents in the case group do not create a significant difference in the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale total point averages. Discussion: There is a need for studies that assess the main factors related to the association of self-injurious behavior with smoking and self-esteem, and that determine the direction of causality between them. In our study, the findings that are related to family functions seem to suggest that self-injurious behavior in adolescents might be related to unhealthy family environment. This finding shows the importance of assessing family functions along with the characteristics of the adolescent and the family.

AB Relative to children and adults, adolescents are highly focused on being evaluated by peers. This increased attention to peer evaluation has implications for emotion regulation in adolescence, but little is known about the characteristics of the evaluatee and evaluator that influence emotional reactions to evaluative outcomes. The present study used a computer-based social evaluation task to examine predictors of adolescents' emotional responses to feedback from unknown peers. Nine-to-seventeen-year-olds (N = 36) completed the "chatroom task" and indicated the degree to which each peer would be interested in interacting with them and how good they felt after receiving acceptance and rejection feedback from peers. We examined whether adolescents' age and gender impacted their emotional responses to being accepted or rejected by peers of different age groups (i.e., early or middle adolescence) and genders. We also tested whether expectations about peers' interest was associated with variability in adolescents' emotional responses to the evaluative outcome. Upon being accepted by middle adolescent male peers, females in the middle relative to early years of adolescence reported greater well-being, whereas males reported similar levels of well-being regardless of their own age. Following acceptance from middle adolescent female peers, females reported greater well-being than males. Adolescents with high expectations for being liked by peers felt better after being accepted versus rejected relative to those with low expectations. For adolescents with low expectations, acceptance and rejection were associated with similar levels of well-being. Adolescents' emotional responses to peer evaluation are influenced by specific individual characteristics and antecedent preparation for evaluation that may serve an emotion regulatory purpose.

This study was designed to extend understanding of children's judgment of the efficacy of alternative emotion regulation strategies. Children aged six and nine (N = 97) were presented with illustrated storyboards of anger- and sadness-evoking situations and rated the effectiveness of eight emotion regulation strategies. Children endorsed some strategies on an emotion-specific basis: they rated problem-solving as more effective for anger, and seeking adult support and venting emotion as more effective for sadness. Younger children rated cognitively sophisticated emotion regulatory strategies comparably to older children, but they endorsed relatively ineffective strategies as more effective. Early evidence of gender differences was also apparent as girls reported emotion-focused strategies as more effective than boys did. These findings contribute to understanding children's nuanced estimates of the value of alternative strategies of emotion regulation based on emotion context, age, and gender.

AB Systematic screening is one strategy to enhance the early identification of behavioral and emotional problems among youth. Although conceptually sound, it is unclear if screening is more or less effective than current school identification practices in identifying youth with behavioral and emotional concerns. This study compares screening for behavioral and emotional risk with current identification practices in schools to determine differences among referral methods, across a sample of elementary aged students (N = 867). Results indicated that of the 160 students identified as at-risk by the screening measure, only 61 were previously identified through current school identification methods, highlighting the potential benefit of screening to enhance early identification. Results demonstrated internalizing and externalizing behaviors were significantly correlated with at-risk status by identification method. Furthermore, students identified as demonstrating behavioral and emotional concerns by both the screener and receiving school-based services had significantly lower academic achievement. Implications and future research needs are discussed.

AB As fathering gains increasing attention in parenting studies, the same instrument is always used to measure fathering and mothering concurrently and comparisons are made without prior establishment of measurement invariance. It is common that parenting scales possess different factor structures across different cultural settings. This study aimed to examine the factor structure, measurement invariance and latent mean differences of the Father/Mother Involvement Scale across adolescents' perceived paternal and maternal involvement and by adolescent gender. A random sample of 720 Malaysian high school adolescents (M-age=16 years; SD=0.16) was used in the current study. Initial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the original factor structure had inadequate fit in the current sample. Subsequent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) yielded a three-factor structure that demonstrated good fit in further CFAs. Multigroup CFA provided support for configural invariance, metric invariance and scalar invariance across adolescents' perceived paternal and maternal involvement and across adolescent gender. The latent factor mean comparisons showed that mothers were perceived to have higher expressive, instrumental and leisure/companionship involvement. Female adolescents perceived higher paternal expressive and instrumental involvement and maternal expressive, instrumental and leisure/companionship involvement than did male adolescents. These mean differences found at the latent level may reflect true differences. Taken together, the Father/Mother Involvement Scale is a sound measure of paternal and maternal involvement in Asian people, at least in Malaysian adolescents. The differences in factor structure may be attributable to sample variations in cultural background and/or family form.

AB Parents of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face specific challenges in parenting, but concrete parenting behavior has never been properly investigated in these families. This exploratory questionnaire study compared parenting behaviors among mothers of children and adolescents with ASD (n = 552) and without ASD (n = 437) and examined associations between child behavior problems and parenting behavior. Results showed that mothers of children with ASD reported significantly lower scores on Rules and Discipline and higher scores on Positive Parenting, Stimulating the Development, and Adapting the Environment. Age was differently related to parenting behavior in the ASD versus control group. Furthermore, distinctive correlation patterns between parenting behavior and externalizing or internalizing behavior problems were found for both groups.

AB Although daily hassles and coping are associated with behavior and emotional problems in non-clinical populations, few studies have investigated these relationships in individuals with high-functioning autism/Asperger's Disorder (HFASD). This study examined the relationships between daily hassles, coping and behavior and emotional problems in adolescents with HFASD. Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed questionnaires assessing their coping and behavior and emotional problems, and completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment run via a mobile phone application on their coping and daily hassles. Parents completed questionnaires of the adolescents' daily hassles, coping, and behavior and emotional problems. The disengagement coping style was associated with significantly higher levels of behavior and emotional problems regardless of respondent or methodology, suggesting it may be a valuable target for intervention.

AB Sleep problems are common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to the extent that they mimic or exacerbate daytime symptoms expression. In this review, we advocate the need for a better understanding of sleep alterations in youths with ADHD and their impact on neurobehavioral functions including learning, memory and emotional regulation. An in-depth exploration of existing data showed that although extensively studied, the actual nature of sleep problems in ADHD and their effects on daytime behavior are still less well understood. Important issues, among which developmental changes in sleep architecture and role of subtle sleep electroencephalogram signatures, are generally neglected. Future research of sleep effects on behavior in ADHD would benefit from considering developmental aspects and links between brain activation patterns during sleep and wake.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine differences in emotion expression and emotion regulation in emotion-eliciting situations in early adolescence from a bio-psycho-social perspective, specifically investigating the influence of early mother-infant attachment and attachment disorganization on behavioural and adrenocortical responses. The sample consisted of 96 children of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV. At age 12 months, attachment security and disorganization were assessed in the Strange Situation. At age 12 years, the adolescents were observed together with their mother during a computer game (eliciting anger) and the "Talk Show Task" (eliciting fear). Analyses included self-ratings and mother-ratings of the adolescents' emotions (anger and fear), observations of the adolescents' emotional expression and emotional regulation (social regulation, effective regulation) as well as concurrent maternal emotional support. In addition, adrenocortical activity was assessed from saliva samples before and after observation. The findings revealed different patterns of social-emotional responses depending on early attachment security. Adolescents with secure infant attachment reported more anger, when anger was induced, were rated as less anxious by their mothers, and their emotion self-ratings were more similar to their mothers' ratings compared to adolescents with an early insecure attachment. An increased adrenocortical response was only found in the group of adolescents with attachment disorganization in infancy, especially with increased fear.

AB Despite the growing research on emotion regulation, the empirical evidence for normative age-related emotion regulation patterns is rather divergent. From a life-span perspective, normative age changes in emotion regulation may be more salient applying the same methodological approach on a broad age range examining both growth and decline during development. In addition, emotion-specific developmental patterns might show differential developmental trends. The present study examined age differences in seven emotion regulation strategies from early adolescence (age 11) to middle adulthood (age 50) for the three emotions of sadness, fear, and anger. The results showed specific developmental changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies for each of the three emotions. In addition, results suggest age-specific increases and decreases in many emotion regulation strategies, with a general trend to increasing adaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, middle adolescence shows the smallest emotion regulation strategy repertoire. Gender differences appeared for most emotion regulation strategies. The findings suggest that the development of emotion regulation should be studied in an emotion-specific manner, as a perspective solely on general emotion regulation either under- or overestimates existing emotion-specific developmental changes.

AB Purpose: This study examined risk factors associated with recent substance use (SU) among perinatally human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (PHIV+) and perinatally exposed, uninfected (PHEU) youth and compared SU lifetime prevalence with the general population of United States (U.S.) adolescents.
   Methods: We conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of 511 PHIV+ and PHEU youth (mean age at study entry, 13.2 years; 51% female; 69% PHIV+; and 72% African-American) enrolled in a U.S. multisite prospective cohort study between 2007 and 2009. Substance use data were collected by audio computer-assisted self-interview. Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and Monitoring the Future data were used to compare SU lifetime prevalence with U.S. samples.
   Results: Perinatal HIV infection was not a statistically significant risk factor for alcohol or marijuana use. Risk factors for alcohol use among PHIV+ youth included higher severity of emotional and conduct problems and alcohol and marijuana use in the home by the caregiver or others. Risk factors for marijuana use among PHIV+ youth included marijuana use in the home, higher severity of conduct problems, and stressful life events. Similar SU risk factors among PHEU youth included SU in the home and higher severity of conduct and emotional problems. Overall lifetime prevalence of SU by age was similar to that in national surveys.
   Conclusions: Although SU lifetime prevalence and risk factors for PHIV+ and PHEU adolescents were similar to national norms, the negative consequences are potentially greater for PHIV+ youth. Prevention efforts should begin before SU initiation and address the family and social environment and youth mental health status. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Background: There is a burgeoning and varied literature examining the associations between parental factors and depression or anxiety disorders in young people. However, there is hitherto no systematic review of this complex literature with a focus on the 12-18 years age range, when the first onset for these disorders peaks. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the evidence in prevention, a focus on modifiable factors is required.
   Methods: Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of parental factors associated with depression and anxiety disorders in young people which parents can potentially modify.
   Results: We identified 181 articles altogether, with 140 examining depression, 17 examining anxiety problems, and 24 examining both outcomes. Stouffer's method of combining p values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable, and meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the mean effect sizes of associations between each parental factor and outcome.
   Limitations: Limitations include sacrificing micro-level detail for a macro-level synthesis of the literature, not systematically reviewing moderators and mediators, the lack of generalizability across cultures and to younger or adult children, and the inability to conduct a meta-analysis on all included studies.
   Conclusions: Parental factors with a sound evidence base indicating increased risk for both depression and anxiety include less warmth, more inter-parental conflict, over-involvement, and aversiveness; and for depression additionally, they include less autonomy granting and monitoring.

AB Objective: A substantial proportion of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also display emotion regulation deficits manifesting as chronic irritability, severe temper outbursts, and aggression. The amygdala is implicated in emotion regulation, but its connectivity and relation to emotion regulation in ADHD has yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of amygdala circuits and emotion regulation deficits in youth with ADHD. Method: Bilateral amygdala iFC was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 63 children with ADHD, aged 6 to 13 years. First, we examined the relationship between amygdala IFC and parent ratings of emotional lability (EL) in children with ADHD. Second, we compared amygdala iFC across subgroups of children with ADHD and high EL (n = 18), ADHD and low EL (n = 20), and typically developing children (TDC), all with low EL (n = 19). Results: Higher EL ratings were associated with greater positive iFC between the amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in youth with ADHD. EL scores were also negatively associated with iFC between bilateral amygdala and posterior insula/superior temporal gyms. Patterns of amygdala-cortical iFC in ADHD participants with low EL were not different from the comparison group, and the effect sizes for these comparisons were smaller than those for the trend-level differences observed between the high-EL and TDC groups. Conclusions: In children with ADHD and a range of EL, deficits in emotion regulation were associated with altered amygdala cortical iFC. When comparing groups that differed on ADHD status but not EL, differences in amygdala iFC were small and nonsignificant, highlighting the specificity of this finding to emotional deficits, independent of other ADHD symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the number and the pattern of latent classes based on online game time and to test the significant determinants of classes among the variables, such as sex, self-control, self-esteem, aggressiveness, emotion regulation, academic stress, academic motivation and social skills. In order to identify the latent classes, we applied Nagin's semiparametric, group-based approach to the four waves of longitudinal data from the Korean Youth Panel Study using SAS Macro. As a result, four latent classes emerged according to different patterns of change in game play time: the low group, the rising group, the declining group and the chronic group. As for the influential factors, the results of conducting a multinomial logit analysis indicated that all factors, except social skills, proved to be significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Of all the motives for drinking, drinking to cope is the strongest predictor of problematic alcohol use, particularly for adolescent and college-age drinkers, with limited work assessing predictors of drinking to cope for community adult samples. At least for young adults, drinking to cope is associated with heightened negative affect and may serve as a substitute for more adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The current study tested an indirect relationship between negative affect intensity, or the propensity to experience strong negative affect, and drinking to cope via difficulties in emotion regulation, using a multiple mediator model. The model was tested using bootstrapping estimates of indirect effects in a combined sample of 566 college students (M-age = 19.75%, 40.8% women) and 104 non-college student adults (M-age = 35.40%, 36.5% women). Results revealed that negative affect intensity indirectly predicted drinking to cope through lack of emotional clarity and limited emotional strategies, with no moderation by sample. Results indicate that problems in clearly identifying specific emotional experiences appear to be important in predicting drinking to cope for people who experience intense negative emotions, suggesting that treatment and prevention efforts focused on teaching emotional clarity and/or learning multiple regulation strategies may be important in reducing coping-motivated drinking.

AB Little is known about the potentially powerful set of emotion regulation (ER) processes that target emotion-eliciting situations. We thus studied the decision to end emotion-eliciting situations in the laboratory. We hypothesized that people would try to end negative situations more frequently than neutral situations to regulate distress. In addition, motivated by the selection, optimization, and compensation with ER framework, we hypothesized that failed attempts to end the situation would prompt either (a) greater negative emotion or (b) compensatory use of adifferent ER process, attentional deployment (AD). Fifty-eight participants (18-26 years old, 67% women) viewed negative and neutral pictures and pressed a key whenever they wished to stop viewing them. After key press, the picture disappeared ("success") or stayed ("failure") on screen. To index emotion, we measured corrugator and electrodermal activity, heart rate, and self-reported arousal. To index overt AD, we measured eye gaze. As their reason for ending the situation, participants more frequently reported being upset by high- than low-arousal negative pictures; they more frequently reported being bored by low- than high-arousal neutral pictures. Nevertheless, participants' negative emotional responding did not increase in the context of ER failure nor did they use overt AD as a compensatory ER strategy. We conclude that situation-targeted ER processes are used to regulate emotional responses to high-arousal negative and low-arousal neutral situations; ER processes other than overt AD may be used to compensate for ER failure in this context.

AB Background: The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems in a sample of school children living in Campania, a region of South Italy.
   Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Parent Report Form (PRF) and the CBCL Teacher Rating Form (TRF) were administered to parents and teachers of a sample of school children aged 8-9 yr.
   Results: The subjects (SS) eligible for the study were 3072. In 2137 (69.5%) cases parents returned the envelopes back. 1228 (57.4%) subjects were excluded because of lack of signed consensus, unfilled or incomplete forms. Parents reported children's behavioural or emotional Total Problems in 14.7% of the SS. (5.2% borderline, 9.5% clinical), Internalizing Problems in 18.5% (8.0% borderline, 10.5% clinical), and Externalizing Problems in 8.5% (3.8% borderline, 4.7% clinical) respectively. At the Competence Scale of CBCL more than 2/3 of the sample show high rate for Total Competence Problem (24.3% borderline, 47.3% clinical.) Teachers reported 8.7% of SS having Total Problems, (4.3% borderline, 4.4% clinical), Internalizing problems were detected in 13.3% of the sample (4.9% borderline and 8.4% clinical), while Externalizing problems were reported for 9.6% of SS (4.1% borderline and 5.5% clinical). In the sub-scale of Academic Performances teachers report a high number of subjects with problems, 18.7%, whose 4.3% had a "borderline" score, and 14.4% had a "clinical" score.
   Conclusion: Concerning Total Problems (clinical and borderline SS, 14.7% as reported by parents, 8.7% as reported by teachers) we obtained a prevalence similar to that reported in the rest of the country, with differences in gender (males 13.2%, females 16.0% as reported by parents; males 7.4%, females 9.7% as reported by teachers). The difficulties in social and relationship competencies area were higher (4/10 children). This datum should be cautiously evaluated because the possible inadequacy of CBCL competences scale.

AB Background: Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested an abnormal neural circuitry of emotion regulation including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in both adult and adolescent generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients. Aberrant integrity of white matter in this neural circuitry has been verified in adult GAD patients. White matter abnormalities in adolescent GAD patients have not been detected.
   Methods: Twenty-five adolescents with GAD and 24 healthy controls underwent a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was compared between groups with a voxel-wise Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis method.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, adolescents with GAD showed significantly reduced FA in bilateral uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and corona radiata.
   Conclusions: The findings in the present study suggest a neural basis of emotion dysregulation in adolescent GAD patients.

AB This study set out to establish the novel use of the go/no-go Overlap task for investigating the role of attentional control capacities in the processing of emotional expressions across different age-groups within adolescence: at the onset of adolescence (11-12 year-olds) and toward the end of adolescence (17-18 year-olds). We also looked at how attentional control in the processing of fearful, happy, and neutral expressions relates to individual differences in trait anxiety in these adolescent groups. We were able to show that younger adolescents, but not older adolescents had more difficulties with attention control in the presence of all faces, but particularly in the presence of fearful faces. Moreover, we found that across all groups, adolescents with higher trait anxiety exhibited attentional avoidance of all faces, which facilitated relatively better performance on the primary task. These differences in reaction time emerged in the context of comparable accuracy level in the primary task across age-groups. Our results contribute to our understanding of how attentional control abilities to faces but in particular fearful expressions may mature across adolescence. This may affect learning about the environment and the acquisition of behavioral response patterns in the social world.

AB Although compulsive hoarding may pose health, social, and developmental impairment for children, there are few phenomenological and treatment studies to guide assessment and treatment. Current evidence-based questions the link between hoarding and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy protocols for OCD to adequately address the unique challenges of poor insight, poor emotion regulation, and increased family accommodation in children with compulsive hoarding. This case study seeks to illustrate a family-based behavioral approach to outpatient treatment of compulsive hoarding with a 9-year-old girl (pseudonym Lily). Treatment included psychoeducation, exposure to discarding items, exposure to acquiring cues, and parent behavior management techniques.

AB This study utilizes a prospective design to examine the interaction of recent rape/attempted rape with individual differences in thought suppression on increases in disordered eating symptoms during late adolescence/emerging adulthood. Thought suppression is the attempt to suppress unwanted thoughts. We propose that emerging adult women who have experienced recent rape/attempted rape and tend to use thought suppression as a coping mechanism are at risk for increases in disordered eating. 319 women completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, the Sexual Experiences Survey, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the White Bear Thought Suppression Inventory in their first month of college and three months later. The experience of recent rape/attempted rape in the three months prior to the assessment accounted for unique variance in disordered eating at Time 2. Levels of thought suppression assessed at Time 1 significantly moderated the influence of recent rape/attempted rape on disordered eating at Time 2.

AB Theories of affective learning suggest that early experiences contribute to emotional disorders by influencing the development of processing biases for negative emotional stimuli. Although studies have shown that physically abused children preferentially attend to angry faces, it is unclear whether youth exposed to more typical aspects of negative parenting exhibit the same type of bias. The current studies extend previous research by linking observed negative parenting styles (e.g., authoritarian) and behaviors (e.g., criticism and negative affect) to attention bias for angry faces in both a psychiatrically enriched (ages 11-17 years; N = 60) and a general community (ages 9-15 years; N = 75) sample of youth. In addition, the association between observed negative parenting (e.g., authoritarian style and negative affect) and youth social anxiety was mediated by attention bias for angry faces in the general community sample. Overall, findings provide preliminary support for theories of affective learning and risk for psychopathology among youth.

AB Many students who exhibit behavioral and emotional problems during adolescence often show less severe problems in school in early grades. Screening for these early indicators can help educational professionals direct support to students who are more likely to benefit from increased support. The screening protocol needs to be psychometrically sound, accurate in identifying students at risk, and resource efficient. The present study explored the psychometric properties of a brief behavioral screener-the 10-item Emotional and Behavioral Screener (EBS)-for a sample of 5,109 first-grade students assessed as part of a universal screening process. Confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch measurement techniques were used in conjunction to evaluate the factorial validity, item quality, rating scale functioning, and measurement invariance across gender of the EBS. Results indicated that the EBS has largely strong psychometric properties, with a few notable exceptions: potential multidimensionality, significant differential item functioning across gender, and only moderate differentiation between rating-scale categories (i.e., response options). Limitations and directions for research to clarify some remaining questions about this screening procedure are also discussed.

AB Early motherhood is considered a risk factor for an adequate relationship between mother and infant and for the subsequent development of the infant. The principal aim of the study is to analyze micro-analytically the effect of motherhood in adolescence on the quality of mother-infant interaction and emotion regulation at three months, considering at the same time the effect of maternal attachment on these variables. Participants were 30 adolescent mother-infant dyads compared to 30 adult mother-infant dyads. At infant 3 months, mother-infant interaction was video-recorded and coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver Engagement Phases and the Adult Attachment Interview was administered to the mother. Analysis showed that adolescent mothers (vs. adult mothers) spent more time in negative engagement and their infants spent less time in positive engagement and more time in negative engagement. Adolescent mothers are also less involved in play with their infants than adult mothers. Adolescent mother-infant dyads (vs. adult mother-infant dyads) showed a greater duration of negative matches and spent less time in positive matches. Insecure adolescent mother-infant dyads (vs. insecure adult mother-infant dyads) demonstrated less involvement in play with objects and spent less time in positive matches. To sum up adolescent mother-infant dyads adopt styles of emotion regulation and interaction with objects which are less adequate than those of dyads with adult mothers. Insecure maternal attachment in dyads with adolescent mothers (vs. adult mother infant dyads) is more influential as risk factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The high degree of comorbidity among mental disorders has generated interest in identifying transdiagnostic processes associated with multiple types of psychopathology. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema conceptualized rumination as one such transdiagnostic process associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, binge eating, and self-injurious behavior. The degree to which rumination accounts for the co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, however, has never been tested. We used a sample of early adolescents (N = 1,065) assessed at 3 time points spanning 7 months to examine (a) the reciprocal prospective associations between rumination and aggressive behavior in adolescents, (b) whether rumination explained the longitudinal associations of aggressive behavior with depression and anxiety symptoms, and (c) gender differences in these associations. Rumination predicted increases over time in aggressive behavior, and aggression was associated with increases in rumination over time only for boys. Rumination fully mediated the longitudinal association of aggression with subsequent anxiety symptoms and of both depression and anxiety symptoms with subsequent aggression in boys but not girls. Rumination did not explain the association between aggression and subsequent depressive symptoms for either boys or girls. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of rumination as a transdiagnostic factor underlying transitions between internalizing and externalizing symptoms among males during early adolescence. Interventions aimed at reducing rumination may have beneficial influences on multiple forms of psychopathology and on the development of comorbidity.

AB Our review examines the current state of the research on hot executive function (EF), as contrasted with cool EF, with regard to the evidence for construct validity. Current theoretical discussions have examined the conceptual overlap among constructs such as hot EF, effortful control, self-control, and self-regulation. We explore this emerging literature with a focus on research questions, tasks, and methods. Finally, we consider the unresolved questions facing the study of hot EF, most notably the difficulty in determining the relative "heat" of a given task based on task content, testing context, and the individual differences among the participants.

AB The present study sought to investigate the relation between ethological observations of children's gaze aversion during a psychosocial stress task and their cortisol reactivity to the task, and how this relation might be moderated by how stressful the children perceived the stress task to be.
   Videos of 140 children (74 girls; M-age = 10.60 years) performing a psychosocial stress task in front of a jury were coded for displays of the children's gaze aversion from the jury, and saliva samples were taken to determine their cortisol reactivity. A questionnaire assessed the children's level of perceived stress. Results showed higher cortisol reactivity in children who perceived the task as more stressful. Furthermore, a quadratic relation between gaze aversion and cortisol was found which depended on the level of perceived stress: for children with low levels of perceived stress, cortisol reactivity was lowest with intermediate levels of gaze aversion, whereas for children with high levels of perceived stress cortisol reactivity was highest at intermediate levels of gaze aversion. The results suggest a modest association between subjective and physiological stress responses in 9- to 11-year-olds, and indicate that gaze aversion may play only a minor role as a behavioural coping strategy at this age.

AB Sexual minorities have documented elevated risk factors that can lead to inflammation and poor immune functioning.
   This study aims to investigate disparities in C-reactive protein (CRP) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by gender and sexual orientation.
   We used the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine disparities in CRP (N = 11,462) and EBV (N = 11,812).
   Among heterosexuals, women had higher levels of CRP and EBV than men. However, sexual minority men had higher levels of CRP and EBV than heterosexual men and sexual minority women. Lesbians had lower levels of CRP than heterosexual women.
   Gender differences in CRP and EBV found between men and women who identify as 100 % heterosexual were reversed among sexual minorities and not explained by known risk factors (e.g., victimization, alcohol and tobacco use, and body mass index). More nuanced approaches to addressing gender differences in sexual orientation health disparities that include measures of gender nonconformity and minority stress are needed.

AB Caring for adolescents with congenital heart disease requires attention to physical health but also to psychosocial functioning. Identifying how such psychosocial variables influence one another over time is important for designing health care strategies. The present study examined how depressive symptoms, loneliness, paternal and maternal support, and quality of life predicted one another. A total of 429 mid- to late adolescents with congenital heart disease (53.4 % boys) participated in a three-wave longitudinal study. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that depressive symptoms and loneliness mutually reinforced one another over time and led to relative decreases in quality of life. Paternal- and not so much maternal-support predicted relative decreases in depressive symptoms and loneliness and relative increases in quality of life. Maternal and paternal support, in turn, were negatively predicted by previous levels of adolescent depressive symptoms. In sum, important temporal sequences were uncovered potentially providing information for prevention and intervention targeting psychosocial functioning in adolescents with congenital heart disease.

AB BackgroundThe aim of this study was to test whether maladaptive cognitions or difficulties in emotion regulation mediate the association between change in number of adverse life events (i.e. change in life stress) and emotional and behavioural problems in adolescence.
   MethodOur sample consisted of 557 young people, aged 10-19years from a state secondary school in London. We fitted a multiple mediator model to contrast five mediators: three maladaptive cognitions (negative cognitive errors, negative automatic thoughts, and dysfunctional attitudes) and the two emotion regulatory processes of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. We adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, special educational needs and family poverty.
   ResultsTaken as a set, our mediators explained the effect of change in life stress on adolescent emotional and behavioural problems. However, cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, dysfunctional attitudes and negative cognitive errors did not contribute to the indirect effect above and beyond negative automatic thoughts.
   ConclusionsOnly negative automatic thoughts mediated the association between change in life stress and emotional and behavioural problems. This suggests the possibility that negative automatic thoughts is the pathway through which an increase in life stress may lead to emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents.
   Key Practitioner Message: An increase in the number of adverse life events (increase in life stress) was strongly associated with emotional and behavioural problems in adolescence Increased life stress was associated with negative automatic thoughts, negative cognitive errors, dysfunctional attitudes, expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal, which were, in turn, associated with emotional and behavioural problems However, only negative automatic thoughts explained the association between increased life stress and emotional and behavioural problems

AB Studies examining the link between parental socialization and child functioning in varying cultural contexts are scarce. Focusing on early adolescents in suburban middle-class families in India, the present study examined interrelations among reports of mothers' socialization goals, socialization behaviors in response to child emotion, child emotion regulation, and child socioemotional functioning. One hundred and ten mothers and one of their children attending seventh grade at middle schools in Gujarat, India participated. Results indicated that suburban Indian mothers were more likely to endorse relational than autonomous socialization goals, and relational socialization goals were related to mothers' reported explanation-oriented socialization behaviors in response to their children's anger or sadness. Children's self-reported regulation of anger and sadness mediated the negative relation between reports of mothers' explanation-oriented supportive behaviors and child behavior problems. Moreover, children's self-reported dysregulation partially mediated the positive association between reports of mothers' nonsupportive behaviors and child behavior problems.

AB Research Findings: Young children's relationships with their sisters and brothers offer unique and important opportunities for learning about emotions and developing emotional understanding. Through a critical analysis, this article examines sibling interaction in 3 different but normative contexts (conflict/conflict management, play, and sibling-parent interaction) in order to elucidate the processes by which emotional understanding and emotion regulation develop. The results of recent research and theoretical frameworks are used to explore the ways in which sibling relationships are effective contexts for the development of children's emotional understanding, including identifying emotions, decoding the emotions of others, and anticipating the emotional responses of others in particular situations; emotion regulation; and the use of emotional understanding to build (or impede) relationships and affect the behaviors of others. Practice or Policy: Implications from the current analysis include methods for harnessing the potential of children's growth in emotional understanding through their encounters with siblings to affect positive outcomes for child development.

Participants were 80 parent-adolescent dyads (mean age = 13.6; 79 % African-American and 17 % Caucasian) with diverse family composition and socioeconomic status. Parent and adolescent dyads self-reported on their emotion regulation difficulties and adolescents reported on their perceptions of parent invalidation (i.e., punishment and neglect) of emotions and their own internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results showed that parents who reported higher levels of emotion dysregulation tended to invalidate their adolescent's emotional expressions more often, which in turn related to higher levels of adolescent emotion dysregulation. Additionally, adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation mediated the relation between parent invalidation of emotions and adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Potential applied implications are discussed.

AB Despite the increasing number of studies on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), little is known about the influence of family and parental factors on this outcome. This study aimed to explore whether family cohesion and children's HRQOL were connected through three indicators of parental psychological adjustment (parenting stress, depressive symptoms, and anxious symptoms) as well as whether these links varied according to the child's age. Levels of family cohesion, parenting stress, and depression/anxiety symptoms of parents of children with T1D and parents of healthy children were compared. The sample included 88 child-parent dyads composed of children/adolescents (8-18 years old) with T1D and one of their parents and 121 dyads composed of healthy children/adolescents and one of their parents. The parents completed self-report measures of family cohesion, parenting stress, and emotional adjustment, and the children completed measures of HRQOL. Testing of the hypothesized moderated mediational model showed that higher HRQOL ratings in children were associated with higher levels of cohesion through lower levels of parental stress, regardless of the child's age. Parents of children with T1D perceived less cohesion and felt more anxiety and stress about parenting tasks compared to parents of healthy children. Our findings suggest that parents of children with T1D are at an increased risk of psychological maladjustment. Moreover, this study highlights the interrelation between family/parental functioning and child adjustment and makes an innovative contribution by identifying a mechanism that may account for the link between family and child variables.

AB Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure/response prevention is effective among youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and comorbid anxiety symptoms. This case illustrates the application of a modularized family-based CBT approach with a school-aged boy with autistic disorder and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Following 16 family sessions over 21 weeks, "Jerry," a 9-year-old Caucasian male, showed significant reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Jerry's parents also reported improvements in emotional regulation, participation in school activities, and in his parent-child relationships. This case study illustrates the use of family-based CBT, which has been modified to account for social and behavioral deficits endemic to ASDs, for school-aged youth with autism and comorbid OCD.

AB Background. According to empirical literature, low self-esteem is highly correlated to behavioural and emotional problems in gifted children and adolescents. Since self-esteem is an indicator of social and emotional adjustment, it would be interesting to better understand the meaning of this construct, as it is evaluated explicitly with the use of self-report questionnaires. In order to explore the psychological processes underlying the explicit self-esteem, we studied the relation of a self-report questionnaire and an indirect measure of self and interpersonal perception using the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS).
   Method. The participants were 93 children, aged between 9 and 15 years old, with an IQ >= 130. They were attending regular classes (no curriculum difference). Self-esteem was evaluated using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). We used the Rorschach CS measures of self and interpersonal perception.
   Results. The results showed no significant correlation between self-esteem and high IQ. A negative correlation between self-esteem evaluated on the SEC and the Rorschach Vista responses was found, which reflected self-critical introspection and painful self-appraisal. Then a positive correlation was observed between self-esteem and reflection answers on the Rorschach (Fr + rF > 0), which are related to narcissistic-like features of personality. We also found a positive correlation between self-esteem and the Rorschach egocentricity index (EGO), which provides an estimate of self-concern. Finally, the strongest correlation was found between self-esteem and the dominance of good over poor human representations (GHR> PHR), which reveals effective interpersonal behaviour.
   Discussion. The psychological processes which seem to be related to low self-esteem in gifted children and adolescents are maladaptive interpersonal behaviours, painful experience of introspection focusing on perceived negative aspects of the self, absence of narcissistic-like features of the personality and low self-concern. These findings may suggest that intervention planning with gifted children and adolescents with low self-esteem should emphasize the accurate interpretation of interpersonal data, develop social skills and restructure negative self-thoughts.

AB The current study investigated the longitudinal, reciprocal associations between stressful events and psychological difficulties from early childhood to mid-adolescence. Child age, sex, prenatal maternal anxiety, and difficult temperament were tested as sources of sensitivity, that is, factors that may make children more sensitive to stressful life events. Analyses were based on data from 10,417 children from a prospective, longitudinal study of child development. At ages 4, 7, 9, 11, and 16 years, stressful events and psychological difficulties were measured. Prenatal anxiety was measured at 32 weeks of gestation and difficult temperament was measured at 6 months. Children exposed to stressful events showed significantly increased psychological difficulties at ages 7 and 11 years; there was consistent evidence of a reciprocal pattern: psychological difficulties predicted stressful events at each stage. Analyses also indicated that the associations between stressful events and psychological difficulties were stronger in girls than in boys. We found no evidence for the hypothesis that prenatal anxiety or difficult temperament increased stress sensitivity, that is, moderated the link between life events and psychological difficulties. The findings extend prior work on stress exposure and psychological difficulties and highlight the need for additional research to investigate sources of sensitivity and the mechanisms that might underlie differences in sensitivity to stressful events.

AB The Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children (QLSKC) is an ongoing population-based prospective longitudinal study presently spanning ages 6-29 years, designed to study the prevalence, risk factors, development and consequences of behavioural and emotional problems during elementary school. Kindergarten boys and girls attending French-speaking public schools in the Canadian province of Quebec during the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school years were included in the cohort: 2000 children representative of the population and 1017 children exhibiting disruptive behaviour problems. To date, 12 waves of data have been collected, and three generations of participants have been involved in the study (i.e. the study child, his parents and the first child of the study child). Information on demographics, psycho-social and lifestyle factors, child and family member characteristics (physical and mental health), and outcomes such as psychiatric diagnoses, delinquency or school diploma were assessed during three important developmental stages (childhood, adolescence and early adulthood). Blood samples were also collected in early adulthood for genetic analyses.

AB IMPORTANCE Pediatric hearing impairment is a chronic handicap that can potentially lead to the development of psychopathology. Yet, for hearing-impaired children and adolescents, the exact occurrence of various forms of psychopathology and its causes are unclear, while this knowledge is essential to enable targeted screenings and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the level of psychopathological symptoms in hearing-impaired children and adolescents as compared with normally hearing peers. Second, the influence of type of hearing device and possible risk and protective factors on psychopathology were examined.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic literature search was performed covering relevant databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Two independent researchers identified the relevant articles. The final search was performed on May 2, 2013, and resulted in a total of 35 articles.
   FINDINGS Literature consistently demonstrated that hearing-impaired children and adolescents were more prone to developing depression, aggression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and psychopathy than their normally hearing peers. Levels of anxiety, somatization, and delinquency were elevated in some, but not all, hearing-impaired participants, for reasons related to sex, age, and type of school. Divergent results were obtained for the level of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and the influence of type of hearing device on psychopathology. Possible risk and protective factors were identified, including age at detection and intervention of hearing loss, additional disabilities, communication skills, intelligence, type of school, and number of siblings.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Literature on psychopathology in hearing-impaired children and adolescents is scarce and sometimes inconsistent. To define a more precise occurrence of psychopathology, more studies are needed. These studies should have a longitudinal design to draw firmer conclusions on causality. Hopefully, this will lead to more knowledge in the future to help and support each hearing-impaired individual.

AB Links between parents' psychiatric symptoms and their children's behavioral and emotional problems have been widely documented in previous research, and the search for moderators of this association has begun. However, family structure (single versus dual-parent households) has received little attention as a potential moderator, despite indirect evidence that risk may be elevated in single-parent homes. Two other candidate moderators-youth gender and age-have been tested directly, but with inconsistent findings across studies, perhaps in part because studies have differed in whether they used youth clinical samples and in which informants (parents vs. youths) reported on youth problems. In the present study, we examined these three candidate moderators using a sample of exclusively clinic-referred youths (N = 333, 34 % girls, aged 7-14,) and assessing youth problems through both parent- and youth-reports. Both family structure and youth gender emerged as robust moderators across parent and youth informants. Parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing and externalizing problems in single-parent but not dual-parent homes; and parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing problems among boys, but not girls. The moderator findings suggest that the risks associated with parent psychopathology may not be uniform but may depend, in part, on family structure and youth gender.

AB BackgroundThe relationship between inadequate sleep and mood has been well-established in adults and is supported primarily by correlational data in younger populations. Given that adolescents often experience shortened sleep on school nights, we sought to better understand the effect of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction on adolescents' mood and mood regulation.
   MethodsFifty healthy adolescents, ages 14-17, completed a 3-week sleep manipulation protocol involving a baseline week, followed by a sleep restriction (SR) condition (6.5hr in bed per night for five nights) and healthy sleep duration (HS) condition (10hr in bed per night for five nights). The study used a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover experimental design. Participants' sleep was monitored at home via self-report and actigraphy. At the end of each condition, participants and their parents completed questionnaires of mood and mood regulation. To assess for expectancy effects, we also analyzed parent and teen ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, which prior research suggests is not sensitive to SR in adolescents. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests compared questionnaire outcomes across the two conditions.
   ResultsParticipants averaged 2.5 more hours of sleep per night during HS relative to SR. Compared with HS, adolescents rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, and fatigued, and as less vigorous (p=.001-.01) during SR. Parents and adolescents also reported greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotional regulation during SR compared with HS (p<.05). There were no cross-condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity (p>.05).
   ConclusionsFindings complement prior correlational study results to show that after only a few days of shortened sleep, at a level of severity that is experienced regularly by millions of adolescents on school nights, adolescents have worsened mood and decreased ability to regulate negative emotions.

AB The uncinate fasciculus is a major white matter tract that provides a crucial link between areas of the human brain that underlie emotion processing and regulation. Specifically, the uncinate fasciculus is the major direct fiber tract that connects the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala The aim of the present study was to use a multi-modal imaging approach in order to simultaneously examine the relation between structural connectivity of the uncinate fasciculus and functional activation of the amygdala in a youth sample (children and adolescents). Participants were 9 to 19 years old and underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results indicate that greater structural connectivity of the uncinate fasciculus predicts reduced amygdala activation to sad and happy faces. This effect is moderated by age, with younger participants exhibiting a stronger relation. Further, decreased amygdala activation to sad faces predicts lower internalizing symptoms. These results provide important insights into brain structure-function relationships during adolescence, and suggest that greater structural connectivity of the uncinate fasciculus may facilitate regulation of the amygdala, particularly during early adolescence. These findings also have implications for understanding the relation between brain structure, function, and the development of emotion regulation difficulties, such as internalizing symptoms.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the prevalence of sexting behaviors ( sexually explicit messages and/or pictures) among an atrisk sample of early adolescents as well as the associations between sexting behaviors and sexual behaviors, risk-related cognitions, and emotional regulation skills. It also aimed to determine whether differences in risk were associated with text-based versus photo-based sexts.
   METHODS: Seventh-grade adolescents participating in a sexual risk prevention trial for at-risk early adolescents completed a computerbased survey at baseline regarding sexting behavior ( having sent sexually explicit messages and/or pictures), sexual activities, intentions to have sex, perceived approval of sexual activity, and emotional regulation skills.
   RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of the sample reported having sexted in the past 6 months; sexual messages were endorsed by 17% ( n = 71), sexual messages and photos by 5% ( n = 21). Pictures were endorsed significantly more often by females ( x2[ 2] = 7.33, P =.03) and Latinos ( x2[ 2] = 7.27, P =.03). Sexting of any kind was associated with higher rates of engaging in a variety of sexual behaviors, and sending photos was associated with higher rates of sexual activity than sending text messages only. This was true for a range of behaviors from touching genitals over clothes ( odds ratio [ OR] = 1.98, P =.03) to oral sex ( OR = 2.66, P,.01) to vaginal sex ( OR = 2.23, P,.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Sexting behavior ( both photo and text messages) was not uncommon among middle school youth and co-occurred with sexual behavior. These data suggest that phone behaviors, even flirtatious messages, may be an indicator of risk. Clinicians, parents, and health programs should discuss sexting with early adolescents.

AB Openness to experience has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health in the general population, but there is a dearth of information both about why this is the case and on LGB populations in this area. The present article explores the relationship between openness to experience, LGB identity development, and mental health. The results revealed a full mediation model, where the positive impact of openness to experience on mental health is fully mediated by positive LGB identity development. Limitations and implications are discussed.

AB The present article examines the interpersonal and intrapersonal antecedents and consequences of food offering. Food offering is one of the earliest biobehavioral regulatory interactions between parent and child. It ensures survival of the child who is fully dependent on food provision by others. The quality of these early interactions influences how people respond to situations later in life, and food offering in particular may be closely related to emotion regulation throughout the lifespan. While research has examined other forms of emotion regulation, and food consumption has been studied from an intrapersonal perspective, we know little about the interpersonal effects of food offering. After reviewing literature from a wide range of disciplines, we propose that one mechanism underlying these effects is empathic emotion regulation (EER). We conceptualize EER as an interpersonal regulation system in which an empathic response to another persons emotional state aims to regulate both emotion within the provider and across interaction partners. We suggest that the offer of food by an empathic provider is motivated by the emotional state of ones interaction partner (recipient). By offering food, the provider not only aims to attenuate the recipients negative affect but also her own. Food offering thereby becomes a means to increase positive affect for both recipient and - when the offer has the desired effect - provider. We further propose that the sharing of food resources as well as the use of food as a support behavior increases interpersonal closeness. Finally, we frame the process of food offering within a developmental perspective. If the regulatory success of food offering becomes a replacement for other support behaviors, children will learn from an early age to use food as a primary means to soothe self and others, possibly resulting in eating disorders and a restricted range of coping behavior.

AB Social isolation during the vulnerable period of adolescence produces emotional dysregulation manifested by abnormalities in adult behaviors that require emotional processing. The affected brain regions may include the basolateral amygdala (BLA), where plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in principal neurons plays a role in conditioned emotional responses. This plasticity is dependent on NMDA receptor trafficking denoted by intracellular mobilization of the obligatory NR1 NMDA subunit. We tested the hypothesis that the psychosocial stress of adolescent social isolation (ASI) produces a lasting change in NMDA receptor distribution in principal neurons in the BLA of adults that express maladaptive emotional responses to sensory cues. For this, we used behavioral testing and dual electron microscopic immunolabeling of NR1 and calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a protein predominantly expressed in principal neurons of the BLA in adult C57Bl/ 6 mice housed in isolation or in social groups from post-weaning day 22 until adulthood (similar to 3 months of age). The isolates showed persistent deficits in sensorimotor gating evidenced by altered prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and hyperlocomotor activity in a novel environment. Immunogold-silver labeling for NR1 alone or together with CaMKII was seen in many somatodendritic profiles in the BLA of all mice irrespective of rearing conditions. However, isolates compared with group-reared mice had a significantly lower cytoplasmic (4.72 +/- 0.517 vs 6.31 +/- 0.517) and higher plasmalemmal (0.397 +/- 0.0779 vs 0.216 +/- 0.026) density of NR1 immunogold particles in CaMKII-containing dendritic spines. There was no rearingdependent difference in the size or number of these spines or those of other dendritic profiles within the neuropil, which also failed to show an impact of ASI on NR1 immunogold labeling. These results provide the first evidence that ASI enhances the surface trafficking of NMDA receptors in dendritic spines of principal neurons in the BLA of adult mice showing maladaptive behaviors that are consistent with emotional dysregulation.

AB Many survivors of severe disasters need psychological support, even those not suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The critical issue in understanding the psychological response after experiencing severe disasters is to distinguish neurological microstructural underpinnings as vulnerability factors from signs of emotional distress acquired soon after the stressful life event. We collected diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data from a group of healthy adolescents before the Great East Japan Earthquake and re-examined the DTIs and anxiety levels of 30 non-PTSD subjects from this group 3-4 months after the earthquake using voxel-based analyses in a longitudinal DTI study before and after the earthquake. We found that the state anxiety level after the earthquake was negatively associated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right anterior cingulum (Cg) before the earthquake (r = -0.61, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected), and positively associated with increased FA changes from before to after the earthquake in the left anterior Cg (r = 0.70, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected) and uncinate fasciculus (Uf) (r = 0.65, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected). The results demonstrated that lower FA in the right anterior Cg was a vulnerability factor and increased FA in the left anterior Cg and Uf was an acquired sign of state anxiety after the earthquake. We postulate that subjects with dysfunctions in processing fear and anxiety before the disaster were likely to have higher anxiety levels requiring frequent emotional regulation after the disaster. These findings provide new evidence of psychophysiological responses at the neural network level soon after a stressful life event and might contribute to the development of effective methods to prevent PTSD.

AB Although adolescence is a time of individuation with increased reliance on peers, research indicates that, despite a deliberate distancing from parents, adolescents continue to seek the support and console of parental attachment figures in times of distress. The Perceived Parental Reactions to Adolescent Distress (PRAD) is a brief self-report measure developed to examine adolescents' perception of parental response under conditions of distress as measured by four conceptually and empirically distinct parental reactions to distress: Comfort, Self-Focus, Avoidance and Harshness. Across two studies involving a total of 738 high school students, we developed the PRAD and substantiated its robust psychometric properties, including evidence for reliability as well as internal and criterion validity. Sources of individual differences in the test-scores were also explored. Empirical as well as practical importance of assessing parental reactions to adolescent distress is discussed with regard to both the attachment and adolescent development literature.

AB Evidence is mixed regarding an independent association between anxiety and suicidality. Beyond associations with demographic factors and depression, do anxiety disorders increase risk for suicidality in youth? Given that not all anxiety-disordered youth experience suicidal ideation, potential predictors of risk also require investigation. The present study examined (a) the independent relationship between anxiety and suicidal ideation and (b) emotion dysregulation and distress intolerance as predictors of risk for suicidal ideation in a sample of anxiety-disordered youth aged 7 to 17 (N=86, M=11.5). Youth and their parents reported on suicidality, emotion dysregulation, and distress intolerance. Distress tolerance was also measured by a computerized behavioral task. Results support an independent relationship between anxiety symptomatology and youth-reported suicidal ideation, controlling for depressive symptoms. Youth self-report of emotion dysregulation and distress intolerance predicted higher levels of suicidal ideation in univariate analyses. In a multivariate analysis including all significant predictors, only anxiety symptomatology uniquely predicted suicidal ideation. Results provide recommendations for the assessment and treatment of suicidality in anxiety-disordered youth. Suggestions for future research investigating the relationship between anxiety and suicidal ideation are offered.

AB This three-phase prospective study investigated psychosocial factors predicting or associated with academic achievement. An initial sample of 1,514 school-age children was assessed with screening tools for emotional problems (Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders; Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version; Children's Depression Inventory). The following year, 562 subjects (risk group/without risk group) were re-assessed and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was assessed. Two years later, 242 subjects were followed, and their parents informed about their academic achievement. Results showed that early depression (phase 1 B = -.130, p = .001; phase 1 + phase 2 B = -.187, p < .001), persistent anxiety symptoms (phase 1 + phase 2 B = -1.721, p = .018), and ADHD were predictors of lower academic achievement (phase 1 + phase 2 B = -3.415, p = .005). However, some anxiety symptoms can improve academic achievement (Social phobia B = .216, p = .018; Generalized anxiety B = .313, p < .001). Socio-economic status (SES) was positively related to academic achievement. We can conclude that in the transition period to adolescence, school-health professionals and teachers need to consider the emotional issues of students to avoid unwanted academic outcomes.

AB Peer interaction of children with ADHD is often burdened by failure that is reflected in the low acceptance of these children by their peers, a very limited number of friends, low quality friendships and a higher incidence of involvement in peer violence. In order to better understand the social interactions in this population, this paper presents the contemporary knowledge about the characteristics of the behaviour of children and adolescents with ADHD, which include distracting / inappropriate social behaviour, communication features, socio-cognitive difficulties and deficits in social problems solving and emotional dysregulation. Recent findings on predictors of peer acceptance of children with ADHD are creating new possibilities for action. Special attention was paid to the issue of peer violence. The paper presents current concepts of knowledge in the context of typical children and young people, children and youth with disabilities and with ADHD. Compared to typical children, those with disabilities are frequently involved in peer violence and are highly represented in the population of victims. Studies show that ADHD symptoms and bullying are significantly related. The conducted research clearly points to the increasing prevalence of children with ADHD among the victims of peer violence, but also among the perpetrators, and provocative victims compared with typical peers. This paper seeks to highlight the importance of the research of peer interaction of children and youth with ADHD and provide a boost to such research, with particular emphasis on peer violence. The paper gives some guidelines for the design and implementation of prevention and intervention programs tailored to the population of children with ADHD.

AB Research has shown peer victimization to have strong lasting effects on adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among religiousness, forgiveness, and mental health in the context of peer victimization. We hypothesized that religiousness and forgiveness could be protective factors against negative effects of peer victimization on internalizing symptomatology and emotion regulation. Participants were 127 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old and their primary caregivers. Results of structural equation modeling analyses show that religiousness might not be a strong protective factor in the context of peer victimization and that certain dimensions of forgiveness (specifically benevolence motivations) might actually exacerbate the effects of peer victimization on internalizing symptomatology rather than acting as a protective factor.

AB Self-destructive behavior is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly prevalent among adolescents. The main objective of this study is to establish in Spanish communitarian adolescents the association between self-destructive behavior and coping typologies, detecting higher risk profiles. A previous and additional objective is to determine the presence of self-destructive behavior in a subclinical/clinical range according to gender. From a sample of 1400 high school students between 12 and 16 years the results of this cross-sectional study indicate that 15% of adolescents reports self-destructive behavior in a subclinical or clinical level. No gender differences were observed. The adolescents with higher risk of self-destructive behavior are those belonging to the avoidance typology, characterized by the overuse of avoidance coping responses at the expense of those of approach. Coping typologies are more useful in predicting the risk of self-destructive behavior than the typical approach/avoidance dichotomy. The results of this study may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of self-destructive behaviors in adolescents at risk.

AB Despite a large number of publications on the psychosocial situation of short statured children and their parents only a few qualitative studies focus on the perspective of the affected families. Within the European QoLISSY study ("Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth") an instrument to assess the health related quality of life of short statured children was developed. The aim of this project was to examine the self-perceived quality of life of the children themselves in comparison to their parents' perspective. During the development of the QoLISSY instrument, focus groups were conducted as a first step of this study. A total of 23 short statured children and 31 parents participated and discussed their experiences in separate groups with trained moderators. The discussions were analyzed qualitatively und results were used to generate a first list of items for the questionnaire to be developed. While parents focused on socio-emotional problems, children talked much more about their growth hormone treatment and problems in their social environment. In comparison to other studies children rated their quality of life worse than their parents. Not only medical treatment but also a psychological and socio-emotional intervention seems to be indicated.

AB Objective: It is widely known that cigarette use and depressive symptoms co-occur during adolescence and young adulthood and that there are gender differences in smoking initiation, progression, and co-occurrence with other drug use. Given that females have an earlier onset of depressive symptoms while males have an earlier onset of cigarette use, this study explored the possible bidirectional development of cigarette use and depressive symptoms by gender across the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Gender differences in the stability and crossed effects of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking during the transition to young adulthood, controlling for other known risk factors, were examined using a nationally representative longitudinal sample. Methods: A bivariate autoregressive multi-group structural equation model examined the longitudinal stability and crossed relationships between a latent construct of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking over four waves of data. Data for this study came from four waves of participants (N = 6,501) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health. At each of four waves, participants completed a battery of measures including questions on depressive symptoms and an ordinal measure of number of cigarettes smoked per day. Results: The best-fitting bivariate autoregressive models were gender-specific, included both crossed and parallel associations between depressive symptoms and cigarette use during the transition to adulthood, and controlled for wave-specific parental smoking, alcohol use, and number of friends who smoke. For females, greater depressive symptoms at each wave, except the first one, were associated with greater subsequent cigarette use. There were bidirectional associations between depressive symptoms and cigarette use only for females during young adulthood, but not for males. Conclusions: The development of depressive symptoms and cigarette use from adolescence and into young adulthood follows similar patterns for males and females. Controlling for the correlation and stability between initial levels of depressive symptoms and cigarette use from adolescence into young adulthood, there remains a crossed association between cigarette use and depressive symptoms specific to females during young adulthood. The findings suggest that prevention interventions focused on mental health should include warnings that cigarette use may exacerbate depressive symptoms.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior occurs in the general human population, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Some rhesus macaques also develop self-injurious behavior (SIB) as adolescents or young adults. In both of these cases, the development of harmful behaviors is idiopathic, only coming to the attention of physicians or veterinarians after the disorder is established. Thus, a combination of retrospective, statistical, and empirical procedures are used to understand this disorder. Here, we identify concordances between macaques and humans across five different levels of analysis-(1) form and prevalence, (2) etiology, (3) triggering events, (4) function/maintenance, and (5) therapeutic intervention-and show the value of the cross-translational model (macaques to humans and humans to macaques) in understanding this phenomenon. Substantial concordance is present with respect to the range of severity, the presence of early life stress exposure, and emotional dysregulation. In the macaque model, additional information is available on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response system, possible genetic involvement, and the immediate contextual situations that appear to trigger or exacerbate SIB episodes. In contrast, considerably more information is available from human studies on the effectiveness of various treatment regimens. Veterinarians have drawn on this information to explore these therapeutic interventions in monkeys. We expect that models of SIB will continue to have cross-translational impact as scientists and practitioners move from preclinical to clinical research and treatment.

AB Compared to healthy controls, patients with bipolar disorder display an increased use of maladaptive and a decreased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. As this seems to be a performance-rather than a competence-deficit it should be possible to improve the emotion regulation ability of bipolar patients by training. Based on this background 12 patients were administered a one-day emotion regulation training in group-setting. Afterwards patients were attended for four weeks by text-messages, emails and telephone calls. This study shows that a short intervention like this is able to improve the handling with one's own emotions and to increase the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The latter has not only been shown by means of self-reports (EmoCheck, ERQ, CERQ) but also on the basis of an objective measure (PASAT). In addition, the training was highly accepted by patients. These results illustrate that further studies examining the effectiveness of emotion regulation trainings for bipolar patients are desirable.

AB This study investigated whether insecure adolescent attachment organization (i.e., preoccupied and dismissing) longitudinally predicted self-and peer-reported externalizing behavior in emerging adulthood. Secondarily, maladaptive coping strategies were examined for their potential role in mediating the relationship between insecure attachment and future externalizing behaviors. Target participants (N = 184) were given the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) at age 14 and re-interviewed seven and eight years later with their closest peer. Qualities of both preoccupied and dismissing attachment organization predicted self-reported externalizing behaviors in emerging adulthood eight years later, but only preoccupation was predictive of close-peer reports of emerging adult externalizing behavior. Maladaptive coping strategies only mediated the relationship between a dismissing stance toward attachment and future self-reported externalizing behaviors. Understanding the role of coping and emotional regulation in attachment may help us to understand the unique aspects of both dismissing and preoccupied stances toward attachment.

AB To provide counseling psychologists with a greater understanding of patterns of personality, stress, and emotion regulation, the present study examined perfectionists' typical emotion regulation patterns and physiological reactivity (salivary cortisol concentration) to a social-evaluative stress experience. An initially large sample (N = 421) completed measures of perfectionism, higher order personality factors, and emotion regulation. A subset of the larger sample (N = 61) completed the Trier Social Stress Test. Latent profile analysis revealed typologies consistent with more and less adaptively perfectionistic groups, as reflected in different stress reactivity and emotion regulation patterns. The results have implications for further understanding the positive and negative effects of perfectionism and physiological reactivity to performance stress among individuals with high performance expectations. In addition, the results may inform counseling psychologists about viable targets for therapeutic interventions for stress and emotion regulation.

AB The objective was to assess the feasibility of delivering a group treatment to improve emotional regulation via videoconferencing to individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). A pre-post feasibility study was undertaken. Seven individuals with TBI were recruited at a brain injury research centre in an urban medical centre. The main measures were therapist assessment of session-by-session progress and feasibility, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire (BREQ), Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale (STTS), and exit interview. Attendance across sessions and participants was over 90%. Adequate skill acquisition and ease of use of the technology were demonstrated. Self-reported satisfaction with treatment was high. Participants noted several benefits in terms of the treatment delivery modality. There was no change is self-reported emotional dysregulation. This is the first study to report the use of videoconferencing for the delivery of group treatment to individuals with TBI. The exceptional compliance and self-reported satisfaction suggest that this treatment delivery option could be a viable alternative for increasing access to healthcare in this population.

AB Social difficulties are commonly associated with anxiety disorders in youth, yet are not well specified in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify patterns of social experiences in clinically anxious children and examine the associations with indices of emotional functioning. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on parent-, teacher-, and child-reports of social experiences with 64 children, ages 7-12 years (M = 8.86 years, SD = 1.59 years; 60.3% boys; 85.7% Caucasian) with a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or generalized anxiety disorder. Follow-up analyses examined cluster differences on indices of emotional functioning. Findings yielded three clusters of social experiences that were unrelated to diagnosis: (1) Unaware Children (elevated scores on parent-and teacher-reports of social difficulties but relatively low scores on child-reports, n = 12), (2) Average Functioning (relatively average scores across all informants, n = 44), and (3) Victimized and Lonely (elevated child-reports of overt and relational victimization and loneliness and relatively low scores on parent-and teacher-reports of social difficulties, n = 8). Youth in the Unaware Children cluster were rated as more emotionally dysregulated by teachers and had a greater number of diagnoses than youth in the Average Functioning group. In contrast, the Victimized and Lonely group self-reported greater frequency of negative affect and reluctance to share emotional experiences than the Average Functioning cluster. Overall, this study demonstrates that social maladjustment in clinically anxious children can manifest in a variety of ways and assessment should include multiple informants and methods.

AB Executive function is a heterogeneous construct applied to cognitive capacities that together enable individuals to effectively engage in activities toward a purposive goal. Children born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are at risk of executive dysfunction on performance-based measures. In natural contexts, executive function may be described using such parental and teacher questionnaires as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). This study examined the factor structure of the BRIEF-parent form in 124 ELBW children and of the BRIEF-teacher form in 90 ELBW children. Although our data showed that the fit of a two-factor structure was adequate for the parent report, a three-factor model provided advantages over the two-factor model across all fit indices and best characterized the data. For teacher report, these data supported a three-factor but not a two-factor model. Using the three-factor model for both groups of informants, we compared parent and teacher reports (n = 90 pairs) between the three identified latent variables. Parents reported significantly more difficulty with Emotional Regulation (p < .05), and teachers reported significantly more difficulty with Behavioral Regulation (p < .05). No significant differences were found between parent and teacher reports for Metacognition.

AB There are two divergent viewpoints on the phenomenology and outcome of bipolar I (BP I) disorder in youth. Disparities evolved as unintended consequences from investigators' inconsistencies both in translating the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria and in operationalizing them differently in their standardized assessments. Rates of conservatively diagnosed BP I are lower both in community studies of youths than in adults and from liberally defined BP I in youths. Rates of co-occurring attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lower in conservatively than liberally defined children and adolescents with BP I. Rates of both BP I and of ADHD are lower in offspring of BP I probands, and outcome more closely approximates that of adults with BP I in conservatively versus liberally defined children and teens with BP I. Both perspectives can claim evidence for reliability and validity that support their positions. However, the samples are so different that it is difficult to compare studies conducted from these different perspectives.

AB Given that non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) disorder is being considered for the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), it is important to consider how NSSI occurs with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants were 480 undergraduates who completed online questionnaires and were assigned to 4 groups based on NSSI and BPD status. Analyses revealed BPD-positive self-injurers had higher self-punishment, anti-suicide, and anti-dissociation functions of NSSI and higher rates of cutting and burning than BPD-negative self-injurers. Furthermore, difficulty in emotion regulation, not distress tolerance, was most critical in distinguishing between groups. Differences between BPD-positive and BPD-negative self-injurers provide preliminary support for NSSI as a distinct disorder. However, more research in this area is needed.

AB This study analyses the impact of family violence on adolescent maladjustment and child-to-parent violence in a community sample. It also explores a possible mediating effect of adolescent behavioural and/or emotional problems in the relationship between family violence and child-to-parent violence. The sample included 485 adolescents of both sexes, with an age range of 12 to 18 years. Two structural equation models are presented in the data analysis. The results support previous findings indicating that all forms of family violence appear to contribute to adolescent maladjustment. Moreover, indirect effects of family violence on child-to-parent violence through behavioural and emotional problems were found. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB Objective. The study investigated real-time, sequential exchanges of affect in both mother-child and father-child dyads within a triadic framework. Child emotion dysregulation was examined as a mechanism by which parent-child reciprocal positive and negative affect are associated with child psychopathology symptoms. Design. Fifty-onemother-father-child (aged 7-12 years) triads participated in an emotion discussion task, and behavioral observations were coded for negative and positive affect. Parents completed measures of child psychopathology symptoms and emotion regulation skills. Results. Although mothers exhibited greater levels of positive emotional reciprocity than fathers, father-child reciprocal positive affect was uniquely associated with child symptoms of psychopathology. Child emotion dysregulation mediated the relation between paternal reciprocal positive affect and child symptoms; mediational models did not hold for mothers. Conclusions. Fathers play a unique role in boys' and girls' development of symptoms of psychopathology through child emotion dysregulation.
