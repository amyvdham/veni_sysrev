AB This paper shows the internalizing symptoms: anxiety, depression and somatic complaints, obtained in a clinical sample from 300 boys and girls aged between 8 and 12 years. The instrument used was the abbreviated Child Behavior Checklist Scale (CBCL) (Achenbach & Edelbrock 1983) of 96 items.
   The prevalence found in the CBCL-DSM factors in the total sample, estimated from 98th percentile (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), is 54% in anxiety, 32% in affective alterations, and 29% in somatic complaints, finding a higher prevalence in boys than girls in the first two alterations.
   A factorial analysis was carried out and it was found three internalizing empirical syndromes: anxious/depressed, somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed. In these empirical syndromes the prevalence, from mean plus one SD of the sample, is: 18% in anxious/depressed and somatic complaints, and 14% in withdrawn/depressed, and in all factors the prevalence was higher in boys than girls.

AB The present research examines posttraumatic resilience in extremely exposed children and adolescents based on interviews with 330 former Ugandan child soldiers (age = 11-17, female = 48.5%). Despite severe trauma exposure, 27.6% showed posttraumatic resilience as indicated by the absence of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and clinically significant behavioral and emotional problems. Among these former child soldiers, posttraumatic resilience was associated with lower exposure to domestic violence, lower guilt cognitions, less motivation to seek revenge, better socioeconomic situation in the family, and more perceived spiritual support. Among the youth with significant psychopathology, many of them had symptoms extending beyond the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, in keeping with the emerging concept of developmental trauma disorder. Implications for future research, intervention, and policy are discussed.

AB Relationships between temperament, coping, depressive and aggressive mood in 8-12-year-old boys (n = 185) and girls (n = 219) were investigated, with a focus on gender differences. Children completed two self-report questionnaires: the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised and Children's Coping Strategies Checklist-Revised1. Comparing boys and girls on three temperament dimensions, positive affectivity, negative affectivity and effortful control, girls scored higher than boys on the first two dimensions. Girls also scored higher than boys on avoidant coping and depressive mood. For both boys and girls, aggressive and depressive mood were predicted by negative affectivity. Coping did not add towards this prediction. Gender specific models of temperament, coping and depressive mood were tested. For girls, both effortful control and active problem solving, accounted for the variability in depressive mood. For boys, only effortful control accounted for variance in depressive mood. Results showed that gender specific vulnerability to depression in girls is apparent before adolescence and can be linked to temperament and coping. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
   Key Practitioner Message:
   Pre-adolescent girls are more vulnerable to depression than boys. Interventions focussing on self-control, emotion regulation and active coping are tailored towards vulnerabilities in temperament and coping in girls.

AB Extensive research has linked a greater female tendency to ruminate about depressed feelings or mood to the gender difference in depression. However, the developmental origins of the gender difference in depressive rumination are not well understood. We hypothesized that girls and women may be more likely to ruminate because rumination represents a gender-stereotyped coping style that is associated with a more feminine gender role identity, maternal encouragement of emotion expression, and passive coping responses to stress. This study examined whether child self-reported gender role identity and observed maternal responses to child stress mediated the emergent gender difference in depressive rumination in adolescence. Maternal gender role attitudes were further hypothesized to moderate the relationship between child sex and mediating variables. Rumination and gender role identity were assessed in 316 youths and their mothers in a longitudinal study from age 11 to age 15; in addition, 153 mother child dyads participated in an observational task at age 11 from which maternal responses to a child stressor were coded. Results indicated that greater feminine gender role identity among children and encouragement of emotion expression by mothers at age 11 significantly mediated the association between child sex and the development of depressive rumination at age 15, even after controlling for rumination at age 11. Maternal gender role attitudes significantly moderated the relationship between child sex and maternal encouragement of emotion expression, such that mothers who endorsed more traditional gender role attitudes themselves were particularly likely to encourage emotion expression in their daughters.

AB The functional Val158Met COMT polymorphism appears to affect a host of behaviours mediated by the pre-frontal cortex, and has been found associated to the risk for disruptive behaviours including ADHD. Parental socioeconomic status (SES) has also been reported as a predictor for the same childhood disorders. In a general population sample of 575 Italian pre-adolescents aged 10-14, we examined the association of the functional Val158Met COMT polymorphism and SES-both as linear and interactive effects-with oppositional defiant problems, conduct problems, and attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, as defined by the newly established Child Behaviour Check-List/6-18 DSM oriented scales. Multivariate- and subsequent univariate-analysis of covariance showed a significant association of COMT x SES interaction with CBCL 6/18 DOS attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (p = 0.004), and revealed higher scores among those children with Val/Val COMT genotype who belonged to low-SES families. We also found a significant association of SES with attention deficit/hyperactivity problems and conduct problems DOS (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). Our data are consistent with a bulk of recent literature suggesting a role of environmental factors in moderating the contribution of specific genetic polymorphisms to human variability in ADHD. While future investigations will refine and better clarify which specific environmental and genetic mechanisms are at work in influencing the individual risk to ADHD in pre-adolescence, these data may contribute to identify/prevent the risk for ADHD problems in childhood.

AB Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, impairing, life-limiting disorder of childhood. Little is known about how siblings adapt to this. The aim of this study is to document psychosocial adjustment in siblings of patients with DMD. Healthy siblings (11-18 years old) of young people with DMD attending a specialist paediatric centre and their parent/main carer took part. Parents, siblings and teachers completed a battery of questionnaires: (i) to assess psychiatric risk the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); (ii) to measure general wellbeing: SF-36; (iii) to document DMD illness disability: Functional Disability Inventory (FDI); (iv) to assess family function and life stresses for the unaffected sibling: Family Assessment Device (FAD), Family Burden Interview Schedule and Life Events Checklist. Forty six/77 eligible siblings (24 females/22 males); (mean age 14 years (SD 2.3)) took part. Although their mean psychological functioning and wellbeing questionnaire scores were comparable to normative data, there was a trend for more siblings scoring at high-risk for psychological (mainly emotional) problems. Weak/moderate associations with psychological symptoms in siblings varied according to informant and included the following factors: closeness in age to the affected sibling; older sibling age; extent of wheelchair use, burden of illness on family interactions, and siblings reporting high impact of illness on their lives. Psychological symptoms were also associated with less sibling involvement in patient care, with broader psychosocial and family disadvantage and with life stresses. Siblings have an increased risk for emotional problems, which appears influenced by specific illness factors. (C) 2009 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Previous research demonstrates that cultural concerns affect emotional lives. However, the question remains to what extent salient cultural concerns influence emotion experience and expression. In the present study, the role of (i) individualistic versus collectivistic goals and (ii) presence of an authority figure (father) versus an equal status figure (peer), were systematically investigated in 24 Dutch and 23 South Korean children's (a) negative emotion experience and (b) emotion expression and motives using hypothetical conflict situations. The results reveal that for children from both cultures emotion experience did not vary between situational goals and the audience present, however their emotion expression did. More specifically, cultural differences in how negative emotions would be expressed appeared in 'father' situations and not in 'peer' situations. Cultural differences in children's motives for emotion expression were revealed in situations with a collectivistic goal and not when an individualistic goal was presented. Moreover, within group analyses indicate that Dutch children's emotion expressions were more context-sensitive than those of South Korean children. These results indicate that some situational features corresponding to cultural concerns partly explained cultural differences, whereas other features did not, helping to improve our understanding about variation in the emotional lives of different cultural groups.

AB Aim. This study aimed to investigate the role of dental fear (DF) and other personal characteristics in relation to dental behaviour management problems (DBMP).
   Design. A study group of 230 patients (7.5-19 years old; 118 girls), referred because of DBMP, was compared to a reference group of 248 same-aged patients (142 girls) in ordinary dental care. Patients and their parents independently filled in questionnaires including measures of fear and anxiety, behavioural symptoms, temperamental reactivity, and emotion regulation.
   Results. Study group patients referred because of DBMP differed from the reference group in all investigated aspects of personal characteristics. In the multivariate analyses, DF was the only variable with consistent discriminatory capacity through all age and gender subgroups. Aspects of anxiety, temperament, and behavioural symptoms contributed, but differently for different subgroups and at different levels of dental fear.
   Conclusions. Among older children and adolescents, DF deserves to be re-established as the single most important discriminating variable for DBMP at clearly lower scores than commonly used. Further research should focus on the different patterns of DBMP development, considering various personal characteristics that may trigger, maintain, or exacerbate young patients' vulnerability to DF and DBMP.

AB This research investigated the contribution of deficits in emotional clarity to children's socioemotional adjustment. Specifically, this study examined the proposal that deficits in emotional clarity are associated with maladaptive interpersonal stress responses, and that maladaptive interpersonal stress responses act as a mechanism linking deficits in emotional clarity to childhood depressive symptoms. Participants included 345 3rd graders (M age = 8.89, SD = .34) assessed at two waves, approximately one year apart; youth completed self-report measures of emotional clarity, responses to interpersonal stress, and depressive symptoms. Results supported the hypothesized process model linking deficits in emotional clarity, maladaptive interpersonal stress responses, and depressive symptoms, adjusting for prior depressive symptoms. Findings have implications for theories of emotional competence and for depression-intervention efforts aimed at fostering emotional understanding and adaptive interpersonal stress responses.

AB Background:
   A common polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, 5HTT) has been repeatedly shown to moderate the influence of childhood adversity and stressful life events on the development of psychopathology. Using data from the English and Romanian Adoptee Study, a prospective-longitudinal study of individuals (n = 125) exposed to severe early institutional deprivation (ID), we tested whether the effect of ID on adolescent emotional problems is moderated by 5HTT genotype and stressful life events in adolescence.
   Methods:
   Emotional problems were assessed using questionnaire data (age 11), and on the basis of the CAPA diagnostic interview (age 15). Additionally, the number of stressful life events was measured.
   Results:
   There was a significant effect for genotype (p = .003) and a gene x environment interaction (p = .008) that was independent of age at testing. Carriers of the s/l and s/s genotype who experienced severe ID showed the highest emotional problem scores, while l/l homozygotes in the severe ID group showed the lowest overall levels. Furthermore, s/s carriers in the severe ID group who experienced a high number of stressful life events between 11 and 15 years had the largest increases in emotional problem scores, while a low number of stressful life events was associated with the largest decrease (4-way interaction: p = .05).
   Conclusions:
   The effects of severe early ID on emotional problems in adolescence are moderated by 5HTT genotype, and influenced by stressful life events in adolescence.

AB Background:
   Increases in externalizing behaviors during the transition to adolescence may put children at risk for developing mental disorders and related problems. Although children's ability to regulate their emotions appears to be a key factor influencing risk for maladjustment, emotion processes during adolescence remain understudied. In this longitudinal study, we examined a multi-level mediational model in which emotion coaching by parents was posited to influence the ability of adolescents to regulate their emotions, which in turn influences their expression of problem behaviors.
   Methods:
   We recruited a representative community sample of 244 families with biological sibling pairs comprising a child in late elementary school and a child in middle school. Maternal meta-emotion interviews were coded for mother emotion coaching and adolescent difficulty with anger. Mothers also completed questionnaires on adolescent irritability. Ratings of adolescent problem behaviors were obtained from mother and teacher questionnaires completed at two time points. Using structural equation modeling, constructs were partitioned into components across older and younger siblings to examine shared and nonshared variance and contextual effects.
   Results:
   Cross-sectional data indicated that mothers' emotion coaching of anger was related to better anger regulation in adolescent siblings, which was, in turn related to less externalizing behavior. Although support for mediational effects was limited in the longitudinal data, both older and younger siblings' difficulties in regulating anger predicted adolescent externalizing behavior three years later. Additional longitudinal predictors of externalizing behavior were observed for younger siblings. In particular, emotion coaching of anger by mothers was associated with decreased externalizing behavior, while conversely, older siblings' externalizing behavior was associated with increased externalizing behavior in the younger siblings over time.
   Conclusions:
   The findings highlight the importance of considering family emotion processes in understanding adolescent problem behavior. Both maternal emotion coaching of adolescent anger and adolescent difficulty in regulating anger influenced adolescent externalizing behavior. Emotion coaching interventions seem worthy of consideration for enhancing the impact of prevention and intervention programs targeting youth externalizing behaviors.

AB This study investigated the link between exposure to violence and psychosocial adjustment for 442 Chinese secondary school students in Form 1-3. The students completed an inventory assessing exposure to violence through witnessing and through direct victimization in different settings (community, school, and home). Multiple measures and informants (i.e., self-report, teacher report, and school report) were used to assess emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning in adolescents. The results of this study showed that overall exposure to violence was related to emotional and behavior problems. High rates of exposure to violence across multiple contexts were found in this sample. After controlling for the co-occurrence of risk factors (e.g., exposure to violence in other settings), both witnessing school violence and being victimized by domestic violence were associated with emotional problems, whereas being victimized by community violence was related to behavior problems. These results suggest that there are differential effects of risks associated with different forms and settings of exposure.

   INTERVENTION
AB Background: Interventions to teach children healthy and effective coping skills could help reduce their risk of becoming overweight. However, few studies have examined whether an intervention that teaches coping strategies in weight management can influence children's coping behavior and psychosocial well-being.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an interactive, a child-centered, and a family-based program in promoting effective coping, behavioral health, and quality of life in Chinese American children.
   Methods: This study used a randomized controlled study of behavioral intervention in 67 Chinese American children (ages 8-10 years, normal weight and overweight) and their families. At baseline and 2, 6, and 8 months after baseline, children had anthropometric measurements and completed questionnaires related to coping skills and quality of life, and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Children in the intervention group reported using more active coping strategies and having a higher quality of life in the physical and emotional health domains than did children in the control group during the 8-month study. Children's behavioral problems did not differ between the intervention and the control groups. Changes in coping and psychosocial well-being were not related to change in body mass index in the entire group, except increased body mass index is associated with decreased emotional quality of life.
   Discussion: This culturally appropriate behavioral intervention was effective in promoting healthy coping and in improving quality of life in Chinese American children. Its utility for both optimal weight and overweight children suggests potential application of the intervention in a broad range of populations.

AB Results are presented from two pilot studies examining the potential influence of community-based after-school programs (ASPs) on regionally diverse Latino youth of varying ages. Study 1 examined relations between dimensions of ASP attendance and content, and ethnic identity development, and self-worth in urban Latino adolescents. In this study, higher ratings of the ASP's emphasis on ethnic socialization were associated with a more developed ethnic identity, while greater intensity of ASP participation and perceptions of ASP quality were associated with higher levels of self-worth. Study 2 examined relations between ASP participation and development of concentration and emotion regulation skills in rural Latino grade-school youth. In this study, youth who regularly attended the ASP demonstrated significantly better concentration and regulation skills than those who did not regularly attend, if they exhibited preexisting concentration and regulation problems. Findings illustrate how ASPs with varying strategies, activities, and assessment tools can be evaluated in the interest of designing future large-scale investigations into ASPs and Latino positive youth development.

AB Objective: To compare healthy late-preterm infants with their full-term counterparts from age 4 through 15 years for numerous standard cognitive, achievement, socio-emotional, and behavioral outcomes.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, 1991-2007.
   Participants: A total of 1298 children (53 born at 34-36 weeks' gestational age), and their families, observed from birth through age 15 years. None of the infants had major health problems before or immediately following birth, and all the infants were discharged from the hospital within 7 days.
   Main Exposure: Preterm status: children born late preterm (34-36 weeks) vs those born full term (37-41 weeks).
   Main Outcome Measures: Eleven standard outcomes measuring cognition, achievement, social skills, and behavioral/emotional problems using the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery Revised and the Child Behavior Checklist, administered repeatedly through age 15 years.
   Results: No consistent significant differences were found between late-preterm and full-term children for these standard measures from ages 4 to 15 years. Through age 15 years, the mean difference of most of these outcomes hovered around 0, indicating, along with small confidence intervals around these differences, that it is unlikely that healthy late-preterm infants are at any meaningful disadvantage regarding these measures.
   Conclusion: Late-preterm infants born otherwise healthy seem to have no real burdens regarding cognition, achievement, behavior, and socioemotional development throughout childhood.

DT Article
ID PERSONALITY; EXPERIENCE; DIMENSIONS; MUTILATION; MEDIATOR; SCALE
AB Objectives. This study investigates vulnerabilities to deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents, specifically focusing on peer victimisation and alexithymia.
   Design. Correlational survey design.
   Methods. Three hundred and twenty-five secondary school students completed self-report questionnaires asking their history of DSH and bullying, and scales assessing alexithymia and depression.
   Results. Self-harming adolescents reported more victimization and alexithymic symptomology than participants who had never engaged in DSH. Alexithymia moderated, and partially mediated, the relationship between bullying and DSH. Bullying and DSH significantly co-varied when participants' alexithymia was moderate or high, but not when participants' alexithymia was low. The relationship between alexithymia and DSH was fully mediated by depression. The relationship between bullying and DSH was also moderated by depression. Depression moderated the relationship between alexithymia and DSH.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest stressors in the social environment (e.g. bullying) are more likely to facilitate DSH when an adolescent has poor emotion regulation and communication skills and when an individual is experiencing mood difficulties.

AB This article provides a review of research into the social and emotional functioning of adolescents with specific language impairment (SLI). In particular, we focus on peer relations, peer friendships, bullying, emotional difficulties and psychiatric difficulties. As a group, adolescents with SLI tend to be more vulnerable to problems in these domains than are typical adolescents. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among those with SLI, and some individuals experience positive outcomes. We stress the need to understand adolescence and SLI in a developmental context. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research findings for service provision to support the needs of young people with language impairments.

AB This article applies the tenets of Bernard's in Counselor Edu Supervision 19: 60-68, (1979) discrimination model of clinical supervision to the supervision needs of those who provide direct care to adolescents in residential treatment due to abuse, neglect, behavioral, or emotional problems. The article focuses on three areas (intentionality, flexibility, and professionalism) in which the model may be particularly effective in meeting the needs of youth care workers serving adolescents in residential treatment in the United States.

AB Researchers have not adequately addressed the unique characteristics of rural areas that influence the accessibility of services for families with children who have serious emotional problems. Understanding rurality is particularly important to "systems of care" grant sites because these grants are intended to restructure mental health service delivery by building upon the strengths of a community and addressing the community's needs. This qualitative study examines the barriers to and supports for participation in services within a rural system of care site through the reported experiences of eight caregivers and nine staff. Findings indicate families face many challenges related to rurality, including stigma, transportation, isolation, poverty, and service availability. In addition to these challenges, however, participants reported many meaningful supports such as the religious community and the close-knit community of families and service providers. We present implications for planning, implementing, and evaluating systems of care in rural areas.

AB Children with high dysregulated affect experience a range of emotional and behavioral problems, including aggression, delinquency, and low levels of prosocial behavior. Alongside this research, the psychopathy literature suggests that abnormally low levels of affect and emotional reactivity are associated with aggression and violence. The current study builds on prior research in the fields of affect regulation and psychopathy by testing the effects of affect dysregulation and deficient affect in predicting aggression and antisociality in 179 high-risk youth. Using structural equation modeling, results suggest that affect dysregulation and deficient affect are separate risk factors for aggression, as both constructs contributed independently to aggression while showing marginal relations with one another. Features of deficient affect, but not dysregulation, were robust predictors of violent and nonviolent offending. We discuss the importance of recognizing that diverse risk factors may lead to similar outcomes and highlight the heterogeneity in risk factors underlying aggressive behaviors.

DE Analysis; Suicidal behaviour; Adolescents; Action
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Introduction. - The answer to the various problems encountered during adolescence is experienced in the form of behavioural thoughts and/or action expressed in conduct. The failure to act could lead to suicidal ideation and its completion. Are there any risk factors? The general aim of this study was to describe the motives and methods of suicide among adolescents observed in Abidjan, in order to contribute to their care.
   Materials and methods. - The prospective study, referred to as descriptive, was initiated in the Mental Health Service of the National Public Health Institute in Abidjan from the 1(st) of June to the 31(st) of October 2005, within the setting of the resuscitation service of the University Hospital centers of Cocody, Treichville and the emergency department of the university hospital of Yopougon. The sociodemographic, clinical, therapeutic and evolutive data of suicidal behaviour was analysed in 42 subjects.
   Results. - The study shows the following observations: a predominance of emotional problems (52.38%) versus 38.10% of family conflicts and 7.14% of failure at school; the subjects had resorted to chemical means dominated by chloroquin (45.62%) followed by psychotropics 14.40%; suicide was completed impulsively in 85.71% of cases; except in one case, suicidal behaviour took place at home and 66.67% in the evening; only three suicidal adolescents were oriented towards a psychiatric unit.
   Conclusion. - Our study underlined the difficulties. Once the vital emergency has been managed, the solution would be the immediate orientation of suicidal adolescents towards psychiatric structures. This situation calls for a wider integration of psychiatry in health facilities in the Ivory Coast. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2009.

AB Childhood loneliness is characterised by children's perceived dissatisfaction with aspects of their social relationships. This 8-year prospective study investigates whether loneliness in childhood predicts depressive symptoms in adolescence, controlling for early childhood indicators of emotional problems and a sociometric measure of peer social preference. 296 children were tested in the infant years of primary school (T1 5 years of age), in the upper primary school (T2 9 years of age) and in secondary school (T3 13 years of age). At T1, children completed the loneliness assessment and sociometric interview. Their teachers completed externalisation and internalisation rating scales for each child. At T2, children completed a loneliness assessment, a measure of depressive symptoms, and the sociometric interview. At T3, children completed the depressive symptom assessment. An SEM analysis showed that depressive symptoms in early adolescence (age 13) were predicted by reports of depressive symptoms at age 8, which were themselves predicted by internalisation in the infant school (5 years). The interactive effect of loneliness at 5 and 9, indicative of prolonged loneliness in childhood, also predicted depressive symptoms at age 13. Parent and peer-related loneliness at age 5 and 9, peer acceptance variables, and duration of parent loneliness did not predict depression. Our results suggest that enduring peer-related loneliness during childhood constitutes an interpersonal stressor that predisposes children to adolescent depressive symptoms. Possible mediators are discussed.

AB Few studies on resilience in young children model risk appropriately and test theory-led hypotheses about its moderation. This study addressed both issues. Our hypothesis was that for preschool children's emotional/behavioral adjustment in the face of contextual risk protective factors should be located in the cognitive domain. Data were from the first two sweeps of the UK's Millennium Cohort Study. The final study sample was 4,748 three-year-old children clustered in 1,549 Lower layer Super Output Areas in nine strata. Contextual risk was measured at both area (with the Index of Multiple Deprivation) and family (with proximal and distal adverse life events experienced) level. Moderator variables were parenting, verbal and non-verbal ability, developmental milestones, and temperament. Multivariate multilevel models-that allowed for correlated residuals at both individual and area level-and univariate multilevel models estimated risk effects on specific and broad psychopathology. At baseline, proximal family risk, distal family risk and area risk were all associated with broad psychopathology, although the most parsimonious was the proximal family risk model. The area risk/broad psychopathology association remained significant even after family risk was controlled but not after family level socioeconomic disadvantage was controlled. The cumulative family risk was more parsimonious than the specific family risks model. Non-verbal ability moderated the effect of proximal family risk on conduct and emotional problems, and developmental milestones moderated the effect of proximal family risk on conduct problems. The findings highlight the importance of modeling contextual risk appropriately and of locating in the cognitive domain factors that buffer its effect on young children's adjustment.

AB Objective: To examine attentional bias towards angry and happy faces in 8-12 year old children with anxiety disorders (n = 29) and non-anxious controls (n = 24).
   Method: Children completed a visual-probe task in which pairs of angry/neutral and happy/neutral faces were displayed for 500 ms and were replaced by a visual probe in the spatial location of one of the faces.
   Results: Children with more severe anxiety showed an attentional bias towards angry relative to neutral faces, compared with anxious children who had milder anxiety and non-anxious control children, both of whom did not show an attentional bias for angry faces. Unexpectedly, all groups showed an attentional bias towards happy faces relative to neutral ones.
   Conclusions: Anxiety symptom severity increases attention to threat stimuli in anxious children. This association may be due to differing threat appraisal processes or emotion regulation strategies. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Skills training is a crucial mode of treatment in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993b), yet a psychometrically sound measure of DBT skills use does not exist. We adapted the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist (RWCCL; Vitaliano, Russo, Carr, Maiuro, & Becker, 1985) to create the DBT Ways of Coping Checklist (DBT-WCCL). Using factor analysis procedures, two subscales emerged: one assessing coping via DBT skills, the DBT Skills Subscale (DSS), and one assessing coping via dysfunctional means, the Dysfunctional Coping Subscale (DCS). Principal component, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and content validity analyses suggested that the scale has good to excellent psychometric properties. In addition, the DSS successfully discriminated patients who received skills training during 4 months of treatment from patients who did not. Moderators of skills use are also discussed. The DBT-WCCL appears to be a promising new measure of DBT skills use. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol: 66:563-582, 2010.

AB Objective To examine: (a) child maltreatment's association with young adult daily cigarette smoking, (b) variations in this association by gender, and (c) mediators of this association. Methods For all study participants (N = 1,125, 94% African American), data from multiple sources (e.g., child welfare records) were collected prospectively at child, adolescent, and young adult time points. Authors enlisted multivariate probit regression for objectives a and b versus exploratory and confirmatory mediation strategies for objective c. Results Maltreatment was significantly associated with daily cigarette smoking. Although not moderated by gender, this relation was fully mediated by adolescent indicators of family support/stability, social adjustment, and cognitive/school performance along with young adult indicators of educational attainment, life satisfaction, substance abuse, and criminality. Conclusions Maltreatment places low-income, minority children at risk for daily cigarette smoking and other deleterious young adult health outcomes. Recommended treatment targets include family support/stability, emotion regulation, social skills, and cognitive/academic functioning.

AB Objective The goal of this study was to examine respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of para-sympathetic nervous system-linked cardiac activity, and skin conductance level (SCL), a sympathetic indicator, as moderators of the link between child maltreatment and adolescent aggression. Method Participants were 234 maltreated (48.3% male) and 128 (57.8% male) comparison youth aged 9-16 years participating in wave 2 of a longitudinal study. Results Regression analyses suggest that among boys, high RSA may be protective against the effects of maltreatment on aggressive behavior. Among girls, the moderating effect of RSA was further moderated by SCL reactivity such that low levels of both baseline RSA and SCL reactivity, or conversely high levels of both baseline RSA and SCL reactivity, exacerbated the link between maltreatment and aggression. Conclusions High RSA may protect against the effects of maltreatment on aggressive behavior, though this effect may be moderated by SCL reactivity among girls.

AB Objective: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in pathophysiology of anxiety and depression. It was proposed that NPY counteracts corticotropin-releasing factor-mediated stress effects to maintain emotional regulation. We investigated NPY concentrations in a sample of first episode medication-naive adolescent patients with MDD with regards to their history of suicide attempts.
   Method: 33 adolescents with MDD were enrolled. 11 patients were excluded due to comorbidity of another psychiatric illness. In 22 adolescents with MDD patients, the plasma concentrations of NPY were assessed. The Beck Depression Inventory-Turkish Version and the Beck Anxiety Scale- Turkish Version were used to rate the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
   Results: Our sample of depressed patients showed lower levels of NPY compared to healthy controlsWhen the depressed patients were grouped with regards to suicidality, both groups did not show any significant differences. NPY levels were negatively correlated with duration of illness and feelings of guilt, and positively correlated with anxiety. When anxiety was taken as a covariate, significant correlations between NPY levels and feelings of guilt disappered; whereas, when duration of illness was taken as a covariate correlations were still significant.
   Conclusions: Adolescent depressed patients were found to have lower NPY plasma levels compared to healthy controls. Plasma NPY concentrations were decreasing with duration of illness, increasing with feelings of guilt and anxiety severity. Plasma NPY levels in adolescents MOD might indicate a predisposition to anxiety-related depression.

AB With this study the suitability of two instruments for assessing changes in the quality of life was examined. Data were collected in mother - child rehabilitation centres. The Kiddy-KINDL (R) (n = 727), a parent - based instrument for assessing health related quality of life in children (age 4 to 7 years) and the Kid-KINDL (R) (n = 716), a self - report questionnaire for children (age 8-12 years) were used at the beginning and the end of rehabilitation. In addition in a subgroup of n = 420 children the Child Behavior Checklist was used in order to identify behavioral and emotional problems. The psychometric analyses revealed that both instruments were well accepted by mothers and children. The reliabilities of the sum scores as well as the convert validity were sufficient. The results of the Kid-KINDL (R) were affected by low reliabilities and ceiling effects on subscales. Thus, in repeated measurements only changes of sum scores can be interpreted with sufficient accuracy. However, the use of the self-report questionnaires can be recommended because the known-group validity was high. Both versions of the KINDL (R) are suitable for assessing treatment effects of preventive measures in rehabilitation clinics, considering the low reliabilities of subscales for the Kid-KINDL (R).

AB Recent models of anxiety disorders emphasize abnormalities in emotional reactivity and regulation. However, the empirical basis for this view is limited, particularly in children and adolescents. The present study examined whether anxious children suffer both negative emotional hyper-reactivity and deficits in cognitive emotion regulation. Participants were 49 children aged 10-17 with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder as their primary diagnosis, as well as 42 age- and gender-matched non-anxious controls. After completing a diagnostic interview and self-report questionnaires, participants were presented with pictures of threatening scenes with the instructions either to simply view them or to use reappraisal, a cognitive emotion regulation strategy, to decrease their negative emotional response. Emotion ratings, content analysis of reappraisal responses, and reports of everyday use of reappraisal were used to assess negative emotional reactivity, reappraisal ability, efficacy and frequency. Relative to controls, children with anxiety disorders (1) experienced greater negative emotional responses to the images, (2) were less successful at applying reappraisals, but (3) showed intact ability to reduce their negative emotions following reappraisal. They also (4) reported less frequent use of reappraisal in everyday life. Implications for the assessment and treatment of childhood anxiety disorders are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emotional reactions involve changes in both cognitive and bodily processes. Therefore, effective emotion regulation may also involve modulation of responses in both of these systems. The present study investigated the relationship between regulation of cognition and regulation of the heart in children and adolescents, using a go/nogo task in combination with the induction of negative emotions. Behavioral, temperamental and event-related brain potential (ERP) indicators of inhibitory cognitive control were collected, as was a measure of parasympathetic control of the heart (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA). Independently of age. RSA was correlated with nogo N2 magnitudes during the emotion-induction procedure. RSA during the task was also correlated with N2 latencies and with behavioral accuracy before, during and after the emotion induction. Resting RSA was correlated with individual differences in the capacity for effortful cognitive control, as measured by questionnaire. These results suggest that emotional responses in seemingly distinct neurophysiological systems may be regulated in an integrated fashion throughout the developmental span tested.

AB Many problem behaviors in youth have been attributed to maladaptive self-regulation in response to frustration. Frontolimbic networks that promote flexible as well as over- and undercontrolled regulation could provide evidence linking cortical mechanisms of self-regulation to the development of internalizing or externalizing symptomology. Specifically, ineffective dorsally mediated inhibitory control may be associated with rule-breaking and substance use behaviors, whereas overengagement of ventral limbic systems responsible for self-monitoring of errors may increase risk of developing anxious and depressed symptomology. In this study, a sample of 9- to 13-year-old children were presented with an emotional go/no-go task. Event-related potentials were used to identify differences in cortical mechanisms related to inhibitory control (indexed with the stimulus-locked medial frontal negativity) and self-monitoring (indexed with the error-related negativity). These measurements were then related to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. As predicted, externalizing problems were associated with smaller medial frontal negativity amplitudes, which indicate undercontrolled self-regulation and poor dorsal mediation of actions. Internalizing symptoms were related to larger error-related negativity amplitudes, demonstrating overregulation and overengagement of ventral limbic systems. These findings suggest that the use of event-related potential methodology with paradigms that elicit cognition emotion can provide insight into the neural mechanisms of regulatory deficits that result in problem behaviors in youth.

AB In the current study, we examined parent gender differences in feelings (negativity and positivity) and perceptions of child behavioural and emotional problems in adoptive and biological parent child dyads. In a sample of 85 families, we used a novel within-family adoption design in which one child was adopted and one child was a biological child of the couple, and tested whether the links between parent feelings and child maladjustment included effects of passive gene environment correlation. Parents reported more negativity and less positivity as well as higher levels of externalizing behaviour for the adopted child compared to the non-adopted child, although effect sizes were small and no longer statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Fathers and mothers did not differ significantly in their reports of positive and negative feelings towards their children or in regard to child externalizing and internalizing behaviours. The correlations between parental negativity and positivity and child externalizing and internalizing were similar for fathers and mothers, and for adopted and non-adopted children. The findings suggest similar parent child relationship processes for fathers and mothers, and that genetic transmission of behaviour from parent to child does not account for the association between parental warmth and hostility and child-adjustment problems.

AB Objective: Affect regulation models of disordered eating propose that disordered eating behaviors function as maladaptive efforts to modulate or escape from aversive emotional states. Prior studies have shown both negative affect and emotion regulation factors to be significantly associated with disordered eating and body dissatisfaction in women. The purpose of the current investigation was to evaluate whether emotion regulation difficulties contribute to disordered eating and body dissatisfaction in men.
   Method: Two hundred and ninety-six undergraduate men completed a series of questionnaires assessing negative affect, difficulties in emotion regulation, disordered eating, and body dissatisfaction.
   Results: A series of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties accounted for unique variance in both outcome measures after accounting for the variance associated with BMI and negative affect.
   Discussion: Results are discussed in terms of the role of emotion regulation difficulties in the etiology and maintenance of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in men. (C) 2009 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The current study investigated the patterns of aggressive behavior displayed in a sample of 282 students in the 4th through 7th grades (M age = 11.28; SD = 1.82). Using cluster analyses, two distinct patterns of physical aggression emerged for both boys and girls with one aggressive cluster showing mild levels of reactive aggression and one group showing high levels of both reactive and proactive aggression. Both aggressive clusters showed problems with anger dysregulation, impulsivity, thrill and adventure seeking, positive outcome expectancies for aggression, and higher rates of bullying. However, the combined cluster was most severe on all of these variables and only the combined aggressive group differed from non-aggressive students on their level of callous-unemotional traits. Similar patterns of findings emerged for relational aggression but only for girls.

AB This study examined the Response Styles Theory in a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample (N = 722) of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. We examined the role of response styles (rumination, distraction, and problem-solving) as predictors of changes in depressive symptoms over a seven-month period. Higher levels of rumination and lower levels of problem-solving and distraction were associated with increases in depressive symptoms over time. Response style ratio scores (rumination scores divided by the sum of distraction and problem-solving scores) also predicted increases in depressive symptoms over time. Girls reported greater depressive symptoms compared to boys, and both rumination and response style ratio score statistically accounted for the gender difference in depressive symptoms. Clinical implications include the importance of problem-solving training and rumination reduction techniques in preventive interventions.

AB Background:
   Emotion regulation involves intrinsic and extrinsic processes responsible for managing one's emotions toward goal accomplishment. Research on emotion regulation has predominantly focused on early developmental periods and the majority of emotion regulation research examining the pre-adult years has lacked a comprehensive theoretical framework. The current study examined the use of two strategies of emotion regulation during childhood and adolescents, as conceptualised within Gross's (1998) process-oriented model.
   Methods:
   To determine the use, norms and development of the Expressive Suppression and Cognitive Reappraisal strategies, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) was administered to 1,128 participants aged between 9 and 15 years. Three data collection phases, each one year apart, enabled investigation of developmental patterns in the use of the two strategies.
   Results:
   As predicted, Suppression use was found to be lower for older participants compared to their younger peers, and over time participants reported less use of this strategy. Older participants also scored lower on Reappraisal but stability over time was found. Also as expected, males reported more Suppression use compared to females.
   Conclusions:
   By documenting the development and norms for Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression in a community sample of children and adolescents, the current study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of these two ER strategies during these developmental periods.

AB Recent literature on the determinants of academic motivation has shown that parenting and emotions are central elements in understanding students' achievement goals. The authors of this study set out to examine the predictive relationship between parental behaviors during the last year of elementary school and adolescents' achievement goals at the end of their first year of middle school. Manifestations of anxiety and depression in Grade 6 were examined as explanatory mechanisms for this relationship. A total of 498 early adolescents participated in the study. The results of structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that parental involvement predicted mastery goals, whereas parental control predicted performance goals among these adolescents. This relationship was mediated by the adolescents' symptoms of anxiety. These results underscore the need for educators and clinicians to consider parental behaviors and emotional problems among elementary school students when seeking to understand the behaviors and learning strategies adopted by these students in middle school.

AB This is a follow-up to a study demonstrating that rough-and-tumble play was related to physical aggression in the preschool years. Fathers reported on the frequency of father-child rough-and-tumble play interactions, and the degree to which fathers were dominant in the play dyad was observed and coded from play interactions. In this follow-up study, school-aged children's physically aggressive behaviors and emotion regulation abilities were assessed with questionnaires 5 years later. Higher frequencies of father-child rough-and-tumble play in the preschool years were associated with more physical aggression and worse emotion regulation 5 years later for children whose fathers were less dominant, over and above the effects of physical aggression in the preschool years. Rough-and-tumble play was unrelated to these measures among children whose fathers were more dominant during play. This study shows that early rough-and-tumble play continues to be related to children's psychosocial adjustment over time, and that the effect remains moderated by the quality of the father-child relationship during play.

AB A sample of 3278 students (aged 15-16 years) were surveyed to investigate the interrelations between depression (RBDI; The Finnish modification of the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory), antisocial behaviour (YSR; Youth Self-Report) and perceived social support from family, friends and significant other (PSSS-R; the Perceived Social Support Scale-Revised). The study aimed especially to control for the effect of perceived social support in the comorbidity between depression and antisocial behaviour. The results indicate firstly that decreased perceived social support was associated with both depression and antisocial behaviour in both sexes. Similarly, antisocial behaviour was associated with depression in both sexes. Perceived social support modified comorbidity between depression and antisocial behaviour, but antisocial behaviour still remained independently associated with depression. Thus, perceived social support did not explain the found comorbidity between depression and antisocial behaviour.</.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chronic conditions may be associated with suicide risk. This study aimed to specify the extent to which youth chronic conditions are at risk for suicidality and self-harm.
   METHODS: Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in 10- to 19-year-olds with and without chronic physical and/or mental health conditions.
   RESULTS: Independent of race, socioeconomic status, absent parent, special education status, substance use, and emotional distress, youth with co-occurring chronic physical and mental conditions (n = 4099) had significantly higher odds of self-harm (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5 [99% confidence interval (CI): 2.3-2.8), suicidal ideation (OR: 2.5 [99% CI: 2.3-2.8), and suicide attempts (OR: 3.5 [99% CI: 3.1-3.9]) than healthy peers (n = 106 967), as did those with chronic mental conditions alone (n = 8752). Youth with chronic physical conditions alone (n = 12 554) were at slightly elevated risk for all 3 outcomes. Findings were similar among male and female youth, with a risk gradient by grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chronic physical conditions are associated with a slightly elevated risk for self-harm, suicidal thinking, and attempted suicide; chronic mental conditions are associated with an increased risk for all 3 outcomes. Co-occurring chronic physical and mental conditions are associated with an increased risk for self-harm and suicidal ideation that is similar to the risk in chronic mental conditions and with an attempted suicide risk in excess of that predicted by the chronic mental health conditions alone. Preventive interventions for these youth should be developed and evaluated. Pediatrics 2010; 125: 889-895

AB It was of interest to determine if hemispheric differences in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) volume would be related to behavioral inhibition observed in a peer-play setting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out in 23 individuals (19 males and 4 females) at an average age of 14.87 +/- 1.14 years who were either at high or low risk for alcohol dependence. All subjects had previously been evaluated in a preschool peer play paradigm (5.03 +/- 0.78 years) assessing behavioral inhibition. Region of interest measures were traced for the OFC and the amygdala, and confirmed with voxel based morphometry. Behavioral inhibition, a behavioral tendency that often occurs in a novel setting in reaction to strangers, includes the following: greater time spent next to the mother, greater time staring at another child, and longer latency to begin play with another child. A significant relationship was seen between greater right OFC volume and indicators of behavioral inhibition including greater time spent proximal to their mother and greater time staring at the other child. Also, larger amygdala volume was associated with more time spent proximal to the mother. Behavioral control, including both over- and under-control, is likely to be subserved by neural circuitry associated with emotion regulation including the right OFC and the amygdala.

   CONFLICT; POLYMORPHISM 5-HTTLPR; PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; MARITAL CONFLICT
AB Background: Serotonin genes have been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); prior work suggests that serotonin may interact with psychosocial stressors in ADHD, perhaps via mechanisms involved in emotional dysregulation. Because the development of behavioral and emotional regulation depends heavily both on the child's experience within the family context and the child's construals of that experience, children's appraisals of inter-parental conflict are a compelling candidate potentiator of the effects of variation within the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) on liability for ADHD.
   Method: 304 youth from the local community underwent a multi-informant diagnostic assessment procedure to identify ADHD cases and non-ADHD controls. Youth also completed the Children's Perception of Inter-Parental Conflict (CPIC) scale to assess appraisals of self-blame in relation to their parents' marital disputes. The trialleic configuration of 5HTTLPR (long/short polymorphism with A>G substitution) was genotyped and participants were assigned as having high (La/La N = 78), intermediate (La/Lg, La/short, N = 137), or low (Lg/Lg, Lg/short, short/short, N = 89) serotonin transporter activity genotypes. Teacher reported behavior problems were examined as the target outcome to avoid informant overlap for moderator and outcome measures.
   Results: Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated significant 5HTTLPR x self-blame interactions for ADHD symptoms. Examination of the interactions indicated positive relations between reports of self-blame and ADHD symptoms for those with the high and low serotonin activity genotypes. There was no relation between self-blame and ADHD for those with intermediate activity 5HTTLPR genotypes.
   Conclusion: Both high and low serotonergic activity may exert risk for ADHD when coupled with psychosocial distress such as children's self-blame in relation to inter-parental conflict. Results are discussed in relation to the role of serotonin in the etiology of the ADHD and related externalizing behaviors.

AB Using an ecologically informed, developmental psychopathology perspective, the present study examined contextual and intrapersonal predictors of depressive symptoms and externalizing problems among Korean American adolescents. Specifically, the role of cultural context (self-construals), family processes (family cohesion and conflict), and anger regulation (anger control, anger suppression, and outward anger expression) were examined. Study participants were N = 166 Korean American adolescents ranging from 11 to 15 years old (M = 13.0, SD = 1.2). Results showed that depressive symptoms were significantly associated with lower levels of perceived family cohesion, higher levels of perceived family conflict intensity, and higher levels of anger suppression. Externalizing problems were associated with male gender, a weaker interdependent self-construal, higher levels of perceived family conflict, lower levels of anger control, and higher levels of outward anger expression. The distinction between specific versus common factors associated with depressive symptoms and externalizing problems was discussed with an eye toward prevention or intervention strategies targeting specific coping mechanisms (e.g., generating alternatives to anger suppression) or developing psychoeducational approaches to facilitate family processes.

TI Vulnerability factors for disaster-induced child post-traumatic stress
   disorder: the case for low family resilience and previous mental illness

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether parent report of family resilience predicted children's disaster-induced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general emotional symptoms, independent of a broad range of variables including event-related factors, previous child mental illness and social connectedness.
   Methods: A total of 568 children (mean age = 10.2 years, SD = 1.3) who attended public primary schools, were screened 3 months after Cyclone Larry devastated the Innisfail region of North Queensland. Measures included parent report on the Family Resilience Measure and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-emotional subscale and child report on the PTSD Reaction Index, measures of event exposure and social connectedness.
   Results: Sixty-four students (11.3%) were in the severe-very severe PTSD category and 53 families (28.6%) scored in the poor family resilience range. A lower family resilience score was associated with child emotional problems on the SDQ and longer duration of previous child mental health difficulties, but not disaster-induced child PTSD or child threat perception on either bivariate analysis, or as a main or moderator variable on multivariate analysis (main effect: adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13-2.44). Similarly, previous mental illness was not a significant predictor of child PTSD in the multivariate model (OR(adj) = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.16-3.61).
   Conclusion: In this post-disaster sample children with existing mental health problems and those of low-resilience families were not at elevated risk of PTSD. The possibility that the aetiological model of disaster-induced child PTSD may differ from usual child and adolescent conceptualizations is discussed.

AB The goal of the current study is to examine whether neuroticism, cognitive emotional regulation deficits, and/or their interaction predict increased engagement in risky behaviors following increases in symptoms of depression. At Time 1, 411 Chinese adolescents from Yue Yang, Hunan completed self-report measures assessing cognitive emotion regulation, depressive symptoms, and risky behavior engagement. Follow-up assessments occurred once a month for 6 months, and participants completed measures assessing depressive symptoms and risky behavior engagement. In line with our hypotheses, results of idiographic, multilevel modeling analyses indicated that individuals who exhibited high levels of neuroticism and a tendency to utilize maladaptive cognitive emotional regulation strategies were more likely than individuals possessing only one or neither of these vulnerability factors to report greater engagement in risky behaviors following increases in symptoms of depression.

AB The characterization of adolescence as a time of "storm and stress" remains an open debate. Intense and frequent negative affect during this period has been hypothesized to explain the increased rates of affective disorders, suicide, and accidental death during this time of life. Yet some teems: emerge from adolescence with minimal turmoil. We provide a neurobiological model of adolescence Mat proposes an imbalance in the development of subcortical limbic (e.g., amygdala) relative to prefrontal cortical regions as a potential mechanism for heightened emotionality during this period. Empirical support for this model is provided from recent behavioral and human imaging studies on the development of emotion regulation. We then provide examples of environmental factors that may exacerbate imbalances in amygdala-ventrofrontal function increasing risk for anxiety related behaviors. Finally we present data from human and mouse studies to illustrate how genetic factors may enhance or diminish this risk. Together these studies provide a converging methods approach for understanding the highly variable :stress and turmoil experienced in adolescence. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objectives. Reports on child health in Canada often refer to the disproportionate burden of poor health experienced by Aboriginal children and youth, yet little national data are available. This paper describes the health of First Nations and Inuit children and youth based on the First Nations and Inuit Regional Health Survey (FNIRHS).
   Study design. The FNIRHS combines data from 9 regional surveys conducted in 1996-1997 in Aboriginal reserve communities in all provinces. The target population consisted of all on-reserve communities. All households or a random sample of households or adults (depending on province) were selected based on their population representation. Methods. One child was randomly selected from each participating household, except in Ontario and Nova Scotia, where children were randomly selected based upon their population representation. Alberta did not include the section on children's health in their regional survey.
   Results. Approximately 84% of adults, who were proxy respondents for their child, rated their children's health as very good or excellent. The most frequently reported conditions were ear problems (15%), followed by allergies (13%) and asthma (12%). Broken bones or fractures were the most frequently reported injuries (13%). Respondents reported that 17% of children had behavioural or emotional problems. Overall, 76% of children were reported to get along with the family "very well" or "quite well."
   Conclusions. While most respondents rated their child's health as very good or excellent, injuries, emotional and behavioural problems, respiratory conditions and ear problems were reported among many Aboriginal children. Issues such as substance abuse, exposure to violence and academic performance were not addressed in the 10 core survey questions. Clearly there is a need for more in-depth information about both the physical and emotional health of Aboriginal children and youth. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2010; 69(2):158-167)

AB Strategies that children use for coping with stressors are known to be related to emotional adjustment, but not enough is understood about specific links with social anxiety and depression. The present investigation tested differentiated associations of social anxiety and depression with specific types of coping strategies, and evaluated the direction of these associations over time. In Study 1, 404 children aged 8-13 years completed a coping scale modified from Kochendefer-Ladd and Skinner (Developmental Psychology 38:267-278, 2002) in order to evaluate factor structure and subscale internal consistency. In Study 2, 270 8-11-year-old children completed depression and social anxiety scales, a sociometric survey, and the coping scale from Study 1, with a follow-up timepoint 9 months later. In Study 1, factor analysis revealed six internally consistent coping subscales. In Study 2, social anxiety and depression were found to have distinctive longitudinal associations with subsequent coping strategies. Decreased problem-solving, social support-seeking, and distraction were uniquely predicted by depression but not by social anxiety. Internalising coping was a stronger outcome of social anxiety, and increased externalising was uniquely predicted by depression. There was also some evidence for a moderating role of peer relations. However, none of the coping strategies predicted changes in depression or social anxiety over the two timepoints. These results highlight the impact that emotional adjustment may have on children's coping strategies, and clarify important distinctions between social anxiety and depression in relation to coping.

AB Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT-C) is a manualized group psychotherapy for children ages 9-13 years old, which was developed specifically to increase social-emotional resiliency through the enhancement of mindful attention. Program development is described along with results of the initial randomized controlled trial. We tested the hypotheses that children randomized to participate in MBCT-C would show greater reductions in (a) attention problems, (b) anxiety symptoms, and (c) behavior problems than wait-listed age and gender-matched controls. Participants were boys and girls aged 9-13 (N = 25), mostly from low-income, inner-city households. Twenty-one of 25 children were ethnic minorities. A randomized cross-lagged design provided a wait-listed control group, a second trial of MBCT-C, and a 3-month follow-up of children who completed the first trial. Measures included the Child Behavior Checklist, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children. Participants who completed the program showed fewer attention problems than wait-listed controls and those improvements were maintained at three months following the intervention [F (1, 1, 18) = 5.965, p = .025, Cohen's d = .42]. A strong relationship was found between attention problems and behavior problems (r = .678, p < .01). Reductions in attention problems accounted for 46% of the variance of changes in behavior problems, although attention changes proved to be a non-significant mediator of behavior problems (p = .053). Significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and behavior problems were found for those children who reported clinically elevated levels of anxiety at pretest (n = 6). Results show that MBCT-C is a promising intervention for attention and behavior problems, and may reduce childhood anxiety symptoms.

AB Background:
   Childhood bipolar disorder remains a controversial but increasingly diagnosed disorder that is associated with significant impairment, chronic course and treatment resistance. Therefore, the search for prodromes or early markers of risk for later childhood bipolar disorder may be of great importance for prevention and/or early identification.
   Methods:
   Literature searches were conducted to identify reviews, case reports and empirical papers addressing the issue of prodromes of childhood bipolar disorder.
   Results:
   A total of 54 articles were found that related to bipolar prodromes, risk factors for later childhood bipolar disorder, childhood risk for adult bipolar disorder, mania manifestations in early childhood, and neuropsychological and biological markers of childhood bipolar disorder. A review of articles suggest (a) childhood bipolar prodromes may be detectable prior to the onset of the disorder, (b) prodromal symptoms may display episodicity during childhood, (c) there is evidence of possible endophenotypic markers such as deficits in executive function, sustained attention, and emotion labeling, (d) there is a potential association with functional, structural, and biochemical alterations evident in brain structures involved in mood regulation, (e) a link between childhood bipolar disorder with early tempermental markers, such as emotional regulation and behavioral disinhibition and (f) there is some early but promising evidence of effective psychotherapeutic preventions.
   Conclusions:
   There has been very limited investigation of early prodromes of childhood bipolar disorder. Based on the promising findings of prodromes as well as high-risk states and possible endophenotypic markers, more controlled and targeted investigations into the early markers of bipolar disorder appear warranted and potentially fruitful. Until such longitudinal studies with appropriate controls are conducted, specific markers for bipolar prodromes will remain elusive, although evidence suggests they are manifest in at least some subgroups. The finding of promising psychotherapeutic prevention programs underscores the need to find specific and sensitive markers of bipolar prodromes in childhood.

AB Background:
   Given the long-term morbidity of juvenile-onset major depressive disorder (MDD), it is timely to consider whether more effort should be dedicated to its primary and secondary prevention.
   Methods:
   We reviewed studies of prodromal symptoms that may herald a first episode pediatric MDD and considered whether that literature has made an impact on secondary prevention (efforts to prevent progression from symptoms to full disorder). We also reviewed studies of children at familial risk for MDD that addressed atypical affectivity and the regulation of sad, dysphoric affect (mood repair) and related physiological systems, and considered whether research in those areas has made an impact on primary prevention of pediatric MDD (efforts to prevent the disorder).
   Results:
   A compelling body of literature indicates that depressive symptoms in youngsters predict subsequent MDD across the juvenile (and early adult) years and that any combination of several symptoms for at least one week is informative in that regard. These findings are echoed in the case selection criteria used by many secondary prevention programs. Convergent findings also indicate that (compared to typical peers) young offspring at familial risk for depression manifest low positive affectivity and compromised mood repair, along with signs of dysfunction in three intertwined physiological systems that contribute to affectivity and mood repair (the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, cerebral hemispheric asymmetry, and cardiac vagal control). While all these affect-related parameters are suitable for case selection and as intervention targets, they have not yet made an impact on primary prevention programs.
   Conclusions:
   According to recent meta-analyses, attempts to prevent pediatric depression have not lived up to expectations. Based on our review, possible reasons for this include: (a) the use of case selection criteria that yield samples heterogeneous with regard to whether the symptoms are truly prodromal to an episode of MDD or are trait-like (which could affect response to the intervention), (b) failure to fully capitalize on the broad-ranging literature on vulnerability to pediatric MDD, as evidenced by the infrequent use of family history of depression (a robust index of vulnerability) or combined indices of vulnerability for case selection, and (c) lack of synchrony between dimensions of vulnerability and the content of the prevention program, as indicated by the overwhelming use of cognitive-behavioral interventions, irrespective of subjects' age, developmental readiness, and whether or not they evidenced the relevant cognitive vulnerability. Prevention trials of pediatric MDD could benefit from new approaches to case selection that combine various indices of vulnerability, more effective use of existing findings, and new or modified interventions that are developmentally sensitive.

AB Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 723) were used to test whether the effects of fathers' supportive parenting on children's school readiness are greater when mothers are least supportive. We distinguished between academic and social dimensions of school readiness. Mothers' and fathers' parenting was assessed in dyadic parent child videotaped sessions during the preschool period. Results for both academic and social outcomes indicated that fathers' supportiveness had larger benefits for children at lower levels of mothers' supportiveness. In fact, fathers' supportiveness was associated with children's school readiness only when mothers scored average or below on supportiveness. Mothers' supportiveness was similarly associated with children's social school readiness when fathers scored average or below on supportiveness. However, mothers' supportiveness was associated with children's academic school readiness even when fathers scored above average on supportiveness. The results suggest that fathers may influence child development most as potential buffers against unsupportive mother parenting. Further research is needed to replicate these analyses in a less socioeconomically advantaged sample.

AB This longitudinal study used multilevel modeling to examine the relationships between witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV), community and school violence exposure (CSVE), family social support, gender, and depression over 2 years within a sample of 100 school-aged children. We found significant between-child differences in both the initial levels of depression and the trajectories of depression; depression over time was positively associated with change in witnessing IPV and CSVE and negatively associated with change in support. Two significant 3-way interactions were found: Gender and initial support, as well as gender and initial witnessing IPV, both significantly moderated the effect of change in witnessing IPV on the children's depression over time.

AB In the current study, five annual wave longitudinal data were employed to examine the associations between Big Five personality traits and problem behavior (i.e., depression and aggression) in early to middle and middle to late adolescent boys and girls. Using cross-lagged panel models, we simultaneously tested two competing hypothesis: (1) a vulnerability hypothesis stating that Big Five personality traits would affect problem behavior and (2) a scar hypothesis asserting that problem behavior would affect Big Five personality traits. Results supported both hypotheses, as the effects between personality and problem behavior were bidirectional. These findings have important theoretical and clinical implications, as they suggest a transactional process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Whereas non-suicidal self injury (NSSI) is reported in 13-23% of adolescents and is an increasingly studied topic, there has been little investigation into the pathophysiology behind self-injury. This commentary examines recent research into pain and emotional distress to discuss implications for the manner we should understand, research, and treat NSSI in the future. Research indicates that adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to NSSI behaviors due to neurodevelopmental changes in the processing of distress and pain. Additionally, emotional distress and physical pain neural pathways may have been altered in these individuals, leading to the development of NSSI behaviors during adolescence when changes in ongoing brain development may lead to further emotional dysregulation and poor impulse control. Further studies that directly characterize the relationship between emotional distress and physical pain in adolescence, as well as the neural differences between self-injurers and non-self-injurers, are needed.

AB Appropriate help-seeking is widely recognized as a protective factor, and vital for early treatment and prevention of mental health problems during adolescence. General medical practitioners (GPs), that is, family doctors, provide a vital role in the identification of adolescents with mental health problems and the provision of treatment as well as access to other specialists in mental health care services. The current study examined the association between suicidal ideation and intentions to seek help from a GP for suicidal thoughts, emotional problems and physical health problems, using a sample of 590 Australian high school students that was 56.7% female and aged 13-18 years (M = 15.56 years, SD = .66 years). Higher levels of suicidal ideation and general psychological distress were related to lower intentions to seek help from a GP for suicidal and physical problems. The results suggest that even at subclinical levels, increases in suicidal ideation or psychological distress may lead to help avoidance. School personnel and other gatekeepers need to be aware of this trend in order to be more assertive in encouraging and supporting appropriate help-seeking for mental health problems. School health promotion programs should consider including information to explicitly address the help-negation process.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of child overweight in a regional sample of primary school-aged children, and to examine the relationships among child overweight, psychopathology, and social functioning. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 in 100 primary schools of a large French region, with 2,341 children aged 6-11 randomly selected. Child weight and height, lifestyle variables (leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), watching television (TV), playing video games), and socioeconomic characteristics were collected in parent-administered questionnaires. Child psychopathology outcomes were assessed using child-and parent-reported instruments (Dominic Interactive (DI) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)). Overweight and obesity were estimated according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definition. Response rates to the parent questionnaire and DI were 57.4 and 95.1%, respectively. Final sample size was 1,030 children. According to the IOTF, 17.3% of the children were overweight, of whom 3.3% were obese. In univariate analysis, correlates of overweight were low parental education, low monthly income, Disadvantaged School Areas (DSAs), self-reported generalized anxiety, parent-reported conduct disorders, emotional problems, and peer difficulties. High monthly income was less frequently associated with overweight. In multivariate analysis, parent-reported peer difficulties (odds ratio (OR) = 2.06; 95% confidence interval = 1.27-3.35) and DSAs (1.88; 1.03-3.44) were independent factors significantly associated with child overweight. There was a trend of being overweight with elevated TV times (P for trend = 0.02). The psychosocial burden of excess weight appears to be significant even in young children. Findings should be considered for preventing strategies and public health interventions. School-based overweight prevention programs should be implemented first in disadvantaged areas together with information about weight stigmatization and discrimination.

AB The authors explored the utility of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in assessing adolescents' emotion regulation. Adolescents (11-17 years; N = 870) completed the DERS and measures of externalizing and internalizing problems. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a similar factor structure in the adolescent sample of the authors as demonstrated previously among adults. Furthermore, results indicated no gender bias in ratings of DERS factors on three scales (as evidenced by strong factorial gender invariance) and limited gender bias on the other three scales (as evidenced by metric invariance). Female adolescents scored higher on four of six DERS factors than male adolescents. DERS factors were meaningfully related to adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems. Results suggest that scores on the DERS show promising internal consistency and validity in a community sample of adolescents.

AB Aims: The Schematic Appraisals Model of Suicide (SAMS) suggests that positive self-appraisals may be important for buffering suicidal thoughts and behaviours, potentially providing a key source of resilience. The current study aimed to explore whether positive self-appraisals buffered individuals from suicidality in the face of stressful life events.
   Method: 78 participants who reported experiencing some degree of suicidality were recruited from a student population. They completed a battery of questionnaires including measures of suicidality, stressful life events and positive self-appraisals.
   Results: Positive self-appraisals moderated the association between stressful life events and suicidality. For those reporting moderate or high levels of positive self-appraisals, raised incidence of stressful life events did not lead to increases in suicidality.
   Discussion: These results support the SAMS framework, and suggest that positive self-appraisals may confer resilience to suicide. Positive self-appraisals may be a promising avenue for further resilience research, and an important area to target for suicide interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background The objective of this study was to test if emotion regulation mediates the association between mothers' parenting and adolescents' externalizing behaviour problems (conduct problems and hyperactivity). The parenting dimensions were warmth, psychological control and behavioural control (measured with knowledge, monitoring and discipline). Adjustment was made for contextual risk (measured with the number of proximal adverse life events experienced), gender, age and English as an additional language.
   Method Data were from a UK community sample of adolescents aged 11-18 from a comprehensive school in a disadvantaged area.
   Results At the multivariate level, none of the parenting variables predicted hyperactivity, which was associated only with difficulties in emotion regulation, contextual risk and English as a first language. The parenting variables predicting conduct problems at the multivariate level were warmth and knowledge. Knowledge did not predict emotion regulation. However, warmth predicted emotion regulation, which was negatively associated with conduct problems. Contextual risk was a significant predictor of both difficulties in emotion regulation and externalizing behaviour problems. Its effect on conduct problems was independent of parenting and was not via its association with difficulties in emotion regulation.
   Conclusions The findings add to the evidence for the importance of maternal warmth and contextual risk for both regulated emotion and regulated behaviour. The small maternal control effects on both emotion regulation and externalizing behaviour could suggest the importance of paternal control for adolescent outcomes.

AB Most school health promotion programmes for adolescents have tried to prevent risk behaviours, such as violence or substance abuse, using an approach based on a deficit model of adolescent's health and development. Recently this model has been questioned by new approaches that emphasise competence and positive youth development, and consider school as a suitable context for the implementation of health promotion programmes. This paper reviews the international contemporary literature on school-based programmes as a resource to promote youth development. We focus on different topics such as particular characteristics of effective curricular programmes, and the participant's positive outcomes. To conclude, we present a few questions that are still without answers and future research guidelines for intervention in the Spanish context.

AB In this longitudinal study, we examine whether the effect of parental separation on kindergarten children's behavioral/emotional problems varies according to the level of family conflict, and children's parental representations. One hundred and eighty seven children were assessed at ages 5 and 6. Family conflict was assessed using parents' ratings. Children's parental representations were assessed using a story-stem task. A multiinformant approach (parent, teacher, child) was employed to assess children's behavioral/emotional problems. Bivariate results showed that separation, family conflict, and negative parental representations were associated with children's behavioral/emotional problems. However, in multivariate analyses, when controlling for gender and symptoms at age 5, we found that children of separated parents who showed negative parental representations had a significantly greater increase in conduct problems between 5 and 6 than all other children. In terms of emotional symptoms and hyperactivity, symptoms at 5 and (for hyperactivity only) gender were the only predictors for symptoms 1 year later. Our results suggest that kindergarten children's representations of parent-child relationships moderate the impact of parental separation on the development of conduct problems, and underline play and narration as a possible route to access the thoughts and feelings of young children faced with parental separation.

AB The increasing impetus to provide an effective response to childhood obesity has generated a corresponding concern that weight management interventions may lead to emotional problems among young people, notably in relation to the development of a negative body image. However, currently the processes and factors that contribute to the acquisition of body image among young people is poorly understood. Drawing on salutogenic theory, this paper employs an assets-based approach that focuses on health promoting and protective factors to identify how young people may create or sustain positive body images. Secondary data analysis was undertaken from the WHO Health Behaviour in School Aged Children Study. During the spring term of 2002, information was collected from 6425 English adolescents aged 11-15 using a self-administered questionnaire. The data were analysed using stepwise multinomial logistic regression to determine which factors were associated with positive body image; a total of 2898 students were included in the final analysis. Adolescents who self-identified as having a positive body image were more likely to report ease of talking with a father figure, feeling intelligent, perceiving that their family were well off and a belief that their teachers were interested in them as people. Body Mass Index, age, gender and living within a household containing a father were also significant predictors of body image. The discussion provides an exploration of how the construction of young people's emotional health is in part linked with the attainment of a secure and positive body image. The implications for health promotion and educational programmes are then examined. By considering the assets, which support or sustain a positive body image during adolescence, obesity prevention programmes could be better tailored to meet the needs of young people. In the future, a salutogenic curriculum might provide an alternative to unsustainable levels of deficit led, targeted programmes.

AB This study examined how the quality of relationships with parents and friends were related to intimacy, commitment, and passion in adolescents' romantic relationships for indigenous Dutch and ethnic Dutch adolescents. Self-report survey data were used from 444 (88.9%) indigenous Dutch and 55 (11.1%) ethnic Dutch adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age (M = 15.34, SD = 1.14), all of whom were involved in a romantic relationship. About 61.6% (n = 307) were girls. For both indigenous and ethnic Dutch youths, the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship was positively associated with romantic relationship intimacy, whereas the quality of one's best friendship was related to higher commitment to one's romantic partner. Significant interactions in hierarchical regression analyses revealed that only ethnic Dutch adolescents who experienced low-quality parent-adolescent relationships showed more commitment to their romantic relationships. Additionally, ethnic Dutch adolescents who experienced low-quality best friendships showed more passion in their romantic relationships as compared to indigenous Dutch adolescents. These findings are indicative of ethnic differences in the roles that parents and friends play in the romantic lives of Dutch adolescents.

AB More than a cosmetic nuisance, acne can produce anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems that affect patients' lives in ways comparable to life-threatening or disabling diseases. Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy by itself may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychological comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if depressive-anxious disorders are suspected, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also in disrupted compliance. Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist should have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be combined with systemic and topical treatment of acne in conjunction with basic psychosomatic treatment.

AB Purpose: Positive youth development (PYD) may be a promising strategy for promoting adolescent health. A systematic review of the published data was conducted to identify and describe PYD programs that improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health.
   Methods: Eight databases were searched for articles about PYD programs published between 1985 and 2007. Programs included met the following criteria: fostered at least one of 12 PYD goals in multiple socialization domains (i.e., family, school, community) or addressed two or more goals in at least one socialization domain; allocated at least half of the program activities to promoting general PYD outcomes (as compared with a focus on direct sexual health content); included youth younger than 20 years old; and used an experimental or quasi-experimental evaluation design.
   Results: Thirty programs met the inclusion criteria, 15 of which had evidence of improving at least one adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcome. Program effects were moderate and well-sustained. Program goals addressed by approximately 50% or more of the effective programs included promoting prosocial bonding, cognitive competence, social competence, emotional competence, belief in the future, and self-determination. Effective programs were significantly more likely than those that did not have an impact to strengthen the school context and to deliver activities in a supportive atmosphere. Effective programs were also more likely to build skills, enhance bonding, strengthen the family, engage youth in real roles and activities, empower youth, communicate expectations, and be stable and relatively long-lasting, although these differences between effective and ineffective programs were not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: PYD programs can promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health, and tested, effective PYD programs should be part of a comprehensive approach to promoting adolescent health. However, more research is needed before a specific list of program characteristics can be viewed as a "recipe'' for success. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB To examine the association between "competence'' and adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) outcomes. Competence refers to the development of skills to perform tasks successfully in four areas including social and behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and moral competence. We conducted a systematic review of research published from 1985 through 2007. Inclusion criteria included use of multivariate analyses, a sample size of >= 100, publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and measurement of an ASRH outcome. We coded findings as protective, risk, or no association and as longitudinal or cross-sectional. We considered the presence of two longitudinal studies with consistent findings for at least one outcome to be sufficient evidence for a risk or protective association. We identified 77 studies that examined cognitive competence, 27 studies that examined social and behavioral competence, 12 studies that examined emotional competence, and no studies that met inclusion criteria for moral competence. The evidence indicated that cognitive competence and social and behavioral competence can be protective factors for ASRH, with findings from at least two longitudinal studies demonstrating a protective association with an ASRH outcome. Findings across cognitive, social and behavioral subconstructs and ASRH outcomes were more mixed. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about emotional and moral competence and ASRH. Helping adolescents to achieve cognitive, social, and behavioral competence may reduce the likelihood of sexual activity and teen pregnancy, and increase contraceptive use. Additional research is needed to examine other outcomes and the generalizability of findings. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Efforts to simultaneously address adolescent self-regulation, activity space (routine locations), and mental health represent a promising social ecological approach aimed at understanding the lives and development of urban youth. This type of examination of contextual influences on self-regulation is considered an important area of developmental research, yet one that is understudied (McCabe, Cunnington, & Brooks-Gunn, 2004). Little is known about the self-regulatory experiences that might link specific types of locations with mental health problems, particularly with urban youth who live in areas characterized by chronic and severe stressors such as personal violence, criminal activity, and poverty. Recent research has demonstrated the "power of context" (Tolan, Gorman-Smith, Henry, Chung, & Hunt, 2002) to influence coping styles and has demonstrated that without detailed and specified knowledge of the social ecology of urban youth, measurement of critical variables and interpretation of results are likely to be misinformed (Tolan & Grant, 2009). Given the importance of understanding youth through an interactive and contextual framework (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Szapocznik & Coatsworth, 1999), the present study examined self-regulatory experiences, specified favorite locations, and mental health with urban adolescents residing in low-resource and high-risk environments.

AB Objective To investigate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescents and young adults with Kawasaki disease (KD).
   Study design We conducted a cross-sectional observational study. Patients were eligible for this study when they were >= 16 years of age and had received a diagnosis of KD >= 5 years before the start of this study. The patients were divided in 3 groups according to their coronary status: normal, aneurysms, and giant aneurysms/ischemia. A self-administered questionnaire (Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36) was mailed to the patients to evaluate the HRQOL.
   Results Of 624 total questionnaires mailed, 377 were delivered, and 250 were returned. The response rates of the normal, aneurysm, and giant aneurysms/ischemia groups were 33%, 62%, and 72% of all eligible patients, respectively. All subscale scoress of HRQOL, except vitality and role-emotional (limitations in the usual role activities because of emotional problems) in patients with KD were significantly higher than scores from the national norms.
   Conclusions The HRQOL of adolescents and young adults with a history of KD is favorable. However, long-term follow-up is necessary, because the general health perceptions of older patients tended to be lower. (J Pediatr 2010;156:439-43).

The historical and practical importance of the concept of emotion regulation is noted and conceptual challenges in assessing emotion regulation are discussed. Empirical goals for improving construct validity in research on psychopathology and emotion regulation are discussed. We comment on how the papers in the special section advance understanding in these areas and suggest a multiple perspective and a multiple level of analysis approach for clarifying future research.

AB Emotion dysregulation is believed to be a key factor in anxiety disorders. However, the empirical basis for this view is limited, particularly in children and adolescents. This study aimed to examine whether anxious children display negative emotional hyper-reactivity and deficits in emotion regulation, using a new task that presents ambiguous situations with potentially threatening meanings. Forty-nine children diagnosed with either generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, were compared with 42 non-anxious controls. Relative to controls, anxious children demonstrated (a) greater intensity and frequency of negative emotional responses, (b) deficits in using reappraisal in negative emotional situations and corresponding deficits in reappraisal self-efficacy, and (c) greater reliance on emotion regulation strategies that increase the risk of functional impairment, intense negative emotion, and low emotion regulation self-efficacy. Implications for the assessment and treatment of childhood anxiety are discussed.

AB The primary goal of this study was to examine whether electronic diaries are a feasible method of monitoring transitory emotional states with a school-age, community sample of youth. A second goal was to examine preliminary relations between indices of emotional functioning captured via electronic diaries and other measures of child emotional and psychological functioning. Participants included 38 youth between the ages of 7 and 12 (51% males, M age = 9 [1.52] years and 49% females, M age = 9 [1.94] years) and their mothers (M age = 39 years) and fathers (M age = 42 years). Children were prompted to indicate the intensity of their current emotion four times a day for 1 week using Palm Tungsten E2s. Youth also completed self-report measures of emotion intensity, awareness, and dysregulation. Parents completed measures of child emotion regulation and symptoms of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. Sixty percent of the prompts were answered as intended. Higher levels of positive emotion intensity based on electronic diary ratings were negatively related to parent reports of adaptive emotion regulation and were positively related to youths' reports of emotion dysregulation and poor emotion awareness. Given that the electronic diary data offered unique information on youth emotional functioning, strategies to increase compliance with the diaries are suggested.

AB The early adolescent's state of mind in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is more closely linked to social interactions with peers, who are unlikely to serve as attachment figures, than it is to (i) qualities of the adolescent's interactions with parents, (ii) the AAI of the adolescent's mother, or (iii) the adolescent's prior Strange Situation behavior. This unexpected finding suggests the value of reconceptualizing AAI autonomy/security as a marker of the adolescent's capacity for emotion regulation in social interactions. Supporting this, we note that the AAI was originally validated not as a marker of attachment experiences or expectations with one's caregivers, but as a predictor of caregiving capacity sufficient to produce secure offspring. As such, the AAI may be fruitfully viewed as primarily assessing social emotion regulation capacities that support both strong caregiving skills and strong skills relating with peers.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury is a risk factor for more severe self-injury and later suicide, yet is relatively under-researched in non-clinical populations. In order to prevent more severe self-injury and later suicide, understanding of non-suicidal self-injury is imperative. This study aimed to examine whether coping skills, emotion regulation and alcohol use moderate the relationship between psychological distress and non-suicidal self-injury. Two hundred eighty-nine young adults completed self-report questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. Of the sample, 47.4% reported a history of non-suicidal self-injury. Adaptive coping strategies protected those who were psychologically distressed from severe self-injury. However for those who reported greater distress, this protective effect was negated by heavy alcohol use. Coping skills training may serve to protect young people from self-injury, although those who are severely distressed may also benefit from strategies to limit alcohol use.

AB Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a variety of cognitive and other birth defects, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). and including the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). This study examined the impact of gestational alcohol exposure on the morphology of the cingulate gyrus, given this region's role in cognitive control, attention, and emotional regulation, all of which are affected in children with FASD. Thirty-one youth (ages 8-16) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 21) and demographically matched comparison subjects (n = 10) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. The cingulate gyrus was manually delineated, and parcellated volumes of grey and white matter were compared across groups. Alcohol-exposed individuals had significantly smaller raw dngulate grey matter, white matter, and tissue volumes compared with controls. After adjustment for respective cranial tissue constituents, only white matter volumes remained significantly reduced, and this held regardless of whether or not the child qualified for a diagnosis of FAS. A correlation between posterior cingulate grey matter volume and the WISC-III Freedom from Distractibility Index was also observed in alcohol-exposed children. These data suggest that cingulate white matter is compromised beyond global white matter hypoplasia in alcohol-exposed individuals, regardless of FAS diagnosis. The observed volumetric reductions in the cinguilate gyrus may contribute to the disruptive and emotionally dysregulated behavioral profile commonly observed in this population.

The sample consisted of 111 children at Time 1 who ranged in age from 51/2 to 12 years at Time 1 and 8 to 14 years at Time 3. A significant finding was that, for girls, lower emotion regulation predicted later relational aggression (beta = 2.95, P<.05). Moreover, low prosocial skills coupled with relational aggression were associated with deviant social behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescence is a developmental period that entails substantial changes in affective and incentive-seeking behavior relative to both childhood and adulthood, including a heightened propensity to engage in risky behaviors and experience persistent negative and labile mood states. This review discusses the emotional and incentive-driven behavioral changes in adolescents and their associated neural mechanisms, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex. Common behavioral changes during adolescence may be associated with a heightened responsiveness to incentives and emotional cues while the capacity to effectively engage in cognitive and emotion regulation is still relatively immature. We highlight empirical work in humans and animals that addresses the interactions between these neural systems in adolescents relative to children and adults, and propose a neurobiological model that may account for the nonlinear changes in adolescent behavior. Finally, we discuss other influences that may contribute to exaggerated reward and emotion processing associated with adolescence, including hormonal fluctuations and the role of the social environment.

AB Recent structural and functional imaging studies have provided evidence for continued development of brain regions involved in social cognition during adolescence. In this paper, we review this rapidly expanding area of neuroscience and describe models of neurocognitive development that have emerged recently. One implication of these models is that neural development underlies commonly observed adolescent phenomena such as susceptibility to peer influence and sensitivity to peer rejection. Experimental behavioural evidence of rejection sensitivity in adolescence is currently sparse. Here, we describe a study that directly compared the affective consequences of an experimental ostracism manipulation (Cyber-ball) in female adolescents and adults. The ostracism condition led to significantly greater affective consequences in the adolescents compared with adults. This suggests that the ability to regulate distress resulting from ostracism continues to develop between adolescence and adulthood. The results are discussed in the context of models of neurocognitive development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined emotion perception processes in preschool aged children presenting with clinically significant emotional and behavior problems, with emphasis on sadness perception accuracy (i.e., the ability to correctly identify sadness from expressive and situational cues) and anger perception bias (i.e., the tendency to perceive anger in the absence of concordant cues) as related to children's externalizing symptoms. Participants were 82 children (3-5 years of age) admitted to a psychiatric day treatment program. Children participated in a structured puppet play activity to assess emotion understanding. Mothers reported on children's externalizing symptoms and program staff reported on children's emotion regulation and negative emotional lability. Young children in this clinical sample demonstrated generally age-appropriate ability to identify basic emotions as expressed within prototypical social situations. Most emotion perception errors involved the over-identification of sadness. Children's decreased accuracy in sadness perception was associated with increased externalizing symptoms. Children's negative emotional lability contributed unique variance to the prediction of externalizing symptoms, with more labile children also demonstrating increased symptoms. Results underscore the role of emotion processes in early childhood mental health problems, with implications for emotion-based treatments of early externalizing behavior symptoms.

AB Teacher-rated trajectories of physical aggression in boys and girls front first through sixth grade were examined using data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Cart and Youth Development. In separate analyses, four trajectories were identified in boys and three in girls. Higher levels of aggression in both boys and girls were related to greater sociodemographic risk and higher maternal harshness in the preschool years: lower levels of observed maternal sensitivity during early childhood also predicted higher trajectories of aggression among girls. Trajectory groups also differed oil a range of social and academic adjustment outcomes in sixth grade, with the most aggressive children and even moderately aggressive children evidencing some difficulties in adjustment. Patterns and levels of aggression in boys and girls are discussed as arc their predictors and consequences.

AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the theory and evidence for the links of parent-child attachment with internalizing problems in childhood and adolescence. We address three key questions: (a) how consistent is the evidence that attachment security or insecurity is linked to internalizing symptoms. anxiety. and depression? (b) How consistent is the evidence that specific forms of insecurity are more strongly related to internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression than are other forms of insecurity? (c) Are associations with internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression consistent for mother-child aid father-child attachment? The current findings are consistent with the hypothesis that insecure attachment is associated with the development of internalizing problems. The links between specific insecure attachment patterns and internalizing problems are difficult to evaluate. Father-child and mother-child attachments have a comparable impact, although there are relatively few studies of father-child attachment. No moderators consistently affect these relations. We also propose two models of how attachment insecurity may combine with other factors to lead to anxiety or depression.

AB To investigate differences in cognitive coping strategies between anxiety-disordered and non-anxious 9-11-year-old children. Additionally, differences in cognitive coping between specific anxiety disorders were examined. A clinical sample of 131 anxiety-disordered children and a general population sample of 452 non-anxious children were gathered. All children filled out the child version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-k). Structured clinical interviews were used to assess childhood anxiety disorders. Results showed that anxiety-disordered children experience significantly more 'lifetime' negative life events than non-anxious children. Adjusted for the 'lifetime' experience of negative life events, anxiety-disordered children scored significantly higher on the strategies catastrophizing and rumination, and significantly lower on the strategies positive reappraisal and refocus on planning than non-anxious children. No significant differences in cognitive coping were found between children with specific anxiety disorders. Anxiety-disordered children employ significantly more maladaptive and less adaptive cognitive coping strategies in response to negative life events than non-anxious children. The results suggest that cognitive coping is a valuable target for prevention and treatment of childhood anxiety problems.

AB Recently, a new field of developmental cognitive/socio-affective neuroscience has emerged at the crossroads of Developmental Psychology and Neuroscience, linked to new advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiological measures. This paper presents arguments and evidence from a variety of research areas to illustrate the potential strength of the neuroscience approach to the study of developmental phenomena. In particular, it is argued that adding neurological data to our theorisation of change may produce several beneficial effects: a) bringing new light to old topics; b) refining complex psychological constructs, and c) developing research areas that contemplate several levels of analysis, from genes to contextual influences. Finally, some reflections are presented on the challenges involved in adapting to new technologies and building new theoretical proposals. It is concluded that these challenges are worthwhile because they could potentially bring an end to the polarisation in our discipline between cognitive and sociocultural approaches by encompassing both within a more comprehensive view of developmental processes.

AB This study examined the associations among perceived control over anxiety-related events, worry, and both symptoms and diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The sample was comprised of 140 adolescents (60 girls) between the ages of 10 and 17 years (M (age) = 14.6 years; SD = 2.25) recruited from the general community. Findings were consistent with hypotheses. Self-reported perceived control over anxiety-related events related negatively to worry as well as symptoms and diagnoses of GAD even after accounting for variance associated with age, gender, and negative affectivity. Results are discussed in terms of the theoretical implications that perceived control over anxiety-related events may have for understanding GAD symptomatology among youth.

AB This study examined the hypothesis that maternal socialization of coping would make a differential contribution to youth depression and externalizing psychopathology depending on youths' level of exposure to life stress. A sample of 155 youth (M age = 12.41, SD = 1.21) and their maternal caregivers completed semi-structured interviews and questionnaires in a two-wave longitudinal study over a 1-year period. Results provided evidence for two types of socialization x stress interactions-an amplification-effects model and a differential-effects model. In the context of interpersonal stress, findings supported an amplification-effects model wherein the risk and protective effects of engagement and disengagement socialization of coping emerged in youth exposed to high but not mild levels of stress. In the context of noninterpersonal stress, findings supported a differential-effects model wherein disengagement socialization of coping contributed to heightened risk among youth exposed to high stress but dampened risk among youth exposed to mild stress. This research identifies maternal socialization of coping as a noteworthy contributor to risk for youth psychopathology, and highlights the need to consider parenting x environment interactions when investigating parenting processes related to youth psychopathology.

A sample of 145 German subjects was followed across six waves (i.e. ages 14, 15. 16, 17, 21, and 23 years). Growth mixture modeling revealed three developmental trajectories of parent-child relationships across adolescence (i.e. normative, increasingly negative, and decreasingly negative/distant), which were associated with the quality of romantic outcomes at two times in emerging adulthood Earlier mother-adolescent relationships were distinctively linked with connectedness and sexual attraction experienced in young adults' romantic relationships. Distant father-child relationships during adolescence were linked with the child's later anxious love.

Children from a longitudinal study participated at age 9 and 16 (N = 88) Semi-structured interviews were conducted with children about their emotional experiences and coded for areas of emotional competence Associations were examined for the emotions of sadness and anger concurrently during adolescence, and longitudinally from middle childhood to adolescence Results suggested that children with poor emotional awareness and regulation had a higher likelihood of using hard drugs. Difficulty regulating emotions was associated with having more sexual partners, and both emotion regulation and expression difficulties were associated with greater behavioral adjustment problems. Results were consistent across the concurrent and longitudinal findings and pointed to anger as an important emotion Findings suggest that children's emotional competence may serve as a useful point of intervention to decrease risky behavior in adolescence (C) 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Title. Risk behaviours among early adolescents: risk and protective factors.
   Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to examine the influence of risk/protective factors on risk behaviours of early adolescents and whether protective factors moderate their impact.
   Background. An understanding of how risk and protective factors operate to influence risk behaviours of early adolescents will better prepare nurses to perform interventions appropriately to reduce risk behaviours of early adolescents.
   Method. A cross-sectional study was carried out, based on a sample of public junior high schools (from 7th to 9th grades) in one city and one county in Taiwan. An anonymous questionnaire designed to measure five risk factors, six protective factors and risk behaviours was administered from October 2006 to March 2007. Data from 878 students were used for the present analysis. Pearson's correlations, ANOVA with random effect models, and generalized linear models were used to analyse the statistically significant explanatory variables for risk behaviours.
   Findings. Gender, perceived father's risk behaviour, perceived mother's risk behaviour, health self-efficacy, interaction of health self-efficacy and perceived peers' risk behaviour, and interaction of emotional regulation and perceived peers' risk behaviour were statistically significant explanatory variables of risk behaviours. Health self-efficacy and emotional regulation moderated the negative effects of peers' perceived risk behaviour on risk behaviours.
   Conclusion. All protective factors were negative statistically correlated with risk behaviours, and all risk factors positively statistically correlated with risk behaviours. Male adolescents should be considered an at-risk group for risk behaviour intervention. Nurses could provide early adolescents with training regarding health self-efficacy improvement, self-esteem enhancement, emotional regulation skills to reduce their risk behaviours.

AB Background: Cross-sectional studies suggest an association between eczema and mental health problems, but the temporal relationship is unclear.
   Objective: To assess the association between infant-onset eczema and mental health problems in a prospective study.
   Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, a birth cohort study was recruited and followed until age 10 years. Physician-diagnosed eczema, comorbidities, and a broad set of environmental exposures were assessed at age 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 years. First, we investigated the association between infant-onset eczema (age 1-2 years) and mental health problems at age 10 years according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Second, we analyzed the likelihood of mental health problems at age 10 years in relation to the course of eczema.
   Results: A total of 2916 infants were eligible for analysis. Compared with participants never diagnosed as having eczema, children with infant-onset eczema had a significantly increased risk for possible/probable mental health problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total score) at age 10 years (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13-1.96) and for emotional symptoms (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.25-2.09). Eczema limited to infancy predicted a significantly higher risk for conduct problems at age 10 years. The strength of the association between eczema and emotional problems at age 10 years increased with increasing eczema persistence.
   Conclusion: Infants with eczema are at increased risk for mental health problems at age 10 years. Even if cleared afterward, eczema at age 1 to 2 years may cause persistent emotional and behavioral difficulties. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125:404-10.)

AB Background: Previous research has suggested that television (TV) viewing may be associated with increased behavioral and emotional problems in children. However, there are few prospective studies targeted for its association with outcomes of children under 3 years old. The purpose of this study was to exam the association between children's early TV exposure at ages 18 and 30 months and the behavioral and emotional outcomes at age 30 months.
   Methods: We analyzed data collected prospectively in the Japan Children's Study. TV exposure was assessed by mothers' report at infant ages of 18 and 30 months. The outcomes were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Analysis of Covariance was used to estimate the effect of TV exposure on behavioral and emotional outcomes.
   Results: The percentage of children who watched TV 4 hours or more per day was 29.4% at age 18 months, 24.5% at age 30 months, and 21 % at both ages. Hyperactivity-inattention at age 30 months was positively associated with TV exposure at age 18 months, whereas prosocial behavior was negatively associated with hours of exposure even after adjustment. However, there were no significant differences in SDQ subscales according to daily hours of TV viewing at age 30 months.
   Conclusions: Daily TV exposure at age 18 months was associated with hyperactivity-inattention and prosocial behavior at age 30 months. However, the directly casual relation was not proved in the present study. Additional research considering the TV program content and exposure timing are needed to investigate the causal relation between TV viewing and behavioral outcome.

   INTERMITTENT; OBSTRUCTION; PREVALENCE
AB Allergic rhinitis (AR) typically presents after the second year of life, but the exact prevalence in early life is unknown. AR affects 10-30% of the population, with the greatest frequency found in children and adolescents. It appears that the prevalence has increased in the pediatric population. As the childs' immune system develops between the 1st and 4th yr of life, those with an atopic predisposition begin to express allergic disease with a clear Th-2 response to allergen exposure, resulting in symptoms. In pediatric AR, two or more seasons of pollen exposure are generally needed for sensitization, so allergy testing to seasonal allergens (trees, grasses, and weeds) should be conducted after the age of 2 or 3 years. Sensitization to perennial allergens (animals, dust mites, and cockroaches) may manifest several months after exposure. Classification of AR includes measurement of frequency and duration of symptoms. Intermittent AR is defined as symptoms for < 4 days/wk or < 4 consecutive weeks. Persistent AR is defined as occurring for more than 4 days/wk and more than 4 consecutive weeks. AR is associated with impairments in quality of life, sleep disorders, emotional problems, and impairment in activities such as work and school productivity and social functioning. AR can also be graded in severity - either mild or moderate/severe. There are comorbidities associated with AR. The chronic effects of the inflammatory process affect lungs, ears, growth, and others. AR can induce medical complications, learning problems and sleep-related complaints, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and chronic and acute sinusitis, acute otitis media, serous otitis media, and aggravation of adenoidal hypertrophy and asthma.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study provides nationally representative prevalence estimates of internalizing mental health symptoms among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and identifies significant co-variates of these symptoms by using multivariate regression. Internalizing symptoms include feeling anxious and depressed.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a nationally representative, parent-reported, cross-sectional survey of 40 465 CSHCN. The presence of internalizing mental health symptoms was assessed by using 2 binary items capturing whether a child had or experienced difficulty with depression, anxiety, disordered eating, or other emotional problems. The odds of experiencing internalizing symptoms were assessed by using multivariate regression, controlling for sociodemographic, health-related, and burden-related covariates.
   RESULTS: A total of 31.9% of CSHCN 3 to 17 years of age experienced internalizing mental health symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression showed internalizing symptoms to be strongly associated with female gender, older age, and frequent activity limitations, as well as externalizing mental health symptoms and conditions with behavioral components. Children with behavior problems had 6 times the odds of internalizing symptoms ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.95 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.30-6.69]), whereas children with autism spectrum disorder had 3 times the odds (aOR: 3.00 [95% CI: 2.39-3.77]). Increased odds of symptoms also were associated with frequent headaches ( aOR: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.45-2.13]) and chronic pain (aOR: 1.46 [95% CI: 1.221.75]). Odds of symptoms were greater for children living in households that experienced employment changes or financial burdens resulting from the children's needs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Internalizing mental health symptoms are common among CSHCN. Findings may help caregivers focus screening and prevention efforts for high-risk groups in this heterogeneous population. Pediatrics 2010; 125:e269-e277

AB This study examined associations between self-reports of sadness and anger regulation coping, reluctance to express emotion, and physical and relational aggression between two cohorts of predominantly African-American fifth (N = 191; 93 boys and 98 girls) and eighth (N = 167; 73 boys and 94 girls) graders. Multiple regression analyses indicated unique associations between relational aggression and expressive reluctance and sadness regulation coping. In contrast, physical aggression, but not relational aggression, was associated with anger regulation coping. These relations did not differ across gender, but the strength of the association between anger regulation coping and physical aggression varied by grade. Sadness regulation coping moderated the association between expressive reluctance and relational aggression. Conversely, anger regulation coping moderated the relation between expressive reluctance and physical aggression; however, the strength of this relation differed by gender. These findings have important implications for intervention efforts.

AB Based on the family ecological model, personal (hopelessness, social problem solving, emotional competence) and family (parent-adolescent communication, family functioning) quality of life measures related to adolescent suicidal ideation were examined in 5,557 Secondary 1 to Secondary 4 students in Hong Kong. Results showed that suicidal ideation was positively related to adolescent hopelessness but negatively related to emotional competence, social problem solving, father-adolescent communication, mother-adolescent communication and family functioning. Multiple regression analyses showed that hopelessness was the most important predictor of adolescent suicidal ideation, followed by mother-adolescent communication, family functioning, social problem solving, father-adolescent communication, and emotional competence. Path analyses with and without direct effects showed that hopelessness mediated the effect of personal and family correlates on adolescent suicidal ideation. Theoretical and practice implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Objective.-To describe the extent to which parent- and teacher-reported child mental health problems vary by different indicators of socioeconomic status.
   Methods.-Participants were 4-5-year-old children in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Parents (N = 4968) and teacher (N = 3245) completed the 3-4-year-old version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parents also reported the socioeconomic indicators of income, education, employment, and family composition (1- vs 2-parent families). Logistic regression models were used to predict SDQ total difficulties and each of the 4 SDQ subscales problems, as reported by parents and by teacher, and considered all putative socioeconomic status (SES) predictor variables simultaneously.
   Results.-The proportions of children scoring in the abnormal range varied according to SES indicator and mental health subscale. All of the SES indicators independently predicted parent-reported child mental health problems, although odds ratios were generally small to moderate (1.2 to 2.4), and not all reached statistical significance. Low income and parent education showed larger associations than sole parenthood or unemployment. The pattern for teachers was similar, though less consistent. Behavioral problems showed stronger associations with social disadvantage than emotional problems.
   Conclusions.-Research examining pathways to young children's mental health should include diverse measures of SES, particularly of family income and education. The fact that mental health problems were most strongly associated with parent education and income should be of interest to policy makers because education and income reflect investments in the lives of our participants' parents during their own childhood and adolescence.

AB Emotion regulation is essential for adaptive functioning and social integration. However, it is not clear to what extent the responsible brain mechanisms are similar to those invoked in cognitive control in a non-emotional context. The aim of this study was to compare the neural circuitry of cognitive and emotional interference resolution in healthy adolescents, employing variants of the counting Stroop task. Cognitive and emotional interference processing engaged predominantly brain regions belonging to the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems, respectively, and commonly the inferior frontal gyrus, IFG (Broca's area, left BA 45, but also right BA 45). These results suggest that BA 45 is a bridge of interaction between the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems implicated in top-down orienting of attention and, respectively, in bottom-up processing of salient stimuli. Reaction time data showed that some participants tend to respond faster, while others respond slower to negative emotional compared to neutral trials. The emotional interference maps revealed that fast responders recruit the right temporo-parietal junction and to a larger extent the right BA 45 and the bilateral cuneus, suggesting that they engage more efficient cognitive control mechanisms to override the attentional bias. No anterior cingulate (ACC) activation was observed in either cognitive, or emotional interference; this supports the view that ACC is not involved specifically in mediating Stroop selection.

AB Attachment theory has been conceptualised as an affect regulation theory, proposing that attachment is associated with the expression and recognition of emotions as well as interpersonal functioning. Previous research has reported affect regulation difficulties in substance use disorders and addiction has been considered an attachment disorder. However, scarce empirical research exists on the relationship of attachment in relation to affect regulation and interpersonal functioning in those with substance use problems. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate potential associations between attachment, negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies, fear of intimacy and self-differentiation in substance abusers. The revised adult attachment scale (RAAS), the NMR expectancies scale, the fear of intimacy scale and the differentiation of self inventory were administered to a sample of 100 substance use disorder inpatients. Attachment accounted for significant variance in NMR expectancies and was also a strong predictor of fear of intimacy. The predictive utility of attachment also extended to self-differentiation, suggesting that attachment was strongly related to overall self-differentiation score, Emotional reactivity, Emotional cut-off and I position. These findings support attachment theory suggesting that attachment is associated with and predicts affect regulation abilities and difficulties in interpersonal functioning in a sample of substance use disorder inpatients. The inclusion and assessment of attachment appears to be important in the development of treatment programmes for substance abusing individuals.

AB This study examined disease-specific stressors and coping responses employed by youth with HIV. Data were analyzed from Adolescent Impact, a multi-site study of 166 adolescents infected with HIV in three major US cities. Participants identified HIV-related stressors during a face-to-face interview. Coping strategies were measured using the adolescent version of the Kidcope. Emotional and behavioral functioning were assessed with the Youth or Adult Self Report symptom checklists. Medication-related stressors were most common (30%) and reported more often by perinatally infected youth, whereas youth infected through risk behaviors reported more disclosure-related stressors. Passive emotional regulation was perceived as the most used and most helpful coping strategy overall. Youth reporting medication adherence-related stressors used resignation most frequently. A two-factor model (Passive and Active Coping) emerged. The Passive Coping factor included strategies that do not directly approach the problem, whereas Active Coping included strategies that involve an active approach. Youth with moderately advanced disease (CD4 200-500 cells/mm(3)) used a Passive Coping style more often than healthier youth (CD4 > 500 cells/mm(3)). Additionally, Passive Coping was associated with greater emotional and behavioral problems. Youth infected with HIV may benefit from interventions promoting adaptive coping responses to HIV-specific stressors, particularly medication adherence.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the validity and the reliability of Turkish version of Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)-Abbreviated Form. Methods: The sample consisted of 1749 1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd), and 4(th) grade elementary schoolchildren. The parents were asked to complete the CSHQ, sociodemographic form, and a question list assessing the behavioral and emotional problems of children. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the CSHQ were investigated. Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient was determined as 0.78. The test retest correlation coefficient was 0.81 (p<0.001). As a result of factor analysis 11 factors were determined. Additional analysis regarding the construct validity indicated that the total sleep scores did not differ by age and gender (p>0.05), yet the scores tended to increase with decreasing socioeconomic status (p<0.001). There were statistically significant relationships between all behavioral and emotional parameters and the presence of sleep problems. Conclusion: These results suggest that Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which is a parent proxy-report, is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing sleep habits and screening possible sleep problems of Turkish children.

AB This study provided an initial test of a theoretical model which emphasizes patterns of actual and perceived control. The model suggests that profiles of actual and perceived control are differentially related to emotional and behavioral problems. We examined whether anxiety and depression symptoms and aggressive behavior would differ among diverse patterns of actual (caregiver reported competencies) and perceived control (anxiety-related control beliefs) in youth (n = 203). Results were consistent with the theoretical predictions in that reported levels of anxiety and depression symptoms and aggressive behavior varied depending upon youth's control profiles. For example, youth with high actual and low perceived control exhibited relatively more anxiety/depression symptoms than aggressive behavior, while those youth with low actual and high perceived control exhibited relatively more aggressive behavior. Furthermore, youth with both high actual and perceived control reported and were reported by caregivers as having the least anxiety/depression symptoms and aggressive behavior, respectively. The findings provide empirical support for the model and suggest the importance of considering the role of actual and perceived control in emotional and behavioral problems. Implications for future tests of the model are also discussed.

AB The current study tested hypotheses derived from Joiner's (2005) interpersonal theory of suicide, which proposes that deliberate self-harm (DSH) becomes increasingly more reinforcing with repetition. One hundred six participants with a history of DSH completed questionnaires about their emotions and experience of physical pain during their most recent DSH episode. Consistent with prediction, people with more numerous past DSH episodes felt more soothed, more relieved, and calmer following their most recent episode of DSH. Contrary to prediction, greater numbers of past DSH episodes were associated with more intense physical pain during the most recent episode. The findings suggest that the emotion regulation functions of DSH may become more reinforcing with repetition.

AB Behavioral insomnia of childhood (BIC; more commonly known as bedtime problems and night wakings) commonly occurs in young children (5 years). If left untreated, bedtime problems and night wakings can result in impairments in behavior, emotion regulation, and academic performance. Yet, treatments for bedtime problems and night wakings have been found to be efficacious and durable. This article begins with a review of the diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation of BIC. This is followed by a brief review of how operant theory is applied to behavioral interventions for BIC and a detailed discussion of how to apply these treatments for bedtime problems and night wakings in young children.

AB In this article, the major studies on the etiologies of associations between childhood sleep disorders and behavioral problems in children in China are reviewed. PUBMED was used to locate original articles published in China and international journals in both the Chinese and English languages. About 50 articles were selected on the basis of their having a sufficiently high scientific standard. Reviewing these articles indicates that there has been an increased interest in recent years in the association between sleep disorders and behavioural problems in young children. Behavioural problems include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, emotional problems (including anxiety and depression), Tourette's syndrome and autism. Possible reasons for these associations are discussed; they appear to be complex and diverse, and many aspects of the problems and details of causal links are still poorly understood. Further work is required to address these problems specifically and so provide advice to clinicians, healthcare workers and parents.

AB Previous research has supported a three-factor division of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) when dividing the parent form in 9 instead of 8 subscales. The present study investigated different factor models in the 8- and 9-scale division in both the parent and teacher form of the Norwegian BRIEF version. Confirmatory Factor Analyzes showed best fit for the three-factor model in a mixed healthy and clinical sample, indicating a distinction between Emotional and Behavioral Regulation. This division is in accordance with present knowledge of brain function and may increase the specificity of executive dysfunction in clinical groups.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between long-term physical and psychological outcome variables in patients who survived meningococcal septic shock (MSS) in childhood.
   Methods: The study population was made up of all MSS patients requiring intensive care treatment between 1988 and 2001.
   Results: A total of 120 patients visited the follow-up clinic (age at paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission 3.1 years; follow-up interval 9.8 years; age at follow-up 14.5 years (all medians)). Four major outcomes were considered: 1) major physical sequelae (defined as major scars and/or orthopaedic sequelae) (29/120), 2) mild neurological impairments (39/120), 3) problem behaviour (defined as a total score above the 90(th) percentile of the reference groups on questionnaires to screen for psychopathology) (16/114) and 4) total intelligence quotient < 85 (18/115). No differences were found between patients with major physical sequelae and patients without major physical sequelae as to the presence of problem behaviour or total IQ < 85. Also, no differences were found between patients with mild neurological impairments and patients without as to the presence of problem behaviour or total IQ < 85. Finally, no differences were found between patients with major physical sequelae and patients without as to the presence of mild neurological sequelae. Less favourable scores on behavioural and emotional problems were significantly associated with poorer health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). HR-QoL scores were to a lesser amount predicted by severity of illness at time of PICU admission or by adverse physical outcome.
   Conclusions: Long-term adverse physical and psychological outcomes in survivors of MSS did not seem to be associated. Poorer HR-QoL was mainly predicted by problem behaviour.

AB One of the most important tasks of childhood is learning to self-regulate in the presence of negative emotions. Until recently, almost no research has examined the neurophysiological correlates of emotional self-regulation as it develops over childhood and adolescence. We were interested in plotting a fine-grained developmental profile of the neural underpinnings of self-regulation, in the context of negative emotion, for 7- to 14-year-old children. We predicted that children would recruit less cortical activation with age in the service of self-regulation, reflecting increased neural efficiency with development. We also predicted that children would recruit more cortical activation with increased negative emotion, possibly reflecting greater demand on cortical resources. We administered a Go No-Go task with an emotion induction block and we measured the amplitude of the N2, an event related potential associated with inhibitory control, as it varied with block and with age. Furthermore, we estimated activation for a ventral prefrontal region of interest (ROI; suggestive of orbital frontal, ventromedial prefrontal, or rostral anterior cingulate activation) and a dorsomedial prefrontal ROI (suggestive of dorsal anterior cingulate activation) frequently modeled as cortical generators underlying the N2. Results revealed a marginal decrease in mediofrontal scalp activation, but a more pronounced decrease in activation of the ventromedial prefrontal ROI, with age. There were no age-related changes in dorsomedial prefrontal ROI activation. Lastly, as predicted, we found increased ventral prefrontal ROI activation during the negative emotion induction, possibly reflecting greater recruitment of frontocortical resources underlying emotion regulation, but developmental change in this activation was no different than for the other conditions. Thus, both self-regulation in general and emotion regulation in particular recruited less cortical activation with age, suggesting more efficient cortical mechanisms of response inhibition.

AB This study examined the moderating role of attentional control on relations between negative affect and action monitoring event related potentials (ERPs) (error-related negativity (ERN) and N2) in a group of healthy adolescents (9 to 17 years old). These ERPs were recorded while participants completed a modified flanker task. Participants also completed the negative affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C) and the attentional control subscale of the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R). Regression analyses revealed negative affect by attentional control interactions, suggesting that youth high in attentional control and high in negative affect show increased N2 amplitude and a trend toward increased ERN amplitude. These findings are discussed with regard to the interface of attention and emotion processes that are implicated in action monitoring and relevance to the study of self-regulation during adolescence.

AB Prior research has documented associations between hours in child care and children's externalizing behavior. A series of longitudinal analyses were conducted to address 5 propositions, each testing the hypothesis that child care hours causes externalizing behavior. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were used in this investigation because they include repeated measures of child care experiences, externalizing behavior, and family characteristics. There were 3 main findings. First, the evidence linking child care hours with externalizing behavior was equivocal in that results varied across model specifications. Second, the association between child care hours and externalizing behavior was not due to a child effect. Third, child care quality and proportion of time spent with a large group of peers moderated the effects of child care hours on externalizing behavior. The number of hours spent in child care was more strongly related to externalizing behavior when children were in low-quality child care and when children spent a greater proportion of time with a large group of peers. The magnitude of associations between child care hours and externalizing behavior was modest. Implications are that parents and policymakers must take into account that externalizing behavior is predicted from a constellation of variables in multiple contexts.

AB Responses to five doll-story stems thematically related to attachment experiences with the mother were videotaped in the home and used to evaluate child, maternal, and environmental predictors of representational aggression in 93 preschool children of African American women receiving public assistance who had become pregnant as teenagers. Significant correlations were found between representational aggression and child's gender (male), birth weight, maternal depressive affect, maternal educational attainment, recent employment, mother's historical residence with her own mother, and felt social support, accounting for 40% of the variance in representational aggression. A significant Felt Social Support x Gender interaction effect suggested that girls of mothers who perceive higher levels of felt social support are more likely to represent less aggression in their stories; felt social support was not associated with boys' representational aggression. A significant Felt Social Support x Employment interaction effect suggested that representational aggression is associated with lower levels of felt social support only among employed mothers. Findings suggest that different pathways exist for representational aggression in children of low-income adolescent mothers, which nevertheless share predictors associated with poverty.

AB Background: The aim was to evaluate psychosocial symptoms and competence as reported by the parents and the adolescents themselves among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in relation to population-based controls.
   Methods: Standardized Achenbach questionnaires-Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for the parents and Youth Self-Report (YSR) for the adolescents-were sent to Finnish families of adolescents with IBD (age 10-18 years), and their controls matched for age, gender, and place of residence. The final study group comprised 160 adolescents with IBD and 236 controls with their parents, respectively.
   Results: According to parent reports, adolescents with IBD had more symptoms of anxious/depressed mood (P < 0.001), with-drawn/depressed mood (P < 0.05), social problems (P < 0.05) thought problems (P < 0.001), somatic complaints (P < 0,001) and lower competence (P < 0.05) than population-based controls. Unexpectedly, there was no group difference in the amount of self-reported psychosocial symptoms, somatic complaints, or competence between adolescents with IBD and their peers. However, adolescents with severe IBD reported significantly more emotional problems (P < 0.001) than those with mild symptoms or controls.
   Conclusions: According to parents, adolescents with IBD have more emotional problems, social problems, thought problems, and lower competence than their population-based peers. Self-perceived severity of the IBD symptoms is associated with a larger amount of parent and self-reported emotional symptoms. Complementary methods should be used while assessing the psychosocial well-being of adolescents with IBD as questionnaires alone may be insufficient.

AB Objective. The PedsQL (TM) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (TM)) is a modular instrument designed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and disease-specific symptoms in children and adolescents. The PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale was designed as a child self-report and parent proxy-report generic symptom-specific instrument to measure fatigue in pediatric patients. The objective of the present study was to determine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale in pediatric obesity. Methods. The 18-item PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (General Fatigue, Sleep/Rest Fatigue, and Cognitive Fatigue domains) and the PedsQL (TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed by 41 pediatric patients with a physician-diagnosis of obesity and 43 parents from a hospital-based Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic. Results. The PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale evidenced minimal missing responses (1.6%, child report; 0.5%, parent report), achieved excellent reliability for the Total Fatigue Scale Score (alpha = 0.90 child report, 0.90 parent report), distinguished between pediatric patients with obesity and healthy children, and was significantly correlated with the PedsQL (TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales supporting construct validity. Pediatric patients with obesity experienced fatigue comparable with pediatric patients receiving cancer treatment, demonstrating the relative severity of their fatigue symptoms. Conclusions. The results demonstrate the measurement properties of the PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale in pediatric obesity. The findings suggest that the PedsQL (TM) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale may be utilized in the standardized evaluation of fatigue in pediatric patients with obesity.

AB Objective: Few pediatric primary care providers routinely use mental health screening tools, in part because they may have concerns about whether screening is useful and how it will affect their practice. This study examined the extent to which screening in primary care would increase the identification of mental health problems among a diverse population of children and youth. Methods: Prior to the visit, the parents of 767 patients age 5 to 16 completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to report their child's mental health symptoms and impairment. Without viewing the screening results, each child's provider (N = 53) completed a questionnaire to report whether the child or youth demonstrated a mental health problem. Results: Compared with providers, the screen identified twice as many patients with moderate symptoms and nearly 28% more patients with high symptoms. Among patients with high symptoms, providers failed to identify a problem among 78% of those who were Latino/Other and 55% of those who were African American compared with 27% of Caucasian patients (p < 0.001). Providers were not more likely to identify patients with externalizing versus internalizing symptoms but were more likely to identify patients who demonstrated symptoms across multiple domains of functioning. Conclusions: Screening substantially increased the number of children and youth who would be identified as possibly having a mental health problem. Screening may have the most potential to increase the identification of problems among patients who have moderate mental health symptoms and those who are African American or Latino. (Int'l. J.

AB Parenting practices are among the strongest predictors of juvenile delinquency identified in the criminological literature and have been intimately connected to adult offending. The prior research connecting early parenting experiences with crime, however, has not systematically assessed the long-term effect of parenting style on adult criminal offending, or the processes linking the parenting and crime, by race. In this study, we explore the extent to which experiences associated with minority status influence the nature of the relationship between parenting style and adult criminal offending as well as the mediating processes of adult social bonds and emotional self-concepts involved. Using two waves of a contemporary longitudinal sample of youth, the results show that parenting styles lacking in demandingness show significant and positive effects on adult criminal offending among the Black sample, but parenting styles exert little long-term effects on criminal offending among the White sample. Furthermore, negative emotionality, namely anger, significantly mediates the relationship between uninvolved parenting and adult criminality among the Black and White samples, but depression is also a mediator for the Whites. In this sample, adult social bonds do not mediate the relationship between parenting during childhood and adult criminality.

AB In recent years, emotion regulation has re-emerged in the literature as a fundamental component of psychological functioning. The present study investigated the independent and interactive roles of temperamental dispositions and perceptions of parenting behaviors in the use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in late childhood. A sample of 293 children (grades 4-6) completed measures of ER, temperament, and parenting behaviors. As hypothesized, higher scores on temperament-based Approach and perceived parental Care were associated with greater use of the ER strategy of Reappraisal, whereas lower levels of temperament-based Flexibility, Positive Mood Quality and perceived parental Care were associated with greater use of the ER strategy of Suppression. Results suggest that despite differing temperamental dispositions, the presence of a nurturing and supportive caregiving environment is important for the development of adaptive patterns of ER.

AB The Pittsburgh Girls Study is a longitudinal, community-based study of 2,451 girls who were initially recruited when they were between the ages of 5 and 8 years. The primary aim of the study was testing developmental models of conduct disorder, major depressive disorder, and their co-occurrence in girls. In the current article, we summarize the published findings from the past 5 years of the PGS and place those results in the context of what it known to date about developmental psychopathology in girls. Key results suggest that DSM-IV mental disorders tend to have an insidious onset often beginning with subsyndromal symptom manifestation, and that there appear to be shared and unique developmental precursors to disorder in subgroups of girls based on race and poverty.

AB This longitudinal study investigated the associations between peer victimization and maladaptive outcomes (emotional and behavioral problems) among 580 adolescents concurrently and across a 2-year Period, and proposed that adult emotional support moderated this association. Peer victimization and maladaptive outcomes were assessed from adolescents' self-reports. Adult emotional support was measured from adolescents' ratings of Parent and teacher emotional support. Adolescents who were physically or relationally victimized by their peers were at risk of emotional and behavioral problems. Higher levels of father and teacher emotional support were associated with lower levels of adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems concurrently and across time. Higher levels of mother emotional support were associated with lower levels of emotional problems and moderated the effects of physical victimization on maladjustment for concurrent assessments only. Teacher emotional support moderated the association between relational victimization and emotional and behavioral problems across time. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The authors compared the associations among perceived maternal socialization goals (self-development, filial piety, and collectivism), perceived maternal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, and training), and the social-emotional adjustment (self-esteem, academic self-efficacy, and depression) between Chinese and European American young adults. The mediation processes in which socialization goals relate to young adults' adjustment outcomes through parenting styles were examined. Results showed that European American participants perceived higher maternal self-development socialization goals, whereas Chinese participants perceived higher maternal collectivism socialization goals as well as more authoritarian parenting. Cross-cultural similarities were found in the associations between perceived maternal authoritative parenting and socioemotional adjustment (e.g., higher self-esteem and higher academic self-efficacy) across the two cultural groups. However, perceived maternal authoritarian and training parenting styles were found only to be related to Chinese participants' adjustment (e.g., higher academic self-efficacy and lower depression). The mediation analyses showed that authoritative parenting significantly mediated the positive associations between the self-development and collectivism goal and socioemotional adjustment for both cultural groups. Additionally, training parenting significantly mediated the positive association between the filial piety goal and young adults' academic self-efficacy for the Chinese group only. Findings of this study highlight the importance of examining parental socialization goals in cross-cultural parenting research.

AB This study examined the relation between mothers' positive and negative interaction behaviors during mother-child interactions and the emotion regulation (ER) and depressive symptoms of their adolescent offspring. Event-planning (EPI) and problem-solving interactions (PSI) were observed in 163 mother-adolescent dyads, and adolescents also provided a self-report of ER responses and depressive symptoms. Sequential analyses of mother-adolescent behaviors during the interaction tasks indicated that adolescents with more depressive symptoms were more likely to reciprocate their mothers' negative affective behaviors. Adolescents whose mothers displayed less positivity and more negativity (i.e., less frequent positive and more frequent negative behaviors) during the EPI displayed more emotionally dysregulated behaviors in the PSI and reported more frequent maladaptive ER responses. Adolescents whose mothers behaved negatively toward them more frequently during mother-adolescent interactions also reported more depressive symptoms. The frequency with which adolescents engage in maladaptive ER responses mediated the association between maternal negativity and adolescents' concurrent depressive symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the frequency of risk behaviours among Swiss adolescents and their links with risk perception, impulsivity and emotion regulation abilities, operationalized with the concepts of alexithymia and emotional openness. We recruited 144 subjects (aged 14-20), who completed the Risk Involvement and Perception Scale (RIPS-R), the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and the 20-item Dimensions of Openness to Emotional Experiences (DOE-20) questionnaire. Findings revealed that a greater perception of benefits and a higher level of sensation seeking were associated with more involvement in risk behaviours, which are essentially socially accepted behaviours. Notably, the path model indicated that the perception of benefits was a mediator in the relationship between sensation seeking and risk behaviours. The results add to the psychological understanding of factors associated with risk behaviours in adolescence. The limitations and implications of these results for developmental theories, research, and prevention are stated.

AB School-aged children have to deal with a variety of academic stressors that have been linked with psychological maladjustment. In previous studies, the development and evaluation of primary preventive school-based stress management programs among children have been widely neglected. In the present study, the Anti-Stress Training for children (Hampel & Petermann, 2003) was adapted for primary schools. Effects of the training on coping prior to, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention were examined among N = 102 third and fourth graders, using a control-group design with block randomization. Children in the intervention group improved in adaptive coping strategies immediately and 6 weeks after the intervention. Moreover, immediately after the intervention levels of adaptive coping strategies in the intervention group were statistically and clinically significantly higher than in the untreated control group. Thus, results support that this stress management training in primary schools may have beneficial effects on adaptive coping and improve mental health of school-aged children.

AB This review gives an overview of the background to the controversy along with orientations for clinical practice. For diagnosing early-onset BD, special emphasis should be laid on the occurrence of clearly demarcated affective episodes, accompanied by changes in behavior and cognition. The mixed phenotype of ADHD and severe affective dysregulation is not a correlate of BD but deserves more attention regarding the development of psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic procedures. Differential diagnostic considerations are made on the disparities and the overlap of BD with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and substance misuse.

AB Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism, and its detrimental effects on neurocognitive functioning have been well studied. Early detection and treatment of PKU prevent the severe consequences of this disorder. However, even early- and well-treated patients experience hidden disabilities, including subtle deficits in executive functioning, mild reductions in mental processing speed, social difficulties, and emotional problems that may remain unnoticed for years. poor executive function (EF) may impact treatment adherence and may lead to psychosocial deficits that are not always visible. These psychosocial aspects include social difficulties and psychosocial problems, such as forming interpersonal relationships, achieving autonomy, attaining educational goals, and having healthy emotional development. Studies report EF deficits in children and adults with early-treated PKU, which contribute significantly to the hidden disabilities in this population. In adults, hidden disabilities affect job performance and social relationships as a result of residual attention deficits, poor EF (e.g., planning, organizing), and reduced processing speed. An indirect relationship also exists between quality of life and EF impairment. In the absence of overt psychiatric symptoms, low level depressive OF anxious Symptom may be present. The interaction between the neurocognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms Puts this population of patients at significant risk for experiencing hidden disability, PKU is a disorder in which a less than optimal psychosocial Outcome arises from the Cumulative impact of relatively mild symptoms. The key to reducing risks associated with PKU is metabolic control throughout life. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the effectiveness of the school-based prevention program "Verhaltenstraining in der Grundschule" for improving social competencies and reducing behavior problems in third and fourth grade pupils. 23 classes (n = 372) from 12 schools in Bremen and Lower Saxony participated in this quasi-experimental study as intervention or comparison classes. Data were collected prior to training and directly after training was completed, using teacher and child questionnaires. From pre- to posttest, social-emotional problems decreased significantly in intervention classes; further, social behavior improved significantly among part of the intervention group. Gender-specific effects were found for social behavior: Boys improved more during training than girls did. Practical implications and study limitations are discussed.

AB Single parent families not only differ from traditional families regarding socioeconomic problems and missing a parent, but also concerning the duration of using youth welfare measures, psychological problems in single parents, and the way youth welfare measures are ended. Due to different basic parameters in these two family settings, this study investigates the differential effectiveness of youth day care measures. In total, 55 children and adolescents (aged 6 to 14 years) and their parents were involved. Using axis I, II and V, ICD-10 multiaxial presentation, data on the general burden of problems, externalizing problems, emotional problems, and parenting skills were recorded before care measures began and again after they had ended. Although day care measures were very effective in both family settings, traditional families showed a significantly stronger decline of externalizing problems than single parent families, exceptions being emotional problems and burdens.

AB Sixteen male students (mean age = 14.01 years; SD = 1.27) with aggressive behaviour participated in the Training with Aggressive Children. Teachers implemented the training in their school for special needs. To assess problematic behaviours, information was gathered from teachers, parents, and students themselves, with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In comparison to a control group with sixteen adolescents (11 boys, 5 girls) of same age (mean age = 14.14 year; SD = 1.06) and magnitude of aggressive-delinquent behaviour, the training group received lower score on the scales conduct problems and total difficulties, rated by teachers two weeks after completion of the training. Students reported lower scores on peer problems. For a subsample of adolescents, receiving the training, parents see lower scores on emotional problems and on total difficulties. The results showed out that the training can be effectively conducted in the school setting.

AB Although often lacking "malice", aggression is fairly common in children with intellectual or developmental disability (I/DD). Despite this, there are no scales available that are appropriate for an in-depth analysis of aggressive behavior in this population. Such scales are needed for the study of aggressive behavior, which is a common target symptom in clinical trials. We assessed the reliability and validity of the Children's Scale of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (C-SHARP), a new aggression scale created for children with I/DD. Data are presented from a survey of 365 children with I/DD aged 3-21 years. Interrater reliability was very high for the Problem Scale, which characterizes type of aggression. Reliability was lower but largely acceptable for the Provocation Scale, which assesses motivation. Validity of the Problem Scale was supported by expected differences in children with autism, Down syndrome, comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) and ADHD. The Provocation Scale, which categorizes behavior as proactive or reactive, showed expected differences in children with DBD, but was less effective in those with ADHD. The C-SHARP appears to have fundamentally sound psychometric characteristics, although more research is needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this piece of work was to study the relationship between psychopathology and attachment in adolescents and the influence of gender on these variables. The sample (N=88) was made up of adolescents between 14 and 16 years old. The attachment styles were evaluated by using Attachment Styles Scale (Casullo y Fernandez, 2005) and psychopathology by means of questionnaire SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 2002). The results show that women present higher levels of psychopathology and a greater tendency towards insecure attachment styles which are related with a higher level of psychopathology in both genders.

AB This study examines the association of peer acceptance with different indexes of socio-emotional maladjustment, daily stress, and coping styles in school students, including gender and age differences. The sample consists of 392 schoolchildren aged from 9 to 12. Results show significant negative correlations of peer acceptance with emotional maladjustment indexes and daily stress. In addition, it shows a significant positive correlation with reference-to-others coping style. Results also indicate gender and age differences, specifically the relationships between peer acceptance and the different self-assessed measures, which are more significant among the girls' subgroup, and among the 10 and 12 year old subgroups. Finally, we emphasize the need to apply these results as a baseline for educational psychology interventions to prevent development of emotional maladjustment in childhood.

AB In this study, the relationships among psychological health and self-efficacy, social support, and coping strategies soon after a devastating natural disaster was explored using path analysis, in order to provide guidelines for early psychological intervention. Participants comprised 172 senior middle-school students, in the stricken area of the May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China, of whom 167 completed the scales. Three different models were tested consecutively and compared. According to the model that provided the best fit to the data, emotion-focused coping significantly predicted psychological problems, while subjective social support and problem-focused coping significantly predicted self-efficacy. The results showed that soon after a disaster, the most important mediating factor for people is emotional regulation.

AB Emotion regulation is a critical aspect of children's social development, yet few studies have examined the brain mechanisms involved in its development. Theoretical accounts have conceptualized emotion regulation as relying on prefrontal control of limbic regions, specifying the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 5- to 11-year-olds during emotion regulation and processing of emotionally expressive faces revealed that older children preferentially recruited the more dorsal ocognitiveo areas of the ACC, while younger children preferentially engaged the more ventral oemotionalo areas. Additionally, children with more fearful temperaments exhibited more ventral ACC activity while less fearful children exhibited increased activity in the dorsal ACC. These findings provide insight into a potential neurobiological mechanism underlying well-documented behavioral and cognitive changes from more emotional to more cognitive regulatory strategies with increasing age, as well as individual differences in this developmental process as a function of temperament. Our results hold important implications for our understanding of normal development and should also help to inform our understanding and management of emotional disorders.

AB A current concern among social science researchers is the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease on the family, especially on the parenting abilities of mothers with HIV. Beginning research suggests that the children of HIV-positive parents are vulnerable, pointing to the impact of HIV disease on children's social and emotional adjustment. The objective of this article is to propose a model of the HIV disease-related disruption of care on children's psychosocial adjustment. The schematic model can be used to evaluate the mechanisms by which maternal HIV disease may influence the psychosocial adjustment of elementary school-age children.

AB Utilizing Daniel Goleman's theory of emotional competence, Beck's cognitive theory, and Rudd's cognitive-behavioral theory of suicidality, the relationships between hopelessness (cognitive component), social problem solving (cognitive-behavioral component), emotional competence (emotive component), and adolescent suicidal ideation were examined. Based on the responses of 5,557 Secondary 1 to Secondary 4 students from 42 secondary schools in Hong Kong, results showed that suicidal ideation was positively related to adolescent hopelessness, but negatively related to emotional competence and social problem solving. While standard regression analyses showed that all the above variables were significant predictors of suicidal ideation, hierarchical regression analyses showed that hopelessness was the most important predictor of suicidal ideation, followed by social problem solving and emotional competence. Further regression analyses found that all four subscales of emotional competence, i.e., empathy, social skills, self-management of emotions, and utilization of emotions, were important predictors of male adolescent suicidal ideation. However, the subscale of social skills was not a significant predictor of female adolescent suicidal ideation. Standard regression analysis also revealed that all three subscales of social problem solving, i.e., negative problem orientation, rational problem solving, and impulsiveness/carelessness style, were important predictors of suicidal ideation. Theoretical and practice implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study examined why some preschool-age children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) showed deleterious outcomes and others appeared more resilient. Resilience, conceptualized as strengths in emotion regulation and prosocial skills, was evaluated using the Social Competence Scale developed by the Conduct Problem Prevention Research Group. The sample consisted of 56 mothers and their 4- to 6-year-old children exposed to IPV within the past 2 years. After controlling for relevant demographic factors, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that better parenting performance, fewer maternal mental health problems, and less severe violence exposure predicted better emotion regulation and prosocial skill scores, which in turn were negatively correlated with maladaptive child behaviors. These findings can be used to inform and enhance clinical services for children exposed to IPV.

AB Introduction: This article gives an overview of the consultant child and adolescent psychiatric services in the region of Upper Bavaria (Germany). Method: The data of 257 children and adolescents with intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders were evaluated. Results: About 14% of the children with ID in special schools or day care centers, and 40% of the children with ID in residential care showed a definite psychiatric disorder. The most frequently diagnosed disorders were adjustment disorders, hyperkinetic disorders and conduct disorders, as well as emotional problems and pervasive developmental disorders. Children with severe intellectual disability had more additional somatic disorders and were more impaired in their psychosocial functions. Conclusions: The results show the need for psychiatric services for children and adolescents with intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders. The development and implementation of integrative and interdisciplinary models is necessary to allow for adequate medical care for these patients.

AB Evaluation of a two-year intensive outpatient care programme for adolescents with schizophrenia
   Objective: The Trialog project offers patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) a two-year programme of residential outpatient care following discharge from a clinic. The programme aims to support their further recovery and independence and encompasses interactive and psycho-educational multifamily care, coping with persistent symptoms, development of socio-emotional competence, independent house keeping, and support of school and vocational training. Methods: To evaluate psychopathology along with social and neuropsychological function for 12 participants over a period of 2 years. Their progress was compared with that of 12 EOS patients who did not attend Trialog following discharge. Results: Participants showed a significantly greater decrease of positive and negative symptoms, as opposed to an increase in positive symptoms in the comparison group. Measures of social function, neuropsychological indicators of memory, (selective) attention, and psychomotor speed improved more than in the comparison subjects. Neither group showed changes in measures of intelligence or in the subjective quality of life. Conclusions: First analyses raise hope that monitoring participant performance in the programme of the "Trialog project" will improve the treatment and care of EOS-patients in the critical first years following the onset of schizophrenia.

AB Background: A strong increase in smoking is noted especially among adolescents. In the Netherlands, about 5% of all 10-year olds, 25% of all 13-year olds and 62% of all 17-year olds report ever smoking. In the U. S., an intervention program called 'Smoke-free Kids' was developed to prevent children from smoking. The present study aims to assess the effects of this home-based smoking prevention program in the Netherlands.
   Methods/Design: A randomized controlled trial is conducted among 9 to 11-year old children of primary schools. Participants are randomly assigned to the intervention and control conditions. The intervention program consists of five printed activity modules designed to improve parenting skills specific to smoking prevention and parent-child communication regarding smoking. These modules will include additional sheets with communication tips. The modules for the control condition will include solely information on smoking and tobacco use.
   Initiation of cigarette smoking (first instance of puffing on a lighted cigarette), susceptibility to cigarette smoking, smoking-related cognitions, and anti-smoking socialization will be the outcome measures. To collect the data, telephone interviews with mothers as well as with their child will be conducted at baseline. Only the children will be examined at post-intervention follow-ups (6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the baseline).
   Discussion: This study protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based smoking prevention program. We expect that a significantly lower number of children will start smoking in the intervention condition compared to control condition as a direct result of this intervention. If the program is effective, it is applicable in daily live, which will facilitate implementation of the prevention protocol.

AB Background:
   Underage drinking is a significant social and public health problem in Thailand. We report the prevalence and patterns of alcohol consumption and associated health-risk behaviors using data from a 2007-2008 national school survey.
   Method:
   A cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among 50,033 high school and vocational college students from 201 schools in 40 provinces between December 2007 and February 2008.
   Results:
   The prevalence rates of past-year drinking, past-30-day binge drinking, and drinking until intoxication were 25.5, 9.5, and 17.3% in boys and 14.5, 3.7, and 7.2% in girls, respectively. Higher school levels, lower grades, living with someone other than their own parents, and having family members with substance or alcohol problems were significantly associated with all kinds of drinking. Binge drinkers were significantly more likely to have drinking consequences, e.g., driving after drinking, nausea and vomiting, and having a hangover than were nonbinge drinkers. The rates of other behavior and emotional problems were 2.5 to 6.7 times as likely in drinkers as nondrinkers, including smoking (35.1% vs. 4.9%), prescription drug misuse (17.7% vs. 6.7%), illicit substance use (17.8% vs. 2.4%), carrying a weapon (6.5% vs. 1.8%), feeling depressed (23.2% vs. 10.9%), suicidal attempt (10.5% vs. 3.8%), and sexual intercourse (30.5% vs. 5.7%).
   Conclusion:
   Alcohol consumption is a serious problem among adolescents in Thailand and is strongly associated with various health-risk behaviors. Effective age- and gender-specific interventions should be implemented to discourage underage drinking and associated adverse health and social consequences.

AB The distinction between bipolar disorder (BD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is difficult because of their shared clinical features such as motor agitation, distractibility, impulsivity or irritability. In clinical practice, a rigorous assessment of affective symptoms can help to distinguish between BD (acute affective episodes) and ADHD (chronic irritability or low self-esteem without psychotic symptoms, elation or sexual desinhibition). Impaired cognitive functions have been shown in both diseases; however, some studies identified a major emotional dysregulation in BD by contrast to ADHD, whereas cognitive deficits could more specifically characterize the latter. Comorbid BD and ADHD is a frequent and severe condition. The coprescription of psychostimulants and mood stabilizers has shown its potential clinic and functional benefits.

AB The aim of this study was to elaborate a questionnaire to assess social information processing (SIP) related to aggressive behavior in adolescents. This questionnaire consists of five situations that adolescents have to imagine to assess the following SIP components: Interpretation, Anger, Response selection, and Emotion regulation. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the structure of the questionnaire in a sample of 1231 adolescents aged between 12 and 17. Furthermore, an alternative version of the questionnaire was developed with Likert response items. This version showed good structure and internal consistency (between 0.66 and 0.87). SIP components were differently associated with proactive and reactive aggression. Finally, boys scored higher than girls on SIP components characteristics of aggressive behavior.

AB To assess the effectiveness of providing training in elaborative, emotion rich reminiscing (emotional reminiscing, ER) as an adjunct to Parent Management Training (PMT) for parents of children (N = 38, M age = 56.9, SD = 15.8 months) with oppositional behaviors. Control parents received PMT and non-language adjunct intervention, child-directed play. All components of the intervention were manualized. Parents in both conditions received training in an abbreviated course of PMT. Parents in the ER condition additionally received brief training in discussing everyday past events with their child incorporating emotion labels and causes, "wh" questions, and detailed descriptive information. Parents in the control condition received training in allowing their child to lead during play sessions. Across both conditions, children's oppositional behaviors decreased between the beginning and end of training. Providing parents with training parents in an elaborative, emotion-rich reminiscing style resulted in greater parent and child use of elaborations and emotion references during shared conversations. Given findings in the literature of an association between parental emotion talk and children's emotional competence, developmental skills that are frequently compromised in oppositional children, the current pilot study has implications for interventions that broaden the focus of PMT.

AB Research on adulthood posits personality and self-esteem as important predictors of psychopathology. In childhood, however, the study of these relationships is complicated by the lack of consensus on how to combine data from multiple informants of child behavior. This study evaluates the relationships among personality symptoms, self-esteem and psychopathology in 60 child psychiatric patients (M (age) = 10.6) using principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate data from multiple informants and compares this strategy with a single informant approach. When predictor and criterion measures were rated by a single informant, strong and differential relationships between personality symptoms, self-esteem and psychopathology are found. When multiple informant data were combined into composite scores by PCA, correlations decreased but remained significant. Hierarchical regression analyses affirm the robustness of the following pattern: Emotional Instability, Introversion and Global Self-Esteem are associated with internalizing whereas Disagreeableness and Behavioral Conduct primarily relate to externalizing problems.

AB This study aims to analyse how the characteristics of Youth under custody in foster residences and the characteristics of foster residences affect the sociolaboral insertion after coming of age. This information is important for maximizing the possibilities of an autonomous, positive and satisfactory life after coming of age. The directors of 36 finalist residences that care for young people who will come of age in the same center were interviewed. Information about people who left the residences when they came of age over the past 2 to 5 years (n = 143) was gathered. Results show that after leaving the center. girls lived more with their partner, became pregnant at an early age, and did not work although they had received more job training than boys and did not seem to have more work instability. The young people who had been in more than one center had more problems with drugs, did not have a job, and have less acceptance of social rules, perseverance at work and emotional regulation than the other young people. The subgroups classified as "successful" scored better than other groups in autonomy; education, acceptance of the rules, perseverance at work, emotional regulation, ability to negotiate and be assertive. More "successful" young people came from centers in which the educators have less children. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite continued efforts by researchers, a gap still exists in our understanding of the psychological, social, and emotional adjustment of gifted students. Historically, research and education of the gifted has focused on cognitive variables, with less attention given to the social and emotional needs of these students. The current study used data from the full Add Health data set to examine how protective factors moderated depression differently for gifted and nongifted adolescents. Results of the study indicate that gifted students are significantly less depressed than nongifted students, and all of the protective factors moderated depression for both groups. Future research should examine additional indicators of psychosocial well-being provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the social and emotional development of gifted and nongifted adolescents.

AB Aggressive, violent and antisocial behaviour in children and adolescents is a growing concern across the globe. Targeting parent-teen relationships is critical in reducing problem behaviour. 'Connect' is a manualized ten-week program for parents or alternative caregivers of at-risk teens that focuses on the building blocks of secure attachment: parental sensitivity, cooperation, reflective capacity, and effective dyadic affect regulation. Through didactic and experiential activities, parents develop the competence necessary to identify, understand and respond to the needs of their teen in a manner that provides structure and safety while safeguarding the quality of the parent-teen relationship. In Study 1, twenty parents reported significant increases in perceived parenting satisfaction and efficacy and reductions in adolescents' aggression, antisocial behaviour and other mental health problems following completion of Connect as compared to a waitlist control period. These effects were sustained and additional small effects were noted in decreases in conduct problems, depression and anxiety at a 12-month follow-up. The program was then transported to 17 communities serving 309 parents through standardized training and Supervision of group leaders. Study 2 summarizes significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in teen externalizing and internalizing problems; enhanced social functioning; and improvements in affect regulation. Parents also reported significant increases in parenting satisfaction and perceived efficacy and reductions in caregiver burden.

Participants included 246 young adults from a large Midwestern university, as well as their mothers. Higher levels of maternal control, particularly psychological control, were related to lower levels of young adults' emotion regulation. This study is among the first to explore the above relations within the context of young adulthood. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the "real-life'' prevalence of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents in Germany and related behavioral and emotional problems. Data from the nationwide representative National German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) were analyzed.
   Method: A total of 17,450 subjects aged 0-17 years from 167 communities were examined as part of the KiGGS in Germany between 2003 and 2006 to determine their use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and sedatives within the 7 days prior to being interviewed. Medication use was assessed by a medical doctor who conducted a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) with the parents, and related emotional and behavioral problems were assessed using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Results: The overall prevalence for these medications was moderate (4.81/1000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.70-6.26), but prevalence varied across the different classes of drugs (sedatives > antipsychotics > antidepressants > anxiolytics). Rates of off-label use were high for antipsychotics and antidepressants. About 30% of the medication, especially sedatives, was used without prescription. Subjects using psychotropic medication obtained higher scores in the screening for emotional or behavioral problems than the total sample, but 40% of the children did not show abnormal scores.
   Conclusion: The indication for antipsychotics was mostly behavioral symptomatology, while antidepressants were used for a wide variety of symptoms. The high proportion of children and adolescents using psychotropic medication with normal scores in the emotional and behavioral screening was remarkable. It cannot be determined whether in these cases low scores were related to improvement in symptoms or whether medication was being misused.

AB Objectives: This study investigated predictors of mental health service utilization from age 5 through age 16. Methods: Data were collected on a community sample of 399 children, including 338 European Americans and 61 African Americans. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed by maternal and teacher reports in kindergarten. History of mental health service utilization was assessed by maternal reports when participants were 16 years old. Results: On average, the probability of first-time mental health service utilization increased in early to middle childhood, stabilized, and then increased in early adolescence. Mother reports of internalizing behaviors (independent of teacher reports of externalizing behaviors) predicted an increased likelihood of service use among European American children but a decreased likelihood of service use among African American children. Externalizing behaviors (independent of internalizing behaviors) predicted a higher likelihood of first-time service use in middle childhood. The combination of elevated internalizing and externalizing behaviors predicted a higher likelihood of first-time service use in adolescence, mainly among European American children. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that elevated mother-reported internalizing behaviors are less likely to forecast mental health service utilization among African American children compared with European American children. To meet the mental health service needs of all children, it is critical to further examine reasons for service utilization and underutilization among children with internalizing problems.

AB Few studies have examined the prevalence of nitrous oxide (NO) inhalation or co-occurrence of NO and volatile solvent (VS) use in adolescents. Study aims were to (1) describe the independent and conjoint prevalence of NO and VS use in incarcerated youth, (2) compare adolescent users of both NO and VS inhalants (NO+VS) to users of NO-only, VS-only, and nonusers of NO and VS (NO/VS nonusers) with regard to demographic, psychological, and behavioral characteristics, and (3) conduct logistic regression analyses identifying correlates of NO use. Residents (N = 723) of Missouri Division of Youth Services were assessed with standardized psychosocial measures. Participants averaged 15.5 (SD = 1.2) years of age, were ethnically diverse and predominantly male. Lifetime prevalence of NO use was 15.8%. NO+VS users evidenced greater impairments compared to NO+VS nonusers. VS-only users evidenced impairments that were similar in kind but at lower prevalences compared to those displayed by NO+VS users, whereas NO-only youth had profiles that were similar to those of NO/VS nonusers. Psychiatric disorders, polydrug use, and temperamental fearlessness were correlates of NO use. NO+VS users were at high risk for behavioral and emotional problems. Screening and interventions for NO and VS inhalant use should be implemented in juvenile justice facilities.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether preterm children with low risk for neurodevelopmental deficits show long-term changes in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes compared with term children and to relate these changes to cognitive outcome.
   METHODS: MRI was used to evaluate 20 preterm children who were determined to be at low risk for neurodevelopmental deficits and were born between 30 and 34 weeks' gestational age without major neonatal morbidity or cerebral pathology in the neonatal period and 22 matched, term control subjects. Volumetric images were analyzed by means of voxel-based morphometry to identify regional cerebral alterations. Children also underwent cognitive and behavioral/emotional assessments.
   RESULTS: Preterm children showed global and regional GM volume reductions in several brain areas, including temporal and parietal lobes and concomitant WM volume reductions in the same areas, although only the left temporal regions achieved statistical significance. Global intellectual performance in the preterm group was significantly decreased compared with control subjects. Neither behavioral nor emotional problems were found in the preterm group. In the whole sample, we found a positive correlation between GM volume bilaterally in the middle temporal and in the postcentral gyri with IQ. Positive correlations were observed between GM and gestational age at birth in parietal and temporal cerebral regions and with WM in parietal regions.
   CONCLUSION: Preterm birth has an important impact on the neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcome of children at 9 years of age, being a risk factor for decreased regional cortical GM and WM even in preterm children with low risk for neurodevelopmental deficits. Pediatrics 2009; 124: e1161-e1170

AB Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence of the use of medicines, particularly over-the-counter medicines (OTC medicines), and to analyse its association with different personal and lifestyle aspects. Setting The study sample was an adolescent population in the Valencian Community (East Spain) aged 14-17 years. Method A total of 23,349 adolescents from 229 schools completed a questionnaire (response rate 89.54%). We analysed adolescents who were taking prescribed medicines at the time of the questionnaire, and who were users of OTC medicines that had not been prescribed by a doctor for a particular illness. We estimated this association with several personal and lifestyle factors using simple and multivariate analyses and logistic regression. Results A total of 15.18% of the participants reported that they were taking prescribed medicines when they answered the questionnaire, and 45.38% of the participants reported a frequent use of OTC medicines. Prescribed medicine use is more likely in older adolescents [Relative Prevalence Ratio adjusted by confounding factors (RPRa) 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10], in those who had tried to lose weight by dieting in the last year (RPRa 1.23, 95% CI: 1.11-1.37), in current smokers (RPRa 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.27), in those who had a serious emotional problem (RPRa 1.85, 95% CI: 1.60-2.16) and in people who presented a chronic pathology (RPRa 8.24, 95% CI: 7.45-9.11). Respondents who reported a frequent use of OTC medicines were more likely to be older (RPRa 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.06), have tried to lose weight by dieting in the last year (RPRa 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.24), be a current smoker (RPRa 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.28), have a serious emotional problem (RPRa 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and watch TV (RPRa 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16-1.32). Conclusions We noted an extensive use of medicines, especially OTC medicines, in adolescents, and an association with some personal and lifestyle factors. We conclude that prevention and early education of a responsible use of medicines should be a public health priority.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in patients with craniosynostosis and to determine the prospective association of a beaten-copper pattern before 18 months of age with behavioral and emotional problems in patients with craniosynostosis.
   Methods: The authors performed a follow-up study of 115 craniosynostosis patients at the Erasmus Children's University Hospital in Rotterdam. Behavioral and emotional problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist at a mean age of 8 years. The presence of beaten-copper pattern before the age of 18 months was assessed on presurgical radiographs. Analyses were adjusted for intelligence quotient.
   Results: Whereas craniosynostosis patients with intelligence quotients of 85 or greater did not differ from children in the normal group, craniosynostosis patients with intelligence quotients less than 85 had a higher risk of behavioral and emotional problems. However, these results were comparable to the findings of other studies assessing psychopathology in children with lower intelligence levels. Type of craniosynostosis (single suture versus complex) and a beaten-copper pattern before the age of 18 months did not affect the risk for behavioral and emotional problems in children with craniosynostosis.
   Conclusion: When intelligence is taken into account, craniosynostosis is not associated with an increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems, nor is type of craniosynostosis or a beaten-copper pattern before the age of 18 months. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 124: 2054, 2009.)

AB The construct of emotion dysregulation increasingly has been used to explain diverse psychopathologies across the lifespan. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; K. L. Gratz & L. Roemer, 2004) represents the most comprehensive measure of the construct to date and exhibits good reliability and validity in adults; however, the measure has yet to be tested in adolescents. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the DERS in a community sample of 428 adolescents (ages 13-17 years). Exploratory factor analysis supported a 6-factor structure consistent with the 6 DERS subscales. Internal consistencies for the subscales were good to excellent (alphas ranged from .76 to .89). In support of the measure's construct validity, the DERS exhibited robust correlations with psychological problems reflecting emotion dysregulation, specifically depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, alcohol use, and drug use. Intercorrelations among the DERS subscales ranged from negligible to high (range: r = .04 to r = .68), and potential problems with discriminant validity were noted. In general, results support the reliability and validity of the DERS as a measure of emotion dysregulation in adolescents.

AB Personality as a resource or risk for development was discussed in the light of the results of the ongoing Finnish Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (FJYLS) which the author has conducted since 1968 when the participants (N = 369, b. 1959) were 8 years of age. A general hypothesis presented within a two-dimensional framework of self-control and activity was that the child's high self-control of emotions and behavior would be associated with adaptive behavior in adulthood. The results have provided evidence in support for and limitations to the hypothesis. High self-control was a resource and low self-control was a risk for development, but there were gender differences that came out consistently in variable-oriented and person-oriented analyses. A resource factor for male adult social functioning was, compared to females, a broader construct of self-control in childhood covering both more passive (compliant) and active (constructive) behavior; only active well-controlled (constructive) behavior was a resource for female functioning. A risk factor for female functioning was low self-control combined with passivity (internalizing behavior), whereas low self-control combined with activity (externalizing behavior) was a risk factor for male functioning. Childhood self-control was not directly associated with adult psychological functioning such as well-being but indirectly through social functioning such as career development. Low self-control in childhood was an antecedent of criminal behavior but only for those male offenders who committed offences in adulthood, not for those who had limited their offending to adolescence.

AB Fronto-limbic neural dysfunction has been implicated in the emotional dysregulation and impulsivity seen in borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, it remains unclear whether affected individuals exhibit morphologic changes of the insular cortex, a fronto-limbic integration cortex engaged in emotional regulation and impulse control. This magnetic resonance imaging study examined the insular cortex volume and its relationship to clinical characteristics in a first-presentation teenage BPD sample. No significant difference was found in the insular volume between 20 BPD participants (5 males) and 20 healthy control participants (5 males). There was no association between the insular volume and parasuicidal episodes, trauma exposure, or comorbid Axis I disorders, but the BPD participants with violent episodes during the previous 6 months had a smaller insular volume bilaterally compared with those without such episodes. Furthermore, right anterior insular volume in the BPD participants was negatively correlated with impulsivity score. These preliminary findings suggest that insular cortex volume does not significantly differ in early BPD, but that there might be a relationship with violent and impulsive behavior that is often seen in the disorder. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the potential relationship between the insular cortex volume and impulsivity is specific to BPD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Why do some countries, regions and schools have more bullying than others? What socio-economic, socio-political and other larger contextual factors predict school bullying? These open questions inspired this study with 53.316 5th- and 9th-grade students (5% of the national student population in these grades), from 1,000 schools in Colombia. Students completed a national test of citizenship competencies, which included questions about bullying and about families, neighborhoods and their own socio-emotional competencies. We combined these data with community violence and socio-economic conditions of all Colombian municipalities, which allowed us to conduct multilevel analyses to identify municipality- and school-level variables predicting school bullying. Most variance was found at the school level. Higher levels of school bullying were related to more males in the schools, lower levels of empathy, more authoritarian and violent families, higher levels of community violence, better socio-economic conditions, hostile attributional biases and more beliefs supporting aggression. These results might reflect student, classroom and school contributions because student-level variables were aggregated at the school level. Although in small portions, violence from the decades-old-armed conflict among guerrillas, paramilitaries and governmental forces predicted school bullying at the municipal level for 5th graders. For 9th graders, inequality in land ownership predicted school bullying. Neither poverty, nor population density or homicide rates contributed to explaining bullying. These results may help us advance toward understanding how the larger context relates to school bullying, and what socio-emotional competencies may help us prevent the negative effects of a violent and unequal environment Aggr.

AB Background
   The process by which children cope with stressful events is a very relevant topic. However, few systematic efforts have been made to design age-specific measures.
   Methods
   This study examined problems commonly experienced by children, ages between 7 and 12 years, from two different sources: a primary school mainly enrolling families of medium socio-economic status, and an after-school social care centre from a socially and economically deprived neighbourhood. Data were obtained using the younger version of the Kidcope.
   Results
   Almost 55% of the sample reported a problem related to others with no differences observed in age, gender or school group. The strategies that children considered the most effective were 'social support' (35%), 'emotional regulation' (33%) and 'wishful thinking' (32%). The children from disadvantaged backgrounds reported different problems mainly related with 'victimization and violence', 'moving house' and conflicts with 'norms and rules' and tended to use avoidant strategies to face them, which could be related to the perception of uncontrollability of these stressors.
   Conclusions
   This study reported the first descriptive results in the type of problems and coping strategies of two different social groups of Spanish children using the Kidcope. The Kidcope can be useful to screen children for coping abilities at an early age living under stressful conditions in underprivileged sectors of society.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Some children, whom we have labeled poly-victims, experience very high levels of victimizations of different types. This article finds support for a conceptual model suggesting that there may be four distinct pathways to becoming such a poly-victim: (a) residing in a dangerous community, (b) living in a dangerous family, (c) having a chaotic, multiproblem family environment, or (d) having emotional problems that increase risk behavior, engender antagonism, and compromise the capacity to protect oneself. It uses three waves of the Developmental Victimization Survey, a nationally representative sample of children aged 2-17 years. All four hypothesized pathways showed significant independent association with poly-victim onset. For the younger children, the symptom score representing emotional problems was the only significant predictor. For the older children, the other three pathway variables were significant predictors-dangerous communities, dangerous families, and problem families-but not symptom score. Poly-victimization onset was also disproportionately likely to occur in the year prior to children's 7th and 15th birthday, corresponding roughly to the entry into elementary school and high school. The identification of such pathways and the ages of high onset should help practitioners design programs for preventing vulnerable children from becoming poly-victims.

AB Emotion Regulation Training (ERT) was developed for adolescents with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and emotion dysregulation. ERT is an adaptation of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) programme. This paper describes the background of the programme, and gives an outline of the treatment programme. The effectiveness of ERT was examined in a randomized controlled pilot study with 43 youth (aged 14-19 years) in five mental health centres in the Netherlands. Subjects were assessed before and after random assignment to ERT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or to TAU alone (n = 20). Outcome measures included assessment of BPD symptoms, locus of control, and internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Both groups showed equal reductions in BPD symptoms over time. The group receiving ERT plus TAU (and not the TAU-only group) had a significant increase in internal locus of control: ERT participants reported more sense of control over their own mood swings, and attributed changes in mood swings not only to external factors. The study was complicated by a high attrition. The implications of the findings are discussed, including the difficulties inherent in treating and researching an adolescent population, and the need for researchers to develop age-appropriate assessments.

AB The present longitudinal study investigated cascade effects linking the longitudinal trajectories of shyness and aggressiveness between age 4 and 23 and individual differences in this longitudinal relationship. Results demonstrated that there were cascade effects from shyness to adjacent measures of aggressiveness at three moments in time. and that the dynamics of these relationships changed over time. Children who were shy at age 6 became less aggressive at age 7 and the same effect was found between age 8 and age 10. From adolescence to early adulthood, the direction of the relationship changed and shy adolescents at age 17 became increasingly aggressive 5 years later. Interindividual differences were found in the latter cascade effect in that shyness at age 17 only predicted an increase in aggressiveness at age 23 for adolescents receiving low levels of support from their parents and for adolescents spending little time in part-time work. Together, findings suggest the importance of examining the development of normal variations in personality and personality disorders from a developmental perspective and taking into account person-environment interactions.

AB In this longitudinal study, we examined identity development using the life story model (McAdams, 2001), in addition to a traditional identity status approach, in order to explore the association between perceived parenting in adolescence and the subsequent quality of life story narration in emerging adulthood. Participants (N = 100) were given a battery of questionnaires at ages 17 and 26 years and were asked to narrate a story at age 26 about their most difficult life experience. Low point narratives were analyzed for evidence of concluding clarity, resolution, and affective tone, termed coherent positive resolution (Pals, 2006). Structural equation modeling showed that participants who experienced more positive parenting at age 17 narrated their low points with clearer evidence of coherent positive resolution at age 26. Coherent positive resolution of the low point was also related to concurrent measures of identity achievement and emotional adjustment at age 26. Discussion centers on the potential impact of positive parenting as a contributor to healthy low point narration and identity in emerging adulthood.

AB Toward advancing conceptualizations of the spillover hypothesis, this study examined the conditions and mechanisms underlying the transmission of distress from the interparental relationship to parenting difficulties over a 2-year period in a sample of 233 mothers (M = 35.0 years) and fathers (M = 36.8 years) of kindergarten children. Findings from autoregressive structural equation models indicated that parents' gender moderated associations between interparental conflict and parental psychological control and insensitivity to children's negative affect. Pathways between interparental conflict and parenting difficulties over the 2-year period were significant for fathers but not mothers. Analysis of insecurity and depressive symptoms as affective mechanisms of spillover revealed that adult relationship insecurity was a significant mediator in the pathways between interparental conflict and parenting difficulties experienced by fathers.

Parents provided basic demographic and deployment information. Youth reported on their coping, effortful control, and adjustment using standardized self-report measures. Results indicate that youth residing in military families report elevated levels of conduct problems according to established clinical norms. However, Study findings also indicate that effortful control and maternal support act as important protective factors against the development of conduct problems and emotional symptoms, whereas avoidant coping is associated with greater emotional symptoms. No significant differences emerged among youth of recently deployed versus non-deployed parents. Findings are discussed in light Of Current stressors on military youth and families. and in terms of their implications for successful intervention and prevention programming. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   RELATEDNESS; DEPRESSION; SELF
AB Background:
   Adolescence is a time when intense emotions are elicited within the parent-adolescent relationship, often when autonomy subjectively is endangered. As emotion dysregulation is one of the risk processes for the development of psychopathology, adolescence may be perceived as a highly sensitive period for maladjustment. Inter-individual differences in emotionality and emotion regulation have been shown to be influenced or moderated by molecular genetic differences in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) and by attachment patterns. We investigated whether both the 5-HTT and attachment are associated with emotionality and emotion regulation in an observed adolescent-mother interaction and the personality traits aggressiveness and anxiety in adolescence.
   Methods:
   Ninety-one adolescents at age 12 were observed in interaction with their mothers during a standardized emotion-eliciting social task to assess emotionality and emotion regulation in relation to autonomy. Adolescents' aggressiveness and anxiety were assessed by mother report. Concurrent attachment quality was determined by an attachment interview. DNA samples were collected in order to assess the 5-HTTLPR, a repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene.
   Results:
   While the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene was associated with a higher overall rate of autonomy behaviors, attachment security was related to more agreeable and less hostile autonomy. A significant interaction revealed a moderating effect of attachment security. Carriers of the short version of the 5-HTTLPR showed more agreeable autonomy when they had a secure attachment behavior strategy but showed more hostile autonomy when they were insecurely attached. Carriers of the short version of the 5-HTTLPR and insecurely attached adolescents were rated as more aggressive.
   Conclusions:
   The study suggests a gene-attachment interaction in adolescents where the adolescent's attachment status moderates a genetically based higher negative reactivity in response to threats to autonomy in social interactions.

SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Internalizing problems; externalizing problems; emotions; heart rate;
   response coherence
ID INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BASIC EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM; PATTERNS; FEAR
AB Background:
   Effective emotion regulation should be reflected in greater coherence between physiological and subjective aspects of emotional responses.
   Method:
   Youths with normative to clinical levels of internalizing problems (IP) and externalizing problems (EP) watched emotionally evocative film-clips while having heart rate (HR) recorded, and reported subjective feelings.
   Results:
   Hierarchical linear modeling revealed weaker coherence between HR and negative feelings in youths, especially boys, with more EP. Youths with IP showed coherence between HR and negative feelings that did not match the affect portrayed in the eliciting stimuli, but atypical positive emotions: they felt happier when they had slower HR. Youths without problems predominantly showed normative emotional coherence.
   Conclusions:
   Youths with EP and IP experience atypical patterns of activation across physiological and experiential emotion systems which could undermine emotion regulation in evocative situations.

AB Background:
   Several theoretical perspectives suggest that emotion dysregulation is a predisposing risk factor for many psychiatric disorders. Yet despite a rapidly evolving literature, difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) are often measured inconsistently across studies, with little regard to whether different approaches capture the same construct. In this study, we evaluate the correspondence between two widely used measures of emotion dysregulation that cut across self-report and physiological levels of analysis. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate whether youth self-reports of ER difficulties correspond with physiological measures of emotion dysregulation collected at baseline and during sad emotion induction, and (2) validate the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in a youth sample.
   Method:
   We measured emotion dysregulation among a sample of youth with depression, conduct problems, comorbid depression/conduct problems, or no psychiatric condition. Youth were assessed initially at ages 8-12 (Year 1) and followed up at Years 2 and 3. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a widely used physiological index of emotion regulation, was measured across all three years during sad emotion induction. At Year 3, the DERS was also administered.
   Results:
   Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that slopes in RSA collected across the three assessments were associated with later self-reported ER abilities at the transition into adolescence. These findings were replicated across contexts (baseline and emotional challenge), suggesting that adolescents whose physiological responding to emotional challenge improves also experience fewer difficulties with emotion regulation as they mature.

AB Background:
   The regulation of emotion is essential for adaptive functioning. However, delineating the pathways of emotion regulation (ER) processes that lead to psychological adaptation remains under-studied, with mixed evidence for the specificity vs. generality of ER deficits in relation to specific forms of psychopathology. To examine this issue, this study investigated links among ER, social-contextual factors (family, peer), and psychological adjustment (internalizing, externalizing).
   Method:
   Participants were 140 adolescents (71% female, 83.3% Caucasian, M age = 16.03 years) who were consecutive psychiatric admissions over a one-year period. Adolescents completed measures on family environment and peer relationship experiences. Both adolescents and parents reported on adolescents' characteristic patterns of ER and psychopathology.
   Results:
   Discriminant analyses revealed that two functions, ER skills and impulsivity/lability, differentiated among adolescents who were elevated in internalizing symptoms only, in externalizing symptoms only, in both domains, or in neither domain. Regarding social contextual variables, family cohesion was associated with adaptive ER behaviors for girls along the internalizing dimension and all adolescents reporting externalizing behaviors. Relational victimization predicted difficulties with ER in both symptom domains for all adolescents. Within the internalizing domain, friendship support was related to adaptive ER.
   Conclusion:
   Facets of ER do differentiate between global indices of internalizing and externalizing behaviors and suggest that both general and specific factors contribute to adolescents' unique learning history with emotions and characteristic patterns for managing emotions.

AB Objective: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits in children and adolescents are increasingly recognized as a distinctive dimension of prognostic importance in clinical samples. Nevertheless, comparatively little is known about the longitudinal effects of these personality traits on the mental health of young people from the general population. Using a large representative sample of children and adolescents living in Great Britain, we set out to examine the effects of CU traits on a range of mental health outcomes measured 3 years after the initial assessment. Method: Parents were interviewed to determine the presence of CU traits in a representative sample of 7,636 children and adolescents. The parents also completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a broad measure of childhood psychopathology. Three years later, parents repeated the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: At 3-year follow-up, CU traits were associated with conduct, hyperactivity, emotional, and total symptom scores. After adjusting for the effects of all covariates, including baseline symptom score, CU traits remained robustly associated with the overall levels of conduct problems and emotional problems and with total psychiatric difficulties at 3-year follow-up. Conclusions: Callous-unemotional traits are independently associated with future psychiatric difficulties in children and adolescents. An assessment of CU traits adds small but significant improvements to the prediction of future psychopathology. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(11):1079-1084.

AB Since the decade of 1980, the model of stress and coping proposed for the assessment of vulnerability of adoptive families emphasizes that the emotional adjustment of those adopted is moderated by variables such as institutionalization, the manner and age at which the adoption was revealed, the change of first name, and the contact with the biological family. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of these variables to the perceived parenting style, mood, and self-esteem of the adopted adolescents. Participants in the study were 68 adolescents, between the ages of 14 and 15, adopted during infancy through judicial channels. The adolescents responded to a questionnaire about the history of adoption and to scales of Parenting Styles, Depression and Self-esteem. The main results indicated that the late revelation of adoption and the change of the first name are connected to higher levels of depression and low self-esteem and to more frequent perceptions of negligent or authoritarian parenting style. The contact with the biological family was frequently mentioned among those who perceived their parents as authoritative and presented the best indicator of mood and self-esteem. These findings were discussed in light of the necessity for multidisciplinary actions which can improve the psychological adaptation of the adopting families.

AB In the past decade, neuroimaging research has identified key components in the neural system that underlies bipolar disorder (BD). The ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) and amygdala are highly interconnected structures that jointly play a central role in emotional regulation. Numerous research groups have reported prominent structural and functional abnormalities within the VPFC and amygdala supporting their essential role in a neural system underlying the emotional dysregulation that is a core feature of BD. Findings in BD also include those in brain regions interconnected with the VPFC and amygdala, including the ventral striatum, hippocampus and the cerebellum. Abnormalities in these regions may contribute to symptoms that reflect disruption in functions sub-served by these structures, including motivational, mnemonic and psychomotor functions.
   This article will first review leads from behavioural neurology that implicated these neural system abnormalities in BD. It will then review findings from structural and functional imaging studies to support the presence of abnormalities within these neural system components in BD. It will also review new findings from studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that provide increasing evidence of abnormalities in the connections between these neural system components in BD. Emerging data supporting differences in this neural system during adolescence, as well as potential beneficial effects of treatment on structure and function will also be presented. Finally, the article will discuss the implications for future investigations, including those for early identification and treatment of BD.

AB We examined respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), emotion regulation (ER), and prospective depressive symptoms in children at risk for depression and controls. Of the 65 children (35 boys; 5-13 years) in the sample, 39 had a parent with childhood-onset mood disorder and 26 had a parent with no history of major psychiatric disorder. RSA during pre- and post-film baselines and RSA reactivity to sad film clip were measured. Later, children's ER responses (focusing on sad/distressing affect) were assessed using a parent-reported questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were measured via clinical ratings. Results indicated that, compared to the initial baseline, a greater decrease in RSA (i.e., more vagal withdrawal) in response to the sad film clip predicted more adaptive ER responses and lower levels of clinician-rated depressive symptoms. However, tests for ER as a mediator of the association between RSA reactivity and depressive symptoms were precluded because maladaptive, but not adaptive, ER was associated with depressive symptoms. Overall, results suggest that cardiac vagal withdrawal (a greater decrease in RSA) in response to an emotional stimulus reflects more adaptive parasympathetic activity, which could facilitate children's ability to effectively manage their sadness and distress and predict lower risk of depressive symptoms over time.

AB Background/Objective: Adult survivors of childhood cancer can have altered social functioning. We sought to identify factors that predict marriage and divorce outcomes in this growing population.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 8,928 >= 5-year adult survivors of childhood malignancy and 2,879 random sibling controls participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Marital status, current health, psychological status, and neurocognitive functioning were determined from surveys and validated instruments.
   Results: Survivors were more likely to be never-married than siblings [relative risk (RR), 1.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.15-1.26] and the U.S. population (1111, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.21-1.29), after adjusting for age, gender, and race. Patients with central nervous system tumors were at greatest risk of not marrying (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.41-1.59). Married survivors divorced at frequencies similar to controls. In multivariable regression analysis, nonmarriage was most associated with cranial radiation (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.31 for >2,400 centigray). In analysis of neurobehavioral functioning, nonmarriage was associated with worse task efficiency (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.35), but not with emotional distress, or problems with emotional regulation, memory, or organization. Physical conditions predictive of nonmarriage included short stature (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.34) and poor physical function (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18). Structural equation modeling suggested that cranial radiation influenced marriage status through short stature, cognitive problems, and poor physical function.
   Conclusions: Childhood cancer survivors married at lower frequencies compared with peers. Patients with central nervous system tumors, cranial radiation, impaired processing efficiency, and short stature were more likely to never marry. Divorce patterns in survivors were similar to peers.

ID EGOCENTRICITY INDEX; PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; STUDENTS;
   DEPRESSION; ANXIETY
AB Background. - There is an ongoing debate of how giftedness affects social-emotional adjustment. Self-esteem may be an indicator of social-emotional adjustment but insufficient in its explanatory capacity, especially high self-esteem which tends to produce opposite responses in regards to adjustment. A distinction between defensive and genuine high self-esteem could account for these results. In order to understand how self-esteem operates on social-emotional adjustment, it should be associated with other measurements relating to self-concern. In the Rorschach comprehensive system (CS), egocentricity index measures self-centeredness, which can be defined as the balance between self-concern and concern for others. High self-concern is associated with a neglect of the others. Operationalized here, as the interaction of high self-esteem and excessive self-concern, defensive high self-esteem should predict maladaptive outcomes.
   Method. - Participants were aged from 9 to 15 years old, with an IQ greater or equal to 130 on the WISC-III. They were attending regular classes and were not in counseling or psychotherapy. Children and adolescents were administrated the Rorschach CS and the Coopersmith self-esteem inventory. Parents completed the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) which assesses general psychopathology.
   Results. - Seventy-eight subjects' data satisfy the conditions of validity of the instruments used. Gifted boys present more behavior and emotional problems than gifted girls in this study. Self-esteem predicts social-emotional adjustment. There is an interaction between self-esteem and self-concern on psychopathology only for high values of self-esteem. Gifted with high self-esteem associated with high self-concern are more vulnerable to maladjustment than high self-esteem associated with low self-concern. Gifted children and adolescents with low self-esteem experience more problems anyhow.
   Conclusion. - These findings reinforce the view that the gifted are a diverse group in terms of social-emotional adjustment and self-esteem. Self-esteem operates as a valuable resource for the social-emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents but only under some conditions. Low self-esteem gifted seem to be at more risk of maladjustment, but that does not mean any causal relationship. Gifted children and adolescents with high self-esteem can be considered as a heterogeneous category. High self-esteem associated to excessive self-concern has less beneficial effects on adjustment than high self-esteem associated to tow self-concern. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between goal frustration, coping and well-being in the context of adolescent headache. Firstly, we investigated whether adolescents with weekly. monthly or no headache complaints differed with regard to the importance assigned to their personal goals, experience of goal frustration, coping with goal frustration and well-being. Secondly, the extent to which goal and coping factors contributed to well-being and whether this relationship differed according to the frequency of headache complaints was examined. For this purpose, 1202 adolescents aged 12-18 completed self-report questionnaires in schools. Adolescents were divided into three groups based on their experience of headache: no headache reported (38%); monthly headache (40%); weekly headache (18%). Results show that these groups did not differ with respect to the importance they attach to goals. They did, however, differ according to experience of goal frustration, use of strategies to cope with goal frustration and well-being, although effect sizes were small. After controlling for individual and headache characteristics, frustration of self acceptance and health goals, and the use of self blame, rumination and other blame were consistently related to lower well-being. Moreover, interactions with headache group indicated that for adolescents with weekly headache, greater frustration of school and self acceptance goals and a lower importance assigned to health goals was more detrimental to well-being than for those with no headache complaints. We conclude that frustration to goal pursuit and strategies for coping with this frustration are important factors in adolescent well-being and may offer important targets for intervention.

AB In recent years, social-emotional competence of preschool children has come to the fore. In spite of this, social-emotional skills have been largely neglected in health examination for school entry in comparison with cognitive skills. After a description of the concepts "emotional competence" and "social competence" the importance of social-emotional skills for school readiness and academic achievement is shown. Then we describe how these skills can be assessed in health examinations for school entry. One can differentiate between behavioural observation, interview, and questionnaires. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are demonstrated and suitable diagnostic instruments are mentioned.

AB Background The nature of the association between birth weight and behavioural problems in adolescence is unclear. Recent studies are limited by their capacity to adjust for important obstetric and measurement issues.
   Aim To examine the nature of the association between birth weight and a range of behavioural symptoms, including anxiety/depression and social problems, in adolescence.
   Methods Data from 4971 mothers and their children participating in the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a prospective, population-based birth cohort, are presented. This study commenced in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. Mothers and their children were followed up at 3-5 days post-birth, and 6 months, 5 years and 14 years after the initial interview. Internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems, social problems and anxiety/depressive symptoms were assessed using Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR) of the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL).
   Results There was no evidence of a linear association between birth weight and behavioural symptoms, when birth weight z-scores were examined as a continuous variable. However, a non-linear association was identified when birth weight z-scores were categorized into quintiles. Children in the lowest and highest quintiles were at higher risk of increased anxiety/depressive and social problems symptoms. After adjustment for potential confounders, birth weight showed a non-linear association with the log odds of social problems {Quintile 1 odds ratio (OR) 1.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 2.23] Quintile 5 OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.12, 2.20)}.
   Conclusions Our findings provide further support for an association between birth weight and some adolescent behaviour problems. This association is likely to be non-linear, affecting babies at both the lower and higher ends of the birth weight distribution.

AB This study investigated whether and how deficits in executive functioning and distortions in appraisal processing are related to subtypes of aggressive behavior. The sample included 83 boys assessed using multi-informant reports and performance measures. Deficits in two executive functions, response inhibition and planning ability were related primarily to reactive aggression. Hostile attributional biases moderated relations between planning ability and proactive and reactive aggression subtypes, with minimal relations between planning deficits and aggression at low levels of hostile attributional bias. As the level of hostile attributional bias increased, the relation between planning deficits and reactive aggression became increasingly large in a positive direction whereas the relation between planning deficits and proactive aggression became increasingly negative. Additionally, hostile encoding moderated the relation between behavioral inhibition and reactive aggressive behavior. Results also suggested a mediational role for response inhibition in the relation between planning ability and reactive aggression.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) is a widely used parent-report measure of youth internalizing and externalizing problems. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that the CBCL may not adequately assess clinical problems in diverse populations. We investigated the measurement equivalence (ME) of the CBCL in an African American adolescent sample (N = 145). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated poor factor model fit; however, modification indices and an alternative two-factor model produced improved fit statistics. Internal consistency coefficients of CBCL scales ranged from alpha =.65 to .88 and were generally lower than those reported for the normative sample. The CBCL exhibited convergent validity with conceptually similar scales on the Parent Report Scale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children; however, the correlations were weaker than those reported for the normative sample. The CBCL Internalizing composite failed to predict clinician-rated Emotional problems, however, the Externalizing composite predicted clinician-rated behavior problems. In summary, the CBCL did not exhibit unequivocal evidence of ME, as it both possesses and lacks a number of statistical attributes that would demonstrate its equivalence with African Americans. Future empirical and theoretical work is discussed.

AB Background:
   The Child Behavior Checklist Juvenile Bipolar Disorder (CBCL-JBD) profile and Posttraumatic Stress Problems (CBCL-PTSP) scale have been used to assess juvenile bipolar disorder (JBD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. However, their validity is questionable according to previous research. Both measures are associated with severe psychopathology often encompassing multiple DSM-IV diagnoses. Further, children who score highly on one of these scales often have elevated scores on the other, independent of PTSD or JBD diagnoses. We hypothesized that the two scales may be indicators of a single syndrome related to dysregulated mood, attention, and behavior. We aimed to describe and identify the overlap between the CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scales.
   Method:
   Two thousand and twenty-nine (2029) children from a nationally representative sample (1073 boys, 956 girls; mean age = 11.98; age range = 6-18) were rated on emotional and behavior problems by their parents using the CBCL. Comparative model testing via structural equation modeling was conducted to determine whether the CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scale are best described as measuring separate versus unitary constructs. Associations with suicidality and competency scores were also examined.
   Results:
   The CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP demonstrated a high degree of overlap (r = .89) at the latent variable level. The best fitting, most parsimonious model was one in which the CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP items identified a single latent construct, which was associated with higher parental endorsement of child suicidal behavior, and lower functioning.
   Conclusions:
   The CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scale overlap to a remarkable degree, and may be best described as measures of a single syndrome. This syndrome appears to be related to severe psychopathology, but may not conform to traditional DSM-IV classification. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the utility of the CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP profiles, and offer promising methods of empirically based measurement of disordered self-regulation in youth.

AB Peer victimization experiences represent developmentally salient stressors among adolescents and are associated with the development of internalizing symptoms. However, the mechanisms linking peer victimization to adolescent psychopathology remain inadequately understood. This study examined emotion dysregulation as a mechanism linking peer stress to changes in internalizing symptoms among adolescents in a longitudinal design. Peer victimization was assessed with the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire (M. J. Prinstein, J. Boergers, & E. M. Vemberg, 2001) in a large (N = 1,065), racially diverse (86.6% non-White) sample of adolescents 11-14 years of age. Emotion dysregulation and symptoms of depression and anxiety were also assessed. Structural equation modeling was used to create a latent construct of emotion dysregulation from measures of discrete emotion processes and of peer victimization and internalizing symptoms. Peer victimization was associated with increased emotion dysregulation over a 4-month period. Increases in emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between relational and reputational, but not overt, victimization and changes in internalizing symptoms over a 7-month period. Evidence for a reciprocal relationship between internalizing symptoms and relational victimization was found, but emotion dysregulation did not mediate this relationship. The implications for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB This study examines how attachment to mother and father predicts worries about academic demands and relationships with teachers generated by the transition from elementary to middle school through its contribution to adolescents' emotional problems (depression and anxiety). The study sample includes 626 young adolescents (289 boys and 337 girls) in sixth grade who completed the Security Scale to assess security of attachment to their mothers and fathers. The results of analyses based on structural equation modeling showed that attachment to mother predicts adolescents' teacher-academic worries about the middle school transition through anxiety symptoms. These results are discussed in light of the literature on attachment theory, emotional problems during adolescence, and the context of the middle school transition.

AB This study used hierarchical linear modeling to compare longitudinal patterns of adolescent religious service attendance and club attendance, and to contrast the longitudinal relations between adolescent adjustment and religious service versus club attendance. Participants included 1050 students (47% girls) encompassing a school district in Canada, who completed the survey first in grade nine and again in grades 11 and 12. Results demonstrated that patterns of religious service attendance over time were quite different from other clubs. Religious attendance was uniquely associated with several indicators of positive as well as negative adjustment. Club involvement, conversely, was only associated with positive adjustment--particularly for individuals who reported sustained involvement over time. Findings suggest that religious services may provide some unique experiences--both positive and negative--over and above what may be provided in other clubs, and that sustained, rather than sporadic participation in clubs, may be especially important for adolescent adjustment.

AB Objective:
   To determine continuities of mental health problems of children across a 24-year follow-up period.
   Method:
   In 1983, parent ratings of emotional and behavioral problems were collected with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in a general population sample of 2076 children. Twenty-four years later, 1365 participants completed Adult Self-Reports (ASR) to assess emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results:
   Of the participants who were classified as deviant in childhood, 22.2% were also classified as deviant in adulthood. Both homotypic and heterotypic continuity was found. Childhood aggressive, delinquent, and anxious/depressed problems were associated with most adult psychopathology. Attention problems did not predict later problems independently.
   Conclusion:
   Even though assessed with parent-reports in childhood and analogous self-reports in adulthood, and over a large period of 24 years, continuity of psychopathology was found from childhood into adulthood. Anxious/depressed problems, delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior in childhood are core predictors for adult psychopathology.

ID EMOTION REGULATION; DEPRESSION; SUPPORT
AB Early parenting experiences and child outcomes of adolescent, mothers depend greatly on the mother's intellect, personal adaptability, and cognitive readiness. A plethora of research indicates that parenting adolescent females experience higher rates of depression and stress, attain fewer years of formal education, lack employment skills, live in higher rates of poverty, and tend to their children's needs inconsistently and less effectively compared to older mothers; these issues are indicative of poor child outcomes. A high percentage of adolescent girls engage in disorganized attachment relationships with their children. This paper focuses on disorganized attachment in infants of adolescent mothers, and includes factors that may assist adolescents and their infants to achieve more positive outcomes.

AB This 15-year longitudinal study examined the stability of attachment representations from infancy to adolescence and investigated the emergence of unresolved representations during adolescence in a sample of 47 16-year-olds. Attachment was assessed at 12 months using the Strange Situation Procedure, at 4 years using the modified Strange Situation Procedure, and again at 16 years with the Adult Attachment Projective (AAP). The emergence of unresolved classifications in adolescence (AAP) was associated with higher rates of negative fife events, low levels of early mother-child relationship security (an aggregate measure of the 12-month and 4-year measures), negative teacher-child relationship experiences in middle childhood, and low early adolescent friendship quality. The results support the growing body of evidence suggesting that changes in attachment are lawful, while adding to the growing understanding of the emergence of unresolved attachment representations.

AB Background: The paediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) hypothesis arose in the USA and proposes childhood onset and high rates of prevalence. Method: Child and adolescent psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand were surveyed about the PBD hypothesis. Results: Sixty percent responded (N = 199) and most (53%) reported never having diagnosed pre-pubertal PBD and a further 29% estimated seeing '1 or 2' cases. Most (83%) rated pre-pubertal PBD as 'very rare', 'rare' or 'not diagnosable'. Opinion varied as to whether PBD was over-diagnosed (25%), appropriately diagnosed (42%), or under-diagnosed (28%) in Australia and New Zealand, 5% were unsure. In contrast there was a consensus of views that PBD was over-diagnosed in the USA (90%), whilst less felt it appropriately diagnosed (3%), or under-diagnosed (1%) and 6% were unsure. Conclusions: The majority view was consistent with classical descriptions of bipolar disorder.
   Key Practitioner Message:
   Paediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) as defined by USA researchers, applies to a range of child behavioural patterns that differ in varying degrees from traditional descriptions of bipolar disorder
   PBD has become a common diagnosis in the USA
   There is some evidence to suggest that adoption of the PBD diagnosis in the UK and Europe has been limited
   This paper reports on a survey of Australian and New Zealand child and adolescent psychiatrists and finds a solid majority retain a traditional view of bipolar disorder and are sceptical of the new PBD phenotypes
   The PBD phenotypes remain hypothetical and the alternative hypothesis is that responses to trauma and other more recognised emotional and behavioural disorders of childhood remain sufficient diagnostic explanations

   INTERPRETATION
AB Given the relationship between internalizing disorders and deficits in emotion regulation in youth, the emotion science literature has suggested several avenues for increasing the efficacy of interventions for youth presenting with anxiety and depression. These possibilities include the identification and addition of emotion-regulation skills to existing treatment packages and broadening the scope of those emotions addressed in cognitive-behavioral treatments. Current emotion-focused interventions designed to meet one or both of these goals are discussed, and the developmental influences relevant to the selection of emotion-focused treatment goals are explored using the framework of a modal model of emotion regulation. These various lines of evidence are woven together to support the utility of a novel emotion-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Youth, a transdiagnostic treatment protocol that aims to treat the range of emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety and depression) simultaneously. Avenues for future directions in treatment outcome and assessment of emotion regulation are also discussed.

AB The experience of child maltreatment is a known risk factor for the development of psychopathology. Structural and functional modifications of neural systems implicated in stress and emotion regulation may provide one mechanism linking early adversity with later outcome. The authors examined two well-documented biological markers of stress vulnerability, [resting frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry and cardiac vagal tone] in a group of adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment (n = 38; M age = 14.47) and their age-matched non-maltreated (n = 25; M age = 14.00) peers. Maltreated females exhibited greater relative right frontal EEG activity and lower cardiac vagal tone than controls over a 6-month period. In addition, frontal EEG asymmetry and cardiac vagal tone remained stable in the maltreated group across the 6 months, suggesting that the neurobiological correlates of maltreatment may not simply reflect dynamic, short-term changes but more long lasting alterations. The present findings appear to be the first to demonstrate stability of two biologically, based stress-vulnerability measures in a maltreated population. Findings are discussed in terms of plasticity within the neural circuits of emotion regulation during the early childhood period and alternative causal models of developmental psychopathology.

AB The authors employed a daily diary method to assess daily frequencies of interparental and parent-adolescent conflict over a 2-week period and their implications for emotional distress across the high school years in a longitudinal sample of 415 adolescents from Latin American, Asian, and European backgrounds. Although family conflict remained fairly infrequent among all ethnic backgrounds across the high school years, its impact on emotional distress was significant across ethnicity and gender. In addition, parent-adolescent conflict significantly mediated the association between interparental conflict and emotional distress. These associations were observed at both the individual and the daily levels, providing evidence for both the chronic and episodic implications of family conflict for adolescents' emotional adjustment.

AB The hippocampus governs memory formation and emotional regulation, and there is widespread evidence of hippocampal dysfunction in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. There is abundant evidence that prenatal viral infection may play a role in the development of these two disorders. In the current study, we have examined gene expression and structural changes of the hippocampi of exposed neonates following maternal infection at embryonic day (E) 16 (middle second trimester). We observed significant changes in gene expression in the offspring at postnatal day (P) 0 (birth), P14 (childhood), and P56 (adulthood), including a number of candidate genes for autism and schizophrenia. qRT-PCR verified the direction and magnitude of change for 5 of the genes from the microarray data set and revealed mRNA changes for additional genes associated with schizophrenia and autism. MRI revealed a decrease in hippocampal volume at P35 (adolescence). Our results demonstrate altered gene expression and reduced hippocampal. volume in the offspring following prenatal viral infection at E16. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. and ECNR All rights reserved.

AB Objective.-
   To investigate both concurrent and prospective relationships between daily frustration, cognitive coping and coping efficacy on the one hand and daily headache occurrence on the other.
   Methods.-
   Eighty-nine adolescents aged 13-21 completed an online daily diary for 3 weeks. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling.
   Results.-
   Daily frustration of goal pursuits was significantly related to both same day and next day headache occurrence. Coping efficacy beliefs were significantly related to lower next day headache occurrence (no same day relationship was found). None of the cognitive coping strategies used in response to daily frustration were related to headache occurrence on the same or next day.
   Conclusions.-
   Daily frustration to goal pursuit is suggested to be an important stressor contributing to concurrent and prospective headache occurrence. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents believe in their ability to cope also appears to influence experience of subsequent headache. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to further unravel the possibly reciprocal relations between these factors. These findings offer useful insights into the dynamic interplay between daily stressful experiences and headache in youths.

AB This study extends understanding of romantic development in the emerging adult years by using an 8-year longitudinal design in Italy. Peer groups at age 13, interpersonal functioning and emotion regulation at age 17, and romantic styles at age 21 were measured in 388 youth. Early peer groups were shown to be indirectly associated with two romantic outcomes: a consolidated style and an exploratory style. As mediators, interpersonal functioning was integral to both longitudinal trajectories, while emotion regulation was unique to the exploratory one. Results provide empirical support for the heterogeneous nature and paths of developing romantic relationships in emerging adulthood and the lasting effects of early peer groups on romantic development beyond adolescence. Results are discussed in consideration of Italian culture.

AB Although progress has been made in the treatment of childhood brain tumors,work remains to understand the complexities of disease, treatment, and contextual factors that underlie individual differences in outcome. A combination of both an idiographic approach (incorporating observations made by adult survivors of childhood brain tumors) and a nomothetic approach (reviewing the literature for brain tumor survivors as well as childhood cancer survivors) is presented. Six areas of concern are reviewed from both an idiographic and nomothetic perspective, including social/emotional adjustment, insurance, neurocognitive late effects, sexuality and relationships, employment, and where survivors accessed information about their disease and treatment and possible late effects. Guidelines to assist health care professionals working with childhood brain tumor survivors are offered with the goal of improving psychosocial and neurocognitive outcomes in this population.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL/6-18) possesses newly developed DSM-Oriented Scales, constructed through expert clinical judgment to match selected categories for behavioral/emotional problems as described in the DSM-IV. The present investigation examined the basic psychometric properties for all six DSM-Oriented Scales (i.e., Affective, Anxiety, Somatic, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity, Oppositional, and Conduct Scales) in a large clinical sample of children and adolescents (N = 673). Findings from the present study provide strong evidence for the reliability, as well as convergent and discriminative validity, of these scales. It appears that the DSM-Oriented Scales may provide accurate supplementary information that may be considered when formulating clinical diagnoses.

AB Little research has examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with learning disabilities in post-secondary settings and the potential relationship between a learning disability and anxiety or sadness. This study examined HRQoL in 68 undergraduate students: 34 students who reported having been diagnosed with a "learning disability" were compared to 34 students who indicated they had not been diagnosed with a learning disability. Participants completed an online survey of anxiety, sadness, and HRQoL, including the SF-36. ANCOVAs on the Emotional Well-Being and Role Limitations Due to Emotional Problems scales from the SF-36 revealed that students reporting a diagnosis of a learning disability were significantly more impaired in Emotional Well-Being. Regression analyses suggested that impairment in Emotional Well-Being was mediated by separate ratings of both anxiety and sadness. Results indicated that those undergraduates reporting learning disabilities suffered from an impaired sense of well-being associated with anxious and sad feelings.

AB Objective: Few studies have applied the "life course perspective" to the study of drug use, a noticeable omission in the field. The current study addresses this gap by examining patterns of interpersonal crime, substance use, and emotional problems over 7 years for a sample of 196 high-risk males as they transition from adolescence to young adulthood, with a specific focus on the role of transitions (living alone, employment, marrying or cohabiting with a romantic partner, graduating from high school or acquiring a General Equivalency Diploma, and becoming a parent) on these patterns. Method: We surveyed youth who were adjudicated as delinquent in Los Angeles between February 1999 and May 2000 and referred by probation officials to Phoenix Academy, a long-term residential substance-treatment provider for adolescent probationers, Males ages 13-17 (N = 196) were given face-to-face interviews at study entry and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 72, and 87 months. Results: Living independently and cohabiting were associated with decreased substance problems. Living with children was associated with increased interpersonal crime. Living away from parents was associated with an increase in substance problems following the transition and then a subsequent decrease in problems over time. No effects were found for receiving a diploma or having employment. Conclusions: It is crucial to begin to understand how developmental transitions may affect high-risk adolescents' involvement in criminal behavior, substance use, and emotional problems. The current study suggests that several transitions were associated with a reduction in problems as these youth transitioned into young adulthood. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 641-651, 2009)

AB Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) may be associated with alterations in children's developing emotional arousal and regulation systems.
   Objective: We examined emotional responses to a frustrating task and subsequent behavior problems in 225 2 1/2 year olds (129 Prenatally Cocaine and Other Drug Exposed [PCE], 30 Non Cocaine but other drug Exposed [NCE], 66 Non Drug Exposed [NDE]).
   Method: Children's behaviors in a frustrating toy wait task at age 2 1/2 were coded for emotional arousal and regulation behaviors.
   Results: Findings indicated a trend for PCE toddlers to show greater agitated emotional arousal than NCE and NDE toddlers. Further, PCE boys made more references to their caregivers in the task than NDE boys. Higher agitated arousal at age 2 1/2 years was related to greater decreases in externalizing behaviors through age 5 1/2 years.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest a link between cocaine exposure and emotional arousal and regulation and highlight the need to understand complex relations between emotion and risk for later psychopathology in exposed youth. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective Adolescence is a period of developing emotional regulation. However, alexithymia has rarely been examined during this period. The objective of this study is to examine the factor structure and internal consistency of the Korean version of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20K) in normal adolescents in South Korea.
   Methods The TAS-20K was administered to a sample of 290 adolescents aged from 12 to 16 years old. Internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and factorial validity were evaluated.
   Results The three factors of the TAS-20K were confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency, measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient was acceptable for difficulty in identifying feelings, good for difficulty in describing feelings, and acceptable for externally oriented thinking.
   Conclusion Our study indicates that the TAS-20K is an appropriate instrument to assess alexithymia in Korean adolescents.

AB Sexual minorities are at increased risk for multiple mental health burdens compared with heterosexuals. The field has identified 2 distinct determinants of this risk, including group-specific minority stressors and general psychological processes that are common across sexual orientations. The goal of the present article is to develop a theoretical framework that integrates the important insights from these literatures. The framework postulates that (a) sexual minorities confront increased stress exposure resulting from stigma; (b) this stigma-related stress creates elevations in general emotion dysregulation, social/interpersonal problems, and cognitive processes conferring risk for psychopathology; and (c) these processes in turn mediate the relationship between stigma-related stress and psychopathology. It is argued that this framework can, theoretically, illuminate how stigma adversely affects mental health and, practically, inform clinical interventions. Evidence for the predictive validity of this framework is reviewed, with particular attention paid to illustrative examples from research on depression, anxiety, and alcohol-use disorders.

AB There is increased awareness that exposure to violence in the community can influence students' aggressive behavior at school; however, less is known about the mechanisms that mediate this process. Having an enhanced understanding of how community violence exposure relates to students' aggressive behavior at school may inform the use of preventive interventions aimed at reducing school violence. Consistent with social-cognitive theory, the current study tested whether the association between exposure to community violence and teacher-reported aggressive behavior was mediated by biased social information processing. Data on 184 suburban adolescents and their teachers were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Community violence exposure and aggressive behavior in the classroom were significantly related and mediated by negatively biased social-cognitive factors. Results suggest that even relatively low levels of community violence exposure may increase the risk of students displaying aggressive behavior at school. Although gender differences were explored, social information processing appeared to be an important mediator for both boys and girls.

AB Aim:
   To investigate the associations of some family characteristics with adolescents' self-reported emotional/behavioural problems.
   Methods:
   Questionnaires were administered to a Greek nation-wide random sample of adolescents (N = 1194) aged 11-18 years and their parents (N = 973) in 2003. The present analysis included the questionnaires completed by mothers and their offspring (639 families). Adolescents' emotional/behavioural problems, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, were assessed in relation to family socioeconomic status and residence type, parental marital status, educational attainment and subjective mental health, family cohesion and parent-child relations.
   Results:
   The analysis showed that parental marital status other than being married, poor parent-child relations and low levels of maternal subjective mental health were independently correlated with significantly more adolescents' emotional/behavioural problems.
   Conclusion:
   Family factors are potential determinants of adolescent emotional/behavioural problems and therefore are potential targets for prevention and/or intervention.

AB Methods A sample of 1029 children was drawn from Birth to Twenty, a longitudinal cohort followed from pregnancy to young adulthood. This sample completed the Youth Self Report at age 12 years, a validated psychological measure of behavioural and emotional adjustment. Scores were compared between LBW (< 2500 g) and normal birthweight children using multivariate analysis with adjustment for potential birth and life events confounding factors.
   Results No associations were found between LBW and total [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.74], internalizing (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52-1.28) or externalizing profiles (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49-1.36). The only difference detected was for the internalizing sub-profile of Somatic Complaints (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.38), which on subgroup analysis was greatest among females.
   Conclusions We found no convincing evidence of an association between LBW and emotional and behavioural outcomes in 12-year olds in this sample in urban South Africa. To our knowledge, this is the first published assessment of this association in a developing world context.

AB Two focal social cognitive processes were evaluated in a structural model for their direct and indirect roles in early adolescents' jealousy surrounding their closest friend in a sample of 325 early adolescents (169 girls and 156 boys) ages 11-14 years. Individuals who are rigid and unrealistic about meeting their friendship needs were more vulnerable to feelings of jealousy than individuals who think more flexibly. Inflexible individuals also engage in more jealousy-driven surveillance and other problem behavior towards their friends. Stronger jealous feelings and behavior were related, in turn, to greater conflict with friends and to a vulnerability to emotional maladjustment. In addition, young adolescents who tended to ruminate over friendship problems were also more vulnerable to jealousy. Inflexible attitudes and friendship rumination were positively associated. Results extend recent models of friendship jealousy that focus only on early adolescents' self-worth.

AB This study analyzed routine locations (activity spaces) of urban adolescents enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program to understand the relationship between their spatial lives and health outcomes such as substance use and mental health. Sixty-eight adolescents were interviewed and produced a list of 199 locations identified as most important, safe, and risky. A TwoStep Cluster analysis resulted in two mutually exclusive groups of adolescents (n = 58). Clusterwise importance analyses showed that sex, distress, anxiety, emotional problems, and drug use significantly distinguish clusters from each other. An important finding was that activity spaces vary according to the frequency of substance use and the amount of emotional problems. School was frequently perceived as a risky place - followed by friend's house and nature - for those who used alcohol and marijuana more frequently and had more emotional distress. The intersection between environment, emotion regulation, and health outcomes is discussed. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Low perceived social acceptance is a significant risk factor for emotional difficulties in children. No studies, however, have examined genetic factors that may underlie individual differences in perceived social acceptance. In the present study we examined the relation between polymorphisms on the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met and serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) genes and perceived social acceptance in 103 adolescent girls. Only the COMT polymorphism was related to perceived social acceptance: Val-allele carriers reported greater perceived social acceptance than did homozygous Met-allele carriers. In a subsample of these participants, homozygous Val-allele carriers reported greater maintenance of positive emotions during stress. This, in turn, predicted social acceptance, suggesting that COMT exerts its effects on social functioning through emotion regulation. These data are the first to show an association between COMT and social functioning in children. Future research might profitably examine emotion regulation as a mediator between COMT and social acceptance.

AB ObjectivesTo analyze the relation between the symptoms reported by adolescents with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and their perception of their emotional and behavioral functioning.MethodsTwo groups of adolescents (clinical group, n 48; control group, n 135) and their parents (clinical group, n 42; control group, n 128) were studied, respectively, with the Youth Self-Report Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist. Moreover, a secondary analysis was performed, identifying another subgroup of adolescents who reported having headaches.ResultsThe clinical group of adolescents obtained higher scores than the control group in Internalizing Syndrome; Aggressive Behavior for Externalizing Syndrome; Social, Thought, and Attention Problems; and in all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)-oriented scales (except conduct problems). Differences between the two groups of parents were found in all the scales. The controls reporting headaches obtained interesting intermediate scores.ConclusionsAdolescents with CTTH show greater emotional and behavioral problems than their healthy peers. Consequently, clinical approaches for proper diagnosis and treatment need to adopt a multidisciplinary prospective.

AB This study examined how parent-adolescent relationship qualities and adolescents' representations of relationships with parents were related to interactions in 200 adolescent-close friend dyads. Adolescents and friends were observed discussing problems during a series of structured tasks. Negative interactions with mothers were significantly related to adolescents' greater conflict with friends, poorer focus on tasks, and poorer communication skills. Security of working models (as assessed by interview) was significantly associated with qualities of friendship interactions, whereas security of attachment styles (as assessed by questionnaire) was not. More dismissing (versus secure) working models were associated with poorer focus on problem discussions and weaker communication skills with friends, even after accounting for gender differences and current parent-adolescent relationship qualities.

AB Prevalence and characteristics of externalizing symptoms in childhood. Gender differences. This report shows the characteristics of the empirical type externalizing syndromes, and the diagnostic prevalence rates in a clinic pediatric sample. The instrument used was the Clinical Child Inventory (ICI) that is based on the second part of the Child Behavior Checklist, to assess behavior and emotions. It was carried out by 300 subjects (males and females, aged 6 to 12 of the Clinical Child Psychology Unit of University Hospital of Murcia. from the Consultation pediatric hospital. By conducing factor analysis, three externalizing syndromes that are equal to three disruptive behavior disorders were found: dissocial, oppositional defiant and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity. It has been obtained different prevalences estimated from Punctuation obtained from our sample (18.1:18.5 and 14.5 respectively): and the score equal to 98 percentile of CBCL (44%; 28,3% y 40,6%). The results indicate that there are not differences between boys and girls in dissocial disorders while the oppositional defiant disorder is more Prevalent in boys than in girls. About Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. it was found that is more prevalent in boys than ill girls Using CBCL (49,3% and 34,3%), and more prevalent ill girls than in boys using empirical syndrome obtained ill this clinic sample (19,8% girls, 12,2% boys).

AB Background. Mood lability is a concept widely used. However, data on its prevalence and morbid associations are scarce. We sought to establish the occurrence and importance of mood lability in a large community sample of cildren and adolescents by testing a priori hypotheses.
   Method. Cross-sectional data were taken from a national mental health survey including 5326 subjects aged 8-79 years in the UK. The outcomes were prevalence and characteristics of mood lability and its associations with psychopathology and overall impairment.
   Results. Mood lability occurred in more than 5% of the population of children and adolescents, both by parent and self-report. Mood lability was strongly associated with a wide range of psychopathology and was linked to significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric disorders. Mood lability was particularly strongly associated with co-morbidity between internalizing and externalizing disorders, even when adjusting for the association with individual disorders. The pattern of results did not change after excluding youth with bipolar disorder or with episodes of elated mood.
   Conclusions. Clinically significant mood lability is relatively common in the community. Our findings indicate that mood lability is not a mere consequence of other psychopathology in that it is associated with significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, the pattern of association of mood lability with co-morbidity suggests that it could be a risk factor shared by both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Our data point to the need for greater awareness of mood lability and its implications for treatment.

AB The styles of attachment in two groups of adolescents with different characteristics and life experiences are examined. Participants were 81 adolescents residing inside residential treatment centers (M age = 15.5 yr., SD = 1.1; 48% boys, 52% girls) and 81 adolescents living with their own families (M age=15.6 yr., SD = 1.3; 49% boys, 51% girls). The Italian adaptation of the Separation Anxiety Test was used to measure attachment style. Only the data obtained from the "Self" perspective indicated a significant difference between the two groups, showing higher percentages of Secure attachment among adolescents living with their families. When replies were referred to the "Self," the risk of assessing Insecure attachment in the Residential group was about 2 times higher than in the Family group (OR = 2.28).

AB This paper presents an approach for evaluating the reliability and validity of mental health measures in non-Western field settings. We describe this approach using the example of our development of the Acholi psychosocial assessment instrument (APAI), which is designed to assess depression-like (two tam, par and kumu), anxiety-like (ma lwor) and conduct problems (kwo maraco) among war-affected adolescents in northern Uganda. To examine the criterion validity of this measure in the absence of a traditional gold standard, we derived local syndrome terms from qualitative data and used self reports of these syndromes by indigenous people as a reference point for determining caseness. Reliability was examined using standard test-retest and inter-rater methods. Each of the subscale scores for the depression-like syndromes exhibited strong internal reliability ranging from alpha = 0.84-0.87. Internal reliability was good for anxiety (0.70), conduct problems (0.83), and the pro-social attitudes and behaviors (0.70) subscales. Combined inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability were good for most subscales except for the conduct problem scale and prosocial scales. The pattern of significant mean differences in the corresponding APAI problem scale score between self-reported cases vs. noncases on local syndrome terms was confirmed in the data for all of the three depression-like syndromes, but not for the anxiety-like syndrome ma lwor or the conduct problem kwo maraco.

AB Counselling children often requires the use of supplementary strategies in order to interest and engage the child in the therapeutic process. One such strategy is the Metaphorical Fruit Tree (MFT); an art metaphor suited to exploring and developing self-concept. Quantitative and qualitative data was used to explore the relationships between children's ability to use metaphor, age, gender, and level of emotional Competence (N = 58). Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed a significant negative relationship between self-reported emotional competence and ability to use the MFT. It is proposed that children rely on different processes to understand self and as children's ability to cognitively report on their emotional capabilities via the Emotional Competence Questionnaire (ECQ) increases, their ability to report creatively on those capabilities via the MFT is undermined. It is suggested that the MFT may be used, via creative processes and as an alternative to cognitive processes, to increase understanding and awareness of intrapersonal and inter-personal concepts of self in the child during counselling.

AB Children with chronic illness are known to have an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems. In the present population-based study children with asthma, neurological disorders and other chronic illnesses were compared with children without chronic illnesses to assess differences in psychological presentation across illness groups.
   A total of 537 children with parent-reported chronic illness in the Bergen Child Study were categorized into three groups: asthma, neurological disorders and other chronic illnesses. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   All three illness groups had an increased rate of emotional and behavioural problems, as well as increased probability of a psychiatric disorder compared with children without a chronic illness. Most children with asthma and other chronic illnesses did not have emotional and behavioural problems, and effect sizes were small in both groups. In children with neurological disorders the effect sizes ranged from moderate to large, with emotional problems, inattention hyperactivity and peer problems being the most frequent problems.
   The increased rate of emotional and behavioural problems in children with chronic illness, especially neurological disorders, emphasizes the importance of early detection of mental health problems in these children.

AB The authors conducted 2 studies of 9th-grade Israeli adolescents (169 in Study 1, 156 in Study 2) to compare the parenting practices of conditional positive regard, conditional negative regard, and autonomy support using data from multiple reporters. Two socialization domains were studied: emotion control and academics. Results were consistent with the self-determination theory model of internalization, which posits that (a) conditional negative regard predicts feelings of resentment toward parents, which then predict dysregulation of negative emotions and academic disengagement; (b) conditional positive regard predicts feelings of internal compulsion, which then predict suppressive regulation of negative emotions and grade-focused academic engagement; and (c) autonomy support predicts sense of choice, which then predicts integrated regulation of negative emotions and interest-focused academic engagement. These findings suggest that even parents' use of conditional positive regard as a socialization practice has adverse emotional and academic consequences, relative to autonomy support.

AB An important issue in the field of clinical and developmental psychopathology is whether cognitive control processes, such as response inhibition, can be specifically enhanced by motivation. To determine whether non-social (i.e. monetary) and social (i.e. positive facial expressions) rewards are able to differentially improve response inhibition accuracy in typically developing children and adolescents, an 'incentive' go/no-go task was applied with reward contingencies for successful inhibition. In addition, the impact of children's personality traits (such as reward seeking and empathy) on monetary and social reward responsiveness was assessed in 65 boys, ages 8 to 12 years. All subjects were tested twice: At baseline, inhibitory control was assessed without reward, and then subjects were pseudorandomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions, including (1) social reward only, (2) monetary reward only, (3) mixed social and monetary reward, or (4) a retest condition without reward. Both social and non-social reward significantly improved task performance, although larger effects were observed for monetary reward. The higher the children scored on reward seeking scales, the larger was their improvement in response inhibition, but only if monetary reward was used. In addition, there was a tendency for an association between empathic skills and benefits from social reward. These data suggest that social incentives do not have an equally strong reinforcing value as compared to financial incentives. However, different personality traits seem to determine to what extent a child profits from different types of reward. Clinical implications regarding probable hyposensitivity to social reward in subjects with autism and dysregulated reward-seeking behaviour in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are discussed.

AB Emotion dysregulation is often invoked as an important construct for understanding risk for psychopathology, but specificity of domains of emotion regulation in clinically relevant research is often lacking. In the present study Gross' (2001) model of emotion regulation is used to generate hypotheses regarding the relative contribution of two specific types of deficits in emotion regulation, inhibited and disinhibited expression of negative emotion, to individual differences in depressive symptoms in preadolescent girls. A sample of 232 9-year-old girls was recruited from a community based study. Depression symptoms were assessed via diagnostic interview. The mother and interviewer rated the girl's level of impairment. Questionnaires and observations were used to assess inhibited and disinhibited expression of negative emotion. Differences in inhibited expression of negative emotion typically explained more variance in depressive symptoms and impairment across informants than did disinhibited expression of negative emotion. Although disinhibited expression of negative emotion is associated with depression and impairment, inhibited expression appeared to be a necessary ingredient, suggesting that inhibited expression may be a particularly relevant deficit in emotion regulation in the development of depression in females.

AB Past research has documented a link between negative problem orientation (NPO) and poor emotional well-being, but little of this research has focused on adolescence or has collected multiple waves of data. The authors conducted a 3-wave longitudinal survey of 841 adolescents in Grades 8, 9, and 10 (428 boys, 411 girls, 2 unidentified). The survey included measures of NPO, sadness, fear, hostility, and joviality. Structural equation modeling (AMOS 7.0; J. L. Arbuckle, 2006) revealed that adolescents high in NPO experienced increases in fear, sadness, and hostility, and decreases in joviality compared with adolescents low in NPO with the same baseline levels of affect. The evidence that affect predicted future levels of problem orientation was less consistent. We discuss the implications of these findings for problem-solving interventions and for the early identification of at-risk adolescents.

AB This study investigates the impact of several types of exposure to terror attacks on adolescents' psychological outcomes in the context of ongoing terror. A total of 913 adolescents (51% girls) aged 12 to 18 years (12-13.6 = 33%; 13.7-15.6 = 38%; 15.7-18 = 28%) took part in the study. Detailed data were collected concerning objective, subjective and "mixed" types of exposure to terror, as well as demographics, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), emotional and behavioral problems and overall psychological and psychiatric difficulties. Subjective exposure was found to be the most important contributor to adolescents' post-traumatic stress and other mental health problems in this context. Gender also had important effects. The effects of objective and mixed types of exposure, as well as age, were less prominent. We did find, however, that the more adolescents consulted media, the less they experienced behavioral and emotional problems. Given that subjective experiences appear to be the best factor in explaining mental health outcomes when adolescents are confronted with persistent terror, the cognitive and emotional dynamics along with the coping behavior linked to such experiences merit further investigation.

AB Primary palmar hyperhidrosis in children and adolescents may be severe enough to affect school and physical activities, causing emotional problems, stress in the patient's life, and a compromised quality of life. Nine patients with palmar hyperhidrosis underwent treatment with botulinum A. Before the session, and in the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month post-session follow-ups, the patients were administered the Minor test, gravimetry, the Scales of Frequency and Severity, and the Questionnaire of Quality of Life. The mean age was 11 years, with seven girls and two boys. Each patient was administered at least one treatment of botulinum toxin in the palm of the hands (75-150 U for palm), with the mean number of sessions 2.2 (range: 1-4). All sessions in the patients resulted in drying of the hands, with a mean duration of effect of 7 months. Botulinum toxin A controls excessive sweat in the palms of children and adolescents who have primary palmar hyperhidrosis, with an improvement in the quality of life. The therapy is safe and effective in this pediatric group and can be considered before surgical interventions.

   SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENTS; DEFICIT
AB Persistent neuropsychological deficits have been reported in adult bipolar affective disorder, and impairments in executive functions, attention, verbal learning and memory, are postulated as neurocognitive endophenotypes.
   However, there is a lack of information about the neuropsychological functioning in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD). Hence, it is important to study this pediatric disorder because it could help, in first place, to clarify if children and adolescents with this disorder have neurocognitive impairments and secondly to analyze if the neuropsychological impairments in PBD are alike to those reported in aduits.
   Neuropsychological characterization of PBD has been complicated because it has a 60%-90% comorbidity with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Several studies have reported ADHD neuropsychological impairment in executive functions, sustained attention and working memory. Meanwhile, few studies in PBD have reported impairments in vigilance, working memory, interference control, speed processing, abstract problem solving and verbal learning. Yet, it is unknown if these deficiencies are distinct to the ones reported in ADHD or if they are a more severe manifestation of the some deficits.
   The objective of the present study was to assess the neuropsychological functioning of PBD by means of a battery of tests to analyze the caoacities of complex problem solving, abstract reasoning and planning. We seeked if PBD presents other neuropsychological impairments beyond executive functions, verbal learning and memory, and attention that have been reported in adults with this disorder.
   Two groups were assessed, the first one included fourteen adolescent patients with PBD in euthimic phase, the other group consisted of eleven asyntomatic adolescents selected by means of absence of bipolar, affective, psychotic or neurodevelopmental disorders. Each participant was evaluated by certified neuropsychologists during three sessions of one hour each.
   As study variables we considered the general capacity for complex problem solving measured by subtest of the Intelligence Scales of Wechsler (WAIS or WISC-R) that were administered and qualified according to Lezak's proposals. We also assessed abstract reasoning, cognitive flexibility and planning measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Tower of London Drexel University (TOL(DX)).
   Results were analized with SPSS 11 program using U Monn-Whitney test with statistic significance at p <0.05 and <0.01.
   The results obtained, showed that adolescents with PBD had impairments in neuropsychological functioning. Some of the deficits are alike the impairments reported in adults with bipolar disorder, specially in tasks that involve executive funcioning like working memory and planning. Besides, we detected impairments in other neuropsychological measures that are associated with complex problem solving capacities that no other studies have reported, suggesting that PBD show neuropsychological impairments that go beyond those reported in adult patients.
   Capacities for complex problem solving were related to diminished scores for Wechsler's subtests of information, vocabulary, similarities, comprehension, picture completion, block designs and digit symbol. These subtests are associated with language abilities, concept formation, verbal reasoning, visual reasoning and speed of information processing.
   Although in our study adolecents with PBD scored within the normal range on Intellectual Quotient (IQ) full, verbal and executive scales, analysis showed statistical differences when compared to control group, suggesting a potentially more insidious impact of the early onset of the disorder on overall cognitive functioning. This impact con directly affect through disease evolves, or indirectly disrupting academic functioning.
   PBD group also differed from control group on variables that measured executive functions like planning and working memory as could be seen in Digit Span Wechsler's subtests and TOL 's total move, total rule violation and total execution time variables.
   Explanation of deficits could involve problems with speed processing, given the lower scores obtained on Wechsler's digit-symbol substitution subtest; or with executive deficits, such as organization and problem solving ruled out by working memory and language reasoning. Whatever the explanation could be, our data contributes to the possibility of a continuity of domains of neuropsychological impairment in people with early and later onset of bipolar disorder, although direct comparison of such groups is necessary in future studies. As such, these neuropsychological findings also could provide support for the validity of the differential diagnosis in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.
   The neuropsychological impairments found in our research are consistent with the behavioral dyscontrol, poor frustration tolerance and impulsive aggression that are characteristic of PBD. It is proposed that the ability to regulate attention has implications for emotional regulation, meanwhile verbal reasoning deficits may reflect difficulties with effortful semantic processing, and impairments in executive functions such as working memory and planning, contribute to self-control and completion of goal-directed behavior. Together, deficits in these domains may impair the ability of PBD to attend to cues in the environment that assist the regulation of emotion and arousal, and to limit the ability for identifying and implementing novel and prosocial options for behavior by processing efficiently cues that are presented and ignore emotionally salient or distracting stimuly.
   It is important to point out that not all capacities for complex problem solving were impaired in PBD. There were no differences in Wechsler's subtests of object assembly, picture arrangement or arithmetic, neither differences were observed in TOL's variables of total correct, total time violation, total problem-solving or none of WCST variables.
   These findings can be associated with preserved capacities for set shifting, abstract reasoning, interference control, arithmetic reasoning, sequencing thinking, interpretation of socio-emotional clues and visuo-spatial planning.
   However, more work is needed to elucidate the meaning of this preserved capacities and how they interact with the impairments already discussed. In this sense, it is possible to speculate that although the impairments already described can influence on academic functioning, the preserved capacities might exert an important role in the regulation of adaptive behavior.
   As a conclusion, our data indicate neuropsychological deficits in youth with PBD in domains of executive functioning and capacities for general problem solving. These findings add to a growing body of work documenting the presence of neurocognitive underpinnings of bipolar disorder in adolescents. Data suggests that measures of verbal reasoning, visual reasoning, speed processing, working memory and planning might be explored further in future functional neuroimaging studies of PBD.

AB Adolescents with mental health problems have much higher rates of smoking than those without such problems. Although a large body of evidence suggests that higher cigarette prices reduce smoking prevalence and the quantity smoked, little is known about the interaction between mental health or behavioral problems and tobacco consumption in the general population or among adolescents. Using a national representative sample of adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and employing validated psychiatric measures of emotional distress and behavioral problems, we estimate the price elasticity of cigarette demand for adolescents who have behavioral or emotional problems. The results indicate that these adolescents are at least as responsive to cigarette prices as adolescents with no emotional or behavioral problems.

AB Objectives. - The impact of the presence of a child with cystic fibrosis in the family on the siblings is rarely studied. Moreover, the available empirical data are not clear. This study aims at evaluating the siblings' quality of life according to the assessments performed by, on the one hand, the parents and, on the other hand, the brothers and/or the sisters of the sick child.
   Methods. - Thirty families took part in this study for which we used two instruments. The parents filled out the Child Behavior Checklist, which is a questionnaire intended to assess the behavioral and emotional problems of their nonsick children. The parents and their nonsick children filled out the Duke Health Profile which is a questionnaire intended to assess the quality of life in three fields: physical health, social health, and mental health.
   Results. - The parents and their nonsick children differently assess this quality of life. The parents tend to over-estimate the physical health of their nonsick children and to incorrectly evaluate the risks of suffering that are-differently-expressed by their sons and/or their daughters. In particular, while they correctly estimate the social health of their sons, they overestimate their mental health (p < 0.02). At the contrary, while their evaluations of their daughters' mental health are quite well adjusted, they overestimate their social health (p < 0.03).
   Conclusion. - As most of the parents directly provide affective support and follow-up care for their child with cystic fibrosis, it remains necessary to more precisely specify how their perceptions of the health of the different members of the family fall under the family dynamics of adjustment to the disease. This conclusion goes for the research level as well as for the services for educational and psychological aid one. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. The present study seeks to extend the understanding of the role of dispositional factors in the aetiology of self-harm among adolescents. We hypothesized that higher trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) would be associated with a lower likelihood to harm oneself, and that this relationship would be mediated by the choice of coping strategies.
   Design and Methods. Trait EI, coping styles and self-harm behaviours were assessed in 490 adolescents recruited from eight British schools.
   Results. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the relationship between trait EI and self-harm was partly mediated by the choice of coping strategies. Emotional coping was a particularly powerful mediator, suggesting that self-harm may be a way to decrease the negative emotions that are exacerbated by maladaptive emotional coping strategies, such as rumination, self-blame, and helplessness. Trait EI was correlated positively with adaptive coping styles and negatively with maladaptive coping styles, and depression.
   Conclusions. These findings emphasize the potential value of incorporating coping coaching programmes in the treatment of self-harm patients.

AB Given that depression is a debilitating disorder, it is critical that we advance our understanding about the aetiology of this disorder. This study investigated both traditional (temperament and parenting) and novel (emotion regulation strategy) risk factors associated with adolescent depression. Forty-four adolescents (12-16 years; 64% females) with high scores on a self-report depressive symptomatology questionnaire were compared to a similar group of 44 adolescents with low scores, matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Significant group differences were present on all assessed risk factors. The presence of high depressive symptomatology was found to be associated with (1) low levels of temperamentally based positive mood, flexibility, and approach behaviours, (2) a parenting style characterized by low nurturance and high overprotection, and (3) emotion regulation characterized by higher levels of expressive suppression and lower levels of cognitive reappraisal. It was concluded that, in addition to specific temperament characteristics and parenting style, use of particular emotion regulation strategies is associated with varying levels of depressive symptomatology. These findings reinforce the importance of incorporating emotion regulation into explanatory models of depression symptomatology. Further research that tests the direction of effects for these cross-sectional findings is warranted.

AB This study examined whether specific emotion-related constructs may be uniquely related to anxious or depressive symptoms in youth. Although anxiety and depression are comorbid in both youth and adult populations, delineation of these disorders is a worthwhile endeavor given that such differentiation may lead to a clearer conceptualization of the disorders that in turn may facilitate more efficient diagnosis and effective treatment. Children in the 4th and 5th grades (N = 187; M age = 10 years, 3 months) completed measures to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression and emotion-related functioning. Using structural equation modeling, emotion-related variables were identified that were common to both anxiety and depression (poor emotion awareness, emotion dysregulation, poor emotion regulation coping, high frequency of negative affect), most strongly related to depression (low frequency of positive affect), and most distinctly associated with anxiety (frequency of emotion experience, somatic response to emotion activation). The findings suggest that comprehensive theoretical formulations of anxiety and depression in youth should consider emotion-related variables. The results also suggest potential avenues that may facilitate more efficient assessment and treatment of such youth.

AB The present study investigates five types of continuity of personality and internalizing and externalizing problems (i.e., structural, differential, mean-level, individual-level and ipsative continuity) in a sample of referred children and adolescents (N = 114) with a broad variety of psychological problems. Mothers were administered a child personality and psychopathology measure, i.e., the Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children [Handleiding hiA << rarchische persoonlijkheidsvragenlijst voor kinderen (manual hierarchical personality inventory for children). Ghent University, Department of Developmental, Personality, and Social Psychology, Ghent, 2005] and the Child Behavior Checklist [Handleiding voor de cbcl/4-18: (Manual of the CBCL/4-18), Afdeling Kinder- en Jeugdpsychiatrie. Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 1996] at two measurement occasions, with a 26-months interval. Personality was substantially stable, paralleling findings for non-referred peers. Internalizing and Externalizing Problem Behavior were almost as stable as personality traits, suggesting that childhood psychopathology is more persistent than generally assumed. Strengths and limitations of the present study and implications for further research are discussed.

AB McClure-Tone (2009) focused on the role of two aspects of emotion knowledge (emotion expression recognition and labeling) and on emotion regulation in bipolar disorder (BD). We encourage further research on these and on other components of emotion knowledge that probably play equally significant roles in normal and abnormal development, and perhaps particularly in BD. Despite the author finding serious gaps in the literature, it was shown that we have learned a lot about differences in neural, cognitive, and behavioral processes in children and adolescents with BD and same-age normal individuals, and that much remains unknown. We join the author in encouraging more clinical, developmental, and longitudinal research on emotion processes in BD, particularly theoretically driven studies on some neglected emotion schemas that may prove relatively distinct to the disorder.

AB Objective. - The purpose of this study wits to investigate the degree of agreement among parents, teachers and adolescents with respect to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and the Youth Self Report (YSR). In addition we evaluated the suitability of these three forms (CBCL, TRF and YSR) in terms of their contribution to understanding internalizing and externalizing disorders in youths being referred to a child and adolescent unit of a psychiatric care facility.
   Methods. - A total of 611 patients aged 11-18 years (mean age 13.0, SD 1.6) were assessed using the CBCL, the TRF and the YSR.
   Results. - Intraclass coefficients (ICC) showed low to moderate agreement among informants. Furthermore, the level of agreement was generally less among patients suffering from internalizing disorders than for young patients who displayed externalizing disorders. Logistic regression revealed that the TRF internalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL internalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of internalizing disorders in youth. The YSR internalizing syndrome scale, on the other hand, was not a relevant factor among adolescents of a clinical target population. Likewise, only the TRF extemalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL externalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of externalizing disorders in youth.
   Conclusions. - Particularly the CBCL and TRF are useful instruments in assessing internalizing and externalizing disorders in adolescents referred to a mental health setting. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

   Study design. A cross-sectional questionnaire Study.
   Methods. A total of 487 students, aged 13-16 years in 21 junior high schools and 247 parents participated in this school based questionnaire Study conducted in 1990 in Finnmark. the County in Norway with the highest suicide rates. Sociodemographics, substance use, thriving at school, ethnocultural factors Such its ethnic context, ethnic identity, ethnic language competence and ethnic parentage, self-reported its well as parent-reported behavioural/emotional problems were assessed.
   Results. Self-mutilation and/or suicidal attempts within the last 6 months were reported by 12.5% of the adolescents and 14.8% reported having suicidal thoughts. Ill univariate analyses, significant gender differences Occurred for both ethnic groups, With more girls reporting self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour. However, in logistic regression analyses adjusting for all other significant variables, the gender difference disappeared. No significant ethnic differences occurred in prevalence. Although factors associated with self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour varied between Sami and Norwegian adolescents, self-reported anxiety/depression was it strong and significant correlate to both self-mutilation/suicide attempts and Suicidal thoughts ill both ethnic groups. Parents reported less emotional/behavioural problems associated with self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour than the adolescents did. Ethnic identification in Sami and ethnic context in Norwegian adolescents Occurred in independent analyses as significantly related to self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour, but turned insignificant when adjusting for all other significant variables. Conclusions. In contrast to several other Indigenous groups the prevalence of self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour did not differ between Sami and Norwegian gian adolescents. In both ethnic groups, the effect of ethnocultural factors disappeared when controlled for other variables such as anxiety/depression. Across both ethnic groups, anxiety and depression problems occurred as a common and significant correlate for self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):235-248)

AB Using an 'at-risk' sample of African American girls, the present study examined the link between girls' retrospective reports of pubertal timing, girls' perceived relative pubertal timing, and their behavioral and emotional problems as rated by the girls themselves (N = 102; 11 - 17 years), as well as teachers and parents. Structural equation modeling results indicated that the girls' retrospective reports of menarche were significantly related to their perceived relative menarche, whereas the girls' retrospective reports of development of their breasts were not related to their perceived relative development of breasts. Girls who perceived their breasts developing early relative to their peers were more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors according to teacher report. Significant effects of teacher reported adolescent internalizing problems also were found for girls who retrospectively reported either early or late development of breasts. The study's findings Underscore the importance of teasing apart the effects of different indicators of girls' pubertal development on psychosocial adjustment and including teachers' reports of girls' emotional and behavioral problems, particularly among girls with the additional risks associated with residing in an economically disadvantaged Urban setting.

AB The study explores adolescents' attitudes toward seeking help for emotional problems. The personal service gap is examined by asking adolescents about their willingness to refer themselves and others to formal (psychologists) and informal (friends) help sources, using a within-subjects design. The study included 662 Israeli adolescents in the 10th and 12th grades. The results indicate that adolescents refer peers more than them selves to a psychologist and to a friend. They are also more willing to refer themselves and peers to a friend rather than to a psychologist. Barriers to seeking psychological help are explored and significant correlations between perceptions of psychological benefit, problem severity and barriers to help seeking are described. Recommendations for increasing adolescents' awareness and use of help Sources are Suggested. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Interpersonal stress is a significant determinant of relapse following treatment for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs), but there remains little specific information about the mechanisms underlying the relationship between interpersonal stress and AUD relapse. Application of Social Action Theory provides one new approach to advancing knowledge about the interpersonal stress-relapse relationship. Especially relevant are the Social Action Theory construct of social-emotional competence, with its accompanying measurement procedures of the Social Competence Interview and the Anger Transcendence Challenge. This study evaluated the use of the Social Competence Interview and Anger Transcendence Challenge in a sample of 63 men and women in AUD intensive outpatient treatment. The results support the use of the Social Competence Interview and the Anger Transcendence Challenge with an adult AUD clinical sample, so that these measures may help to advance knowledge about the relationship between interpersonal stress and alcohol relapse.

AB In line with the wider trend of offering support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for children have introduced online chat, often in addition to a traditional telephone service.
   A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Children experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many of the children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems.
   Both the telephone and the web-based support improved the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer cooperation between child helplines and mental health and child welfare services.

AB This investigation examined associations between early adolescents' relationships with parents and teachers and indicators of school-adjustment. Participants were primarily students of color (91% Latino) in a low-income urban environment, and analyses were conducted to examine the relative contributions of parent-child and teacher-student relationships to school adjustment among these youth. Findings indicated that parent-child relationship quality accounted for a significant portion of the variance in student-rated school engagement, school competence, and standardized achievement in reading. Teacher-student relationship quality accounted for a significant amount of variance in student-reported engagement, grades in language arts, grades in mathematics, and mathematical achievement. Unclear expectations in relationships with parents, and closeness-trust with teachers made particularly strong contributions to school adjustment. Interaction analyses between parent and teacher relationship factors were significant for only one of the six school adjustment variables (i.e., student-rated school competence). The implications of these findings for teachers and other school personnel are discussed.

AB There have been few studies examining noise and psychological disorders in children and the results are equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine exposure-effect relationships between aircraft and road traffic noise exposure and children's mental health. We conducted a cross-national, cross-sectional study assessing 2844 pupils, aged 9-10, from 89 schools around three major airports in the Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom matched within country for socio-economic position. We selected children on the basis of exposure to external aircraft and road traffic noise exposure. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed child mental health, including emotional problems, conduct disorder, hyperactivity, peer problems and prosocial behaviour. Aircraft noise exposure was significantly associated with an increased score on the hyperactivity subscale (pooled B estimate 0.013 CI 0.007-0.019) after full adjustment. Road traffic noise was significantly associated with lower scores on the conduct problems subscale maintained after full adjustment (pooled B estimate 0.010 95%CI -0.020 to -0.001). There was no association between either aircraft or road traffic noise exposure and the SDQ total score. The hyperactivity results have been found in a previous UK study and may indicate that high aircraft noise exposure exacerbates hyperactivity symptoms in children although this finding requires further replication.

AB We examined the role of stress as a risk factor and motivation for cannabis use/misuse. A systematic review of studies gathered from PsychINFO and MEDLINE databases was conducted. Findings suggest that cannabis is commonly used as a stress-coping strategy. Negative life events, trauma, and maladaptive coping were all related to consumption. Cannabis use for stress-coping purposes was most evident when examining chronic as compared with experimental use. Although many individuals may be able to use cannabis without consequences, there appears to be a subset of individuals who experience greater life stress and who may be more likely to use for stress-coping purposes. These individuals may be at greatest risk for addiction. Chronic use may potentiate stress-related motivation to use/abuse cannabis and is associated with decision-snaking deficits and alterations in brain-stress pathways that may exacerbate compulsive drug seeking and sensitize individuals to stress-related drug use. Overall, stress-coping interventions and harm reduction focused on reducing the amount ingested may facilitate prevention and recovery efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored youth reports of traumatic events by (a) identifying the types of events that children and adolescents report as traumatic in their lives, (b) investigating the association between self-reported traumatic events and self- and parent-reported emotional problems, and (c) examining developmental differences in the type and severity of the events reported as traumatic. Findings suggest that youth reported as traumatic a wide variety of experiences that could be reliably coded and classified and that youth reporting traumatic, events and symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder evidence higher levels of emotional and behavioral problems (via parent and child report) than youth not reporting traumatic events. Youth ages 13-17 tended to report traumas. that were rated by independent coders as more severe than,did youth ages 6-12. Although-the types of events reported did not differ in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and. other. emotional. and behavioral problems, there were differences in objective ratings of physical-severity and psychological intensity. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the creation of developmentally informed classification of traumatic stressors.

AB Purpose: To assess prospectively language and speech ability in children with benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS). To evaluate academic performance and social competencies both during the active disease and after remission.
   Methods: Right-handed school children with typical BCECTS and a control group matched by age, sex, handedness and socioeconomic status were examined. The German version of WISC-R, the "Tubinger Luria Christensen Neuropsychological Test Set for children" (TUKI), the "Verbal Learning Memory Test" (VLMT), the "Heidelberger Speech Development Test-second edition" (HSET), and the "Salzburger reading and writing test" (SLRT) were applied. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a semi-structured interview were performed with the children's teachers to gain insight into school performance, behavioral and emotional problems.
   Results: During the active phase, the patient group - despite normal global intellectual abilities showed few, but significant impairments both in expressive speech and in receptive and expressive vocabulary. A significant deficit in the ability to recognize and express interpersonal relations was also found. Patients' teachers stated deficits concerning academic performance and complained about disturbing behavior. Parents reported significantly more psycho-pathological features in the subscales "Aggressive Behavior", "Attention Problems" and "Anxious/Depressed" of the CBCL. Results were independent of medication and spike localization.
   After complete recovery from BCECTS, these problems were not found any more.
   Conclusions: Both deficits of speech-related abilities (in both expressive and receptive vocabulary) and behavioral disturbances can be detected in children with typical BCECTS, but are no longer apparent after remission of the seizure disorder.

AB Developmental research has demonstrated the harmful effects of peer rejection during adolescence; however, the neural mechanisms responsible for this salience remain unexplored. In this study, 23 adolescents were excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality, participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.

AB Many youth experience impairing, unexplained somatic complaints. Psychosocial models of child somatization have primarily focused on parent somatic functioning. Although helpful in understanding child somatization, this narrow focus on parental factors leaves a large proportion of the variance unaccounted for when explaining children's general somatic functioning. The goal of this investigation is to extend current models of child somatization by collectively examining the influence of parent somatization and child emotional functioning.
   Forty-two children (50% male; M age = 9.11) reported on their somatic symptoms, emotion awareness skills, and negative affect. Parents reported on their own somatic symptoms and their child's somatic symptoms and emotion regulation skills.
   Regression analyses indicated that poor awareness of emotional experiences and frequency of negative effect predicted child-reported somatic symptoms. Parental somatic symptoms and parent reports of children's emotion regulation difficulties predicted mother-reported child somatic symptoms. Only parental somatic symptoms significantly predicted father-reported child somatic symptoms.
   These results suggest that models of child somatization should consider both family - (e.g. parent somatization) and child-level (e.g. emotional functioning) variables. The discrepancies between parent and child report of youth somatic symptoms underscore the importance of including multiple reporters on symptomatology in research and clinical settings. Suggestions for future research are provided.

AB The Latino population in the USA is growing faster than any other group. Latinas are at risk for mental health and substance-abuse problems and school dropout. Research has shown that the ability to adapt to life in the USA while retaining one's cultural heritage is essential for successful acculturation and may increase the chances for success in school. There is strong evidence that mentoring relationships can enhance teens' social and emotional competence. This paper describes Club Amigas, a mentoring project that paired Latina college students with Latina middle-school girls. Initial quantitative and qualitative evaluations of programme effectiveness found that, as predicted, mentees' self-esteem was related to a positive commitment to their Latina identity, and that self-esteem and positive commitment to Latina identity increased over the programme year.

AB ne development of language and communication may play an important role in the emergence of behavioral problems in young children, but they are rarely included in predictive models of behavioral development. In this study, cross-sectional relationships between language, attention, and behavior problems were examined using parent report, videotaped observations, and performance measures in a sample of 116 severely and profoundly deaf and 69 normally hearing children ages 1.5 to 5 years. Secondary analyses were performed on data collected as part of the Childhood Development After Cochlear Implantation Study, funded by the National Institutes of Health. Hearing-impaired children showed more language, attention, and behavioral difficulties, and spent less time communicating with their parents than normally hearing children. Structural equation modeling indicated there were significant relationships between language, attention, and child behavior problems. Language was associated with behavior problems both directly and indirectly through effects on attention. Amount of parent-child communication was not related to behavior problems.

AB Identifying childhood precursors for depression has been challenging and yet important for understanding the rapid increase in the rate of depression among adolescent girls. This study examined the prospective relations of preadolescent girls' emotion regulation and parenting style with depressive symptoms. Participants were 225 children and their biological mothers recruited from a larger longitudinal community Study. Girls' observed positive and negative emotion during a conflict resolution task with mothers, their ability to regulate sadness and anger, and their perception of parental acceptance and psychological control were assessed at age 9. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report at ages 9 and 10. The results indicated interactions between child emotion characteristics and parenting in predicting later depression. Specifically, low levels of positive emotion expression predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in the context of moderate to high parental psychological control. Low levels of sadness regulation were predictive of high levels of depressive symptoms in the context of low to moderate parental acceptance. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that the prospective association between vulnerabilities in emotion regulation and depression are moderated by the caregiving environment.

Although these perceived popular aggressive youth appear relatively well adjusted, especially in the social domain, the emotional wellbeing of these youth is understudied.

AB The objective of the study was to assess behavioural and emotional problems in children and adolescents with congenital cardiac disease.
   From the database of Paediatric Heart Section, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Norway, 430 patients and their parents were included and received questionnaires of youth self-report and child behavior checklist. The response rate was 71.4%.
   Compared to their parents children with congenital heart disease reported more behavioural and emotional problems. Boys scored significantly higher than girls in total problem score and externalising scores with more social problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. No gender difference was found regarding internalising problem score. Compared to healthy boys, no differences were found in total problem, externalising or internalising score. In girls lower values were found in patients than healthy children for total problem, externalising and internalising scores.
   In the present study boys scored themselves higher with regard to total problem score than girls. No effect was found of due to different diagnoses. The data indicate that the children experience more problems than the parents are aware of. However, the behaviour problem scores in children with cardiac disease are significantly lower than in healthy children. A close parental follow-up and an experience of being exposed to life-threatening situation may play a role for the latter results.

AB In a sample of 473 4th- and 5th-grade students, we examined the interaction between the type of clique to which a child belongs and the clique's level of perceived cohesion on a clique member's social and emotional adjustment. Perceived cohesion of a clique was operationalized as the degree to which the clique was perceived as an entity and was measured by submitting peers' similarity judgments of same-gender peers to a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. Clique types were determined based on clique members' average scores on a wide range of social behaviors. Correlation analyses indicated that the degree to which children were perceived to be similar to each other was highly related to the strength of their affiliative ties, providing support for a similarity-based assessment of the perceived cohesion of a clique. It was also found that perceived cohesion moderates the link between the type of clique to which a child belongs and self-reported social and emotional adjustment outcomes. Whether it is beneficial or not to belong to a highly cohesive clique appears to depend on the type of clique to which a child belongs.

AB Objective: To examine the ability to regulate emotions in children with binge eating.
   Method: A community sample of 60 children ages 8-13 with at least one episode of loss of control (LOC) eating during the past 3 months and a matched control group without LOC (n = 60) underwent a clinical interview (Eating Disorder Examination adapted for Children) and completed self-report questionnaires assessing emotion regulation strategies, eating pathology, and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Children with LOC eating made a significantly higher use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (p < .01), especially for the regulation of anxiety (p < .01). Maladaptive strategies were associated with greater depressiveness (p < .001). Use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies did not differ between children with and without LOC eating.
   Discussion: Results document an association between LOC eating and difficulties in regulating negative emotions in children. Interventions targeting LOC eating in children should include training for coping with negative emotions. (C) 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The current study examined the moderating influence of observed parental emotion socialization (PES) on self-medication in adolescents. Strengths of the study include the use of a newly developed observational coding system further extending the study of PES to adolescence, the use of an experience sampling method to assess the daily covariation between negative affect and substance use, and a focus on PES styles defined by the interaction of emotion-dismissing and emotion-coaching behaviors. Using multi-leveling modeling, we tested PES as a moderator of daily negative mood-substance use relation in a sample of 65 elevated-risk adolescents (48% male, 58% Caucasian, with a median age of 14). Results showed a three-way interaction between emotion-coaching PES, emotion-dismissing PES and daily negative mood in predicting daily substance use. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of PES styles and their effects on self-medication through compromised emotion regulation and interpersonal processes.

AB This investigation examined psychosocial and behavioral factors involved in the course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in youth affected by Hurricane Katrina. Participants (N = 152; 54% female; 61% Caucasian; mean age = 11.5 years) self-reported on hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, fear reactivity, regulatory abilities, social experiences, and coping 1.5 months following the storm, and on their PTSD symptoms again 8 months following the storm. Fear reactivity predicted more severe initial PTSD symptoms. Peer victimization added to the prediction of subsequent PTSD symptoms. Whereas regulatory abilities protected against PTSD symptoms both initially and across time, a negative coping style enhanced vulnerability to PTSD symptoms. Thus, mental health service providers should work to minimize peer victimization experiences, improve regulatory abilities, and promote alternatives to negative coping in youth following disasters.

AB This study examined relations among emotional self-regulation, peer rejection, and antisocial behavior in a sample of 122 boys from low-income families who participated in a summer camp and were followed longitudinally from early childhood to early adolescence. Emotional self-regulation strategies were coded in early childhood from a waiting task, measures of peer rejection were collected during middle childhood at the summer camp, and reports of antisocial behavior were obtained during early adolescence. Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine longitudinal relations among these constructs, with results supporting a negative association between use of active distraction and peer rejection and a positive association between peer rejection and antisocial behavior. Furthermore, an indirect effect of active distraction on antisocial behavior was found through peer rejection. Thus, adaptive self-regulation strategy use in early childhood demonstrated direct longitudinal relations with peer rejection and an indirect association with antisocial behavior in early adolescence. Results have implications for early prevention and intervention efforts to foster adaptive self-regulation of emotion and reduce risk for later social problems and delinquency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Assessments of child psychopathology commonly rely on multiple informants, e.g., parents, teachers and children. Informants often disagree about the presence or absence of symptoms, reflecting reporter bias, situation-specific behaviour, or random variation in measurement. However, few studies have systematically tested how far correlates of child psychopathology differ between informants.
   Parents, teachers and children in the 1999 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey (n = 4,525, ages 11-15 years) completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Multiple source regression models tested the extent to which child, family, school and neighbourhood characteristics were differentially associated with the three informants' reports. The 2004 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey (n = 3,438, ages 11-15 years) was used for replication.
   Almost all significant correlates of child mental health were differentially related to parent, teacher and child ratings of adjustment. Parental distress, parent-rated family functioning, and child physical health problems were most strongly associated with parent ratings. Child ability and attainment, socio-economic factors, and school and neighbourhood disadvantage were more strongly associated with teacher and parent rated mental health than with children's own ratings. Gender differences in externalising problems were most pronounced for teacher ratings, and least so for child ratings; the opposite held true for emotional problems. Effect sizes for combined latent scores fell near the upper end of the range of effect sizes estimated for the three individual informants. Results showed good replication across the two samples.
   The study highlights that there is substantial variation across informants in the links between associated factors and child psychopathology.

AB To longitudinally describe prosocial behaviour development from childhood to adolescence, using multiple informants within Canadian and Italian samples.
   Participants in Study 1 were 1037 boys from low socioeconomic status (SES) areas in Montreal, Canada, for whom yearly teacher and mother reports were obtained between the ages of 10 and 15. Participants in Study 2 were 472 children (209 girls) from Genzano, Italy, for whom yearly self and teacher reports were obtained between the ages of 10 and 14. Developmental trajectories were estimated from ratings by each informant to identify subgroups of children following distinct courses of prosocial development.
   In Study 1, three trajectory groups (low/declining 53%, high/declining 16%, high/steep declining 31%) were identified from teacher ratings, while five trajectories (low/stable 7%, low/declining 19%, moderate/stable 41%, high/declining 24%, high/stable 9%) were identified from mother ratings. Small but significant associations were observed between mother and teacher ratings. In Study 2, three trajectory groups (low/stable 9%, moderate/stable 50%, high/stable 42%) were identified from self-ratings, while four trajectory groups (low/stable 8%, moderate/declining 48%, high/declining 37%, increasing 7%) were identified from teacher ratings. Small but significant associations were observed between self- and teacher ratings.
   The present studies investigated levels of prosocial behaviours from childhood to adolescence, using a multi-informant, cross-cultural perspective. All but one of the developmental trajectories identified were characterised by stable or declining levels of prosocial behaviours. Further research longitudinally investigating prosociality across developmental periods is needed to clarify prosocial behaviour development over time.

AB The aim of the present 15-year follow-up was to study the association between childhood psychological symptoms and sense of coherence (SOC) in adolescence. Destructive behaviour at three years, attention problems and thought problems at 12 years, attention problems, anxiety/depression, delinquency and somatic complaints at 15 years predicted a poor SOC at 18 years. Problems reported by adolescents themselves explained a poor SOC much more often than problems reported by parents. The identification of early childhood behavioural problems helps us to identify children at risk of ill-being in adolescence since problems seem to persist unchanged until that period of life.

AB Children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity. The most common types of comorbidities include disruptive behavior, anxiety, and substance use disorders, as well as major depression. When comorbidities are present, impairments in school and family functioning tend to be more severe and persistent than in children who have ADHD alone. Comorbidities to ADHD are likely to go unrecognized in primary pediatric settings because clinicians may not routinely collect behavioral information, and parents are often reluctant to discuss their children's emotional problems with physicians. Although ADHD with a comorbid component is associated with poorer outcomes, many such patients can be treated successfully. Developing improved methods for the identification and appropriate treatment of comorbid conditions in children with ADHD must be a high clinical priority, because intervention can have a significant positive impact on patients' functioning and long-term outcomes.

AB This article reviews the literature focusing on the relationship between perceived threat to life and risk-taking behaviors. The review of empirical data, garnered from field studies and controlled experiments, suggests that personal threat to life results in elevated risk-taking behavior. To account for these findings, this review proposes a number of theoretical explanations. These frameworks are grounded in divergent conceptual models: coping with stress, emotion regulation, replenishing of lost resources through self-enhancement, modifications of key parameters of cognitive processing of risky outcomes, and neurocognitive mechanisms. The review concludes with a number of methodological considerations, as well as directions for future work in this promising area of research.

AB Over the past several decades, research has focused increasingly on developmental precursors to psychological disorders that were previously assumed to emerge only in adulthood. This change in focus follows from the recognition that complex transactions between biological vulnerabilities and psychosocial risk factors shape emotional and behavioral development beginning at conception. To date, however, empirical research on the development of borderline personality is extremely limited. Indeed, in the decade since M. M. Linehan initially proposed a biosocial model of the development of borderline personality disorder, there have been few attempts to test the model among at-risk youth. In this review, diverse literatures are reviewed that can inform understanding of the ontogenesis of borderline pathology, and testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future research with at-risk children and adolescents. One probable pathway is identified that leads to borderline personality disorder; it begins with early vulnerability, expressed initially as impulsivity and followed by heightened emotional sensitivity. These vulnerabilities are potentiated across development by environmental risk factors that give rise to more extreme emotional, behavioral, and cognitive dysregulation.

AB This study aims to examine the,characteristics and functions of the self-injurious behavior carried out by a group of "not referred" italian subjects. Method. The group consists of 211 subjects (189 females, 22 males) who have joined the research between December 2005 and August 2008, filling in the open question questionnaire, available on "SIBRIC", website built ad hoc for the Study and research about self-injurious behavior. Those who took part to this research joined in voluntarily also giving their consent to the processing of personal data. Results. A prevalence of female subjects with a mean age of 20.84 years and a high education level has been registered. Following particular stressful events, they start injuring themselves at the age of 13/16 years old. Different ways of injuring are used; the most frequent ones are cuts and burns. Often the interviewees reported being overwhelmed by "negative feelings" before injuring themselves and to seek at self-injury to manage them. It seems that many do not feel pain during the act, indeed, in some cases it appears to induce a temporary sense of relief. One might assume, therefore, that the self-injury plays a role in "emotional regulation" in these people, able to put an end to unpleasant feelings. Conclusion. A significant correlation has been found between the results obtained and literature, which confirms the profile of typical self-injurer. The complexity of a such articulated phenomenon shows how this should be investigated from a clinical and empirical point of view.

   Design: Birth cohort study of individuals 8 to 24 years old.
   Setting: Finland.
   Participants: The sample includes 5302 Finnish people born in 1981 who were examined at the age of 8 years to gather information about psychopathologic conditions, school performance, and family demographics from parents, teachers, and children.
   Main Outcome Measures: National register-based lifetime information about completed suicides and suicide attempts that prompted hospital admission.
   Results: Of all 24 deaths among males between 8 and 24 years of age, 13 were suicides, whereas of 16 deaths among females, only 2 were suicides. Fifty-four males and females (1%) had either completed suicide or made a serious suicide attempt, defined as a suicide attempt that prompted hospital admission. Of 27 males with completed or serious suicide attempts, 78% screened positive on parent or teacher Rutter scales at the age of 8 years, whereas of 27 females only 11% screened positive. Among males, completed or serious suicide attempt outcome was predicted at the age of 8 years by living in a nonintact family; psychological problems as reported by the primary teacher; or conduct, hyperkinetic, and emotional problems. However, self-reports of depressive symptoms at the age of 8 years did not predict suicide outcome. No predictive associations between the study variables measured at the age of 8 years and suicide outcome were found among females. Male suicide outcome was predicted most strongly by comorbid conduct and internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Most males who completed suicide and/or made serious suicide attempts in adolescence or early adulthood had psychiatric problems by the age of 8 years, indicating a trajectory that persists throughout their lives. However, female severe suicidality is not predicted by psychopathologic disorders at the age of 8 years. The results give additional support to the importance of early detection and treatment of psychiatric problems in males.

AB Background: Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been proposed as a physiological marker of emotion-regulation capacity, and shown to be cross-sectionally associated with depression. Little is known about the role of RSA as a predictor of (subclinical) depressive symptoms over time and as a modifier of the depressogenic effect of stressful life events (SLEs).
   Methods: In a longitudinal population-based study with data collected in 1653 adolescents twice (at age 11 and 13.5 years, respectively), RSA was assessed in supine position at the first assessment wave. Depressive symptoms were assessed at both waves and SLEs experienced between the two waves at the last wave.
   Results: Low levels of RSA were not associated with concurrent or future depressive symptoms, and did not enhance the depressogenic effects of SLEs.
   Conclusions: In a normal population of young adolescents, a low level of RSA does not identify adolescents at risk for depressive symptoms when confronted with SLEs. In post hoc analyses, among those reporting high exposure to stressful life events, higher RSA tended to predict less self-reported anxiety and more self-reported somatic symptoms as compared to those with lower RSA.

AB We investigated the temperamental traits high-intensity pleasure (temperamental activation) and shyness (temperamental inhibition) in relation to autonomic function as measured by heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in 938 10-13-year-old preadolescents from a population cohort. Temperament was evaluated by parent reports on the Revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. Autonomic measurements were obtained in supine and standing position. High-intensity pleasure was negatively associated with supine HR and positively with supine RSA and BRS in both genders. Shyness was positively related to supine BRS in girls only. Orthostatic-based autonomic reactivity (difference) scores adjusted for supine values were unrelated to temperamental measures. It appeared that higher scores on temperamental activation and inhibition are associated with higher cardiac vagal activity (RSA) and/or flexible regulation of autonomic balance (BRS), implicating healthy physiological functioning. Moreover, results suggest a physiological basis promoting the tendency towards engagement in high-intensity activities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Before the last 150 years, the use of the term mania to mean any kind of agitated state and the term childhood to include people up to their early 20s make historical identification of manic-depression in children difficult. Not long after Kraepelin's seminal work was published, similar syndromes were identified in youth, usually adolescents. Interestingly, however, the question of whether preadolescent mania should be broadly or narrowly defined-the so-called bipolar controversy-has been an issue for at least 50 years. Although the question of whether and how a disorder characterized by discrete episodes of mania and depression with periods of relative normality between episodes relates to one characterized by more fluctuating and intense mood lability/dysregulation remains unanswered, the work of researchers in the twenty-first century will be to understand not only symptoms of bipolar disorder but also how it develops and how emotion regulation relates to both the development of bipolar disorder and to other conditions that are characterized by dysregulated emotion.

AB Purpose To investigate the role of emotion regulation in the relation between fathers' parenting (specifically warmth, behavioral control and psychological control) and adolescents' emotional and eating disorder symptoms, after adjustment for controls. Methods A total of 203 11-18 year-old students from a school in a socio-economically disadvantaged area in North-East London completed questionnaires assessing emotional symptoms (measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire's (SDQ) Emotional Symptoms Scale), eating disorder symptoms (measured with the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)), difficulties in emotion regulation (measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)), and fathers' overprotection and warmth, measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), as well as behavioral and psychological control. The confounding variables considered were number of proximal (i.e., during the last year) adverse life events experienced, gender, age, and socio-economic status (eligibility for free school meals). Results Adolescents' difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the link between fathers' psychological control and adolescents' emotional symptoms, but not the link between fathers' parenting and adolescents' eating disorder symptoms, which appeared to be more directly linked to fathers' psychological control and number of proximal adverse life events experienced. Proximal adverse life events experienced were also strongly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation. Conclusions The study findings have implications for intervention programs which may prove more fruitful in addressing adolescent emotional problems by targeting underlying emotion regulation abilities, and in addressing adolescent eating disorder symptoms by protecting adolescents with a recent experience of multiple adverse life events. Parenting programs also stand to benefit from the evidence presented in this study that paternal psychological control may have uniquely harmful consequences for adolescent development through the hampering or atrophying of emotion regulation abilities and the encouragement of eating disorders.

AB A cross-sectional study is reported in which loneliness and emotional problems are explored in adolescent victims of direct or relational bullying, together with the potentially moderating influence of friendship quality. Adolescents (N=401, mean age 13.5) completed the School Relationships Questionnaire. to identify bullying and victimisation roles, the Friendship Activity Questionnaire (FAQ), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess emotional problems, and the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire (LSDQ). Relational victims, but not direct victims reported significantly elevated feelings of loneliness and emotional problems compared to non-victims. Direct victims reported a significantly higher quality of friendship, compared to non-victims. Poor quality of friendship was also associated with high levels of loneliness.. and vice versa for direct victims, but not for relational victims. This indicates that the higher quality of friendship found in direct victims is associated with the reduced levels of loneliness found in this group. Given the cross-sectional nature of this Study, it is not possible to ascertain whether this association truly reflects the role of friendship quality as a moderator, and hence protective factor against adverse influences of victimisation. The different mechanisms underlying direct and relational victimisation are important for future research and intervention programmes.

AB Objective or the study was to examine how cognitive emotion regulation strategies were related to psychological maladjustment in adolescents with a chronic disease. The sample consisted of adolescents with a diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). A self-report questionnaire was used to assess Internalizing problems and Quality of Life. The specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies that were used in response to the disease were measured by the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Correlations and Multiple regression analyses showed that Rumination and Catastrophizing were the most important 'predictors' of psychological maladjustment in adolescents with JIA, suggesting that they should he considered as maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies in response to a chronic disease such as JIA. Challenging these maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies may therefore play an important role in intervention strategies.

AB Psychopathology in youth appears to be linked to deficits in regulating affective responses to stressful situations. In children, high-quality parental support facilitates affect regulation. However, in adolescence, the role of parent-child interaction in the regulation of affect is unclear. This study examined physiological reactivity to and recovery from stress in adolescents at risk for psychopathology, and their associations with internalising and externalising problems and parent-adolescent interactions.
   A total of 99 adolescents (M = 13.57 years, SD = 1.83) with a history of mental health problems underwent the Alarm Stress Task and were reunited with their primary caregiver after the stressor, while the physiological responses of the parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and sympathetic (pre-ejection period) systems were measured. The quality of parent-adolescent interaction was determined from observations of secure-base seeking and providing during the task. Affect regulation was measured as physiological reactivity and recovery after the stressor.
   Adolescents with high levels of externalising problems and low levels of secure-base support showed weaker parasympathetic reactivity and recovery. Higher level of adolescent secure-base seeking was associated with stronger sympathetic reactivity and recovery.
   Secure-base interactions between parents and adolescents facilitate physiological regulation of stress, especially for adolescents with externalising symptomatology.

AB This study examined adolescents' emotional reactivity to parents' marital conflict as a mediator of the association between triangulation and adolescents' internalizing problems in a sample of 2-parent families (N = 426). Four waves of annual, multiple-informant data were analyzed (youth ages 11-15 years). The authors used structural equation modeling and found that triangulation was associated with increases in adolescents' internalizing problems, controlling for marital hostility and adolescent externalizing problems. There also was an indirect pathway from triangulation to internalizing problems across time through youths' emotional reactivity. Moderating analyses indicated that the 2nd half of the pathway, the association between emotional reactivity and increased internalizing problems, characterized youth with lower levels of hopefulness and attachment to parents. The findings help detail why triangulation is a risk factor for adolescents' development and which youth will profit most from interventions focused on emotional regulation.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the role of executive function in coping and behavioral outcomes in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) survivors.MethodsWe examined associations among several domains of executive function (working memory, behavioral inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and self-monitoring), coping, and emotional/behavioral problems in 30 children and adolescents ages 10- to 20-years old who completed treatment for ALL and 30 healthy controls matched on age and sex.ResultsWe found partial support for our hypothesis that performance on executive function measures is associated with strategies used to cope with stress, and emotional and behavioral problems in ALL survivors.ConclusionsFindings suggest that executive function impairment may be associated with difficulties in coping and emotion regulation in a subgroup of children treated for ALL. Directions for future research on executive function deficits and coping skills in survivors of pediatric ALL are suggested.

AB This study examined the role of adolescents' and mothers' self-reports of English and heritage language proficiency in youth's academic and emotional adjustment among 444 Chinese American families. Adolescents who were proficient in English tended to exhibit higher reading achievement scores, math achievement scores, and overall GPA. Mothers who were English proficient tended to have children with higher academic achievement and fewer depressive symptoms. Results also indicated that adolescents' heritage language maintenance was associated with positive adjustment, particularly amongst foreign-born youth and for youth whose parents were highly proficient in the heritage language. Mother-adolescent match in heritage language proficiency was related to higher math achievement scores and overall GPA. Additionally, higher heritage language proficiency was associated with fewer depressive symptoms for foreign-born but not U.S.-born youth. Overall, the findings suggest that proficiency in both the English and heritage language may confer advantages to Chinese American youth.

AB Background. Severe thermal injuries often cause long-time functional and emotional problems in a child's life. The aim of our study was to evaluate information on the epidemiology and prevention of thermal injuries.
   Patients and methods. Eighty-three patients age 0-18 years who had been treated in our clinic between September 2002 and December 2005 were considered in a retrospective study. We gathered information regarding the cause of the accidents, the place and time of the injuries, and family background.
   Results. Scald burns are often found in the toddler age group (age 1-3 years). In our study, they were mostly caused by the children themselves and occurred 92% of the time in the domestic environment. Burns by improper use of spirits and fire were frequently seen in children age 6-18 years. These injuries mostly happened outside buildings.
   Conclusion. Midwives and pediatricians should teach parents about burn prevention soon after a child's birth. Furthermore, child daycare centers, schools, and the media should provide information regarding the handling of hot liquids, hot objects, and open flames.

AB Youth in urban settings are at significant risk for suicide and other mental health issues, but little is known about the utility or outcomes of suicide prevention programs with this population. This article reviews the outcomes of a grant-funded initiative to provide suicide screening to urban, African American youth. Columbia TeenScreen was implemented at 13 middle and high schools in Washington, DC, to 229 Black or African American students. Forty-five percent of students screened positively for previous suicide attempt or ideation, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and/or other emotional problems. Twenty percent of all youth screened endorsed current or previous suicidal ideation or attempts. Over 90% of youth endorsed at least some problem with depression or irritability. Early detection of risk factors through universal screening can lead to earlier treatment, thwarting a suicidal crisis. Implications for conducting screening in an urban setting and how psychologists call engage in screening are explored.

AB This study examined perceived behavioral atypicality as a predictor of children's school-based adjustment. First, it descriptive pilot study was conducted to examine children's reasons for nominating peers its behaviorally atypical. Then, atypicality was investigated in relation to school-based adjustment in a two-wave panel design. Social problems, emotional adjustment, and academic achievement were assessed in the fall and spring of a school year with 1,193 third-grade students via peer-, teacher-, and self-report instruments as well as school records. In the fall, atypicality was related to higher levels of social rejection and peer victimization as well as impaired emotional adjustment and academic achievement. When examined across the school year, atypicality, its mediated by higher levels of social rejection and peer victimization, predicted impaired emotional adjustment and academic achievement. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering behavioral atypicality its it broad risk factor with implications for school-based intervention. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objective Although previous research has investigated the stress response in acutely anorexic patients, there is currently little research addressing this response in recovering adolescent anorexic girls. Therefore, this study investigated partially and fully weight-restored anorexic adolescent girls' psychological and physiological response to a standardized stressor. Methods We measured the heart rate and affect of 17 adolescent recovering anorexic patients and 40 healthy age-matched controls during two conditions of the Stress Induced Speech Task (SIST): Free Association and Stress Task. Recovering patients were either partially or fully weight-restored. Results Compared to the controls, the recovering anorexic girls reported greater overall habitual psychological distress and higher levels of negative affect during the standardized stressor. However, recovering patients did not show a muted heart rate response during the stressor. Neither recovering anorexics nor controls demonstrated a correspondence between heart rate and positive or negative affect. Discussion Although the physiological stress response of recovering adolescent anorexic patients was similar to controls, the psychological response of partially and fully weight-restored anorexic adolescents appears similar to that of acutely anorexic adolescents. Treatment implications are discussed in terms of the persistence of negative affect and treatment resistance.

AB This study examined the self-reported expression of overt aggressive behaviors and covert emotional and cognitive processes in adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) during childhood. Methods: Participants were a clinically referred sample of 85 individuals diagnosed with ADHD, initially recruited in the early to mid 1990s when they were 7-11 years of age. At that time, 44 (52%) met criteria for a comorbid diagnosis of ODD and an additional 22 (26%) met criteria for a comorbid diagnosis of CD. Approximately 10 years later, these youth, along with an age-matched comparison sample (n = 83), were re-evaluated to assess a wide array of outcomes including physical and verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. Results: Individuals diagnosed with ADHD + CD in childhood reported elevated levels of physical aggression when compared to Controls and the ADHD-only group. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD + ODD had elevated levels of verbal aggression compared to Controls. Additionally, both comorbid groups experienced significantly greater amounts of anger, but not hostility, as compared to Controls. Importantly, the persistence of ADHD symptoms into adolescence accounted for most group differences in verbal aggression and anger at follow-up, but not physical aggression, which was accounted for by childhood CD. Conclusion: Adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and comorbid disruptive behavior disorders during childhood report high levels of aggression associated with increased emotionality in the form of anger, but not hostile cognitions. These findings suggest that in addition to inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, emotional dysregulation may be an important component of ADHD, particularly as it presents in adolescence.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was twofold: to assess psychological functioning, interactional competencies, and sleep patterns in children and adolescents with cleft lip and palate (CLP), and to compare these results with those from age- and gender-matched controls. It was hypothesized that participants with CLP would exhibit greater difficulties in psychological functioning, more interactional difficulties, and poorer sleep patterns than those without CLP.
   Participants: Thirty-two children and adolescents with CLP and 34 controls were recruited. Ages ranged from 6 to 16 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: For psychosocial assessment, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a questionnaire on interactional competencies (PIELCQ) were completed; for sleep assessment, a sleep log was completed for seven consecutive nights.
   Results: Participants with and without CLP did not differ with respect to emotional problems, conduct problems, or hyperactivity. With respect to interactional competencies, participants with CLP were six times more likely to report difficulties. Unfavorable sleep patterns were associated with psychosocial strain but not with the presence of CLP.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that children and adolescents with CLP may report that they have sleep irregularities as often as those without CLP. In adolescence, the presence of CLP may be associated with increased difficulties. Consequently, skill training to improve context-related social competencies may be appropriate.

AB Based on a 13-month ethnographic meaning-centered study of the lived experience of behavioral and emotional disorders among children and families living in the United States, this article highlights the range of orientations to mental health problems and treatment among families from diverse backgrounds. Detailed case portraits of three families are presented to illustrate the various meanings that psychiatric diagnoses and mental health treatments take on within families, with medicalized perspectives holding less salience among African-American families relative to Euro-Americans in the study. The diverse orientations to problems among families in the study suggest that, despite the dominance of biochemical and neurological explanations for behavioral and emotional distress in contemporary U.S. culture, and especially U.S. psychiatry, nonpathological interpretations have not been wholly eclipsed by broad trends toward biologization and medicalization. Families' experiences are positioned to reveal the allure, as well as the limitations, of biopsychiatric approaches to behavioral and emotional problems.

AB Understanding what factor,, influence positive youth development has been advocated by youth development researchers (P. L. Benson, 2006; J. S. Eccles & J. A. Gootman, 2(X)2). Consequently, the purpose of this study was to examine whether perceptions of I caring youth sport context influenced prosocial and antisocial behavior through efficacy-related beliefs, that is, positive and negative affective self-regulatory efficacy (ASRE) and empathic self efficacy (ESE). Multiethnic youths taking, pan in summer sport programs (N = 395) completed a questionnaire that measured perceptions of die caring climate, ESE, ASRE, and social behavior. Structural equation modeling wits used to test whether ASRE and ESE mediated the relationship between caring and social behaviors. Findings revealed that perceptions of caring positively predicted ASRE and ESE. In turn, positive ASRE positively predicted ESE. Prosocial behaviors were positively linked to ESE, whereas antisocial behaviors were negatively predicted by positive ASRE, The results suggest that caring influences prosocial and antisocial behavior because such contexts develop youths' ability to monitor, manage, and control positive affect, which in turn enhances their belief in their ability to empathize.

Method A total of 1,718 patients between the age of 11 and 18, as well as their parents, were assessed using the child behavior checklist (CBCL), and the youth self-report (YSR). Results Poor to low agreement between parent- and adolescent-reported problem behavior on the internalizing scale, the total problem scale and moderate agreement concerning the externalizing scale of the CBCL and the YSR were found. Independent from the amount of psychiatric diagnoses, adolescents reported significantly less behavioral problems than their parents. Concerning externalizing problems, parent-youth disagreement was stronger for patients suffering from comorbid psychiatric disorders, than for adolescents displaying only one psychiatric disorder. Conclusion In clinically referred children, parents are likely to emphasize the severity of the difficulties, whereas adolescents' under-report symptoms.

AB Obsessive-compulsive behavior was studied in a cohort of N = 570 subjects who had been assessed at three times between adolescence and young adulthood. Based on the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR), the adolescent obsessive-compulsive scale (AOCS) was defined. At each of the three assessments, subjects scoring above the cut-off score of the 90th percentile of the AOCS were identified and compared to the rest of the sample serving as control group. The risk group was clearly more abnormal in both domains of internalizing and externalizing across time. Various psychiatric disorders in young adulthood were predicted by the AOCS. However, concomitant general psychopathology also contributed strongly to the prediction. Parent and youth agreement on group membership was rather low. Stability of group assignment across time was significantly increased. The AOCS is a promising instrument both for epidemiological and clinical studies. Its content and predictive validity deserves further studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Caregiver depression has been described as leading to overreport of child behavior problems. This study examines this "depression-distortion" hypothesis in terms of high-risk families of young adolescents. Questionnaire data were collected from mothers, teachers. and fathers. and self-report information was obtained from youth between ages 10 and 14 years. First, convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated for internalizing and externalizing multiagent constructs. Second, the depression-distortion hypothesis was examined, revealing a modest effect of maternal depression, leading to the inflation of reported son externalizing and daughter internalizing problems. The data suggest the need to consider multiple influences on parental perceptions of child behavior and psychopathology in research and clinical settings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To identify childhood psychiatric symptoms as antecedents of cigarette smoking at age 18. Methods: In 1989, a general population sample of 2946 8-year-old boys born in Finland in 1981 was assessed using the Rutter's parent and teacher questionnaires, and the Child Depression Inventory. This birth cohort was followed up in 1999, when the subjects reported for their obligatory military service at age 18. Information about cigarette smoking frequency was obtained from 78% (n = 2307) of the boys attending the study in 1989. Results: Childhood hyperactivity and self-reported depressive symptoms correlated with moderate daily (1-10 cigarettes), and heavy daily (> 10 cigarettes) smoking at age 18. Conduct problems correlated with heavy daily smoking. A high level of childhood depressive symptoms, particularly in conjunction with a low educational level of the father, increased the risk of daily smoking. Emotional problems decreased the risk of smoking at age 18. In general, teacher reports had a better predictive power than parent reports for subsequent smoking. Conclusion: Future developmental studies with special focus on interaction between individual and environmental factors are warranted to reveal the mechanisms underlying the association between childhood psychopathology and adult smoking. In particular, the associations between childhood depression and future smoking need more clarification.

AB The authors investigated the relation between social achievement goals (A. M. Ryan & S. S. Shim, 2006) and aspects of students' socio-emotional adjustment in a sample or elementary school students. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that after controlling for levels of prosocial skills, a social development goal was positively related to perceived belongingness and negatively related to perceptions of loneliness at school. In contrast, a social demonstration-avoid goal was positively associated with perceptions of loneliness, whereas a social demonstration-approach goal was negatively associated with peer acceptance. Last, prosocial skills were positively related to students' peer acceptance, which was negatively associated with feelings of loneliness. The results and their implications on students' school adjustment are discussed within the social achievement goal framework.

AB Common measures of eating disorder symptoms contain affect-related items. When associations between negative affect and eating disorder symptoms are examined, criterion confounding is possible. The current study explored whether criterion confounding biases estimates of relations between symptoms of binge eating and negative affect. Data were collected from first-year university student women via 14-day web-based daily diaries. The Minnesota Eating Behavior Survey (MEBS) measured daily symptoms of binge eating, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measured daily negative affect. The inclusion of affect-related items in the MEBS biased mean level tests of negative affect, correlations of negative affect with symptoms of binge eating, and associations between the likelihood of reporting behavioral symptoms of binge eating and same-day negative affect. Converging results demonstrated the need to measure associated features and risk factors separately from problematic eating behavior symptoms.

AB Objective: There are no previous studies about the association of childhood bullying behavior with later suicide attempts and completed suicides among both sexes. The aim was to study associations between childhood bullying behaviors at age 8 years and suicide attempts and completed suicides up to age 25 years in a large representative population-based birth cohort. Method: The sample includes 5,302 Finnish children born in 1981. Information about bullying was gathered at age 8 years from self-report, as well as parent and teacher reports. Information about suicide attempts requiring hospital admission and completed suicides was gathered from three different Finnish registries until the study participants were 25 years old. Regression analyses were conducted to determine whether children who experience childhood bullying behaviors are at risk for later suicide attempts and completed suicides after controlling for baseline conduct and depression symptoms. Results: The association between bullying behavior at age 8 years and later suicide attempts and completed suicides varies by sex. Among boys, frequent bullying and victimization are associated with later suicide attempts and completed suicides but not after controlling for conduct and depression symptoms; frequent victimization among girls is associated with later suicide attempts and completed suicides, even after controlling for conduct and depression symptoms. Conclusions: When examining childhood bullying behavior as a risk factor for later suicide attempts and completed suicides, each sex has a different risk profile. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

AB The impact of exposure to violence in the media on the long-term development and short-term expression of aggressive behavior has been well documented. However, gaps in this literature remain, and in particular the role of violent media exposure in shaping violent and other serious antisocial behavior has not been investigated. Further, studies of violent media effects typically have not sampled from populations with confirmed histories of violent and/or nonviolent antisocial behavior. In this study, we analyzed data on 820 youth, including 390 juvenile delinquents and 430 high school students, to examine the relation of violent media use to involvement in violence and general aggression. Using criterion scores developed through cross-informant modeling of data from self, parent/guardian, and teacher/staff reports, we observed that childhood and adolescent violent media preferences contributed significantly to the prediction of violence and general aggression from cumulative risk totals. Findings represent a new and important direction for research on the role of violent media use in the broader matrix of risk factors for youth violence.

AB OBJECTIVES. The goals of this study to assess (1) the stability of self-reported health among a nationally representative sample of youth in adolescence over a period of 6 years, (2) the concordance of self-reported health between parents and children, and (3) the validity of self-reported health across a range of physical and emotional indicators of adolescent well-being.
   METHODS. This study uses data from rounds 1 to 7 (1997-2003) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort (NLSY97). The sample consists of 6748 youth born between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1984. Data on one of the youths' parents were also included in the baseline of the survey. Analyses were conducted using polychoric correlations and ordinal logistic regression.
   RESULTS. Self-reported health of adolescents over a 7-year period indicated moderate stability (40% agreement after 7 years for girls and 41% for boys). Concordance was also present between parents and their children, although the association was higher among same-gender pairings (mother-daughter and father-son concordances). Adolescents' self-reported health was also linked with the presence or absence of chronic health conditions, emotional problems, and with being overweight or obese but not with sensory conditions or physical deformity.
   CONCLUSIONS. Self-reported health is stable from early and middle adolescence to young adulthood. Self-reported health is also a valid measure of a variety of physical and emotional dimensions of adolescent well-being. The stability and validity of self-reported health do not differ by the gender of the child, although there is slightly greater concordance when the reporting parent is the same gender as the child.

AB The field of psychiatry has largely discounted the existence of bipolar disorder (BD) in children and viewed adolescent-onset BD as uncommon until recently. Evidence demonstrating that a significant number of adults with BD report symptom onset before age 19 has led to an explosion in the recognition of childhood BD over the past decade. Because children and adolescents, including preschoolers, are being diagnosed with BD in rapidly increasing numbers, the criteria for mania are being adjusted in children and adolescents to accommodate various presentations of emotional dysregulation into the paradigm of BD. Still, it has yet to be seen whether these presentations will develop in adulthood into what we have traditionally considered to be BD. This blurring of the diagnostic lines has led to significant controversy in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. This article introduces current thinking about this controversial diagnosis through two case examples.

AB Asian Americans are commonly perceived as the diligent and high-achieving "model minority." This positive stereotype has negative consequences for this ethnic minority group because it trivializes their social and mental health problems. This image of success has made many overlook the true nature of the struggles many Asian American families have to face in the United States. Scientific literature suggests that Asian American children experience major adjustment problems in school including loneliness, isolation, withdrawal, rejection, anxiety, low self-esteem, and interpersonal distress. Cultural barriers exist between the Asian and the dominant society and influence Asian Americans' cognitive appraisal and coping choices when personal and emotional problems arise. These barriers also prevent clinicians from identifying and subsequently providing effective mental health services For Asian American children and their families. In this article, the authors examine the Asian cultural conceptions of mental health and various cultural barriers in an attempt to promote cultural understanding and competence among clinicians working with Asian American children and their families. Recommendations for clinical practice and future research directions are provided. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Family socioeconomic position (SEP) is known to be associated with adolescent mental health. Whether the relationship is different for different mental health dimensions is unknown.
   Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated the differential effects of family SEP on multiple mental health dimensions in preadolescents (N = 2230, baseline age 10-12, 49% boys) using reports from multiple informants (parent, self, and teachers). A score equal to or higher than the 85th percentile (averaged across informants) defined mental health problems.
   SEP was inversely associated with all dimensions. Compared to high SEP, the odds ratios (OR) for externalizing problems were 3.88 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.56, 5.90) and 2.05 (CI: 1.34, 3.14) for low and intermediate SEP, respectively. For internalizing problems, they were 1.86 (CI: 1.28, 2.70) and 1.37 (CI: 0.94, 2.00), respectively. When adjusted for externalizing problems, SEP effects on internalizing problems materially attenuated (OR: 1.47, CI: 0.78, 1.68 and OR: 1.34, CI: 0.91, 1.96) while the converse was less pronounced (OR: 3.39, CI: 2.24, 5.15) and (OR: 1.91, CI: 1.25, 2.94).
   In early adolescence, the risk of mental health problems increases with decreasing SEP, particularly for externalizing problems. Further, the SEP-internalizing problems relationship is partly explained by shared aspects with externalizing problems.

AB Because youth with aggressive conduct disorder (CD) often inflict pain on others, it is important to determine if they exhibit atypical empathic responses to viewing others in pain. In this initial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, eight adolescents with aggressive CD and eight matched controls with no CD symptoms were scanned while watching animated visual stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain or not experiencing pain. Furthermore, these situations involved either an individual whose pain was caused by accident or an individual whose pain was inflicted on purpose by another person. After scanning, participants rated how painful the situations were. In both groups the perception of others in pain was associated with activation of the pain matrix, including the ACC, insula, somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and periaqueductal gray. The pain matrix was activated to a specific extent in participants with CD, who also showed significantly greater amygdala, striatal, and temporal pole activation. When watching situations in which pain was intentionally inflicted, control youth exhibited signal increase in the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right temporo-parietal junction, whereas youth with CD only exhibited activation in the insula and precentral gyrus. Furthermore, connectivity analyses demonstrated that youth with CD exhibited less amygdala/prefrontal coupling when watching pain inflicted by another than did control youth. These preliminary findings suggest that youth with aggressive CD exhibit an atypical pattern of neural response to viewing others in pain that should be explored in further studies.

Data was collected as part of a randomized clinical trial involving 155 children with surgically corrected transposition (concordant atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections or alignments). As infants, they underwent the arterial switch operation, involving deep hypothermia with predominantly total circulatory arrest or predominantly low-flow continuous cardiopulmonary bypass as the method of providing support to the vital organs. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist when the patients were aged 4 and 8 years, and the Connors' Parent Rating Scale at the age of 8 years. When the children were aged 8, teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form and the Connors' Teacher Rating Scale. In the cohort as a whole, the frequencies of behavioural problems identified by both parents and teachers were elevated, particularly on the scales for competence of the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Adaptive scales of the Teacher's Report Form. Approximately I in 5 patients had scores for Total Problem Behavior in the range of clinical concern on both the Child Behavior Checklist and the Teacher's Report Form. Few differences were found, however, according to the method of operative treatment. Postoperative seizures were associated with social and attention problems. Children experiencing academic problems at the age of 8 showed a larger increase in behavioural problems between the ages of 4 and 8 than did children making adequate academic progress. Children with congenitally malformed hearts who underwent reparative surgery in infancy using a strategy of severe haemodilution and alpha star are at increased risk of behavioural problems in middle childhood.

AB Background: Problems regulating emotions effectively (emotion dysregulation) are implicated in many psychological problems. Depression in particular has been increasingly conceptualized as a disorder of emotion regulation. Methods: This study examines the linkage between children's depressive Symptoms and the activation and regulation of positive and negative affect in response to all.,manipulated. peer evaluation outcome. Participants (N=142) aged 10-13 played a computer contest ("Survivor") and were randomized to either a negative (i.e., receiving the lowest "likeability" score from a group of peer judges), a positive (i.e., highest score), or a neutral peer evaluation outcome. Positive and negative affect were assessed at baseline, immediately post-feedback, and after a 5 min post-feedback waiting period. Results: No linkage was observed between depressive symptoms and emotional activation in response to either success or failure feedback. Consistent with expectations, we observed a negative linkage between depressive symptoms and childrens up-regulation of positive affect subsequent to receiving negative peer feedback. No such linkage was observed for the maintenance of mood improvement over time. Conclusions: Results suggest that depressive symptoms in children are not linked with deficits or excesses in the overall magnitude of emotional reactivity. However, it appears that elevated depressive symptoms interfere with the ability to swiftly transition out of negative affective states. Depression and Anxiety 26:135-146, 2009.

AB The aim of this study is to compare self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) with the objective of exercise performance in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) according to diagnosis.
   564 patients (255 females, 14-73 years) with various CHD (62 shunt, 66 left heart obstruction, 33 PS/PR, 47 Ebstein, 96 Fallot, 98 TGA after atrial switch, 38 other TGA, 31 Fontan, 32 palliated/native cyanotic, 61 others) and a group of 53 healthy controls (18 females, 14-57 years) completed a QoL questionnaire (SF-36) and performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test. Despite several limitations at exercise (P = 1.30 x 10(-33)), patients only reported reductions in HRQoL concerning physical functioning (P = 4.41 x 10(-15)) and general health (P = 6.17 x 10(-5)) and not psychosocial aspects. This could be confirmed in all diagnostic subgroups. Correlation to peak oxygen uptake was found in physical functioning (r = 0.435, P = 1.72 x 10(-27)) and general health (r = 0.275, P = 3.79 x 10(-11)). However, there was severe overestimation of physical functioning in most patients when compared with actual exercise test results.
   Patients with CHD rate their HRQoL impaired only in physical functioning and general health and not in any psychosocial aspect. Self-estimated physical functioning poorly predicts actual exercise capacity.

AB Purpose: Stressful life events represent potent risk factors for the development of internalizing symptoms among adolescents. However the mechanisms linking stress to adolescent psychopathology remain inadequately understood. This study examined the role of emotion dysregulation as a mechanism linking stress to changes in internalizing symptoms among adolescents.
   Methods: This study used a short-term longitudinal design. Stressful life events were assessed in a large diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065), and emotion dysregulation and symptomatology outcomes were assessed at two subsequent tune points. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the role of emotion dysregulation as a mediator of the association between stress and subsequent changes in internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between stressful life events and changes in internalizing symptoms over time. Sobel's test indicated a significant indirect effect of stressful life events on subsequent symptoms of depression (z = 5.05, p <.001) and anxiety (z = 4.95, p <.001) through emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: Stressful life events appear to disrupt the adaptive processing of emotion among adolescents. Emotion dysregulation represents an intrapersonal mechanism linking stress to poor mental health outcomes. The implications for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Associations between multiple risks, emotion regulation skill, and basal cortisol levels were examined in a community sample of 69 African American youth (mean age = 11.30 years; 49% male) living in an urban setting. Multiple risks were assessed at Time 1 and consisted of 10 demographic and psychosocial risk factors including parent, child, and observer reports. Parents rated the child's emotion regulation skill at Time 2, 6 months later: Three saliva samples were collected one morning in the week following the rime 2 interview and assayed for cortisol, a stress hormone. Regression results indicated that multiple risks at Tine 1 were associated with depressed cortisol levels at Tine 2, but that patterns of association differed across levels of emotion regulation skill and sex. Youth with good emotion regulation skills showed no differences in cortisol across low and high levels of risk. In contrast, females with poor emotion regulation skill showed strong negative associations between multiple risks and basal cortisol levels. Hypocortisolism is a response of some youth to multiple risks, but protective factors can attenuate this association.

AB This study examined behavioral and emotional adjustment in family contexts in which there was high versus low demand for adolescents to serve as language brokers in a sample of 73 recently immigrated Latino families with middle-school-aged adolescents. Language brokering was conceptualized as a family process rather than merely an individual phenomenon. Multiple agents were used to assess language brokering and parent and youth adjustment. Results indicated that those in high language brokering contexts, compared with those in low language brokering contexts, demonstrated higher levels of family stress, lower levels of parenting effectiveness, and poorer adolescent adjustment in terms of academic functioning, socioemotional health, and substance use. The findings are particularly important given the limited and mixed findings from formative research on language brokering, particularly in areas within the United States with emerging immigrant populations. Findings suggest the need for advancing practices that increase language and cultural supports for immigrant families and support parents' efforts to foster positive youth and family adjustment.

AB There is limited research on the links between grandparenting and adolescents' well-being, especially from the perspective of the adolescents. The study examined whether grandparent involvement varied in two-parent biological, lone-parent, and step- families and whether this had a different contribution to the emotional and behavioral adjustment of adolescents across different family structures. The study is based on a sample of 1,515 secondary school students (ages 11-16 years) from England and Wales who completed a structured questionnaire. Findings of hierarchical regression analyses showed that among the whole sample, greater grandparent involvement was associated with fewer emotional problems (p < .01) and with more prosocial behavior (p < .001). In addition, while there were no differences in the level of grandparent involvement across the different family structures, grandparent involvement was more strongly associated with reduced adjustment difficulties among adolescents from lone-parent and step- families than those from two-parent biological families. A possible implication is that the positive role of grandparent involvement in lone-parent and step- families should be more emphasized in family psychology.

It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with various difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multimodal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; child abuse and neglect; conduct problems (including childhood behavioural difficulties, ADHD, delinquency and drug abuse); emotional problems (including anxiety, depression, grief, bipolar disorder and suicidality); eating disorders (including anorexia, bulimia and obesity); and somatic problems (including enuresis, encopresis, recurrent abdominal pain, and poorly controlled asthma and diabetes).

AB Bullying poses a threat to children's social-emotional functioning and their perceptions of school climate, yet few studies have examined different types of social-emotional and behavior problems presented by children involved in bullying, as a bully, victim, or bully/victim across multiple school levels. The current study used data from 24,345 elementary-, middle-, and high-school students to examine the association between frequent involvement in bullying and aggressive impulsivity. attitudes toward aggressive retaliation, internalizing symptoms, peer relations, and perceptions of school climate. Logistic regression analyses indicated that bully/victims were most likely to display internalizing symptoms, problems in peer relationships, and have poorer perceptions of the school environment. Both frequent bullies and bully/victims displayed aggressive-impulsive behavior and endorsed retaliatory attitudes. High-school students frequently involved in bullying tended to display the greatest risk for internalizing problems. but less risk for aggressive impulsivity. Developmental trends and implications for prevention and early intervention are discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Children with congenital heart defects (CHD) requiring open-heart surgery are a group at high risk for health-related sequelae. Little consensus exists regarding their long-term psychological adjustment (PA) and health-related quality of life (QoL). Thus, we conducted a systematic review to determine the current knowledge on long-term outcome in this population.
   Methods: We included randomized controlled trials, case control, or cohort studies published between 1990-2008 evaluating self- and proxy-reported PA and QoL in patients aged between two and 17 years with a follow-up of at least two years after open heart surgery for CHD.
   Results: Twenty-three studies assessing psychological parameters and 12 studies assessing QoL were included. Methodological quality of the studies varied greatly with most studies showing a moderate quality. Results were as follows: (a) A considerable proportion of children experienced psychological maladjustment according to their parents; (b) studies on self- reported PA indicate a good outcome; (c) the studies on QoL suggest an impaired QoL for some children in particular for those with more severe cardiac disease; (d) parental reports of psychological maladjustment were related to severity of CHD and developmental delay.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of survivors of open-heart surgery for CHD are at risk for psychological maladjustment and impaired QoL. Future research needs to focus on self- reports, QoL data and adolescents.

AB The impact of parental substance use on the emotional and behavioral adjustment of their adolescent children was examined over 5 years. A representative sample of 220 parents with HIV (PWH) and 330 adolescent children in New York City were repeatedly assessed. Some parents never used marijuana or hard drugs over the 5 years (nonusers). Among those who were users, substance use varied over time, PWH who used substances during a specific 3-month period were classified as active users and those who abstained from substance use were classified as inactive users. Longitudinal regression analyses were used to analyze the impact of variations in patterns of substance use over time on their adolescent children's emotional adjustment and behavioral problems. PWH relapse exacerbated adolescent substance use, trouble with peers, and adolescent emotional distress. Even time-limited reductions in parents' substance abuse can have a significant positive impact on their adolescent children's emotional and behavioral adjustment. Interventions that address parental substance use among PWH should be developed to ameliorate the impact of substance use relapse on their adolescents.

AB This study examined the contributions of gender, anger, expectations of positive outcomes, and frequency of victimization by and bullying of peers among school-aged children to predict individual differences in intentions to respond to provocative events with nonassertive behavior. Children between the ages of 9 and 13 (N = 505, 246 female, 259 male) completed the Anger Response Inventory, Child Version (Trangney et al, 1996) and measures of victimization and bullying. Results of regression procedures demonstrated that female gender and low anger predicted ignoring and using distraction. Nonassertive responses, low anger, and low victimization predicted expecting, more positive outcomes following provocation. Victimization was unrelated to intentions to use nonassertive responses but bullying negatively predicted walking away and using distraction. No modifying effects for gender, victimization, or bullying were found.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the association between the occurrence of stressful life events and internalizing and externalizing problems, and to analyze longitudinally buffering effects of supportive family relationships. To this end, 100 Spanish adolescents were studied twice, when they were in mid-adolescence (15-16 years) and two years later. They completed questionnaires regarding stressful life events, family relationships, and adolescent adjustment. Results showed that high quality parent-adolescent relationships protected boys and girls against the negative consequences of stressful life events on externalizing, but not internalizing, symptoms. The adolescents who enjoyed good relationships with their parents in mid-adolescence did not increase their externalizing problems in late adolescence as consequence of the occurrence of stressful events. However, these stressors did lead to an increase in the number of externalizing problems when the family relationships were of a middle or low quality. These results highlight the important role that supportive family relationships play in the behavioral adjustment of adolescents, protecting them against some negative consequences of stressful life events, and suggest the relevance of supporting parents through resources such as parent education in order to help them to improve their relationships with their adolescents.

AB Earlier studies indicated a relation between fearful-avoidant attachment and substance abuse. This study compares attachment representations (Family Attachment Interview; Bartholomew Horowitz, 1991) of three groups of substance abusers and non-clinical controls. Heroin abusers (N=22) were mainly fearful-avoidant, ecstasy abusers (N=31) were preoccupied, fearful-avoidant and dismissing-avoidant, cannabis abusers (N=19) were mainly dismissing and secure, and controls (N=22) were mainly secure. Groups did differ in their level of psychosocial functioning (GAF) (cannabisecstasy opioids). Differences in attachment prevailed when GAF was controlled. Based on the self-medication hypothesis we understand the preferences for specific substances to be influenced by specific attachment strategies. Heroin seems to be used as an emotional substitute for lacking coping strategies. Cannabis seems to be used to support existing deactivating and distancing strategies. Ecstasy abuse was related to insecure attachment but not to a specific attachment strategy.

AB This study explored the psychometric properties of the Parent Problem Checklist (PPC), a measure of parental conflict over child-rearing issues. Participants were a clinical sample of 391 parents of children aged 0-18 years presenting at a university paediatric psychology clinic for intervention in relation to their child's behavioural or emotional problems. Exploratory factor analysis was done on the PPC Extent scale. It provided support for a revised three-factor model including dimensions of consistency in discipline, child care, and family processes. Modifications that could enhance the measures are discussed. The present results have implications for examining different aspects of parent conflict, and the assessment of parenting conflict in clinical practice. The PPC provides a valid and reliable means of assessing interparent conflict about child behaviour and parenting. Directions for further research are highlighted.

AB Bulimia nervosa and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) co-occur at high rates, and both have been conceptualized as maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Treatments focusing on emotion regulation have been designed for both problem behaviors, yet, there exists very little research examining the temporal emotional states surrounding acts of NSSI. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology, the current study examined the temporal association between positive and negative emotional states prior to and consequent to acts of NSSI within a subset of bulimia nervosa patients. Results indicate significant increases in negative affect, and decreases in positive affect, prior to an NSSI act. Post-NSSI, positive affect significantly increased while negative affect remained unchanged. The findings offer partial support for an emotion regulation paradigm to understanding NSSI within bulimic populations and implications for treatment are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given the evidence from studies indicating that children in care have significant developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems, services for these children are an essential societal investment. Youth in foster care and adults who formerly were placed in care (foster care alumni) have disproportionately high rates of emotional and behavioral disorders. Among the areas of concern has been the lack of comprehensive mental health screening of all children entering out-of-home care, the need for more thorough identification of youth with emotional and behavioral disorders, and insufficient youth access to high-quality mental health services. In 2001, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) formed a foster care mental health values subcommittee to establish guidelines on improving policy and practices in the various systems that serve foster care children (AACAP and CWLA, 2002). Because of the excellent quality and comprehensiveness of these statements, the Casey Clinical Foster Care Research and Development Project undertook consensus development work to enhance and build upon these statements. This article presents an overview of mental health functioning of youth and alumni of foster care, and outlines a project that developed consensus guidelines.

AB Objective: The purposes of this study were to investigate self-reported social experience in 10-year-old children born with a cleft lip and/or palate and to gain a better understanding of variables implicated in psychosocial resilience.
   Design: Cross-sectional study of 10-year-old children from five consecutive birth cohorts, born from 1992 to 1997.
   Participants: A total of 268 children treated by the Oslo cleft team (Norway) participated in the study. The children's cleft conditions included cleft lip and palate, cleft lip alveolus, cleft palate, and submucous cleft palate.
   Outcome Measures: Psychosocial resilience was measured with the Child Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Other variables were obtained during a clinical interview with the child. Cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial functioning was measured with the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC). Satisfaction with appearance was assessed through the use of the Satisfaction with Appearance Scales (SWA). Informants were both children and parents.
   Results: Cleft types differed significantly with respect to subtype and frequency of additional difficulties. Psychosocial resilience was associated with adequate emotional functioning, high satisfaction with appearance, and a lower frequency of reported teasing. Child characteristics such as visibility of cleft, gender, and additional diagnosis did not contribute to explain psychosocial resilience.
   Conclusions: Results reported here emphasise the importance of assessing the child's subjective report of satisfaction with appearance and psychosocial experience.

AB We summarize progress in the developmental study of coping, including specification of a multilevel framework, construction of definitions of coping that rely on regulation as a core concept, and identification of developmentally graded members of families of coping. We argue that these accomplishments are a prelude to the real tasks of a developmental agenda: (1) identifying age-graded shifts in how children and adolescents recognize, react to, and deal with the stressors they encounter in their daily lives; (2) determining the developmental processes that underlie these shifts; and (3) describing and explaining differential pathways for negotiating these normative transitions.

AB The study of resilience in maltreated children reveals the possibility of coping processes and resources on multiple levels of analysis as children strive to adapt under conditions of severe stress. In a maltreating context, aspects of self-organization, including self-esteem, self-reliance, emotion regulation, and adaptable yet reserved personalities, appear particularly important for more competent coping. Moreover, individual differences in biological processes ranging from gene by environment interactions to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to brain organization related to emotion also are shown to influence the resilience in maltreated youth, highlighting the multifaceted contributions to successful coping.

The challenges are (1) to integrate work on coping and processes of emotion regulation, (2) to use the integration of research on neurobiology and context to inform the study of coping, (3) to explore the implications of dual process conceptualizations of automatic and controlled processes for the development of coping, and (4) to articulate how coping is organized around specific adaptive processes. How researchers resolve these challenges will affect greatly the future contributions that our understanding of coping will make to basic and applied developmental science.

AB The prospective relation of maternal emotion philosophy to children's emotion understanding and regulation and positive and negative adjustment was investigated. Sixty-nine African American youth (50% male; M age = 11.29 years) and their maternal caregivers living in high violence areas of a midsized city participated in this interview study. Caregivers' meta-emotion philosophy predicted child emotion understanding and emotion regulation, which also were associated with Time 1. grades, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and social skills after controlling for Time 1 adjustment. Emotional understanding mediated the relationship between caregivers' emotional socialization and boys' internalizing behaviors and between caregivers' emotional socialization and girls' social skills. In addition, emotion regulation mediated the relationships between emotional socialization and all four outcomes for boys. Implications for future work on emotion socialization and clinical intervention, particularly related to emotion regulation, ate discussed.

AB The pathophysiology of the effects of cocaine on fetal development has been described along 2 major pathways: neurochemical effects and vasoconstrictive effects. Following a summary of these effects, we suggest a 'third pathophysiology' in which altered fetal programming affects the acute and long-term adverse effects of in utero cocaine exposure. We describe how cocaine as a stressor alters the expression of key candidate genes, increasing exposure to catecholamines and fetal cortisol-altering neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) activity, leading to infant behavioral dysregulation, poor behavioral control and emotion regulation during childhood and phenotypes that confer vulnerability to substance use in adolescence. This model is discussed in relation to follow-up studies of the effects of in utero cocaine exposure and maturational changes in brain development. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Among the psychiatric comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with epilepsy, depression and anxiety disorders require further attention because they carry the risk of reduced quality of life and life-threatening complications (e.g., Suicide). Research in recent years has shed light on both the prevalence of emotional problems in youth with epilepsy and the safety and efficacy of treatment options. A number of challenges exist in treating patients with epilepsy. This is particularly true when seizures are difficult to control and medication regimens are more complex. Some pharmaceutical options may provide assistance with both seizures and emotional distress, but care is needed when considering such treatment approaches. In addition. integration of mental health professionals into the care of patients is necessary when cases are complicated and risk factors are high. Thorough methods to accurately diagnose emotional conditions and regular monitoring of symptoms can help prevent serious problems that can negatively affect the success of children and adolescents in everyday life. Collaboration between disciplines offers the best hope for early identification and treatment of these conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE health; cerebral palsy; displaced/refugees families; war
AB Cerebral palsy is a pathological state characterized primarily with the damage to the motoric functioning which can be accompanied by the other disorders such as: sight and hearing problems, intellectual deficit, emotional problems, conduct disorders, speech disorders, epileptic seizures etc. Refugee crisis caused by the war that followed the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia make this situation significantly worse, so the number of those which on these areas, mainly from Croatia and B&H, were forced to leave their homes is around 2 millions.
   The aim of the study is to determine characteristics of health of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy in the Sarajevo Canton, in displaced and refugees families and compare them with children with cerebral palsy in domicile families.
   Material and methods: The study which deals with health of children with cerebral palsy in displaced and refugees families in the Canton of Sarajevo is analytical, retrospective study. The sample consisted of 80 children and-adolescents with cerebral palsy in the Sarajevo Canton, 23 (28,75 %) in displaced and refugees families, and 57 (71,25 %) children in domicile families, age from 6 up to 20 years. Those 23 families did not live in Sarajevo before the war 1992-1996. Statistical design includes descriptive overview in the tables and charts, and calculation of the statistical significance of the differences of three subgroups.
   Results: From 23 families of children with cerebral palsy, 5 (21,74 %) are refugees families and 18 (78,26 %) are displaced families from other towns of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 23 displaced and refugees families of children with cerebral palsy, 9 (11.25 %) children are left at home, 10 (12.5 %) children attend special schools and 4 (5 %) attend regular schools. From 57 (71.25 %) domicile families, 25 (31.25 %) are at home, 17 (21.25%) attend special schools and 15 (18.75 %) attend regular schools.
   Discussion: In this Study, of 23 displaced and refugees families of children with cerebral palsy, 10 children were born before war time, 8 (5 boys and 3 girls) during war time, and 5 after war time.
   Conclusions: From 23 displaced and refugees families, 5 children have severe intellectual disability, 5 children have moderate intellectual disability, 7 have mild intellectual disability, 3 borderline intellectual disability, and 3 have normal intellectual abilities. There is a-significant difference among the groups, X2=10.376 p=0.024 Of 23 displaced and refugees families, 9 children have epilepsy, and 14 don't. There is a significant difference between the groups, X2=4.463 p=0.0107. Lack of unique database indicates poor network among re/habilitation and education Institutions and Associations in the Canton of Sarajevo. War psycho trauma of pregnant women is present as possible prenatal etiological factor of cerebral palsy.

AB A theoretical framework that incorporates emotional responses and emotion regulation into achievement goal theory is proposed as an alternative view to understanding the inconsistent pattern of findings linking achievement goal orientations to academic outcomes. In this critical review and synthesis, the relation of achievement goal orientations to debilitating emotional responses, as well as the use of emotion regulation strategies to alter debilitating emotions, is examined. Although mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goal orientations are considered, the regulation of debilitating emotions is proposed as especially critical for understanding how performance-approach goal orientations relate to academic-related processes and achievement. Finally, this framework is broadened to incorporate research on how the social context and intraindividual factors shape the resultant pattern of achievement goal orientations, emotional responses, and emotion regulation.

AB Despite growing research results indicating that shyness is a risk factor for psychosocial maladjustment in childhood, less is known about the conceptual mechanisms that may underlie these associations. The purpose of the current study was to explore links between self-reported shyness, coping strategies and social functioning in middle childhood. As well, we sought to examine the reliance on internalizing coping strategies as a potential mediator of the link between shyness and social functioning. Participants were 355 children aged 9 to 11 years who completed measures of shyness, loneliness, positive and negative affect, social anxiety, self-concept, well-being, and coping strategies. Results indicated that shyness was associated with greater internalizing difficulties and lower wellbeing. Moreover, internalizing coping was found to partially mediate the relation between shyness and certain indices of internalizing problems. These results suggest a conceptual pathway, where an over-reliance on internalizing coping may partially explain why shy children experience internalizing difficulties in middle childhood.

   This article analyses the breakdown of teenage placements in Denmark from survey data on 227 teenagers placed in care during 2004. We explore frequencies of breakdown, time of breakdown occurrence and factors possibly causing breakdown. These are factors related to (i) the teenager, (ii) the parents, (iii) the care environment and (iv) the casework process. Results show that 26 per cent of the teenagers in the study experienced placement breakdown. Thirty per cent of these breakdowns occurred within the first 4 months of placement. A factor significantly increasing probability of breakdown was emotional problems of the teenager. A factor significantly reducing placement breakdown was the teenager having continuity with the same caseworker throughout the placement. System- and policy-related factors also proved to have an influence on breakdown rates. We discuss possible policy implications of these findings.

Using multilevel modeling, we found heterogeneity across children in terms of their initial levels of anxiety and their trajectories of anxiety over time. Initial community and school violence exposure and witnessing IPV were both positively associated with initial levels of anxiety. Over time, change in both community and school violence exposure and witnessing IPV positively covaried with anxiety. Further, gender, initial family social support, and change in family social support significantly moderated the effect of change in community and school violence exposure on anxiety.

AB This study examined emotion-related functioning following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with 37 youth with anxiety disorders (22 boys, 15 girls) ranging in age from 7 to 15 with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n=27), separation anxiety disorder (n=12), and/or social phobia (n=13). Treated youth exhibited a reduction in anxiety and increased anxiety self-efficacy and emotional awareness at posttreatment. Treated youth also demonstrated improved coping and less emotional dysregulation with worry but not with anger or sadness. The results suggest that the gains made in worry regulation do not generalize to other emotions that are not specifically targeted within the CBT protocol.

AB The development of child anxiety and depressive symptoms from mean ages 5.3 to 9.3 years was examined in a community sample of 133 girls and 134 boys, using parent and teacher ratings. Reliable individual differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms at mean age 5.3 and in their change to mean age 9.3 were observed, with significant correlations between depressive and anxiety symptoms at mean age 5.3 years and between their changes with age. Positive cross-lagged correlations from anxiety to depressive symptoms and negative cross-lagged correlations from depressive to anxiety symptoms were apparent in teachers' ratings at 6- to 12-month intervals. Developmental changes in teacher-rated child anxiety symptoms were robust predictors of child self-reported depressive symptoms at mean age 9.3 years. These results suggest assessment and interventions for emotional problems may be usefully implemented during childhood in school and peer social environments.

AB Objective. To examine whether low birth weight (LBW) children are at greater risk for behavioural and emotional problems than normal birth weight children.
   Methods. Electronic databases (PubMed, Google) were searched. Key search terms (LBW, emotional behavioural outcome) were used to identify possible studies. Selection of studies was limited to those including detailed assessment of behavioural and/or emotional outcome of very low birth weight or very preterm infants with normal term infants as controls, published from the year 2000 to date. A total of 20 studies were identified for inclusion in our review.
   Results. Overall studies showed a significant increase in behavioural problems in particular poor attention span, withdrawn behaviour and poorer adaptive functioning. Rates of a clinically significant neurobehavioural impairment in cases ranged from 25% to 55% with controls displaying a relatively constant rate of around 7%. Attention problems without hyperactivity (ADD) were more common than 'classical attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder' in LBW children. Only 4% of the LBW children had previously been referred to a consultant psychiatric suggesting that at present these problems are being under-recognised.
   Conclusion. VLBW or very preterm infants are at significant risk of behavioural and emotional problems. The risk is further increased when cognitive or motor difficulties are present or when social circumstances are poor.

AB This is a longitudinal study of change in undercontrol and its relation to the use of defense mechanisms with participants from the Berkeley Guidance Study of the Institute of Human Development, University of California, Berkeley. I predicted that use of the immature defense of Denial, but not Projection or Identification, would be related at early adolescence to an increase in undercontrol as assessed from 2 independent measures. The assessment of Ego Undercontrol indicated that the majority of children decreased with age, but for those who increased at early adolescence, the increase was significantly related to the use of Denial. Similarly, assessment of Externalizing Behavior Problems at early adolescence indicated that an increase in Externalizing Problems was related to the use of Denial. In addition to indicating psychological immaturity, the use of Denial prevents these children from recognizing the negative impact of their undercontrolled behavior.

AB Parents' responses to their children's emotional expressivity have been shown to significantly influence children's subsequent psychosocial functioning. This study hypothesized that adolescents' deliberate self-harm (DSH) may be an outcome associated with poor emotion regulation as well as an invalidating family environment. The mediational role of specific emotion processes (i.e., poor awareness of emotion, difficulties expressing emotions) between family emotional environment and the frequency of DSH was examined with 131 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (M age=14.84 years, SD=1.75 years). Results indicated that adolescents who self-injured reported that this behavior reduced their negative emotional states. Structural equation modeling provided support for the proposed model that family climate influences frequency of DSH through emotion regulation skills but the model held for girls only. A direct model effect was not supported. Emotion regulation partially mediated the relationship between family climate and DSH, and direct effects were also observed.

ID BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; CHILDHOOD
AB Adolescent peer crowds such as Punks and Goths are mainly identified by their strikingly unusual or even shocking appearances. Although many studies find these crowds, few have tried to explain why some youths take on these startling or shocking appearances. We hypothesized that an off-putting appearance is a way to cope with behavioral inhibition by limiting social contacts. Using data from 1,200 7th-11th graders, we compared peer crowds characterized by their startling appearance ("Radical" crowds) with three theoretically relevant comparison groups. Results showed that youths affiliating with Radical crowds were more inhibited than other youths, including those in crowds previously shown to be shy or socially anxious. Inhibited Radicals, however, had poorer emotional adjustment than inhibited youths in other crowds. If Radical styles are a way for inhibited youths to cope by limiting social contacts, the strategy does not seem to be beneficial for emotional adjustment.

AB This study examines gender differences in the development of dieting among a representative sample of 1,368 Norwegian boys and girls. The respondents were followed over 3 time points from ages 13/14 to 20/21. Latent growth curve analyses were conducted showing that girls' dieting scores increased while boys' scores remained constant. Gender differences in the development of dieting could be explained neither by differences in the development of appearance dissatisfaction nor by changes in relation to parents. In contrast, the dieting differences between boys and girls could be partially explained by a greater increase in emotional problems among girls compared with boys. Further research is needed, targeting in particular younger age groups, in order to acquire knowledge on whether appearance dissatisfaction serves as mediator of gender differences in dieting at other ages.

AB The aim of this randomized, controlled study was to evaluate whether cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT-AN/BN) are effective in adolescents suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). 50 female patients (12.4-21.0 years) participated in the study. 19 patients received CBT for 25 weeks, and 16 patients were given DBT-AN/ BN for the same period. 15 patients were assigned to a 3-month waiting control group (WCG). At the end of the treatment 42.1 % of the CBT group, 37.5 % of the DBT-AN/BN group, and all patients of the WCG still fulfilled the criteria of an eating disorder according to DSM-lV Compared to the WCG, CBT as well as DBT-AN/BN led to a reduction in caloric avoidance, enhanced meal frequency, and improved current psychological distress as well as an augmentation of BMI. Only small positive effects were seen regarding body image distortion, autonomy development, emotion regulation, and perfectionism.

AB The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders as reported by epidemiological studies has been rising in the last years. In the USA and other countries the overall estimate of prevalence of typical autism was three per 10 000 in the 70ies and above 30 per 10 000 in the 90ies of the last century. The objective of this paper was to review results of surveys on the prevalence of autism and to discuss if methodological factors are responsible for its increase. We found that change in diagnostic criteria, better case identification, increasing awareness among parents, teachers and professionals and higher treatment rates accounts for the majority of this increase. However it remains a rest that might warrant further explanation. In conclusion a real increase in autism cannot be ruled out. Possible explanations are the increasing rate of preterm births and prenatal environmental factors, A survey on autism in Germany could contribute to define the public health burden and future care needs in this country.

AB Emotion discrimination deficits represent a well-established finding in schizophrenia. Although imaging studies addressed the cerebral dysfunctions underlying emotion perception in adult patients, the question of trait vs state characteristics is still unresolved. The investigation of juvenile patients offers the advantage of studying schizophrenia at an age where influences of illness course and long-term medication are minimized. This may enable a more detailed characterization of emotion discrimination impairments and their cerebral correlates with respect to their appearance and exact nature. A total of 12 juvenile patients with early onset schizophrenia and matched healthy juveniles participated in this study. fMRI data were acquired during an emotion discrimination task consisting of standardized photographs of faces displaying happy, sad, angry, fearful, or neutral facial expression. Similar to findings in adult patients, juvenile patients exhibited reduced performance specificity whereas sensitivity was unaffected. Independent of the valence, their processing of emotional faces was associated with hypoactivations in both fusiform gyri and in the left inferior occipital gyrus. In addition, hyperactivations in patients were found in the right cuneus common to happy, angry, and fearful faces. Further, most distinct changes were present in juvenile patients when processing sad faces. These results point to a dysfunction in cerebral circuits relevant for emotion processing already prominent in adolescent schizophrenia patients. Regions affected by a decrease in activation are related to visual and face processing, similar to deficits reported in adult patients. These changes are accompanied by hyperactivations in areas related to emotion regulation and attribution, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms.

AB In order to test its short- and middle-term impact as well as differential gender effects the Universal school-based "Verhaltenstraining fur Schulanfanger", a German prevention program on antisocial behavior for elementary school students, was conducted and evaluated in Luxembourg. In a quasi-experimental setting, nine first grade classes (n = 88) were assigned to intervention and control groups. Three waves of data (pretest, posttest and 12-months-follow up) including teacher and student assessments were analysed. As a result intervention effects in terms of significant reductions in oppositional defiant and aggressive behavior as well as an increase in social and emotional competencies according to teachers' assessments at 12-months-follow-up could be observed. Student interviews showed positive short-term effects in terms of increased emotional knowledge and social problem solving competencies at Posttest, with girls showing a stronger improvement of their emotional knowledge than boys.

AB Schools and kindergartens are particularly suitable for the implementation of violence prevention programs. Many German schools and kindergartens have securely established the violence prevention curriculum Faustlos. The Faustlos programs for kindergartens and elementary schools are now complemented with the version for middle schools. As the kindergarten- and elementary school versions the middle school program too focuses on the theoretically profound, age group-tailored promotion of empathy, impulse control and anger management. These dimensions are subdivided into the five themes "understanding the problem", "traming for empathy", "anger management", "problem solving" and "applying skills" and taught step-wise, highly structured and based on several video sequences in 31 lessons. US-American evaluation studies proof the effectiveness and the violence prevention potential of the program. With the curriculum for middle schools a comprehensive Faustlos program package is now made available to sustainably promote core violence prevention competences of children and adolescents on a developmentally appropriate level and with a consistent didactic approach.

AB Compared to the general population children and adolescents in stationary youth welfare service show higher prevalence of mental disorders. Object of the recent study was to record mental impact and gender differences in adolescents living in accommodations of the welfare youth service using a dimensional approach. The survey was realized in all stationary welfare services in the area of Bad Doberan/Germany. 42 adolescents answered Achenbach's Youth Self Report and their teachers the Teachers Report Form for mental problems. In Self Report 57% of the adolescents showed clinical relevant disorders. Girls were significantly more impaired in internal characteristics than boys. The registration of mental disorders by dimensional method confirms the high prevalence. But an adequate local psychiatric-psychotherapeutic care and therapy is rare. The results argue for a stronger integration of children and adolescent psychiatry and youth welfare system.

AB Aim: To investigate the effects of age, gender, prenatal/perinatal factors, and maternal psychological distress on childhood emotional/behavioral problems, and the gender difference in the patterns of comorbid emotional/behavioral problems.
   Methods: The sample included 1391 children aged 4-9 in Taipei using a multi-stage sampling method. Their mothers completed questionnaires including demographics, prenatal/perinatal variables, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Chinese Health Questionnaire. The linear and non-linear mixed model was used for data analysis.
   Results: Boys scored higher on externalizing problems, and girls scored higher on internalizing problems. Gender also modified the comorbid patterns of emotional/behavioral problems. Aggressive behaviors decreased, but attention and thought problems increased with age. Prenatal/perinatal exposure to alcohol and coffee, vaginal bleeding, and gestational diabetes, low birthweight, and postnatal incubation and resuscitation, and maternal psychological distress predicted the risk for several childhood emotional/behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Prenatal/perinatal and maternal care, and gender-specific measures are important for prevention of childhood emotional/behavioral problems.

AB Coparenting is a multidimensional construct which describes parents' collaboration in child rearing. Since the 1980's, coparenting became an important field of research in American developmental psychology. This article summarizes different conceptualizations of coparenting and integrates them in a coparenting framework which includes the dimensions "cooperation", "conflict", "undermining" and "triangulation". Furthermore, this paper summarizes methods for assessing coparenting, current research findings about the relation between coparenting, marriage quality, parenting style, and parents' characteristics, as well as the impact of coparenting on the social and emotional adjustment of children and adolescents. Conclusions are stated regarding the need for further conceptual and empirical work, as well as regarding practical implications of research on coparenting.

AB This prospective population-based study aimed to compare associations between depressive feelings and smoking behaviour of adolescents with and without asthma. Data were collected from a two-wave 22-24 months prospective study among 5938 adolescents who completed self-report questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses showed that depressive feelings and smoking were related both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Smoking behaviour was similar for adolescents with and without asthma, as well as its correlation with depressive feelings. However, participants with asthma were more likely to report depressive feelings than those without asthma, implying an indirect relationship between asthma and smoking behaviour. Implications for prevention are addressed.

AB The rich research literature on psychotherapies for children, adolescents, and adults has identified several interventions that can ameliorate or effect significant change in psychiatric disorders and a variety of social, behavioral, and emotional problems and can enhance medical outcomes and recovery. After decades of psychotherapy research and thousands of studies, there is no evidence-based explanation of how or why even the most well-studied interventions produce change, that is, the mechanisms through which treatments operate. This article discusses central requirements for demonstrating mediators and mechanisms of change. Also presented are promising lines of work to identify mediators and mechanisms, ways of bringing to bear multiple types of evidence, recommendations to make progress in understanding how therapy works, and conceptual and research challenges in evaluating mediators and mechanisms.

AB Purpose: Changes in emotion-cognition relationships in later life comprise a pattern of both vulnerabilities and strengths. To integrate this pattern of diversity, I propose a neo-Piagetian extension of the concepts of equilibrium and disequilibrium processes to the relationship beyond cognition to encompass emotional activation and arousal, and beyond youth to the full life span.
   Content: Beginning with a simple, Cannon-type equilibrium based on the response to increasing deviation from ideal end states of correcting through tension reduction, a more complex model is outlined that additionally uses tension amplification aimed at enlargement of the range over which stability is maintained, i.e., permits processes of developmental progression. Parallel to cognitive development, emotional development is described as the emergence of more complex cognitive-affective structures out of original automatic, biologically based ones. In that process, tension thresholds are raised, and the functional range over which equilibrium can be maintained is widened, as higher-order representations become part of the regulatory network. These progressive movements provide well automated emotion regulation whose effectiveness increases well into middle and late life.
   Conclusions: In contrast to development, aging is ultimately characterized by a lowering of tension thresholds similar to developmental regression. However, as in the purely intellectual realm, that process is offset by the previous automatization and crystallization of cognitive-affective schemas becomes evident only as a result of increasing constraints on fluid capacities, as in advancing age and/or high load of cognitive effort and/or emotional activation.

AB The main research question of this study is whether children's emotional responses to specific stress-evoking situations (anger or anxiety) and the coping strategies they would use are related. Furthermore, it is asked if these relationships are consistent over a specific age range. A total sample of 432 second graders participated in a longitudinal study with repeated measurements at grades 3, 4 and 5. The children were presented with four short descriptions of everyday stressors. They were requested to indicate the intensity of their feelings of anger and anxiety, and to assess the coping strategies they would use in each of the four situations. The results show that anxiety is related to the use of seeking social support, palliative coping, and avoidant coping, whereas anger is associated to externalizing emotional coping. Problem solving appears to be unrelated to the experience of both anxiety and anger. This structure proved to be invariant for grades 2, 3, 4 and 5, and thus may be generalized for the focused age range. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed.

AB Systematic research about the continuity of mental health problems from childhood to adolescence is limited, but necessary to design effective prevention and intervention strategies. We used a population-based representative sample of Greek adolescents, followed-up from birth to the age of 18 years, to assess early influences on and the persistence of mental health problems in youth. We examined the role of peripartum, early development and parental characteristics in predicting mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Results suggest a strong relationship between behavioural problems in childhood and adolescence for both genders, while emotional problems were more likely to persist in boys. Age and sex-specific models revealed significant positive associations between higher scores on the behavioural and emotional problems scales and higher frequency of accidents in preschool years, physical punishment in early childhood, lack of parental interest in child's school and activities, and perceived maternal stress in all children. Perceived paternal stress was associated with higher scores on the Total and Internalizing problems scales in the total population. Our results suggest that early interventions are necessary as mental health problems strongly persist from childhood to late adolescence. The adverse effects of parental stress and poor care-giving practices on child's psychopathology need to be recognised and improved.

AB During the last decade, a growing number of educational psychology experts, along with academic performance, stress the importance of developing the child's social and emotional skills through schooling. Research indicates that social and emotional competencies can be learned through school-based curriculum activities (Social and Emotional Learning, SEL). Such programs seem to be an effective approach to reducing problem behaviors and emotional distress, while at the same time promoting positive social adjustment and enhancing the academic performance of students.
   This paper brings a broad overview of existing programs and represents an attempt to classify SEL programs implemented in different countries (primarily in American schools) in the last 10 years. Since the primary goal is to raise interest and increase understanding in experts from education and psychology in order to encourage implementation of such programs in Croatia, the paper gives a critical insight into the conditions in which SEL programs are developed, implemented and evaluated.

AB The Parent Rating Scale for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is part of the Diagnostic System for Mental Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence (DISYPS-II) and is based on the international classification systems ICD-10 and DSM-IV. It includes 20 items representing symptom criteria from ICD-10 and DSM-IV, as well as 6 competence items. This study analyses the prevalence rates of symptoms and diagnoses, reliability and factorial validity, correlations with other behavioral and emotional symptoms, comorbidity rates and effects of age and gender based on parent ratings according to this questionnaire.
   Methods: Ratings according to this questionnaire were performed by N = 713 parents of children and adolescents aged 4.0 to 17.11 years.
   Results: Prevalence rates of the symptoms varied between 4.5% and 22.3%. Using the symptom criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10, prevalence rates of the diagnosis of ADHD were 11.5% according to DSM-IV and 3.4% according to ICD-10. Addition of the functional impairment criterion reduces the prevalence rates to 7.9% (DSM-IV), and 3.0% (ICD-10), respectively. The respective reliability of the subscales Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, the total score, and the competence scale was satisfactory to very good. The explanatory factor analyses show a factor structure according to DSM-IV with an inattention factor and a hyperactivity/impulsivity factor, but also a structure according to ICD-10, with separate inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity factors. Most of the scales showed significant effects of age and gender. Moderate correlations between ADHD ratings and parent ratings of other behavioral and emotion problems were found, with comorbidity rates between 7% and 39%.
   Conclusions: The prevalence rates are comparable to those found in other international studies. The Parent Rating Scale for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders is an internally consistent and valid instrument for use in the examined age group. By presenting the norms, the scale can be a helpful tool in practical application.

AB Scholars are giving increased attention to the need to incorporate research on more basic developmental processes into new paradigms for understanding and treating mental illness in children. and adolescents. The study of emotion regulation, rooted in neurodevelopment, has proven a fruitful model for understanding and characterizing problems of behavior and risk in children and adolescents. This article summarizes NIMH initiatives designed to encourage transformational research on the neurodevelopment origins of mental illness. It highlights the NIMH Strategic Plan. and the Report on Transformative Neurodevelopment Research as part of an introduction to a collection of articles that grew out of a previously organized NIMH workshop on developmental and translational models of emotion regulation and dysregulation.

AB There is a gap, between scientific knowledge about typical and atypical emotional development and efforts to identify and serve children's mental health needs. The gap can be bridged with research that integrates clinical perspectives into the study of emotional development. This h; illustrated in the current study by discussing typical emotional development in early childhood and how it differs from the atypical features Of emotion seen among preschool-aged children with depression. New research directions are suggested that integrate the study of typical emotional development with. clinical evidence of risk for and presence of affective disorders in young children.

AB Clinical depression is a significant mental health problem, that is associated with personal suffering and impaired functioning. These effects underscore the continuing need for new approaches that cart inform researchers and clinicians when designing interventions. The present article proposes that. individual differences in the self-regulation of sadness and distress provide air important link between stress, depressed mood, and the onset of depressive disorder, and that a better understanding of the ways children successfully manage dysphoric emotions will lead to improved prevention and treatment of pediatric depression. After examining the normative development of responses that children use to attenuate sadness, aspects of the neurobiological infrastructure that both enable and constrain such self-regulatory efforts, and affect regulation of children at familial risk for depressive disorders, this article concludes by calling for integrated, developmental, multidisciplinary studies of sadness self-regulation.

AB The major aim of this review is to propose new ways of thinking about the role of parents in the development and course of children's relationally aggressive behavior. An important theoretical framework from which to start thinking about linkages between parenting and relational aggression is provided by attachment theory. Attachment theory proposes that early family experiences are an important basis for the development of later peer relationships. Recent studies are only beginning to suggest possible linkages between children's parental attachment and relational aggression. One possible reason for the scant research is that theoreticians studying these constructs have not yet developed a conceptual framework combining the two, but rather have focused on different characteristics of different interpersonal contexts. Based on the premise that both relational aggression and attachment are relational constructs and given the already established correlations between insecure attachment and physical aggression, this paper will attempt to devise a heuristic model that may serve as an aid to discover links between parent-child interactions, attachment, and relational aggression. Finally, implications for future studies of relational aggression are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB Background Reliable information on the prevalence of mental health problems in children and adolescents in the general population in Germany is scarce. With the German health and examination survey for children and adolescents (KiGGS) data is available for the first time on psychopathological problems for the complete age range from 3 to 17 years. Objectives To estimate prevalence rates for several groups with broadly defined psychopathology and to report distributions of psychopathological problems for total and fine-grained subgroups according to age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), migration of children and adolescents from 3 to 17 years. Methods The strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) parent version was completed for 14,478 children and adolescents from 3 to 17 years. Data was collected from May 2003 to May 2006 from 167 representative sample points all over Germany. Prevalence rates of SDQ scales were calculated. Effects of age, gender, socio-economic status and migration status were determined. Results A total of 18.5% of the boys and girls were classified as 'borderline or abnormal' in the total difficulties score and thus determined as risk group for public health policies. Analyses of Variance showed significant effects for age and gender, SES and migration status. Significant interactions between age and gender were found for the total difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention and the emotional symptoms scores; significant interaction between SES and migration status was found for the prosocial behaviour score. Conclusions Prevalence rates of psychopathological problems in children and adolescents are in line with other published findings. Younger age, lower SES and migration are related to more psychopathological problems. While girls display more emotional problems, boys have more externalizing problems.

AB Background The consideration of impairment plays a crucial role in detecting significant mental health problems in children whose symptoms do not meet diagnostic criteria. The assessment of impairment may be particularly relevant when only short screening instruments are applied in epidemiological surveys. Furthermore, differences between childrens' and parents' perceptions of present impairment and impairing symptoms are of interest with respect to treatment-seeking behaviour. Objectives The objectives were to assess parent-and self-reported impairment due to mental health problems in a representative sample of children and adolescents; to describe the characteristics of highly impaired children with normal symptom scores; and to investigate the associations between symptoms in different problem areas and impairment. Methods The mental health module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (the BELLA study) examined mental health in a representative sub-sample of 2,863 families with children aged 7-17. Self-reported and parent-reported symptoms of mental health problems and associated impairment were identified by the extended version of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) in children 11 years and older. Results Considerable levels of distress and functional impairment were found with 14.1% of the boys and 9.9% of the girls being severely impaired according to the parental reports. However, self-reported data shows a reversed gender-difference as well as lower levels of severe impairment (6.1% in boys; 10.0% in girls). Six percent of the sampled children suffer from pronounced impairment due to mental health problems but were not detected by screening for overall symptoms. Childrens' and parents' reports differed in regard to the association between reported symptom scores and associated impairment with children reporting higher impairment due to emotional problems. Conclusions The assessment of impairment caused by mental health problems provides important information beyond the knowledge of symptoms and helps to identify an otherwise undetected high risk group. In the assessment of impairment, gender-specific issues have to be taken into account. Regarding the systematic differences between childrens' and parents' reports in the assessment of impairment, the child's perspective should be given special attention.

AB Background There is a lack of representative prevalence rates for attention deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to DSM-IV criteria and hyperkinetic disorder (HD) according to ICD-10 criteria for German subjects. Objective To report the results of analyses of categorical data on the prevalence rates of the symptoms of ADHD/HD and additional diagnostic criteria, as well as of the diagnoses of ADHD and HD according to symptoms and other diagnostic criteria, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Further, to report administrative prevalence rates of the diagnosis and rates of coexisting behavioural and emotional problems. Method Within the BELLA module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a representative sample of parents of 2,452 children and adolescents aged 7 17 years completed an ADHD symptom checklist (FBB-HKS/ADHS) and additional questionnaires for the assessment of coexisting behavioural and emotional problems. Results The prevalence rates for the diagnoses of ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria were 5.0% and the rate for HD according to ICD-10 criteria was 1.0%. Higher prevalence rates were found in boys and in younger children. The addition of other diagnostic criteria (impairment, pervasiveness, onset, duration) resulted in a significant decrease of the prevalence rates of ADHD and HD to 2.2 and 0.6%, respectively. Higher prevalence rates were found in families of lower socioeconomic status and families from urban areas. The lifetime administrative prevalence rate was 6.5%. Children with ADHD had an increased risk for coexisting behavioural and emotional problems, especially for aggressive and antisocial behaviour problems, but also for anxiety and mood problems. Conclusion The results of the national sample are in line with community studies in other countries. The effects of the additional diagnostic criteria of impairment, situational pervasiveness, symptom onset and symptom duration on the prevalence rates have to be considered in other epidemiological studies.

AB We examined the role of emotion regulation (ER) in improving sibling relationship quality (SRQ) by evaluating the More Fun With Sisters and Brothers Program where 4- to 8-year-old siblings from 95 families were taught emotional and social competencies. Parents reported on SRQ and ER, and sibling interactions were observed in homes. SRQ and ER improved for program participants (n = 55) in comparison to those in a wait list condition (n = 40). Children participating in the program needed less parental direction to control negative emotions and refrain from directing negative actions toward others following the program. Higher levels of ER were linked with more positive SRQ at posttest. Results highlight the value of strengthening children's emotion regulation processes as a mechanism for promoting prosocial sibling relationships.

AB Back,ground. Most studies of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents have been conducted in Western Countries. This study was designed to examine depressive symptoms and age and gender differences in children and adolescents in China.
   Methods: Participants consisted of two community samples of children and adolescents (n1 = 4858, n2 = 1362) in Shandong, China. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF) and Youth Self Report (YSR) were used to assess depressive symptoms.
   Results: Using American norms, the prevalence rates of depression in Chinese children and adolescents were 5.9% with self report, 0.9% with parent report, and 0.8% with teacher report. Self and teach er-reported depressive symptoms were significantly increased with age for both boys and girls. Compared with American norms, self-reported depressive scores were significantly higher in Chinese adolescents, while parent and teacher-reported scores were significantly lower in Chinese children.
   Limitations: Our study lacks clinical assessment of depressive symptoms and the study is comprised of two separate samples where parent and teacher reports and youth reports could not be compared directly.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of self-reported depressive symptoms in Chinese children and adolescents are Much higher than those reported by either parents or teachers. Depressive symptoms are increased with age but (to not differ between boys and girls. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sexual minority adolescents appear to be at increased risk for internalizing disorders relative to their heterosexual peers, but there is a paucity of research explaining this elevated risk. Emotion regulation deficits are increasingly understood as important predictors of internalizing psychopathology among general samples of adolescents. The present study sought to examine whether deficits in emotion regulation could account for disparities in internalizing symptoms between sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents.
   The present study utilized longitudinal data from a racially/ethnically diverse (68% non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino) community sample of 1,071 middle school students (ages 11-14).
   Adolescents who endorsed same-sex attraction evidenced higher rates of internalizing symptoms at both time points. Structural equation modeling indicated that sexual minority adolescents exhibited greater deficits in emotion regulation (rumination and poor emotional awareness) than their heterosexual peers. Emotion regulation deficits in turn mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   The results demonstrate the importance of considering normative psychological processes in the development of internalizing symptomatology among sexual minority adolescents, and suggest emotion regulation deficits as specific targets of prevention and intervention efforts with this population. Future studies are needed to determine whether stigma-related stressors are responsible for emotion regulation deficits among sexual minority youth.

AB We examined how adolescents' and mothers' perceptions of cognitive and interpersonal functions of collaboration surrounding Type I diabetes differed and how they related to adolescent age, psychosocial, and diabetes adjustment. Adolescents (M = 14.16 years) and mothers completed questionnaires assessing the functions of collaboration for the adolescent, quality of the mother-adolescent relationship, emotional adjustment, and adherence to the diabetes regimen. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of perceptions of collaboration confirmed three dimensions: collaboration to compensate for cognitive function, interpersonal enjoyment, and frequency of collaboration. Although adolescents' and mothers' views of interpersonal enjoyment and frequency of collaboration converged, their perceptions of compensation were unrelated. Mothers' perceptions of adolescents' compensation were unrelated to perceptions of enjoyment and frequency. Both adolescents and mothers perceived less compensation and less enjoyment of collaboration with increasing adolescent age, but only adolescents reported collaborating less frequently with higher age. Better emotional adjustment and adherence occurred when mothers and adolescents perceived enjoying collaboration (controlling for mothers' acceptance) regardless of age. Enjoying collaboration at an interpersonal level may be an important avenue for successful diabetes management during adolescence.

AB This study examined emotion socialization practices in families of children with an anxiety disorder (AD; n = 28) and of children who had no diagnoses (ND; n = 28) and considered gender differences. Youth (aged 8-13) and both parents discussed times when the child felt anxious, angry, and happy, for 5 min each. Fathers of AD children engaged in less explanatory discussion of emotion overall and exhibited less positive affect and more negative affect when interacting with sons than did fathers of ND children. Similar patterns emerged for mothers, although specific results varied by emotion type and child gender. Children with an AD demonstrated less positive affect overall and engaged in fewer problem-solving emotion regulation strategies when discussing anxious and angry situations than did children in the ND group. In both AD and ND groups, fathers appeared to have greater involvement in emotion-related discussions with sons versus daughters. The results highlight parents' contributions to the emotional development of their children, the ways in which socialization may go awry in families of AD children, and the implications for children's emotional functioning.

AB This study aimed to contribute to the dimensional approach to personality pathology by addressing the applicability of a personality pathology questionnaire, originally developed for adults, in adolescent samples. The psychometric properties of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire for Adolescents (DAPP-BQ-A) were studied in two samples including 170 adolescents referred for mental health services and 1,628 nonreferred adolescents, respectively. Factor analysis resulted in a strong replication of the original structure, retaining four factors (Emotional Dysregulation, Dissocial Behavior, Inhibitedness, and Compulsivity), which could be further organized into a two-dimensional structure with factors identifiable as Internalizing and Externalizing, suggesting a possible link between personality and psychopathology. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability proved to be satisfactory for all lower-order dimensions, with the exception of Intimacy Problems. Several of these dimensions showed considerable promise in differentiating nonreferred adolescents, referred adolescents without and referred adolescents with a personality disorder. The present findings underscore the need for a developmental perspective on personality pathology. Promising aspects of the dimensional approach to personality pathology in adolescence are discussed.

AB A commonly accepted prerequisite for adaptive emotion regulation is emotion awareness, which refers to an attentional process (e.g. to monitor and differentiate emotions, locate their antecedents) but also includes attitudinal aspects (e.g. how are emotions and their expression valued?). In this study, the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire for children (Rieffe, Meerum Terwogt, Petrides, et al., 2007), developed to measure the key aspects of emotion awareness, was improved conceptually and shortened to a 30-item version. First, the former scale Acting Out (the blunt expression of emotions) previously failed to uniquely contribute to the prediction of internalising symptoms and was therefore replaced by the scale Not Hiding (the tendency not to keep one's emotion experiences hidden from others), which is theoretically more relevant to internalising symptoms. Second, items that did not load on the intended factor were omitted from the questionnaire. The outcomes from a sample of 665 children and young adolescents showed good psychometric properties and good criterion validity with the related measure for emotional self-efficacy, the TEIQue. Additionally, good concurrent validity was established with respect to common internalising problems during childhood and adolescence: somatic complaints, social anxiety, depression and a tendency for non-productive thinking (worry and rumination).

AB The current study examined how affect dysregulation, as indexed via within-person negative mood variability, related to longitudinal patterns of smoking among adolescents. Students in the 8th and 10th grades (N = 517, 56% girls) provided data on cigarette use at baseline, 6-, and 12-month waves and provided ecological momentary assessments of negative moods via palmtop computers for 1 week at each wave. Mood variability was examined via the intraindividual standard deviations of negative mood reports at each wave. As predicted, high levels of negative mood variability at baseline significantly differentiated participants who escalated in their smoking behavior over time from participants who never progressed beyond low levels of experimentation during the course of the study. Mixed-effects regression models revealed that participants who escalated in their smoking experienced a reduction in mood variability as smoking increased, whereas participants with consistently high or low levels of cigarette use had more stable mood variability levels. Results suggest that high negative mood variability is a risk factor for future smoking escalation and that mood-stabilizing effects may reinforce and maintain daily cigarette use among youths.

AB Despite living in disadvantaged urban communities experiencing social and economic hardships, many children emerge with positive outcomes. Social-emotional competence and social support were hypothesized to have strong influences on academic trajectories during the critical period of academic skill acquisition. Participants were 282 third-grade students from six elementary schools in a Northwestern urban community. Beyond the importance of prior levels of academic competence, considerable variance in end-of-year academic outcomes was predicted by initial levels of academic social-emotional competence and improvements in social-emotional competence and perceived teacher support over the course of the year. Noteworthy is that findings were strongest for African-American students, but methodological caveats regarding research with underachieving minority youth were discussed. The findings suggest that school psychologists and others designing interventions to improve achievement of disadvantaged students should address social-emotional competencies and classroom climate, especially teacher support of students.

AB In this study, long-term intellectual functioning and school-related behavioural outcomes were assessed in a patient sample that underwent invasive treatment for congenital heart disease (ConHD) between 1990 and 1995. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised was used to measure intellectual functioning and the Teacher's Report Form to assess teacher-reported behavioural and emotional problems. Overall, patients had IQ scores that fell within the normal range. The total sample of ConHD children (N = 117, 7-16 years old), however, obtained significantly lower mean scores on Verbal IQ and Verbal Comprehension than reference children. When compared with same-aged reference peers from the general population, 7-11-year-old ConHD children obtained significantly lower mean scores on Total IQ, Verbal IQ, Verbal Comprehension, and Perceptual Organization. In contrast, scores of 12-16-year-old ConHD children appeared to be significantly lower on Verbal Comprehension only and significantly higher on Performance IQ. No significant differences were found in intellectual functioning between ConHD boys and girls, nor between different diagnostic groups. The school-related behavioural and emotional adjustment of this sample of children with treated ConHD was favourable. Overall, this sample of recently treated ConHD children, and especially children aged 7-11 years, showed poorer intellectual functioning in several areas. These findings deserve further attention.

AB The current study examined whether adolescents' attachment representations were associated with differences in emotion regulation during the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; C. George, N. Kaplan, & M. Main, 1996) and during a mother-adolescent conflict interaction task (Family Interaction Task [FIT]; J. P. Allen et al., 2003). Participants were one hundred and fifty-six 14-year-old adolescents. Dismissing adolescents showed less interbeat interval (IBI) reactivity (indicating less stress) during the AAI than secure adolescents. However, during the FIT, dismissing adolescents showed more IBI reactivity. No differences in physiological reactivity were found between individuals with resolved or unresolved loss or trauma during the AAI or FIT. The results indicate that dismissing adolescents may effectively use a defensive strategy during the AAI but less so in direct conflict interaction with their attachment figure.

AB This investigation examined the associations between maltreatment and aggression using a gender-informed approach. Peer ratings, peer nominations, and counselor reports of aggression were collected on 211 maltreated and 199 nonmaltreated inner-city youth (M age = 9.9 years) during a summer day camp. Maltreatment was associated with aggressive conduct; however, these effects were qualified by gender, maltreatment subtype, and the form of aggression under investigation. Findings revealed that maltreatment was associated with physical aggression for boys and relational aggression for girls. Physical abuse was associated with physically aggressive behaviors, but sexual abuse predicted relational aggression for girls only. Findings suggest that investigating the interaction between familial risk and gender is important in understanding aggressive behaviors of boys and girls.

AB The authors examined regulation of the discrete emotions anger and sadness in adolescents through older adults in the context of describing everyday problem situations. The results support previous work; in comparison to younger age groups, older adults reported that they experienced less anger and reported that they used more passive and fewer proactive emotion-regulation strategies in interpersonal situations. The experience of anger partially mediated age differences in the use of proactive emotion regulation. This suggests that at least part of the reason why older adults use fewer proactive emotion-regulation strategies is their decreased experience of anger. Results are discussed in the context of lifespan theories of emotional development.

AB Objective: The present study examines if there is an increase of behavioral and emotional disorders after stroke in childhood.
   Method: 111 children who suffered a stroke aged 3 to 18 were examined. The CBCL/4-18, a parent questionnaire, was analysed to assess the child's competencies as well as behavioral and emotional problems. Differences in means were analysed according to the date of stroke, sex, affected hemisphere and child's intelligence.
   Results: Children tend to develop more behavioral problems due to stroke. Especially, there is an increase of social and attention deficiencies. Furthermore the children show an increase of school-based problems. More problems in behavior and temperament can be found in patients with perinatal stroke and stroke in childhood than children with stroke in infancy.
   Conclusions: This study emphasises the importance of comprehensive psychological diagnostics and multi professional intervention at an early stage to prevent stable psychological or psychiatric disorders after stroke in childhood.

AB Objective: To assess whether differences between individual Preventive Child Health Care (PCH) professionals in the percentage of children they identify as having psychosocial problems are larger than expected based on chance and whether such differences can be explained by differences in parent-reported problems or risk indicators.
   Study Design: We used data from three community-based studies among 3,170 Dutch children aged 8 till 12 years, invited for a routine health examination. Parents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and questions on demographic characteristics. After the examination, PCH professionals registered whether they had identified any psychosocial problem in the child. We examined differences between professionals in the rate of identified children. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to assess whether such differences could be explained by parent-reported problems or risk indicators.
   Results: Significant differences between PCH professionals were found (P < 0.001). These differences could not be explained by parent-reported problems or risk indicators. The differences were largest for children with a score above the CBCL clinical cut-off point.
   Conclusion: Some PCH professionals are more likely to identify psychosocial problems than others, independently from parentreported problems or other risk indicators. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The role of aggression in adaptation to family and community violence was examined in a sample of 667 inner-city schoolchildren studied annually over three years in middle school. Regression analysed indicated that the association between year 1 exposure to family and community violence and year 2 aggression was mediated by aggression occuring contemporaneously with Year 1 exposure. Cognitive justification of aggression and friends' delinquency made small independent contributions to prediction of Year 2 aggression, delinquency, and externalizing behaviors. Year 2 aggression mediated the association between Year 1 community violence victimization and Year 3 negative adaptation (internalizing problems, anxiety and depression). Year 2 aggression also mediated the negative association between Year 1 witnessing community violence and Year 3 positive adaptation (self-esteem). Cognitive justification of aggression and friends' delinquency made independent contributions to year 3 negative adaptation. The pattern of relations among variables infrequently varied by gender. Implications for intervention are discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The goals of this study are to evaluate the impact of a distressed environment on self-esteem in Jamaican adolescent girls and to assess the impact of behavioural patterns on self-esteem. Participants were African-Jamaicans ages 13-17 years from a Place of Safety (experimental group) and local high schools (control group). All participants completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) while the experimental group also completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Participants in the experimental group were classified as either internalizers (depressed, anxious and somatizing), externalizers (exhibiting aggressive, disruptive behaviours), both (externalizers and internalizers) or other (reporting no or very few symptoms). It was hypothesized that the participants residing in the Place of Safety would report lower levels of self esteem in comparison to the control group. Secondly, the 'both' group would report lower levels of self-esteem than any other group. Results indicated no differences in self-esteem scores; however, statistical significance was found between 'externalizers' and 'both' groups (p =0.006). This study challenges the assumptions of self-esteem and its relationship to behavioural and emotional problems.

AB Context: From the time of school entry, chronic levels of victimization by one's peers predict a multitude of psychiatric and physical health problems. However, developmental trajectories of peer victimization, from the time children first begin to socially interact, are not currently known nor are early familial or child predictors.
   Objectives: To describe preschool trajectories of peer victimization, assess continuity of preschool victimization after school entry, and examine early child- and family-level predictors of preschool trajectories of victimization.
   Design: A longitudinal, large-scale, multiple-informant, population-based study.
   Setting: Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development.
   Participants: One thousand nine hundred seventy children (51% boys).
   Main Outcome Measures: Developmental trajectories were described using mothers' reports of peer victimization at 4 times from 31/3 to 61/6 years of age. In first grade (mean age, 7.2 years), teacher and child reports of peer victimization were collected. Family-level predictors, mostly at age 17 months, included measurements of family adversity (insufficient income [ when the infant was aged 5 months], single-parent family, low education, or teenaged mother) and harsh, reactive parenting. Child-level predictors at age 17 months were the mother's ratings of physical aggression, hyperactivity, and emotional problems.
   Results: Three preschool trajectories of peer victimization were identified (low/increasing, moderate/increasing, and high/chronic). In first grade, children following high/chronic and moderate/increasing preschool trajectories were highest in teacher- and child- rated peer victimization. High levels of harsh, reactive parenting predicted high/chronic peer victimization over and above other child- and family-level variables. Insufficient parent income and child physical aggression predicted the high/chronic and moderate/increasing peer-victimization trajectories.
   Conclusions: Early childhood preventive interventions should target parenting skills and child behaviors, particularly within families with insufficient income. Together, these risks confer a heightened likelihood for continued peer victimization as rated by mothers, teachers, and the children themselves.

LA English
DT Article
DE Maltreatment risk; Self-regulation; Maladjustment
ID EMOTION DYSREGULATION; CHILDHOOD; ATTENTION; IMPACT
AB objective: The present project examined the relationships among early Maternal maltreatment risk, children's self-regulation, and later development. It was expected that early maltreatment risk would impact children's emerging self-regulation which in turn, would foster pre-academic delays and behavioral problems.
   Method: The project used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between early maltreatment risk in 169 primiparous adolescent mothers and the subsequent development of their children in pre-academic and behavioral domains at 5 years of age. Maltreatment risk was assessed by two evaluation tools: (1) a multi-measure index of parenting attitudes, abuse potential, and knowledge and expectations about child development, and (2) an abbreviated version of the multi-measure index consisting of only 12 items. In addition, cognitive and emotional regulation at age 3, as assessed by maternal reports of regulatory behaviors and a newly created observational measure, was evaluated as a potential mediator of development at 5.
   Results: Findings revealed that maternal maltreatment risk was associated with lower levels of children's regulation, which in turn significantly predicted pre-academic skills and behavior problems. Incorporating direct paths from maltreatment risk to each of the children's Outcomes did not significantly improve model fit indices.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that self-regulation was a key process variable in the relationship between maltreatment risk and children's development. The findings support targeting self-regulatory abilities to halt the progression of developmental difficulties often found in maltreated children.
   Practice implications: The present Study identified self-regulation as a mechanism for transmitting the effects of maltreatment risk to multiple domains of children's functioning: these findings have important implications for intervention programs. Intervention programs that focus on fostering self-regulation in home and preschool settings should enhance developmental Outcomes. Previous research has shown the utility of targeting self-regulation in reducing the frequency and intensity of students' anger (Beck, R., & Fernandez, E. (1998). Cognitive-behavioral self-regulation of the frequency, duration, and intensity of anger. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 20, 217-229.). Within the context of maltreatment intervention, these programs have considerable utility. By tailoring programs to strengthen dysfunctional regulation processes common to maltreated children, cognitive and behavioral functioning should be enhanced. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the past decade, the living conditions of hearing impaired children have been changing due to new technologies and mainstreaming in schools. The majority of population-based studies in deaf pupils were conducted before these changes started to take place. The present study aimed to evaluate the current situation regarding aspects of mental health and, for the first time, quality of life in a representative sample of deaf pupils. The sample stems from a population of 145,000 pupils attending the first to ninth grades during the school years 2003-2005 in Upper Austria. From 186 children with bilateral hearing impairment of at least 40 dB registered at the centre for special education for children with sensory impairments, 99 with a performance IQ above 70 were included in the present study. Parents and teachers completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), while parents and children were administered the inventory for the assessment of the quality of life in children and adolescents (ILC). Results indicated that deaf children scored significantly higher on the SDQ than their counterparts from normative samples according to both parent and teacher ratings. Differences were most marked with regard to conduct problems, emotional problems, and peer problems, and less marked for hyperactivity/inattention. While parents of deaf children had a generally positive view of their children's quality of life, deaf children provided a more complex picture, stressing areas of dissatisfaction. Mental health and quality of life were found to be unrelated to the child's degree of deafness.

AB The longitudinal relationships between depression, anxiety, conduct problems, and inattention were investigated. The present study attempted to overcome the methodological limitations of prior research on childhood co-occurring syndromes by using continuous measures of constructs, controlling for multiple symptoms at baseline, and considering the role of age and gender. Using a community sample of 6-11 year-old children, we found evidence of homotypic and heterotypic continuity in baseline characteristics and their symptoms 5 years later. Notably, inattention and conduct problems were stable over time regardless of age or gender. Additionally, inattention predicted subsequent depression, a relationship unaffected by overlapping psychopathology. With attention problems considered, conduct problems did not predict future depression as others have predicted. Instead, depression in young children was a unique risk factor for subsequent conduct problems. Similarly, most other relationships were moderated by age or gender. The implications for understanding childhood psychopathology and for designing prevention and treatment programs are discussed.

AB The Current Study investigated associations between the frequency of and motivations for social withdrawal during adolescence and emotional distresses in young adulthood. Perceived motivations for social withdrawal included unsociability, isolation, shyness, and low mood. Social withdrawal during adolescence was assessed using a retrospective questionnaire completed by Australian and Korean university students. They also completed measures of general self-worth, social relationships, loneliness, social anxiety, and depression at University. Partial correlations and path analyses revealed that different motivations for social withdrawal had different risk status for later adjustment across the two samples. In particular, it appeared that shy and unsociable individuals in Korea showed better social and emotional adjustment than their counterparts in Australia. In contrast, social relationships of sad/depressed and isolated respondents in Korea appeared to be more seriously impaired than their Australian counterparts. These cross-cultural differences are discussed in terms of socio-cultural values and environments unique to the two countries. (C) 2007 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Amongst adults, low emotion identification skill (EIS) relates to poor emotion regulation strategies, higher rates of anxiety and depression, and higher rates of somatic illness and disease [Taylor, G. J., & Bagby, R. M. (2004). New trends in alexithymia research. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 73, 68-77]. Little research has examined EIS in adolescence and, in particular, the longitudinal impact of EIS on social support and affective experience. Six hundred and sixty-seven high school students completed measures of EIS, social support and positive and negative affects in Grade 8, and again in Grade 9. Repeated measure ANOVAS revealed that negative affect increased and positive affect decreased from Grades 8 to 9. Structural equation modelling revealed that low EIS predicted increases in fear, decreases in positive affect, and decreases in the quality and quantity of social support. Amongst boys, low EIS also predicted increases in sadness. We discuss the implications of these findings for early prevention programmes.

AB This article examines data for 8,484 transition-aged youth (TAY) in different age groups who received services in 45 federally funded systems of care between 1997 and 2006. Data from the national evaluation of these systems of care were used to compare descriptive and clinical characteristics at intake of TAY aged 14-15, 16-17, and 18 years, and service use and outcomes of TAY aged 14-15 and 16-17 at 6 and 12 months after system of care intake. Few studies have examined outcomes of TAY. The large national evaluation database provides a unique opportunity to examine outcomes for TAY in relation to increases in age. Results revealed differences in severity and type of behavioral and emotional problems, living situations, access to Medicaid, service use, and outcomes among younger and older youth. Findings support the need to enhance access to services for older TAY and to customize services to the unique needs of each age group.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychotropic medication utilization over the course of treatment for children and adolescents admitted to a large residential group-home facility for youth with emotional and behavioral disorders.
   Method: Retrospective analyses of psychotropic medication utilization at admission, during treatment, and at departure were examined for 1,010 children and adolescents consecutively admitted to the facility during 2001-2004. The relationship between psychotropic medication utilization and demographic variables, psychiatric diagnoses, objective measures of behavioral and emotional problems, in-program behavior, and ratings of program success were examined.
   Results: The overall utilization rate was 49%, and there was a significant reduction in utilization from admission (40%) to departure (26%). Reductions were evident across all medication classes (e. g., stimulants, antipsychotics, etc.). At admission, medication utilization was related to several psychosocial variables, higher scores on measures of behavioral and emotional problems, and psychiatric diagnoses (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mood disorders). A small percentage (16%) of youth was prescribed novel medication during stay. Being placed on medication during treatment was related to internalizing problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at admission, psychiatric diagnoses, higher rates of in-program behavior problems, and poorer outcomes at departure. Youth departing on medication were more likely to be male, younger, and rated as doing more poorly in the program. They also were more likely to be placed in more restrictive settings at follow-up.
   Conclusions: There was a high rate of psychotropic medication utilization among this population, though utilization rates dropped significantly over the course of treatment.

AB Objective: Medical comorbidity is common among children with anxiety disorders; however, little is known about the impact of such comorbidity on mental and functional health outcomes. Even less is known about these problems in high-risk samples of youth. Method: Participants in this study were youth with at least one anxiety disorder with a physical illness (N = 77) or without a physical illness (N = 73), as well as youth with at least one physical illness (but no anxiety disorder) (N = 438). These youth were recruited as part of the Patterns of Care study in which the original set of participants (N = 1715) were randomly sampled from one of five public sectors of care (e.g.,juvenile justice, child welfare, mental health, alcohol and substance use services, school services for children with serious emotional disturbance) in San Diego County. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with a structured interview and three standardized measures were used to assess child health, emotional, and behavior functioning. Results: At least half of children with anxiety disorders had a comorbid physical illness. Allergies and asthma were the most common comorbid physical illnesses. Children with anxiety disorders who had a comorbid physical illness exhibited greater levels of emotional problems, more somatic complaints, and more functional impairment than anxious children without a physical illness as well as than children with physical illness alone. Parents of children in the comorbid group also reported greater caregiver strain than the other two groups. Conclusions: Children with anxiety disorders have high rates of chronic illnesses such as asthma and allergies. These children experience considerable impairment and likely have unique needs that may complicate usual care.

AB As well as verbal disputes and physical aggression, relationship conflict between couples may take a non-verbal non-physical form. Little research exists on this aspect of couple conflict especially in the context of families with children. This qualitative exploratory study was designed to begin addressing this gap and to provide a foundation for the development of a psychometric measure. We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with parents in order to ascertain their perspective on non-verbal non-physical conflict. Five main themes identified through thematic analysis were: behavioural change as a marker of silent conflict, lack of resolution, avoidance and withdrawal, costs of silent conflict, and advantages of silent conflict. Participants reported emotional and physical effects and negative spill over to their interactions with children, as parents became impatient and preoccupied. Despite these high costs, parents cited emotional regulation, de-escalation and the possibility of concealment of discord from children as perceived benefits of silent conflict. The complexity of silent conflict is discussed in view of the recent findings of its impact on young people (Pryor & Pattison 2007).

AB This paper examines the families of intrafamilial adolescent sex offenders attending a community-based treatment program. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to measure family functioning before and after 12 months of treatment. Families were characterised as disorganised, uncommunicative and adversarial Most of the young offenders, many of whom were themselves victims of abuse, came from step, blended or foster families. Seventy-four percent had no, or minimal, contact with at least one biological parent. Conflicts between family members were rarely resolved satisfactorily. After treatment, interviewees reported better family communication and fewer conflicts; there were also significant improvements on a measure of family functioning. Adolescents and their parents reported improvements in self-control, social skills and emotional regulation. Improvements were more likely when at least one parent was engaged in treatment. These findings emphasise the need for treatment to target parents as well as the adolescent offender when intrafamilial sexual abuse occurs.

AB Background Children with Autistic Disorder (AD) evidence more co-occurring maladaptive behaviours than their typically developing peers and peers with intellectual disability because of other aetiologies. The present study investigated the prevalence of Clinically Significant maladaptive behaviours during early childhood and identified at-risk subgroups of young children with AD.
   Method Parents rated their child's maladaptive behaviours on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) in 169 children with AD aged 1.5 to 5.8 years.
   Results One-third of young children with AD had a CBCL Total Problems score in the Clinically Significant range. The highest percentage of Clinically Significant scores were in the Withdrawal, Attention, and Aggression CBCL syndrome scales. There was a high degree of co-morbidity of Clinically Significant maladaptive behaviours. Several subject characteristic risk factors for maladaptive behaviours were identified.
   Conclusions Findings highlight the need to include behavioural management strategies aimed at increasing social engagement, sustained attention and decreasing aggressive behaviour in comprehensive intervention programmes for young children with AD.

AB Background Little is known about the factors affecting the risk of behavioural and emotional problems in young people with severe intellectual disability (ID), although such evidence as there is suggests that there may be differences between the pattern of risk factors in this group and those that operate in general population samples of the same age.
   Method From a sample of 111 children with severe ID who had been initially identified from the registers of six special schools at 4-11 years, 82 were traced and reassessed on average 5 years 4 months later. The relationships between potential risk factors and behaviour problems, reported here for 11:00-17:04 year olds, were assessed by means of parental interview conducted in the family home.
   Results Behaviour problems were associated with the severity of ID and the severity of autistic symptomatology. Perhaps surprisingly, they were also more common in pre-pubertal than post-pubertal adolescents. Family factors such as a history of interrupted/disrupted maternal care, parental criticism of the child and aggressive parental disciplinary practices were also associated with behaviour problems, although the direction of causation was unclear. Several factors, including gender, social disadvantage and epilepsy, well established as risk factors in children without ID, were not significantly associated with behaviour problems in the present sample.
   Conclusion The findings suggest that the pattern of factors associated with behaviour problems in children with severe ID differs from that found both in the general population and in children with mild ID.

AB Due to changes in state and federal policies, as well as logistical and fiscal limitations, researchers must increasingly rely on teachers' reports of school climate dimensions in order to investigate the developmental impact of these dimensions, and to evaluate efforts to enhance the impact of school environments on the development of young adolescents. Teachers' climate ratings exhibited a robust dimensional structure, high levels of internal consistency, and moderate levels of stability over 1-and 2-year time spans. Teachers' climate ratings were also found to be related consistently with students' ratings. In three large-scale samples of schools, teachers' climate ratings were associated significantly and consistently with students' performance on standardized tests of academic achievement, and with indexes of their academic, behavioral, and socio-emotional adjustment.

AB Background Promotion of physical activity (PA) is at the top of the public health agenda. However, there are few longitudinal studies investigating the relationship between PA and children's mental health. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between self-reported physical activity (PA) and emotional problems I-year later in a cohort of schoolchildren. Methods A total of 1,446 children aged 11-14 years from 39 schools in the North West of England completed a self-report questionnaire in class. Each child reported the total number of sessions of sporting activities (lasting more than 20 min) in which they participated during the previous week, including activities both in school and out of school. This total was averaged for the week in order to determine whether the child was physically active at recommended levels (1 h per day). Childhood emotional problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (self-report) at baseline and I-year later. Data on potential confounders were also collected by self-report questionnaire at baseline. Results In unadjusted analyses, children who, on average, participated in at least I h of sporting activity on a daily basis had fewer emotional problems at 1-year follow-up. This attenuated substantially after adjustment for gender (girls were less active but more likely to report emotional problems than boys). After adjustment for additional confounders including emotional problems at baseline, children who met recommended levels for PA had, on average, a score on the emotional problems sub-scale that was 0.29 units lower (-0.29 (95%CI: -0.61, 0.022)) at 1 year follow-up compared to children who did not undertake recommended levels of PA. Children who were physical activity also had higher scores on the hyperactivity sub-scale of the SDQ I year later, but there was no evidence to support an association between PA and other behavioural problems. Conclusions Children who met recommended levels for PA had fewer emotional problems I-year later, although the magnitude of this difference was reduced after adjustment for confounders, particularly gender. Future longitudinal studies need to record both PA and emotional problems at more frequent intervals in order to enable us to determine the effect of maintaining a physically active lifestyle on adolescent mental health outcomes.

AB Objective: This research is a descriptive field study, conducted in order to investigate the relationship between attachment style and mental health in adolescence and was to evaluate the effects of parent's attitude on attachment style. Methods: Sociodemographic data form, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, Relationship Scale Questionnaire was applied to 384 adolescents, between 11-15 years through face to face interviews. The mental capacity of all participants was sufficient enough to maintain the interviews. The parents of all adolescence provided informed consent before the initation of the study. Sociodemographic DataForm, Parental Attitude Research Instrument was applied to adolescence's parents. Results: There was negative correlations between secure attachment style and prosocial behavior, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, conduct problems, total difficulties scores, whereas there was a positive correlation between fearful attachment style and emotional symptoms, total difficulties scores. Significant positive correlations have been found between dismissed attachment style and emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, prosocial behavior, total difficulties scores. Also there was a significant positive correlation between fearful attachment style and oppression and discipline subscales of The Parental Attitude Research Instrument scale and a negative correlation between dismissed attachment style and overeager mother, egalitarianism and democratic attitude subscales. Discussion: The implementation of therapeutic, structured mental support program to adolescences with attachment problems and their families could be beneficial im improving mental status of these individuals.

Participants included 98 children (51 male, 47 female) from a community sample, aged 9-15 at the beginning of the study. Results revealed that child reports of parenting practices were significantly correlated with a greater number of indices of delinquency and conduct problems than were parent reports. Child reports of parenting also showed some association with delinquency at three yearly follow-ups, whereas parent reports did not. Finally, reports of negative parenting from both informants were concurrently related to internalizing characteristics. Implications for child assessment and planning interventions for children and parents are discussed.

AB This study examined the relations among maternal socialization of positive affect (PA), adolescent emotion regulation (ER), and adolescent depressive symptoms. Two hundred early adolescents, 11-13 years old, provided self-reports of ER strategies and depressive symptomatology; their mothers provided self-reports of socialization responses to adolescent PA. One hundred and sixty-three mother-adolescent dyads participated in 2 interaction tasks. Adolescents whose mothers responded in an invalidating or "dampening" manner toward their PA displayed more emotionally dysregulated behaviors and reported using maladaptive ER strategies more frequently. Adolescents whose mothers dampened their PA more frequently during mother-adolescent interactions, and girls whose mothers reported invalidating their PA, reported more depressive symptoms. Adolescent use of maladaptive ER strategies mediated the association between maternal invalidation of PA and early adolescents' concurrent depressive symptoms.

AB An Alarm Stress Task was developed to study affect regulation in the context of parent-child interactions in adolescents (mean age = 12.72, standard deviation = 2.06) with (n = 20) and without (n = 20) mental health problems. Changes in heart rate MR), preejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were used as indicators of affect regulation. HR increased, and PEP and RSA decreased significantly in reaction to a suggested failure on a simple task, indicating that this procedure induced affective arousal in adolescents. During reunion with the parent, RSA increased significantly. Support seeking on reunion was associated with stronger parasympathetic reactivity during stress and reunion, consistent with the model that the parasympathetic system is involved when affect is regulated by social engagement. Quality of parent-adolescent interactive behaviour was overall lower in the clinical sample. Individual and relationship-based processes of affect regulation may be simultaneously assessed, highlighting the continuing importance of the parent-child relationship in adolescence for affect regulation and mental health.

AB Early identification of disease and intervention when necessary are a cornerstone of contemporary medical practice. This approach has been successful in reducing suffering associated with the progression of unchecked medical problems to full-blown disease. Many healthcare systems, in turn, support this approach via routine checkups. The same cannot be said for mental health care. This article evaluates a school-based mental health checkup approach in the context of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. We outline how checkups can identify children with emotional disorders, along with risk factors that, if left unchecked, may contribute to eventual onset. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of this approach.

AB The diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include emotional impairments. However, scientific evidence for these impairments is varied and subtle. In this contribution, recent empirical studies that examined the emotional competence in children and adolescents with ASD are reviewed. Four aspects of emotional competence that are important to children's daily social functioning (expression, perception, responding, and understanding) are discussed, differentiating between mentally retarded and normally intelligent children and adolescents with and without ASD in natural and structured contexts. On various accounts, the emotional impairments of children with ASD that are found in scientific studies provide a more differentiated view on the impairments suggested by the diagnostic literature. Consistent empirical findings and gaps in the field are discussed. Theoretical and clinical recommendations for assessment procedures are suggested. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although use of illicit drugs shows varying degree of heritability, the influence of shared and unique environmental factors predominate among adolescents. We explored factors predicting use of cannabis and other illicit drugs among Finnish adolescent twins.
   Methods: We used longitudinal data from the FinnTwin 12-17 study with baseline at age 11-12 and follow-up at ages 14 and 171/2, including 4138 individuals. The outcome was self-reported ever use of cannabis or other illicit drugs at age 171/2. The potential predictors were measures reported by the twins, their parents or teachers. As individual factors we tested smoking, alcohol use, behavioral and emotional problems; as peer factors: number of smoking friends and acquaintances with drug experience; as family factors: parental substance use, socio-economic status and pre-natal exposure to nicotine. We used logistic regression models, controlling for twinship, age and sex, to compute odds ratios (OR) for each potential predictor. To adjust for within-family confounds, we conducted conditional logistic regressions among 246 twin pairs discordant for drug use.
   Results: 13.5% of subjects had initiated use of cannabis or other illicit drugs by age of 171/2. When adjusted for within-family confounds, smoking, drinking, and aggressiveness, as well as smoking and drug use among peers predicted use of illicit drugs. In the final regression model, the significant predictors were female sex, early smoking onset, drinking to intoxication, having smoking peers and acquaintances with drug experience, father's weekly drinking to intoxication, and aggressive behavior among boys. Smoking initiation by age of 12 was the most powerful predictor among individuals (OR = 26, p < 0.001) and within discordant pairs (OR = 22, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Early onset smoking is a powerful predictor for subsequent use of illicit drugs among Finnish adolescents, but the causal nature of this relationship needs to be clarified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This longitudinal study examined the relationship between mental and physical health problems in a sample of high-risk youth served in the public sector.
   Methods: Participants included youth aged 9-18 years at baseline, randomly sampled from one of five public service sectors in San Diego County, California, and youths may have been active to more than one sector. Diagnoses for mood, anxiety, and disruptive disorders based on structured diagnostic interviews were determined at baseline and data regarding health-related problems were interviews were collected 2 years post-baseline.
   Results: Mood and disruptive behavior disorders were related to cumulative health problem incidence. as well as aggregate measures of health problems and severe health problems. In addition mood disorder diagnosis was associated with higher rates of infectious diseases. respiratory problems, and weight problems. Disruptive disorder diagnosis was related to higher rates of risk behavior-related health problems.
   Conclusions: The present work extends the research on the relationship between mental and physical health problems to adolescents served in the public sector, who are at especially high risk for behavioral and emotional problems. Potential mechanisms by which mental health problems may impact health problems are discussed. We suggest the development of effective interagency cooperation between medical and mental health systems to improve the care of youth with comorbid mental and physical disorders.

AB Literature suggests that parent-child attachment and anxiety symptoms are related. One purpose of the present study was to assess whether attachment patterns relate differentially to social anxiety aspects (fear of negative evaluation. social anxiety and distress in new situations, and generalized anxiety and distress). The second purpose was to investigate these links both longitudinally and concurrently in middle childhood. Children (N = 74) completed measures of secure, ambivalent, and avoidant attachments with mothers in grades 3 and 5 and a measure of social anxiety symptoms in grade 5. Longitudinal analyses showed that ambivalent attachment was most consistently related to social anxiety. Concurrent measures of attachment and social anxiety showed that lower attachment security and higher ambivalent attachment were most consistently related to higher social anxiety. Concurrent attachment predicted variance in social anxiety after controlling for earlier attachment. Findings suggest that anxiety interventions might target attachment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: Bullying or being bullied have been demonstrated to be related to a broad spectrum of behavioural, emotional and social problems. The present study aimed at analysing psychosomatic, emotional and behavioural problems among Italian bullies, victims and bully victims.
   Study design: In a cross-sectional study, 565 primary-school children completed self-reported measures for bullying, victimisation and psychosomatic complaints. Teachers rated each child on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results: Within our sample, 11.2% of children were classified as bullies, 7.1% were classified as victims and 10.4% were classified as bully victims. Compared with the students who were not involved in bullying, victims had a higher risk for conduct problems (2.43 (1.18-5.03)), hyperactivity (2.41 (1.05-5.53)) and problems with peers (4.40 (2.08-9.33)). Bully victims had a higher risk for conduct problems (2.41 (1.28-4.54) and hyperactivity (2.58 (1.25-5.32)). Finally, bullies had higher risk for hyperactivity (2.06 (1.01-4.21)). All groups of children also had a higher risk for several psychosomatic symptoms than uninvolved children.
   Conclusions: Children involved in bullying as victims and bully victims had significantly higher risk for psychosomatic problems and psychosocial maladjustment than uninvolved children, whereas bullies manifested the fewest number of adjustment problems. When addressing bullying in a school community, particular care should be devoted to the identification and help of children who are involved as victims or bully victims.

AB BACKGROUND: Anger, a component of negative affect, has previously been associated with increased drug use primarily among white high school-aged students. However, few studies have examined these associations over time, and fewer have examined them among younger adolescents and students of color. Affective factors may play a greater role in drug use for girls relative to boys; yet, little is known regarding differences in associations between affect and drug use by gender.
   METHODS: The current study used data from the control condition (N = 2025) Of a drug and violence preventive intervention trial to examine the association between self-reported anger levels among multiethnic urban adolescents in the sixth grade and their use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana use 1 year later. Potential gender differences were examined as well.
   RESULTS: Multivariate generalized estimating equations models found anger to be significantly associated with increases in smoking, drinking, and marijuana use. There were no significant gender differences found for any of the drug use outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with studies conducted on primarily white high school youth, where anger had a small but significant effect on drug use over time. The findings also suggest that drug prevention programs should include emotion regulation skills, such as anger management, in addition to drug resistance skills.

AB Self-injurious behavior refers to the direct destructive treatment of one's own body performed without suicidal intent. Many methods are observable, and different body parts are harmed, particularly arms and legs. The 6-month prevalence of self-injurious behavior is projected at 4% in the general population. Such behavior most often supports emotional regulation. Traumatic experiences, mental disorders, and general impulsivity facilitate its appearance.

AB The response styles theory (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991) was proposed to explain the insidious relationship between rumination and depression. We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.

AB Recent research in behavior analysis and clinical psychology points to the importance of language processes having to do with the control of negative cognition and emotion and the commitment to valued action. Efforts to control unwanted thoughts and feelings, also referred to as experiential avoidance (EA), appear to be associated with a diverse array of psychological and behavioral difficulties. Recent research shows that interventions that reduce EA and help people to identify and commit to the pursuit of valued directions are beneficial for ameliorating diverse problems in living. These developments have the potential to improve the efficacy of many preventive interventions. This paper reviews the basic findings in these areas and points to some ways in which these developments could enhance the impact of preventive interventions.

AB Background Individual differences in personality influence the occurrence, reporting and outcome of mental health problems across the life course, but little is known about the effects on adult psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to examine long range associations between Eysenck's personality dimensions and psychological well-being in midlife. Methods The study sample comprised 1,134 women from the 1946 British birth cohort. Extraversion and neuroticism were assessed using the Maudsley Personality Inventory in adolescence (age 16 years) and early adulthood (age 26). Psychological well-being was assessed at age 52 with a 42-item version of Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale. Analyses were undertaken within a structural equation modelling framework that allowed for an ordinal treatment of well-being and personality items, and latent variable modelling of longitudinal data on emotional adjustment. The contribution of mental health problems in linking personality variations to later well-being was assessed using a summary measure of mental health (emotional adjustment) created from multiple time-point assessments. Results Women who were more socially outgoing (extravert) reported higher wellbeing on all dimensions. Neuroticism was associated with lower well-being on all dimensions. The effect of early neuroticism on midlife well-being was almost entirely mediated through emotional adjustment defined in terms of continuities in psychological/psychiatric distress. The effect of extraversion was not mediated by emotional adjustment, nor attenuated after adjustment for neuroticism. Conclusions Individual differences in extraversion and neuroticism in early adult life influence levels of well-being reported in midlife.

AB Objective: We examined the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems, and associated factors in children and adolescents aged 6-18 years that were reared in orphanages. We aimed to compare these children and adolescents with a notionally representative age-matched sample that were raised by their own families and to identify mental health service needs in orphanages.
   Method: This cross-sectional study included 674 children and adolescents aged 6-18 years that were selected from orphanages using stratified and probability cluster sampling. A socio-demographic information form, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and Youth Self-Report Form (YSR) were used for data collection.
   Results: According to the information provided by coregivers, teachers, and youths, the prevalence of problem behaviors ranged between 18.3% and 47% among those in institutional care versus between 9% and 11% among the notional sample. Among those in institutional care, the prevalence of externalizing problems (21.4%-41.9%) was significantly higher than the prevalence of internalizing problems (6.2%-40.1%). At the syndrome level, the prevalence of social problems (5.7%-11.7%), thought disorders (7.2%-18.4%), and attention problems (7.7%-31.4%) among the youths in institutional care was higher than among the national sample (1.6%-5.8%). Age at first admission, receiving institutional care because of neglect and abuse, moves 2 or more times between institutions, recurrent physical illness, receiving poor quality care, lack of regular contact with parents or relatives, lack of regular contact with teachers and the institutional staff poor problem-solving skills, fatalistic beliefs, tobacco and alcohol use, the feeling of stigmatization, and low-level competency were significantly associated with an increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems. In this representative study, only 2.4% of the children received any mental health care services.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop alternative core models and routine screening for mental health. The training of professionals and development of mental health services for children in institutional care should be a priority.

AB Background
   Convergent evidence implicates white matter abnormalities in bipolar disorder. The cingulum is an important candidate structure for study in bipolar disorder as it provides substantial white matter connections within the corticolimbic neural system that subserves emotional regulation involved in the disorder.
   Aims
   To test the hypothesis that bipolar disorder is associated with abnormal white matter integrity in the cingulum.
   Method
   Fractional anisotropy in the anterior and posterior cingulum was compared between 42 participants with bipolar disorder and 42 healthy participants using diffusion tensor imaging.
   Results
   Fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in the anterior cingulum in the bipolar disorder group compared with the healthy group (P=0.003); however, fractional anisotropy in the posterior cingulum did not differ significantly between groups.
   Conclusions
   Our findings demonstrate abnormalities in the structural integrity of the anterior cingulum in bipolar disorder. They extend evidence that supports involvement of the neural system comprising the anterior cingulate cortex and its corticolimbic gray matter connection sites in bipolar disorder to implicate abnormalities in the white matter connections within the system provided by the cingulum.

AB Recent research has documented the long-term mental health consequences of childhood psychological maltreatment; however, this research is limited in that it typically fails to recognize the qualitative differences of the various behaviors labeled as psychological maltreatment. This study examines the predictive ability of caregiver terrorizing, degradation, ignoring, and isolating during childhood on the selfreported occurrence of anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, and features of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a sample of 256 university students between the ages of 18 and 22. Witnessing violence and childhood physical abuse are included in the analyses. Simultaneous regression analyses reveal that different forms of maltreatment emerge as predictors of the variables of emotional adjustment. Terrorizing predicted anxiety and somatic concerns, ignoring predicted scores of depression and features of BPD, and degradation predicted BPD features only. Findings suggest psychological maltreatment is a multifaceted construct requiring further research to investigate the long-term impact of various subtypes.

AB Psychiatric comorbidity and impaired emotional functioning have been previously reported in adult substance abusers but have been less well documented in adolescents. Thus, we investigated mental health problems and emotion regulation abilities in adolescents and young adults with cannabis dependence. Moreover, we explored the relationships between consumption modalities and affective style. Therefore, 32 cannabis abusers (CA) and 30 healthy controls completed a battery of self-reports measuring depression (BDI-13), anxiety (STAI-Y), alexithymia (TAS20; BVAQ-B), anhedonia (PAS; SAS), and sensation seeking (SSS). The MINI was administered to evaluate cannabis dependence and axis I DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses. A semistructured clinical interview was given to determine psychoactive substance use. Statistical analyses revealed that more than half of the CA reported at least one other nondrug or alcohol comorbid diagnosis. The most common were mood and anxiety disorders. CA subjects scored significantly higher on all affective dimensions except alexithymia total scores; however, they had greater scores for the two subscales measuring the difficulties in identifying feelings. Logistic regressions demonstrated that CA subjects were more likely to experience high levels of trait anxiety, physical anhedonia and sensation seeking than the controls. Various correlations were observed between the affective scores and the substance considered. The amount of substance use and, particularly, the prevalence of polydrug use we observed are alarming. This study demonstrates that cannabis dependence in adolescents and young adults is related to a great psychological distress and specific emotional dimensions and puts emphasis on the importance of substance use prevention as early as middle school.

AB Adolescents with chronic pain report disability, distress and reduced social functioning. A clinical sample of 110 adolescents, with a mean four year history of pain, was investigated for the psychosocial impact of pain on social development. All participants completed a range of self-report measures of pain intensity, disability, distress, social and family functioning. Also completed was the Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire, including its development subscale. The development subscale measures the extent to which adolescents perceive themselves to be ahead or behind their peers on 11 aspects of social development. Three related analyses were undertaken. First, over 50%, of adolescents reported themselves to be less developed than their peers on four or more aspects. The item with the highest endorsement of being ahead compared with peers was "dealing with problems". Second, factor analyses revealed three factors of adolescent social development labelled 'independence', 'emotional adjustment' and 'identity formation'. Third, regression analyses revealed that peer Support had a positive effect on all three factors, disability and anxiety had a negative effect on perceptions of independence, greater family dysfunction had a negative effect on emotional adjustment, and depressive mood had a negative effect on identity formation. Pain intensity had a negative effect on all three factors. Findings suggest that adolescents with chronic pain judge themselves to be less developed than their peers.

AB Mental health issues following sexual assault in young people are common but early intervention may improve outcome. A retrospective case-note review of 58 female patients aged between 13 and 18 attending The Haven Whitechapel, a sexual assault referral centre, demonstrated past emotional problems in 72% of those seen, and current emotional problems in 95% of those being followed up. Fifteen percent were already involved with adolescent mental health services (AMHS). All patients requiring and not already receiving input were referred to AMHS or in-house. Of 23 patients referred to AMHS, eight (35%) were accepted and the patients attended, seven (30%) were accepted but did not attend, six (26%) were declined and the outcome of two referrals was unknown. The prevalence of emotional problems and inconsistent referral outcomes demonstrate a need for closer links with AMHS, clearer referral criteria and improved referral pathways.

AB Friendships containing a child with autism and a friend with typical development ("mixed" friendships, n = 26) and those of children with autism and a friend with a disability ("non-mixed," n = 16) were contrasted with friendships of typically developing subjects and their friends (n = 31). Measures included dyadic interaction samples, and interview and questionnaire data from subjects, friends, and parents. Mixed friendship interactions resembled typical friendships. Participants in mixed friendships were more responsive to one another, had stronger receptive language skills, exhibited greater positive social orientation and cohesion, and demonstrated more complex coordinated play than in the non-mixed dyads. Exposure to typical peers appears to have significant effects on friendship behaviors.

AB Parenting programs have considerable potential to improve the mental health and well-being of children, improve family relationships, and benefit the community at large. However, traditional clinical models of service delivery reach relatively few parents. A public health approach is needed to ensure that more parents benefit and that a societal-level impact is achieved. The Triple P-Positive Parenting Program is a comprehensive, multilevel system of parenting intervention that combines within a single intervention universal and more targeted interventions for high-risk children and their parents. With Triple P, the overarching goal is to enhance the knowledge, skills, and confidence of parents at a whole-of-population level and, in turn, to reduce the prevalence rates of behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. The distinguishing features of the intervention and variables that influence its effective implementation are discussed. Self-regulation is a unifying concept that is applied throughout the entire system (e.g., to interactions between children, parents, service providers, and agencies involved in delivering the intervention). Challenges and future directions for the development of public health approaches to parenting are discussed.

AB The Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP) is a family-focused multilevel prevention program designed for delivery within public middle schools to target parenting factors related to the development of behavior problems in early adolescence. The current study examines the effects of the ATP on the development of youth depressive symptoms across early adolescence in a sample of 106 high-risk youths. Youths were recruited in 6th grade, and selected as high risk based on teacher and parent reports of behavioral or emotional problems. Depression symptoms were based on youth and mother reports in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. Receipt of the family-centered intervention inhibited growth in depressive symptoms in high-risk youths over the 3 yearly assessments compared with symptoms in high-risk youths in the control group. Results support the notion that parental engagement in a program designed to improve parent management practices and parent-adolescent relationships can result in collateral benefits to the youths' depressive symptoms at a critical transition period of social and emotional development.

   INDEXES; CHILDREN; SYMPTOMS; DISASTER; VICTIMIZATION; DYSREGULATION
AB The current study tests a theoretical model illustrating a potential pathway to reactive aggression through exposure to a traumatic event (Hurricane Katrina) in 166 adolescents (61% female, 63% Caucasian) recruited from high schools on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion. The proposed model fits well for both boys and girls; however, results suggest that minority youth in this sample were more likely to experience emotional dysregulation in relation to posttratlmatic stress than Caucasian youth. Further, results indicate that hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, and poorly regulated emotion are associated with reactive aggression even after controlling for proactive aggression. These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services. Researchers examining mental health problems in youth after a significant disaster have traditionally focused on the presence of internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very little empirical attention paid to the incidence of post-disaster externalizing problems such as aggression. Specific types of aggressive responses, particularly those that involve poorly regulated emotion (i.e., reactive aggression), have been shown to be associated with a history of trauma and thus may be especially common following a traumatic event such as a hurricane.

   INSTABILITY; CHILDREN; STABILITY; MOVE; CARE; PERSPECTIVES
AB Objective: To assess evidence for residential mobility in childhood having an adverse association with health outcomes through the life course.
   Methods: A systematic search of medical and social sciences literature was undertaken to identify research defining residential mobility as an independent variable and in which health outcomes were described and objectively measured. Studies were excluded that investigated international migration for asylum or were limited to educational outcomes. Two reviewers assessed each study using quality criteria with particular attention to the consideration of confounders and potential for bias. Data were extracted for analysis using a structured form.
   Results: Twenty-two studies were included for this review. Outcomes identified in association with residential mobility included: higher levels of behavioural and emotional problems; increased teenage pregnancy rates; accelerated initiation of illicit drug use; adolescent depression; reduced continuity of healthcare. Studies assessed as having lower quality were less likely to demonstrate statistically significant effects. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: Residential mobility interacts at neighbourhood, family and individual levels in cumulative and compounding ways with significance for the wellbeing of children. High frequency residential change is potentially a useful marker for the clinical risk of behavioural and emotional problems. The evidence supports the reorientation of health services effectively to engage these residentially mobile children for whom health and psychological needs may be identified. The impact of housing and economic policies on childhood residential mobility should be evaluated considering this evidence.

AB This study examined the contribution of attachment security and emotion regulation (ER) to the explanation of social information processing (SIP) in middle childhood boys with learning disabilities (LD) and without LD matched on age and grade level. Children analyzed four social vignettes using Dodge's SIP model and completed the Kerns security scale and the children's self-control scale. Study results demonstrated major difficulties in SIP, lower attachment security, and less ER in children with LD compared to children without LD. Attachment as well as the interaction between attachment and ER. emerged as important contributors to most SIP steps, suggesting that children with higher security who also have better ER skills will have better SIP capabilities along the different steps, beyond group inclusion. Results were discussed in terms of practical and clinical implications regarding the importance of mother-child attachment and ER skills for social cognitive capabilities in children with LD.

AB OBJECTIVE. Recent studies have noted personality differences among adult survivors of very preterm birth, including higher neuroticism and cautiousness and lower extraversion. We attempted to replicate and extend these recent studies by examining personality characteristics across multiple components of personality that traditionally define personality structure in a birth cohort of young adults born at extremely low birth weight (501 - 1000 g), the smallest and most at- risk infants.
   PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. We assessed 71 (76% of the original birth cohort) extremely low birth weight and 83 (74% of the original cohort) term normal birth weight young adults by using well- validated personality measures, indexing 4 traditional components of personality: temperament (Cheek and Buss shyness and sociability and Eysenck neuroticism and extraversion), motivation (Carver and White behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation), cognitive and affective (Coopersmith self- esteem and University of California, Los Angeles, loneliness), and socialization (Eysenck psychoticism and lie). All of the participants were right- handed and free of neurosensory and psychiatric impairments.
   RESULTS. Extremely low birth weight adults reported significantly higher shyness, behavioral inhibition, and socialization (a measure of prosocial behavior defined by risk aversion and adherence to societal mores) and lower sociability and emotional well- being than their normal birth weight counterparts, replicating and extending the findings of previous studies.
   CONCLUSIONS. Young adults who were born at extremely low birth weight and without major impairments are more cautious, shy, and risk aversive and less extraverted than their normal birth weight counterparts, possibly placing them at risk for future psychiatric and emotional problems.

AB The link between individual personality traits and risk-taking propensity is well documented. Recent theories suggest that one particular trait, individual differences in self-regulatory control, might also explain engagement in risky activities, with poor self-regulatory competence increasing the likelihood of risk participation (Byrnes, 1998, 2005; Steinberg, 2004, 2005). In the current study, 134 undergraduate students (45 males, 89 females; mean age 20.87 years) completed self-report measures of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), cognitive regulation (Dysexecutive Questionnaire), and risk-taking (Smoking & Drinking Survey, Youth Decision-Making Questionnaire, Benthin Risk Perception Measure). Poor cognitive self-regulation, or executive function, was linked to greater endorsement of risky activities portrayed in hypothetical vignettes (e.g. joy riding, shoplifting), an over-emphasis of the benefits associated with risky activities, and a higher incidence of problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption. In contrast, poor styles of emotion regulation predicted greater participation in risky behaviours such as cigarette smoking, as well as alcohol induced problem behaviours such as fighting and arguing. Assessment of cognitive and emotional regulation may improve understanding of the causes of risky behaviours. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Convergent data from different behavioral studies indicate that children (is well (is adults with ADHD show a primary dysfunction in the recognition of emotional stimuli (facial expression and affective prosody), and an important disabilitv to modulate their emotions, specially the negative ones. Nevertheless, the existing knowledge concerning the emotional dysfunctions in ADHD is limited, and several open questions, most of them concerning the neural basis underlying these dysfunctions, still remain. Conclusions. The present review highlights the need to develop new research in the study of emotional dyfunctions in ADHD using not only behavioral measures, but also cerebral activity measures, and to assess and treat emotional problems in the clinical practice.

AB Prior research has examined the relations between various facets of emotion and psychopathology, with a great deal of recent work highlighting the importance of emotion regulation strategies. Much less attention has been given to the examination of emotion reactivity. This study reports on the development and evaluation of the Emotion Reactivity Scale (ERS), a 21-item self-report measure of emotion sensitivity, intensity, and persistence, among a sample of 87 adolescents and young adults. Factor analysis revealed a single factor of emotion reactivity best characterized the data. The ERS showed strong internal consistency (alpha=.94), convergent and divergent validity via relations with behavioral inhibition/activation and temperament, and criterion-related validity as measured by associations with specific types of psychopathology and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB). Moreover, emotion reactivity statistically mediated the relation between psychopathology and SUB. These findings provide preliminary support for the ERS and suggest that increased emotion reactivity may help explain the association between psychopathology and SITB.

AB Variation in emotional processes may contribute to aggressive and defiant behavior. This study assessed these problem behaviors in a large sample of children and adolescents in relation to the volume of two cortical regions with prominent roles in emotion processing, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One hundred seventeen participants (61 boys, 56 girls), ages 7-17, were recruited from the community. Aggressive and defiant behavior was measured using the parent- and teacher-reported Pediatric Behavior Scale and volumetric measures were generated using structural MRI. Regression analyses indicated a significant sex X ACC volume interaction in predicting aggressive and defiant behavior, without significant results for the vmPFC. Follow-up analyses showed that aggressive and defiant behavior is associated with decreased right ACC volume in boys and a nonsignificant reduction in left ACC volume in girls. These results are consistent with the notion that the right ACC acts as a neuroanatomical correlate of aggression and defiance in boys. The authors discuss this finding in light of its implications for understanding the neural correlates of antisocial behavior.

AB The emphasis on achievements in everyday life on social status and monetary wealth encourages exploration of alternative earnings. Although social recreational gambling for most people is a leisure activity with family, friends and work colleagues, for a group of people the social recreational attributes have become distorted by their absolute quest for winning. Children are introduced to gambling by their parents and participate in gambling pursuits well before their legal age. Two Australian research samples are analysed, a youth sample and an adult sample. The youth sample includes 751 high school students, and explores young people's gambling propensity, attitudes to gambling and reactions to losing money. The adult sample, based on 21 case studies, assesses pathways to excessive gambling. The paper explores whether or not early contact with recreational gambling together with family and friends creates an environment conducive to future gambling problems. The research shows that the adults' gambling had gradually changed from a social recreational activity to an isolating, gambling focused act. This trend was present already among a group of young people, thus social indicators can be identified at an early stage among young people in their gambling propensity, however, the social indicators can also indicate further personal and social problems as excessive gamblers often present a combination of personal, social and emotional problems.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PRACTICAL SCALE; ADOLESCENTS; COMA
AB The aim of this study was to relate discharge King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) category to injury severity and detailed outcome measures obtained in the first year post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). We used a prospective cohort study. Eighty-one children with TBI were studied: 29 had severe, 15 moderate, and 37 mild TBI. The male:female ratio was 1.8:1. The mean age was 11 years 10 months (SD 3.6, range 5-16y). Discharge KOSCHI categories were good (n=34), moderate (n=39), severe (n=6), and unclassifiable (n=2). KOSCHI category correlated strongly with admission Glasgow Coma Score, length of hospital stay, and post-traumatic amnesia. It also correlated significantly with Verbal IQ and Performance IQ (Wechsler); measures of attention; health status (Health Utilities Index [HUI]); health-related quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]); depressive symptoms (Birleson Depression Scale) assessed within 3 months postTBI; and with Verbal IQ, selective attention (map mission), and HUI and PedsQL domains assessed at least 6 months post-TBI discharge. KOSCHI did not correlate with behaviour or executive function. We conclude that the KOSCHI scored at hospital discharge correlates with severity of injury and some cognitive, health status, and HRQL outcomes early after TBI. It is not helpful at predicting later difficulties, or behavioural and emotional problems.

AB Objective To determine the level of behavioral and emotional problems among a sample of Algerian children and adolescents aged 6-18 years living in Algiers. Method A school-based sample of 1,405 children and adolescents was recruited; problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist filled out by parents or surrogates. Results The scores varied with age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Contrary to findings in other samples, most Problem scores increased with age. As found in many other cultures, girls scored higher than boys on the Internalizing scales, but lower on Externalizing scales. Youths from lower socioeconomic families tended to score higher on some Problem scales. But, above all, Algerian children and adolescents had raw scores on all Problem scales much higher than those yielded by most previous cross-cultural studies. Conclusions The high level of problems may be attributable to traumatic environmental factors (terrorism and natural catastrophes), but the lack of data from countries that have similar geographic and cultural environments makes it hard to exclude explanations based on cultural factors.

AB Studies suggest that ethnicity and socioeconomic factors may relate to differences in treatment expectancies and the attributions made for emotional or behavioral problems. We examined ethnic differences in (1) parents' attributions about the causes of adolescent behavioral and emotional problems and (2) treatment expectancies among 236 adolescent participants who enrolled in a 36-week randomized controlled trial for depression. Controlling for education and income, European American parents were more Rely to endorse beliefs reflecting physical causes of depression than African American parents. There were no ethnic differences for beliefs reflecting external, familial, or community factors. Ethnic differences were observed in the treatment expectancies reported by parents, but not adolescents, with African American parents more likely than European Americans and Other minorities to endorse positive expectations for CBT. These findings may have implications for understanding discrepancies in mental health service use.

AB Background: The use of similar standardised measures of psychopathology for population surveys permits cross-cultural comparisons. However, interpretation of findings can be challenging because rating thresholds may differ across cultures. By combining questionnaire and interview data, we explore whether lower questionnaire scores in Norway as compared to Britain reflect genuine differences in child mental health, or simply different reporting thresholds. Methods: Information from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) interview were compared across recent population surveys in Norway and Britain. The Norwegian study (2002-03) had questionnaire data for 6,658 and interview data for 1,024 8-10-year-old children. The British dataset included questionnaire and interview data for 4,898 children of the same age range from two independent surveys (1999 and 2004). Results: Norwegian children had lower SDQ scores on all problem scales (emotional, behavioural, hyperactive and peer relationship) according to parents as well as teachers. DAWBA information showed that the Norwegian prevalence of externalising disorders (behavioural and hyperactivity) was about half that found in Britain, whereas rates of emotional disorders were similar. Norwegian and British children with non-emotional disorders had similar questionnaire scores and rates of problem-recognition by parents and teachers. By contrast, questionnaire scores and problem-recognition were all lower in Norwegian children with emotional disorders. Conclusions: Lower Norwegian questionnaire scores for externalising problems appear to reflect real and substantial differences between the two countries. By contrast, lower questionnaire scores for emotional problems seem to reflect under-reporting/under-recognition by Norwegian adults, and not a genuinely lower prevalence of emotional disorders. This illustrates that cross-cultural differences in psychopathology based only on questionnaire data may be misleading. Nevertheless, careful use of questionnaire and interview data can focus mental health research on cross-cultural variations likely to reflect genuine health differences.

AB Objective: To compare weight concerns and self-reported body mass index (BMI) of low birth weight (LBW) adolescent boys to those of a normative sample and examine relationships among BMI, weight concerns, self-esteem, and depression in the LBW cohort. Methods: LBW boys (n = 260; mean age, 16.0) belong to the Neonatal Brain Hemorrhage Study birth cohort. Normative boys (n = 305; mean age, 16.5) belong to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Both samples were assessed in 2001-2004 with self-report questionnaires. BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Weight perception and weight dissatisfaction were assessed with the Eating Symptoms Inventory. In LBW boys, self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and depression with the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: Based on self-reported height and weight, LBW boys were more likely to be healthy weight or underweight and less likely to be overweight than normative boys. Despite having healthier self-reported BMIs, LBW boys reported more weight concerns than the normative sample. A total of 46.9% of LBW boys perceived their weight as abnormal, and 76.5% desired weight change. Weight concerns in LBW` boys mostly reflected a perception of being underweight (31.2% of the cohort) and a desire to gain weight (47.5% of the cohort), although only 6.5% were clinically underweight. Weight concerns, but not BMI, were related to clinical depression and lower self-esteem. Conclusions: LBW adolescent boys are at high risk of experiencing weight concerns. Weight concerns rather than BMI are associated with emotional problems in LBW boys.

AB Although the relationship between parenting and outcomes for children and adolescents has been examined, differences between maternal and paternal parenting styles have received less attention, particularly in the case of late adolescents. As a result, this article examines the relationship between late adolescents' perceptions of their mothers' and fathers' parenting styles and their own emotional adjustment. Findings of this study suggest that mothers and fathers use different parenting styles for their sons and daughters. It also suggests that different combinations of maternal and paternal parenting (e.g., a permissive father parenting with an authoritarian mother) are related to late adolescents' emotional adjustment, with late adolescents who have at least one authoritative parent showing better adjustment than those who do not have such a parent. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of examining dyadic parent-adolescent relationships, and it suggests that having one authoritative parent may be a protective factor for late adolescents.

AB A growing number of students presenting with nonlethal self-injury has recently captured the attention of school nurses. The purpose of intentional self-harm is aimed at reducing emotional distress. This is not a new phenomenon, but what is alarming is the increasing incidence of self-injurious behavior among adolescents. This behavior is raising many questions for school staff. School nurses, along with guidance department staff, are searching for information and direction needed to address this behavior. School nurses, educated about self-injury, can serve as resources for other school staff members. Prevention strategies for all adolescents can be developed as well as strategies targeted at groups of at-risk adolescents. Because mental health care is critical for the treatment of self-injury, referral and early access to counseling is an important role for school nurses. In addition, a plan that includes educating staff members and parents can be developed. Included in this comprehensive plan is developing a protocol to be used to guide the care of adolescents who self-injure.

AB Despite the consistent documentation of an association between compromised attachment and clinical disorders, there are few empirical studies exploring factors that may mediate this relationship. This study evaluated the potential roles of emotion regulation and social support expectations in linking adult attachment classification and psychiatric impairment in 109 women with a history of childhood abuse and a variety of diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Path analysis confirmed that insecure attachment was associated with psychiatric impairment through the pathways of poor emotion regulation capacities and diminished expectations of support. Results suggest the relevance of attachment theory in understanding the myriad psychiatric outcomes associated with childhood maltreatment and in particular the focal roles that emotion regulation and interpersonal expectations may play.

AB Objective: This study examined the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among adolescents with severe emotional disorders who were involved in multiple service systems. Methods: Sixty-nine adolescents, ages 11-17, and their primary caregivers participated in a system-of-care project in three regions of New Hampshire and were interviewed to determine adolescent trauma exposure, prevalence of PTSD, treatment history, family background, behavioral and emotional problems, functioning, caregiver strain, and strengths and resilience. Results: The rate of current PTSD was 28%, which was underdiagnosed in adolescents' medical records. PTSD was related to gender (42% for girls and 19% for boys; p=.03), history of sexual abuse (61% among youths with sexual abuse and 15% among youths without), chart diagnosis of depression (47% among youths with depression diagnoses and 16% among youths without), and treatment with multiple psychotropic medications (53% among youths prescribed two or more medications and 26% among those prescribed no medication or one medication). Adolescents with PTSD also were more likely to have run away, engaged in self-injurious and delinquent behavior, reported higher anxiety and depression, and functioned worse at school and home than those without PTSD. Conclusions: PTSD is a common but underdiagnosed disorder among adolescents with severe emotional and behavioral disorders who are involved in multiple service systems. Routine screening for trauma exposure and PTSD should be conducted with all adolescents receiving mental health services so that treatment can be provided to those with PTSD.

AB This study examined the factor structure of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in urban inner-city and suburban general population samples of American youth. The SDQ was administered to 4,661 predominantly minority urban youth (mean age = 13.0 years, SD = 2.02) and 937 predominantly Caucasian suburban youth (mean age = 14.0 years, SD = 1.56). The authors examined SDQ factor structure using structural equation modeling techniques. The fit for the 5-factor models in both samples was very good (comparative fit index = .96-97). However, the factor loadings and, correspondingly, the scale reliabilities for most of the SDQ scales (except for Emotional Problems) were low, which suggests poor specificity of the items. Subsequent exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested that a 3-factor structure had a comparable model fit and better internal consistency of the scales. The study concluded that, although the SDQ scales do conform reasonably well to a 5-factor model, the scales are unsatisfactory in other respects and that, in its present form, the instrument has inadequate psychometric characteristics. Future research is needed for further scale development.

AB Although elementary schools provide an opportunity for early identification and treatment of academic and psychological problems, relatively little is known about the types of symptoms being addressed in schools. Latent profile analysis on data from 678 urban first graders yielded 3 classes of children: nonsymptomatic (NS), internalizers and average performers (IAP), and externalizers and low performers (ELP), with different combinations of symptoms. Survival analyses conducted on the children's use of services (in Grades 1-9) indicated that students in the ELP class received mental health and special education services faster than those in the NS class, whereas IAP children were no more likely than NS children to receive services. Findings suggest that staff may be more sensitive to early educational and externalizing problems.

AB Background: Adolescence is a transition period from childhood to adulthood that is often characterized by emotional instability. This period is also a time of increased incidence of anxiety and depression, underscoring the importance of understanding biological substrates of behavioral and emotion regulation during adolescence. Developmental changes in the brain in concert with individual predispositions for anxiety might underlie the increased risk for poor outcomes reported during adolescence. We tested the hypothesis that difficulties in regulating behavior in emotional contexts in adolescents might be due to competition between heightened activity in subcortical emotional processing systems and immature top-down prefrontal systems. Individual differences in emotional reactivity might put some teens at greater risk during this sensitive transition in development.
   Methods: We examined the association between emotion regulation and frontoamygdala circuitry in 60 children, adolescents, and adults with an emotional go-nogo paradigm. We went beyond examining the magnitude of neural activity and focused on neural adaptation within this circuitry across time with functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Adolescents showed exaggerated amygdala activity relative to children and adults. This age-related difference decreased with repeated exposures to the stimuli, and individual differences in self-ratings of anxiety predicted the extent of adaptation or habituation in amygdala. Individuals with higher trait anxiety showed less habituation over repeated exposures. This failure to habituate was associated with less functional connectivity between ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that exaggerated emotional reactivity during adolescence might increase the need for top-down control and put individuals with less control at greater risk for poor outcomes.

AB Dissemination of evidence-based HIV prevention programs for adolescents will be increased if community interventionists are able to distinguish core, essential program elements from optional, discretionary ones. We selected five successful adolescent HIV prevention programs, used a qualitative coding method to identify common processes described in the procedural manuals, and then compared the programs. Nineteen common processes were categorized as structural features, group management strategies, competence building, and addressing developmental challenges of adolescence. All programs shared the same structural features (goal-setting and session agendas), used an active engagement style of group management, and built cognitive competence. Programs varied in attention to developmental challenges, emphasis on behavioral and emotional competence, and group management methods. This qualitative analysis demonstrated that successful HIV programs contain processes not articulated in their developers' theoretical models. By moving from the concrete specifics of branded interventions to identification of core, common processes, we are consistent with the progress of "common factors" research in psychotherapy.

AB Objective: To determine whether adopted adolescents are at excess risk for clinically relevant behavioral and emotional problems.
   Design: We examined whether adopted and non-adopted adolescents differed on quantitative indicators of mental health and the prevalence of childhood disorders and whether differences exist between internationally and domestically placed adoptees.
   Setting: Assessments occurred at the University of Minnesota from December 11, 1998, to June 4, 2004.
   Participants: Adolescents adopted in infancy were systematically ascertained from records of 3 large Minnesota adoption agencies; nonadopted adolescents were ascertained from Minnesota birth records. The final sample included these adolescents with their rearing parents.
   Main Exposure: The main exposure was adoptive status: nonadopted (n = 540), international adoptive placement (n = 514), or domestic adoptive placement (n = 178).
   Outcome Measures: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) clinical assessments based on child and parent reports of attention-deficit/hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, conduct, major depressive, and separation anxiety disorders; teacher reports of psychological health; and contact with mental health professionals.
   Results: Adoptees scored only moderately higher than nonadoptees on quantitative measures of mental health. Nevertheless, being adopted approximately doubled the odds of having contact with a mental health professional (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-2.84) and of having a disruptive behavior disorder (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.72-3.19). Relative to international adoptees, domestic adoptees had higher odds of having an externalizing disorder (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.67-4.04).
   Conclusions: Moderate mean differences in quantitative indicators of mental health can lead to substantial differences in disorder prevalence. Although most adopted adolescents are psychologically healthy, they may be at elevated risk for some externalizing disorders, especially among those domestically placed.

AB What is the best way to help children cope with behavioural and emotional problems? This question has been a focus of concern - to children and the adults who care for them - across many centuries and in cultures around the world. In this article we examine the current state of efforts to help children by means of an array of non-medical interventions designed to alleviate psychological distress, reduce maladaptive behaviour, and/or increase adaptive behaviour. We refer to these interventions, collectively, as 'psychotherapy'. In the article, we will note some accomplishments of the effort to develop effective interventions through clinical research. Then we will note some concerns about these efforts, and suggest ways to address the concerns through an alternate model of intervention development and testing.

DE Parenting; perceptions of parents; adjustments; late adolescents
AB Many studies have established that warm, authoritative parenting is associated with positive adjustment in children and adolescents. Fewer studies, however, have examined the potential mechanisms driving this relationship. The current study explores the effects of late adolescents' positive and negative perceptions of their parents in the association between perceived parenting and late adolescent emotional adjustment (depression, anxiety, and self-esteem). The sample consisted of 151 males and 324 females ranging in age from 18- to 22-years. Data were analysed with structural equation modeling. Results of the study suggested that perceived parenting, positive and negative perceptions of parents, and emotional adjustment as reported by late adolescents all are correlated significantly. The effects of perceived parenting on late adolescents' emotional adjustment, however, were not statistically significant when analysed simultaneously with late adolescents' positive and negative perceptions of parents. Also, the relationship between late adolescents' positive and negative perceptions of parents and late adolescent emotional adjustment became non-significant when examining father relationships. Overall, the importance of considering parenting in the context of parent and adolescents' sex as well as other variables is emphasised.

AB The relations of parenting and temperament (effortful control and anger/frustration) to children's externalizing problems were examined in a 3.8-year longitudinal study of 425 native Chinese children (6-9 years) from Beijing. Children's experience of negative life events and coping efficacy were examined as mediators in the parenting- and temperament-externalizing relations. Parents reported on their own parenting. Parents and teachers rated temperament. Children reported on negative life events and coping efficacy. Parents, teachers, children, or peers rated children's externalizing problems. Authoritative and authoritarian parenting and anger/frustration uniquely predicted externalizing problems. The relation between authoritarian parenting and externalizing was mediated by children's coping efficacy and negative school events. The results suggest there is some cross-cultural universality in the developmental pathways for externalizing problems.

AB Introduction: The objective of this research was to investigate the sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioural and emotional risk factors associated with self-reported major injuries.
   Methods: A case-control study, nested in a two-stage survey, was carried out in two cities of the Distrito Federal, Brazil. Cases were defined as subjects who reported an event resulting in injury or physical harm to the person, about which a hospital was visited or a doctor consulted (major injury), during the period of 6 months preceding the interview. Controls (n = 640) were matched to cases (n = 231) based on sex and neighbourhood. Information on determinants of injuries was collected by self-completed questionnaires and included sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioural and emotional variables. Data analysis used conditional logistic regression models.
   Results: Controlling for social support and pro-social behaviour, adolescents reporting "abnormal" behaviour and emotional problems had more than three times the chance of reporting a major injury compared to "normal" status adolescents (OR = 3.65, 95%Cl = 1.83-7.32).
   Discussion: The findings of this study suggest that preventive strategies, while addressing the broader community and environmental risk factors for injuries, need to address the behavioural and emotional factors associated with these injuries. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Culture influences the acceptability of the overt expression of anger. In many cultures, overt expression of anger is considered legitimate for males but not for females. We explored the implications of anger expression among early adolescents in Cuba, expecting that overt, explosive expression of anger would be particularly maladaptive in a society that is collectivistic by virtue of both its cultural heritage and ideology. Given the sharp gender-role distinctions in traditional Latin American society, we expected to find more overt expression of anger by males. However, the analyses revealed no significant gender differences in anger expression. Overt expression of anger was significantly associated with multiple measures of maladjustment. Evidence that the inhibition of anger is associated with maladjustment was not as consistent, but holding anger in was linked with internalizing difficulties. Sociometric data indicated that early adolescents who demonstrate control of their anger are highly accepted and considered as leaders.

AB This study examined proactive and reactive aggression and their relation to psychosocial adjustment in three samples (N = 767, 368 girls, M age = 10.03) of Chinese school age children. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a two-factor model which distinguished both proactive and reactive aggression fit the data reasonably well, and also fit the data better than a single-factor model in all three samples. The distinction between proactive and reactive aggression was found for both boys and girls. Reactive aggression was more strongly related to reciprocated friendship (negatively), peer victimization, emotion dysregulation, hostile attributions of others' behavior in ambiguous social situations, and self-reported loneliness and social anxiety (positively) than was proactive aggression. Proactive aggression was related to positive outcome expectancies and efficacy beliefs of aggression for boys but not for girls, but the significant gender difference was only found for positive outcome expectancies. The findings suggest that proactive and reactive aggression represent two distinct forms of aggression which are associated with specific adjustment outcomes in Chinese children.

AB Background: All previous longitudinal community studies assessing the continuity of child behavioral/emotional problems were conducted in developed countries. Method: Six hundred and one children randomly selected from a Brazilian birth cohort were evaluated for behavioral/emotional problems through mother interview at 4 and 12 years with the same standard procedure - Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: CBCL Total Problem score presented a medium stability (r = .42) with externalizing problems showing higher stability and more homotypic continuity than internalizing problems. Of the children presenting deviant scores at the age of 4, only 31% remained deviant at the age of 12 (p < .001). A deviant CBCL Total Problem score at 12 years old was predicted by Rule-Breaking Behavior [OR = 7.46, 95% CI 2.76-20.19] and Social Problems [OR = 3.56, 95% CI 1.36-9.30] scores at 4 years of age. Either Rule-Breaking or Aggressive Behavior - externalizing syndromes - were part of the predictors for the three broad-band CBCL scores and six out of the eight CBCL syndromes. Conclusions: Behavioral/emotional problems in preschool children persist moderately up to pre-adolescence in a community sample. Externalizing problems at the age of 4 comprise the developmental history of most behavioral/emotional problems at pre-adolescence.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate parental emotional functioning during the first five years of continuous remission after the end of their child's treatment and to identify predictors of parental emotional functioning.
   Methods: Psychological distress and situation-specific emotional reactions were assessed in 122 mothers and 109 fathers from 130 families. Longitudinal mixed model analyses were performed to investigate to what extent generic and disease-related coping, family functioning and social support were predictive of parental emotional functioning over time.
   Results: Initial elevated levels of distress, disease-related feelings of uncertainty and helplessness returned to normal levels during the first two years after the end of treatment. Being more optimistic about the further course of the child's disease (predictive control) was correlated with lower psychological distress and less negative disease-related feelings, while more passive reaction patterns were correlated with higher psychological distress and more negative disease-related feelings.
   Conclusions: Although in general the parents of children with successfully treated cancer showed adequate emotional resilience, support for these parents should not stop when treatment ends. Parents in need of help can be identified on the basis of their coping abilities. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Despite increased awareness of family responses to chronic illness and disability, there is still a need to understand experiences of well siblings. We begin to address this issue by asking, 'What is it like to have a sibling with juvenile idiopathic arthritis?' (JIA). Eight families with an adolescent diagnosed with JIA participated. Four members of each family, including one healthy sibling, were interviewed and transcripts analyzed using grounded theory. Analysis suggests healthy siblings see their family as different to 'normal' families, forfeit time with peers, share vicariously adverse experiences of their ill sibling, and feel inadequately informed. Such experiences amplify the ambivalent nature of sibling relationships and are possibly felt most strongly during late childhood and early adolescence. Support from extended family can reduce these negative experiences and facilitate social and emotional adjustment which also occurs over time as the children mature. These findings have implications for healthcare professionals and voluntary organizations.

AB Background Research comparing population samples from different time periods to investigate secular changes in adolescents' psychosocial problems have mostly focused on parent and teacher reports. The few studies using self-reports have limitations, such as using only school-based samples or investigating a limited range of problems. Aim We investigated changes from 1993 to 2003 in Dutch 11- to 18-year-old girls' and boys' self-reported emotional and behavioral problems. We also examined whether trends were different for various socio-demographic groups. Method We used the Youth Self-Report (YSR) to assess emotional and behavioral problems, and obtained self-reports of police contact, substance abuse, suicidal ideation and self-harm across two adolescent population samples, assessed in 1993 and 2003. To investigate whether reports were different for the 2 years, we performed analyses of variance on the mean scores, and chi-square analyses on the percentages of deviant-scoring children and children reporting specific problem behaviors for boys and girls separately. Logistic regressions were conducted to investigate interactions of year with various socio-demographic variables. Results For boys, results showed a few small changes, indicating decreases from 1993 to 2003 in self-reported Social Problems, Externalizing, Aggressive Behavior, and Rule-Breaking Behavior. For girls, Thought problems, Somatic Complaints, Internalizing problems, suicidal ideation and self-harm increased. Drunkenness and drug use increased for both boys and girls. There were some differences between socio-demographic groups. Boys from low-SES families and younger adolescent girls experienced most increases. Conclusion We found evidence for some small trends in self-reported problems. For boys, some decreases were seen, regarding mostly behavioral problems, whereas for girls, some increases were seen in emotional and behavioral problems. Changes appeared to have most negatively affected young adolescent girls' functioning.

AB Middle adolescents are exposed to environments riddled with potential adversities which pervade their lives, adding to the challenges inherent in their developmental stage. They spend a significant time in school and therefore it is an appropriate context to foster, enhance, and develop emotional, social, and cognitive resilience competencies. There are limited psychological assessment instruments for the South African population that can be used to appraise the level of resilience modalities in middle adolescents. Our aim was to describe and explore the process of appraising, developing, and enhancing the modalities of resilience through the newly developed Resilience Enhancement Kit and the Resiliency Scale. The research was conducted from a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. The results indicated that there was an increase in the level of resilient functioning after administration of the Resilience Enhancement Kit and it therefore appeared to be successful in enhancing resilience modalities. The Resilience Enhancement Kit and Resiliency Scale could be administered by educational psychologists and teachers to assess and enhance resilience modalities and could be incorporated into the school curriculum.

AB Understanding the links between anger expression by children and adolescents, their health, and their interpersonal interactions is important given the evidence that anger is associated with maladjustment and illness among adults. This review covers: 1) possible origins of the awareness and expression of anger; 2) assessment of anger in children and adolescents, including both self-report and observational approaches; 3) implications of anger expression for interpersonal relationships; and 4) outcomes of anger expression. Dimensions of anger expression found in adults have been corroborated to some extent in child and adolescent data. Reliable and valid measures of these dimensions have been developed. There has been much less research on the correlates of maladaptive anger expression in children or adolescents than in adults. Nevertheless, the current data base provides some confirmation that youth who cope inappropriately with their anger are at risk for problematic interpersonal relationships and negative outcomes in terms of both mental and general health.

AB Short-term and structured cognitive behavioral problem-solving therapy (PST) is a developmentally relevant mode of action for the treatment of emotional problems in young people. This study aimed at testing the efficacy of a problem-solving therapy in treating depression and suicide potential in adolescents and young adults. A total of 46 self-referred high school and university students who were randomly assigned to a problem-solving therapy (n = 27) and a waiting list control (n = 19) conditions completed a controlled cognitive behavioral problem-solving treatment trial. Participants were administered the measures of depression, suicide potential, problem solving, self-esteem and assertiveness. Twenty-two of the 27 participants from the PST condition could be reached after 12-months for follow-up. Participants completed depression and problem-solving measures at follow-up. Results showed that post-treatment depression and suicide risk scores of participants within the PST condition decreased significantly compared to the pre-treatment scores but post-waiting and pre-waiting depression and suicide risk scores of participants within the WLC condition were unchanged. Likewise, post-treatment self-esteem and assertiveness scores of participants within the PST condition increased significantly compared to the pre-treatment scores while post-waiting and pre-waiting self-esteem and assertiveness scores of participants within the WLC condition were unchanged. At post-treatment, 77.8% of the participants in the PST but only 15.8% of those in the WLC condition achieved full or partial recovery according to BDI scores. Similarly, 96.3% of participants in the PST but only 21.1% of those in the WLC condition achieved full or partial recovery according to HDRS scores. The improvements were maintained at 12-months follow-up. Therefore, it is concluded that problem-solving therapy should be considered as a viable option for the treatment of depression and suicide potential in adolescents and young adults.

AB Objective: To examine attentional bias for angry and happy faces in 7- to 12-year-old children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 23) and nonanxious controls (n = 25). Method: Children completed a visual probe task in which pairs of face stimuli were displayed for 500 milliseconds and were replaced by a visual probe in the spatial location of one of the faces. Results: Severely anxious children with GAD showed an attentional bias toward both angry and happy faces. Children with GAD with a milder level of anxiety and nonanxious controls did not show an attentional bias toward emotional faces. Moreover, within the GAD group, attentional bias for angry faces was associated with increased anxiety severity and the presence of social phobia. Conclusions: Biased attention toward threat as a function of increased severity in pediatric GAD may reflect differing threat appraisal processes or emotion regulation strategies.

AB Although the relationship between relational victimization and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence has been established, it is unknown whether it extends into early adulthood. The current retrospective study investigated the relationship between recall of adolescent relational victimization and symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and loneliness in 205 undergraduate students. The effects of gender and perceived social support on these relationships were assessed, as were the psychometric qualities of the Relational Victimization Questionnaire (RVQ). Recalled adolescent relational victimization was related to increased symptoms of depression and social anxiety; neither gender nor perceived social support affected the strength of these relationships. Results indicated that the RVQ has adequate internal consistency and a single factor structure. Implications for psychologists working with adolescents are highlighted.

Furthermore, it seeks to answer questions guided towards emotional expression and regulation in eating disorders, levels of alexithymia, anxiety and depression, as well as the effects of shame and guilt in such disorders. The main objective is a broader comprehension of emotions related to eating disorders in order to aid during intervention and prevention. The idea is to coach the process through an improved understanding of their emotions and thus providing a healthier way to express them.

AB Aims: To assess the occurrence of a wide range of behavioural and emotional problems long-term after invasive treatment for congenital heart disease (ConHD) in infancy and childhood.
   Methods: Parents of 125 ConHD children, aged 7-17, completed the Child Behavior Checklist and 85, 11-17-year-old, ConHD children completed the Youth Self-Report.
   Results: According to parents' reports of problem behaviours; a significant proportion of ConHD children scored in the deviant range (16.9%) compared to the reference group (10.2%). The proportion of ConHD boys scoring in the deviant range according to parents (21.4%) was significantly greater than that in the reference sample (10%). Parents reported significantly higher problems scores for the scales Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, Attention Problems, Internalising and Total Problems compared to the reference group. In contrast, reports of patients were comparable to those of reference peers. No differences were found on the self-reports between problem scores for different cardiac diagnostic groups. Discrepancies between self- and parent-reports were found, indicating that more problems were reported by ConHD patients themselves than by their parents.
   Conclusion: Overall, parents of ConHD patients reported higher levels of behavioural and emotional problems compared to the reference group whereas patients themselves reported no long-term behavioural impairment compared to same-sex reference peers. Assessing behavioural and emotional problems in ConHD patients can be helpful to detect children at risk for developing psychopathology. Especially younger male ConHD patients deserve special attention. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Normal intellectual and personal development can be expected in early-diagnosed and treated PKU patients. Aim of the study was to analyse quality of life and social status, which are important parameters for an overall estimation of success of treatment apart from intellectual outcome in adult PKU patients.
   Methods: 67 patients completed a questionnaire on quality of life and social status. Data was compared to the German census on an age matched control collective.
   Results: Quality of life measured with the Profile of Quality of Life in the Chronically Ill ( PLC) revealed mean values for capacity of performance in the patient group in the same range as in the control collective. The analysis of the social state of PKU patients revealed a tendency towards lower or delayed autonomy, and a low rate of forming normal adult relationships in which to have children. Schooling and professional career corresponded approximately to the control collective.
   Conclusion: Though every chronic disorder must be regarded as restraining, it shows that PKU does not preclude healthy emotional adjustment when the disease is diagnosed early and treated well.

   PROCESSES
AB Adolescence is a key period for the development of brain circuits underlying affective and behavioral regulation. It remains unclear, however, whether and how adolescent brain structure influences day-to-day affective behavior. Because of significant changes in the nature of family relations that also typically occur during adolescence, parent-child interactions provide a meaningful context where affective behavior and its regulation may be assessed. In a sample of 137 early adolescents, we investigated the relationship between aspects of the adolescents' brain structure and their affective behavior as assessed during observation of parent-child interactions. We found a significant positive association between volume of the amygdala and the duration of adolescent aggressive behavior during these interactions. We also found male-specific associations between the volume of prefrontal structures and affective behavior, with decreased leftward anterior paralimbic cortex volume asymmetry associated with increased duration of aggressive behavior, and decreased leftward orbitofrontal cortex volume asymmetry associated with increased reciprocity of dysphoric behavior. These findings suggest that adolescent brain structure is associated with affective behavior and its regulation in the context of family interactions, and that there may be gender differences in the neural mechanisms underlying affective and behavioral regulation during early adolescence. Particularly as adolescence marks a period of rapid brain maturation, our findings have implications for mental health outcomes that may be revealed later along the developmental trajectory.

AB While adolescent alcohol consumption has been asserted to adversely alter brain development, research in human adolescents has not yet provided us with sufficient evidence to support or refute this position. Brain constituents actively developing during adolescence include the prefrontal cortex, limbic system areas, and white matter myelin. These areas serving cognitive, behavioral, and emotional regulation may be particularly vulnerable to adverse alcohol effects. Alternatively, deficits or developmental delays in these structures and their functions may underlie liability to accelerated alcohol use trajectories in adolescence. This review will describe a conceptual framework for considering these relationships and summarize the available studies on the relationships among risk characteristics, alcohol involvement and brain development during this period. The cross-sectional designs and small samples characterizing available studies hamper definitive conclusions. This article will describe some of the opportunities contemporary neuroimaging techniques offer for advancing understanding of adolescent neurodevelopment and alcohol involvement.

AB The study assessed conduct and emotional difficulties in a group of Romanian adoptees at age 11, and serves as a follow-up to assessments made when the children were 6 years old. It was found that there was a significant increase in emotional difficulties, but not conduct problems, for the Romanian sample since age 6. It was also found that emotional difficulty was significantly more prevalent at age I I in the Romanian group than in a within-UK adoptee group. Emotional difficulties in the Romanian adoptee group were found to be significantly and strongly related to previous deprivation-specific problems (disinhibited attachment, cognitive impairment, inattention/overactivity and quasi-autism); however, the presence of such early problems did not account fully for the onset of later emotional problems. Five contrasting hypotheses concerning possible mediators for later onset of emotional difficulties for the Romanian group were examined. No links were found to duration of deprivation or other deprivation-related indices, stresses/difficulties in the postadoption family environment, or educational attainment and self-esteem. There was some evidence that emotion recognition might play a role in the emergence of these problems, but other measures of social competence and theory of mind showed no associations with the onset of emotional problems.

AB Parent and teacher data for 14,990 children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used in multilevel analyses to examine the relationship between ethnicity, children's aggression and emotional problems, and parenting. Using parent and teacher report, relationships between ethnicity and child behavior were present but modest. The association between parental harshness and child aggression differed between ethnic groups and across informants. Using teacher report of outcomes, parental harshness was positively related to child aggression in European Canadian families but negatively related in South Asian Canadian families. For all ethnic groups, parental harshness was positively related to children's aggression when parent report of outcomes was used, but relationships varied in strength across ethnic groups. The relationship of parental harshness with child emotional problems did not differ across groups, irrespective of informant. The results are discussed within the context of an ecological model of parenting.

The authors assessed spirituality and religiosity using both parent and adolescent reports, and social competence and adjustment using multiple measures and data sources. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that parent and adolescent reports of religiosity and spirituality yielded I single religious involvement latent variable that was related to peer group status, academic achievement, emotional regulation, prosocial behavior, antisocial/problem behavior, internalizing behavior, and self-esteem. The consistency of relations between religious involvement and competence may be in part attributable to the collectivist context of religion in West Java, Indonesia, within which people exhibit strong beliefs in Islam and religion permeates daily life.

AB Background: To explore whether social or emotional outcomes for high-risk early adolescent youth that attended an established preventive intervention called the Chicago Child-Parent Center Preschool Program (CPC) are moderated by individual, family and program variations.
   Purpose: Two questions are addressed: (1) Do the effects of CPC preschool participation on early adolescent social and emotional competency vary by sex of child, family risk status, parent education and family structure? (2) Do estimated effects on early adolescent social and emotional competency vary by program length in the preschool and school-age components of the program?
   Programme description: Located in or close to elementary schools in the Chicago public school system, the CPC program provides educational and family-support services to children between the ages of 3 and 9 (preschool to 2nd or 3rd grade). Within a structure of comprehensive services similar to Head Start, the intervention emphasises the acquisition of basic skills in language arts and math through relatively structured but diverse learning experiences that include teacher-directed, whole-class instruction, small-group and individualised activities, and frequent field trips.
   Sample: Data for this investigation were drawn front the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS). The CLS follows a cohort of 1539 disadvantaged, minority children (93% African-American, 7% Latino or Other) who were born in 1980 and attended kindergarten programs within the Chicago Public School System in 1985/86. Out of the full sample of 1539, a Subset of 989 children (64% of the sample) received preschool services front one of Chicago's 20 Child-Parent Center (CPC) programs. An additional set of 550 children (36% of the sample) did not attend CPC preschool and serve as a non-CPC comparison group. The study sample Lire 1378 primarily African-American youth who participated in the CLS and had scores for two or more identifiable social and emotional competency indicators by age 15.
   Design and methods: Follow-up of a non-randomised alternative intervention matched-group cohort at age 15 years. Differential effects were estimated using multiple regression. Program interaction terms (e.g., program x sex or program x parent high school graduate) were added to the basic regression model specification that already included the main effects of each variable included in the interaction.
   Results: Some 12% (or 11 of 92) of the interaction terms for social and emotional outcomes by age 15 were significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 level. The most frequently detected differential effects were for family risk level (high or low) and sex of child.
   Conclusions: Most children appear to benefit equally from participation in the CPC program. The prediction from ecological theory that children experiencing a large number of environmental risk factors (e.g., high family risk status and low parental education levels) are more likely to benefit from program participation was supported.

AB Although Internalized and Externalized problem behaviors are described as separate phenomena at the psychometric and clinical levels, they frequently co-occur. Only few studies, however, have investigated the causes of such covariation. In a sample of 398 twin pairs aged 8-17 drawn from the general population-based Italian Twin Registry, we applied bivariate genetic analyses to parent-rated CBCL/6-18 Internalization and Externalization scores. Covariation of Internalizing and Externalizing problem behaviors was best explained by genetic and common environmental factors, while the influence of unique environmental factors upon covariance appeared negligible. Odds ratio values showed that a borderline/clinical level of Externalization is a robust predictor of co-existing Internalizing problems in the same child, or within a sibship. Our findings help to approximate individual risks (e.g., in clinical practice, predicting the presence of Internalization in an externalizing child, and vice-versa), and to recognize that several shared environmental and genetic factors can simultaneously affect a child's proneness to suffer from both types of problem behaviors.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine uncertainty orientation and its relations with school and psychological adjustment in Chinese children. A sample of elementary school children in P. R. China, aged 10 to 12 years, participated in the study. Data concerning uncertainty orientation, academic performance and socio-emotional adjustment were obtained from multiple sources including projective assessments, teacher ratings and self-reports. It was found that children in grade 6 had higher scores on uncertainty orientation than those in grades 4 and 5. Uncertainty orientation was positively associated with school-related competence, academic achievement and self-perceptions of competence, and negatively associated with learning problems and loneliness. The results suggest that uncertainty orientation is an adaptive characteristic in Chinese children.

AB This study examined the relative contributions of emotion knowledge and teacher-child relational variables to school competence. Seventy-four economically and ethnically diverse preschoolers (40 boys, 34 girls) completed an emotion knowledge task and a standardized school competence measure. Classroom teachers and their assistants rated the children's school competence and reported on the quality of their relationships with each child. After accounting for demographic variables, emotion knowledge was directly associated with children's performance on the standardized school competence measure. However, teacher-reported school competence of the children was predicted by both positive and negative teacher-child relationship variables. The association between teacher-child closeness and teacher-reported school competence was mediated by emotion knowledge. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Around the world, cultural blending and conflict pose challenges for assessment and understanding of psychopathology. Economical, evidence-based, culturally robust assessment is needed for research, for answering public health questions, and for evaluating immigrant, refugee, and minority children. This article applies multicultural perspectives to behavioral, emotional, and social problems assessed on dimensions describing children's functioning, as rated by parents, teachers, children, and others. The development of Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) forms and their applications to multicultural research are presented. A primary aim of both questionnaires is to identify children at high risk of psychiatric disorders and who therefore warrant further assessment. The forms are self-administered or administered by lay interviewers. ASEBA problem items are scored on 6 DSM-oriented scales and 3 broader band scales, plus 8 syndromes derived statistically as taxonomic constructs and supported by uniform confirmatory factor analyses of samples from many populations. Comparisons of ASEBA scale scores, psychometrics, and correlates are available for diverse populations. SDQ forms are scored on one broad-band scale and 5 a priori behavioral dimensions supported by data from various populations. For both instruments, factor analyses, psychometrics, and correlates are available for diverse populations. The willingness and ability of hundreds of thousands of respondents from diverse groups to complete ASEBA and SDQ forms support this approach to multicultural assessment. Although particular items and scales may have differential relevance among groups and additional assessment procedures are needed, comparable results are found in many populations. Scale scores vary more within than between populations, and distributions of scores overlap greatly among different populations. Ratings of children's problems thus indicate more heterogeneity within populations than distinctiveness between populations. Norms from multiple populations can be used to compare children's scores with relevant peer groups. Multicultural dimensional research can advance knowledge by diversifying normative data; by comparing immigrant children with nonimmigrant compatriots and with host country children; by identifying outlier findings for elucidation by emic research; and by fostering efforts to dimensionalize DSM-V diagnostic criteria.

DE anxiety; children; REBT
ID 2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; ADOLESCENTS; SYMPTOMS
AB The purpose of this article is to provide detailed descriptions of specific clinical interventions that can be used by REBT therapists working with children and adolescents who are experiencing difficulties with anxiety. It is worth noting that anxiety disorders are among the most commonly occurring mental and emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. While a majority of publications focus on empirical research, there is still a need for articles that address clinical practices. REBT is, first and foremost, a system devoted to the practice of psychotherapy. Whether it is through articles focused on empirical research or clinical applications, the advancement of REBT is the ultimate goal.
   One of the most efficient anxiety management techniques involves the use of distraction in which clients are encouraged to substitute a calming mental image to interrupt the anxiety producing thoughts. This article also provides a detailed explanation of rational-emotive imagery (REI), which is a technique that employs relaxation prior to clients generating their own rational coping statements. Finally, a progressive thought-stopping technique is examined. In this intervention, the therapist provides successively less direction and guidance in the hopes that clients will be able to master this technique for use independently.

AB This study examined age and gender differences in decoding nonverbal cues in a school population of 606 (pre)adolescents (9-15 years). The focus was on differences in the perceived intensity of several emotions in both basic and non-basic facial expressions. Age differences were found in decoding low intensity and ambiguous faces, but not in basic expressions. Older adolescents indicated more negative meaning in these more subtle and complex facial cues. Girls attributed more anger to both basic and non-basic facial expressions and showed a general negative bias in decoding non-basic facial expressions compared to boys. Findings are interpreted in the light of the development of emotion regulation and the importance for developing relationships.

AB Background/Purpose: Children with congenital heart disease (ConHD) are known to be vulnerable to behavioral and emotional problems. In this study, a historical comparison is made between the level of behavioral and emotional problems in a sample of children and adolescents with ConHD treated recently vs a comparable historical sample operated upon before 1980 in the same institute. The hypothesis was that improvements in medical care would result in more favorable behavioral and emotional outcomes for children and adolescents with ConHD treated recently, that is, between 1990 and 1995, compared with same-aged patients operated on before 1980.
   Methods: To assess behavioral and emotional problems, the Child Behavior Checklist (parent report) and Youth Self-Report were used. The historical samples (n = 98 and n = 123, respectively) and recent samples (n 90 and n = 84, respectively) consisted of 4 diagnostic groups.
   Results: Parents and patients from the recent sample with ConHD reported fairly similar levels of behavioral and emotional problems compared with parents and patients in the historical sample with ConHD.
   Conclusion: Despite evident improvements in diagnostic and surgical techniques and medical treatment of ConHD over the past decades, virtually no changes were found in levels of problem behavior of the recent patient sample compared with the historical patient sample, who both underwent invasive treatment for ConHD.

AB This article describes the Strengthening Communities for Youth (SCY) initiative using data from 1,297 adolescents in eight U.S. cities (Oakland, CA; Tucson, AZ; Iowa City, IA; Bloomington, IL; St. Louis, MO; Cleveland, OH; Louisville, KY, New York, NY) to better understand the pattern of services they received, how these services varied by need, and how services were associated with initial treatment outcomes. Data include adolescent reports collected with the Global Assessment of Individual Needs (GAIN) at treatment intake and 90 days post-intake, information on early therapeutic alliance using a modified Working Alliance Inventory (WAI), and staff reports from service logs. Cluster analysis identified four patterns of treatment received: (1) substance abuse and mental health treatment, (2) primarily residential treatment, (3) interrupted treatment, and (4) primarily outpatient treatment. Outcomes examined included changes in substance use, substance abuse/dependence problems, recovery environment risk, as well as risk from social peers, illegal activity and emotional problems. Overall and for most groups, treatment was associated with reduced or unchanged problems in each of these areas. The exception was for cluster 1, for whom emotional problems actually increased. Implications for placement, treatment planning and future research are discussed.

AB This study describes the extent and severity of multiple comorbidities in a juvenile detention center population, and explores how these numerous problems impact the utilization of treatment services, costs, and outcomes including those for substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal activity. Cluster analyses of the outcome scales at intake yielded two groups: youth high (42%) and youth lower (58%) on all factors. Girls experienced the most significant impairments across emotional problems, behavior complexity, internal mental distress, and victimization domains, utilized significantly more units of residential treatment, individual counseling and case management, and had the highest treatment costs. The total cost of services ($1,171,290, N = 114) was significantly related to substance problems in the past year (r = .219, p <.05), emotional problems (r = .237, p <.05), behavior complexity (r = .318, p <.05), internal mental distress (r = .263,p <.05), environmental risk (r = .205,p <.05), and conflict tactics (r =.240, p <.05). Despite initial differences in measures of baseline severity, high and low cluster youth, and boys and girls in general, achieved similar results on the key outcome variables 12 months later. Study implications include a need for co-occurring, integrated treatment efforts that address family, emotional, and mental health problems of delinquent youth (especially females) in order to improve their ability to successfully attend to substance abuse problems and interpersonal conflicts.

ID ROMANTIC LOVE; SEDUCTION
AB A small computer-assisted word frequency analysis, indicating the extent of explicit concern with sexuality in the psychoanalytic literature, has revealed an apparent decline of psychoanalytic interest in psychosexuality. The apparent decline may be related to the limitations of drive theory and object relations approaches in offering persuasive and comprehensive accounts of the psychosexual. A new model of human sexual experience is proposed, rooted in an integration of French psychoanalytic ideas with recent developmental observational research, that once again places sexuality at the center of psychoanalytic clinical inquiry Because emotion regulation arises out of the mirroring of affect by a primary caregiver and sexual feelings are unique in that they are systematically ignored and left unmirrored by caregivers, sexual feelings remain fundamentally dysregulated in all of us. Adult sexual experience serves as a way of coming to organize the psychosexual. The model accounts for some aspects of the phenomenology of sexual arousal and suggests ways of understanding pathological distortions of sexual behavior. The nature of the psychosexual is explored in the analytic treatment of an adolescent boy.

AB Objective: The goals of this research are to develop and test a prospective model of attention problems in sexually abused children that includes fixed variables (e.g., gender), trauma, and disclosure-related pathways.
   Methods: At Time 1, fixed variables, trauma variables, and stress reactions upon disclosure were assessed in 156 children aged 8-13 years. At the Time 2 follow-up (8-36 months following the initial interview), 56 of the children were assessed for attention problems.
   Results: A path analysis involving a series of hierarchically nested, ordinary least squares multiple regression analyses indicated two direct paths to attention problems including the child's relationship to the perpetrator (beta =.23) and dissociation measured immediately after disclosure (beta =.53), while controlling for concurrent externalizing behavior (beta=.43). Post-traumatic stress symptoms were only indirectly associated with attention problems via dissociation. Taken together, these pathways accounted for approximately 52% of the variance in attention problems and provided an excellent fit to the data.
   Conclusions: Children who report dissociative symptoms upon disclosure of CSA and/or were sexually abused by someone within their family are at an increased risk of developing attention problems.
   Practice implications: Findings from this study indicate that children who experienced sexual abuse at an earlier age, by someone within their family, and/or report symptoms of dissociation during disclosure are especially likely to benefit from intervention. Effective interventions should involve (1) providing emotion regulation and coping skills; and (2) helping children to process traumatic aspects of the abuse to reduce the cyclic nature of traumatic reminders leading to unmanageable stress and dissociation.

AB Background: Observational studies involving atomoxetine hydrochloride in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) complement randomized controlled trials by assessing treatment effects in a usual-care setting and including a more heterogeneous patient population.
   Objective: To provide data on the effectiveness of atomoxetine in a naturalistic treatment setting according to both physician and parent ratings.
   Design and methods: A prospective, observational (non-interventional), longitudinal, open-label study of patients (N = 627; mean age = 11 years) with AND (from 60 physicians' offices in the United States and Puerto Rico) whose physicians had decided to prescribe atomoxetine either as initial treatment or after trying another ADHD treatment (e.g., stimulants, antidepressants). Patients with a baseline visit and one post-baseline visit for up to 1 year were eligible. Atomoxetine administration, dosing, and timing of follow-up visits were at each physician's discretion. Physicians evaluated the effectiveness of atomoxetine using a single-item rating scale: the Physician Global Impression: AND Severity (PGI-ADHD-S) scale.
   Results: The average reported duration of treatment was 21.2 (range 0-89) weeks. Over this period, treatment significantly lowered ADHD severity compared with baseline, with a mean change of -0.91 (95% confidence interval: -1.00 to -0.82; p < 0.001) on the PGI-ADHD-S scale. Physician-rated improvement was more marked in patients with more severe ADHD at baseline (p < 0.001). Most patients (59-69%) experienced consistent symptom control at all times of the day. ADHD severity was improved similarly in patients across comorbid conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, learning disorders), chief complaints (e.g., school problems, emotional problems), and prior treatment with stimulants or other medications. By parent reports, 49% of patients had improved grades following atomoxetine therapy while 35% stayed the same, and improvement in behavior (according to parents' ratings) occurred in 49% of patients following atomoxetine therapy, whereas 31% stayed the same.
   Conclusion: Data captured in this study support the conclusion that atomoxetine was effective in reducing symptom severity, and improving progress toward treatment goals, in children and adolescents with AND treated in a naturalistic treatment setting. However, given the open-label, observational (non-interventional) design of this study, certain biases cannot be excluded.

AB Refugee and migrant adolsescents may be at increased risk for the development of emotional and behavioural problems. Since studies on this topic are rather scarce and results inconsistent, this large-scale screening study aims at investigating the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in recently arrived migrant adolescents in Belgium, compared to Belgian peers. About 1,249 migrant adolescents and 602 Belgian adolescents filled in four self-report questionnaires on the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems, traumatic experiences and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Migrant adolescents experienced more traumatic events than their Belgian peers, and show higher levels of peer problems and avoidance symptoms. On the contrary, non-migrant adolescents reveal more symptoms of anxiety, externalising problems and hyperactivity. Factors influencing the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems are the number of traumatic events experienced, gender and the living situation. Although migrant and non-migrant adolescents don't differ much in the prevalence of emotional and behavioural symptoms, attention should be given to the screening and support of risk groups within the population of migrant adolescents, such as girls, those who experienced a lot of traumatic events and unaccompanied refugee children and adolescents.

AB This paper describes a short-term longitudinal study of the relation between violent victimization in the community and peer rejection among 199 children (mean age = 9.02 years) attending two urban Los Angeles area elementary schools. We used a multi-informant approach to assess victimization by community violence, peer group victimization, peer rejection, and impairments in emotion regulation. These data were collected annually for two consecutive school years. Violent victimization in the community predicted later peer rejection after accounting for the effects of initial levels of peer rejection. Analyses indicated that this relation was mediated by deficient emotion regulation skills. In addition, we found evidence that victimization by community violence and peer rejection are reciprocally related over time. The developmental implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Although parents and children are thought to influence one another's affect and behavior, few studies have examined the direction of effects from children to parents, particularly with respect to parental psychopathology. We tested the hypothesis that children's affective characteristics are associated with the course of mothers' depressive symptoms. Children's affect expression was observed during a series of mother-child interaction tasks, and children's resting frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry was assessed in a psychophysiology laboratory. Mothers' depressive symptoms were assessed at two time points, approximately one year apart, at the mother-child interaction visits. Depressive symptoms increased over time for mothers with a history of childhood-onset depression whose children exhibited right frontal EEG asymmetry. Depressive symptoms were associated with high child negative affect at both time points for mothers whose children exhibited right frontal EEG asymmetry. Cross-lagged models with a subset of participants provided some evidence of both parent-to-child and child-to-parent directions of effects. Findings suggest that akin to other interpersonal stressors, children's affective characteristics may contribute to maternal depressive symptoms.

AB This study examined nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in a community sample of young adolescent girls. Potential moderators of the relationships between different types of distress (internal and interpersonal) and particular functions of NSSI (emotion-regulation and interpersonal) were explored. Participants included 94 girls (49% Hispanic; 25% African American) ages 10-14 years who completed questionnaires regarding self-injurious behavior and other constructs of interest. Fifty-six percent of girls (n = 53) reported engaging in NSSI during their lifetime, including 36% (n = 34) in the past year. Internal distress (depressive symptoms) was associated with engaging in NSSI for emotion-regulation functions, and rumination moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms and engaging in NSSI for automatic positive reinforcement. Interpersonal distress (peer victimization) was associated with engaging in NSSI for social reinforcement, and quality of peer communication moderated this relationship. The clinical implications of these findings include designing preventions that address the particular contexts of self-injurious behavior.

AB The aim of the present article was to investigate the outcomes of the universal social competence promotion program Second Step in a typical 'real world' implementation in Norway. We addressed the effects of the program on social competence and externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour among 1,153 fifth and sixth grade students (11 schools, 55 classrooms) after one year of intervention. Although the program is originally American, Second Step has been translated and adapted for the Norwegian setting and renamed Steg for Steg. Applying Linear Mixed Modelling, the results from the age cohort design with comparison groups show that the program had significant positive effects on social competence for boys and girls in grade 5 and for girls in grade 6. Boys in grade 6 reported lower levels of externalizing problem behaviour compared to control students. There were no effects in regard to internalizing problem behaviour. The analysis also revealed that the results varied between classrooms. These results may be considered to add weight to the evidence in support of a wider implementation of the Second Step program.

AB This study examined the roles of fear reactivity and emotional regulatory abilities in overt and relational bullying behaviors. Survey data were collected from 124 middle school students (mean age = 10.3 years, 47% males, 61% Caucasian) and their teachers in the fall and spring of a school year. Surveys included teacher- and self-rated measures of students' overt and relational bullying along with self-reported fear reactivity and effortful control. Findings show that low levels of fear reactivity and effortful control predict higher future levels of overt bullying, but not relational bullying. These results suggest that despite high correlations between overt and relational bullying, these two forms of aggression develop through different processes. The findings from this investigation are discussed with respect to their implications for theory on the development of aggression as well as prevention and intervention programming for youth aggression.

AB The child with a serious medical illness is at greater risk for developing emotional problems. Unlike a child with a temporary sickness, the child with a chronic illness must cope with knowing that the disease is here to stay and may even get worse. The children are hurt emotionally by the uncertainity about illness and treatment. Chronic illness also affects psychological health of their parents. Hence, in addition to the physical aspects it is necessary also, to focus on the psychological health of the child and their parents in order to ensure compliance and thus treat the child comprehensively. It is important to develop a supportive communication with the child and his family for the sake of treatment and effective interventions. To meet children's needs for information and support in health care settings, it is necessary to understand the children's level of understanding about the illness, hospitalization process, and death. The purpose of this paper was to review the information on the recognition and management of the psychological problems that accompany chronic physical illnesses in children and adolescents. Also in this paper the information of children's level of understanding about the illness, hospitalization process and death are reviewed. (Anatolian Journal of Psychiatry 2008; 9:244-252)

AB This study aimed to examine the nature, extent and correlates of non-suicidal self injury (NSSI) in a non-clinical sample of young adults. Two hundred and eleven participants (18-30 years) completed self-report questionnaires assessing history of NSSI, emotional regulation, coping strategies, symptoms of psychopathology, and alcohol use. Of the sample, 43.6% reported engaging in NSSI; approximately 10% engaged in moderate/severe NSSI. Those that reported NSSI reported greater psychopathology, avoidant coping and alcohol use than those who did not self-injure. The extent of these differences was magnified as the severity of NSSI increased. These findings highlight the need to consider any form of NSSI, no matter how mild, as an indication of distress and ineffective coping.

AB The construct of emotion regulation (ER) has received considerable emphasis in developmental psychology, with growing interest in the possible association of dysfunctional ER with various forms of child and adolescent psychopathology. However, the empirical study of emotions often entails their abstraction from the immediate context - particularly, from interpersonal and social variables having a pivotal role in the origin and modulation of emotive processes. In this study we used a school-based drama intervention with special class, immigrant adolescents with behavioral difficulties as a real-life context for the study of forms of emotional expression (EE) and strategies of ER using qualitative methods of analysis. Our findings suggest some impairment in EE and ER in this study sample. In addition, we observed difficulties accessing a range of emotions appropriate to a variety of circumstances, anger being the predominantly expressed negative emotion. Hypotheses drawing on issues of immigration and marginalization were raised to explain this finding. In general, the drama process seemed to help emotional expression and awareness and to foster a transformation of emotive processes in the sense of a "collective ER." The importance of teacher awareness of students' dominant emotional state and its potential impact on learning was emphasized. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This report was designed to clarify links among self-reports of psychiatric symptomatology, stress, and adult attachment insecurity, as operationalized using measures drawn from both the developmental and social psychological literatures. Based on a sample of 160 college students, this study demonstrated that insecurity reflected in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) was associated with self-reports of psychiatric symptomatology principally for individuals experiencing high levels of life stress (consistent with a diathesis-stress model) whereas self-reports of attachment-related avoidance and anxiety correlated robustly with psychopathology under conditions of both relatively high and low life stress (consistent with a risk model). Results provide further evidence that social psychological and developmental approaches to the assessment of adult attachment-related variation are associated with domains of adaptation central to Bowlby's account of human development in empirically distinct ways.

AB The aim of this investigation was to examine whether adolescent attachment representation (as assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview) is linked to the quality of adolescents' peer relations (as assessed using a standard battery of peer-report instruments tapping adolescents' social behaviors, peer victimization, social acceptance, and sociometric status). As expected, secure/autonomous adolescents were more likely than insecure/dismissing adolescents to be perceived as behaving prosocially, and less likely to be perceived as aggressive, shy-withdrawn, and victimized by peers. Other findings indicated that insecure/dismissing adolescents, compared to secure/autonomous adolescents, were less likely to be socially accepted by their peers. In addition, insecure/dismissing girls, compared to secure/autonomous girls, were more likely to be neglected; no attachment group differences emerged for boys, or for peer rejection.

ID SEXUAL ABUSE; HARM; MUTILATION; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIORS; SUICIDE
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and pilot an instrument for the assessment of self-injury in adolescent inpatients.
   Methods: The Self-Injury Motivation Scale was modified for use in adolescents. Thirty-eight consenting adolescent inpatients with a history of self-injury completed the Self-Injury Motivation Scale - Adolescent version (SIMS-A) and the Self-Injury Interview (SII) to collect information about a range of factors associated with self-injury, other clinical variables and demographic details.
   Results: The SIMS-A was acceptable to this adolescent sample and motivations for self-injury were similar to those of adults using the original SIMS scale. Adolescents were, however, more likely to use self-injury for communicating to/influencing others compared to adults. The participants most frequently reported self-injury by hitting, cutting and burning. The clinical diagnosis most frequently associated with self-injury was major depression. Females reported earlier onset, higher frequency and multiple methods of self-injury compared to males. Distraction from emotional pain was the most common motivation for self-injury in both males and females.
   Conclusions: This pilot study suggests the SIMS-A is a useful self-report measure to assist clinicians and adolescent patients to understand a behaviour that may be associated with shame, guilt or other difficult emotions for the adolescent. Results also support the contention that there are often multiple and conflicting motivations for self-injury. Self-injury in this population was more common and severe in female adolescents compared to males, while clinical depression was a risk factor for self-injury in both males and females. The small sample size of adolescent inpatients is an important limitation of this pilot study, and research using the SIMS-A in larger samples is warranted.

AB Objective: The aims of the present study were to (i) examine the relationship between children's degree of adiposity and psychosocial functioning; and (ii) compare patterns of clustering of psychosocial measures between healthy weight and overweight/obese children.
   Method: Cross-sectional data from a population-based cohort of 158 healthy weight, 77 overweight, and 27 obese children aged 8-13 years were analysed. Height, weight depression, quality of life, self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, eating disorder symptoms, peer relationships and behavioural and emotional problems were measured.
   Results: Multi-level analysis showed significant linear associations between child body mass index z-scores and the psychosocial variables, with increasing adiposity associated with increasing levels of psychosocial distress. Principal components analyses indicated subtle differences between the healthy weight and overweight/obese groups with regards to the clustering of psychosocial measures. In particular, in overweight/obese, but not in healthy weight children, global self-worth clustered with body image and eating disorder symptoms.
   Conclusions: The psychosocial burden of excess weight is significant and broad reaching, with overweight/obese children showing multiple significant psychosocial problems.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a health camp psychosocial intervention on children with behavioural and emotional problems and the impact of a parenting programme for their parents. The practical utility of introducing two outcome measures was also evaluated.
   Method: A total of 157 consecutively referred children, with a range of emotional and behavioural problems, were rated by parents and teachers, before and after their residential stay, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Concurrent change in parenting attitudes was assessed using the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2. One hundred parents participated in a parenting programme. Both child and parent outcomes for these parents were contrasted with those of the 57 non-participating parents.
   Results: The whole group showed significant improvements in SDQ rated Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactive and Total problems. These were of moderate effect size. The parenting programme had minimal impact on parenting attitudes and no adjunctive value was demonstrated.
   Conclusions: The Health Camp intervention appeared moderately beneficial for a range of common childhood emotional and behavioural problems. In contrast, there was no demonstrable effect from the parenting programme on either parenting attitudes or child outcomes. The SDQ appeared to have clinical utility as an outcome measure.

AB The study deals with the frequency of experienced emotions and with the emotions regulation. The sample (N = 394) comprised three groups: pupils and students, healthy adults and diseased adults; the questionnaire covered 79 emotions (47 with negative and 32 with positive valence). Respondents reported retrospectively how often they felt given emotions and in which way they regulated displays of these emotions towards the others. Findings of the study show that all groups of respondents are experiencing positive emotions more often than negative emotions, the hedonic balance being generally positive (the pupils have the weakest hedonic balance of all groups). As to the frequency of emotions, the most emotional in our sample are pupils and the least emotional diseased adults. Results also show that respondents tend to express their emotions towards the others most often in a way they really feel them. However, analyses revealed significant differences in the emotion inhibition. Diseased adults and adolescents neutralize their emotions distinctively more often than healthy adults: diseased adults suppress almost one quarter of the listed emotions. Further research on emotion frequency, hedonic balance and emotion regulation should focus on the adolescent group and the diseased adults group.

AB Objective: The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine the relationship between several proposed protective factors and trauma symptoms among highly vulnerable youth in the child welfare system.
   Methods: Participants were 142 youth identified with a sexual behavior problem and their caregivers. Two waves of data were collected for each participant an average of 18 months apart. Foster parents reported on perceived level of support from the child welfare agency, youth involvement in club activities, and perception of youths' interpersonal and emotional competence. Youth provided self-reports of their sexual and physical abuse experiences, trauma symptoms at both time I and time 2, and ratings of parenting practices.
   Results: Youth with higher rates of sexual abuse showed more negative affect and higher levels of sexual and non-sexual rumination at time 2, controlling for time I scores. Boys and youth who experienced better parenting practices displayed lower negative affect. Youth with higher levels of emotional and interpersonal competence showed lower levels of non-sexual rumination. Moderation analyses revealed that youth with more significant sexual abuse histories whose foster parents did not feel supported by their child welfare caseworkers had higher levels of sexually ruminative thoughts. Finally, the results revealed that only youth without sexual abuse histories experienced the benefits of club involvement in terms of lower sexual rumination scores.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that youth with significant vulnerabilities can still exhibit a degree of protection from trauma symptomatology in the presence of a wide range of personal and social variables. These findings support the efforts of stakeholders to promote strengths at the level of the individual, family, and broader social network and community. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
