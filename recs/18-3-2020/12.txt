AB The aim of the present study was to develop a Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-C) and to examine its psychometric properties in a sample of Chinese university students. The English version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was translated and back-translated prior to its administration to 791 participants recruited from two universities in Changsha, Hunan (China). Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-scale reliability, and factorial validity were analysed. The CERQ-C exhibited: (1) moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's =.83); (2) a mean inter-class correlation coefficient of .79; (3) a mean inter-item correlation coefficient of .09; and (4) moderate test-retest reliability (.64). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the original CERQ nine-factor model. Finally, with respect to criterion validity, several CERQ-C subscales were uniquely associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety.

AB In offspring of depressed parents a second parent with emotional problems is likely to increase risk of emotional disorder. This effect may however differ between sons and daughters and between offspring of depressed fathers and offspring of depressed mothers. In adolescent and young-adult offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, this study examined the effects of a second affected parent, offspring gender, gender of the depressed parent and their interactions on risk of depression and anxiety disorder. We found that daughters bad a higher risk of depression and anxiety than sons and that offspring of depressed mothers had a. higher risk of anxiety than offspring of depressed fathers. In addition to these main effects, we found an interaction between parent and offspring gender inasmuch that sons of depressed fathers had the lowest risk of depression and anxiety relative to the other groups. A second affected parent tended to increase risk of depression and significantly increased risk of anxiety. However, this effect of a second affected parent on offspring anxiety was most prominent in daughters when the second affected parent was the father; whereas risk in sons did not increase if the father was affected as well. Our results indicate that paternal and maternal depression similarly and additively increase daughters' risk of emotional disorder, but that sons' risk only increases with maternal depression. Intergenerational transmission of emotional disorder seems strongest when the female gender is involved, either in the form of a daughter or a depressed mother.

AB Aims To determine the prevalence of psychological distress in young adults with Type 1 diabetes and to explore associated factors.
   Methods Ninety-two participants with Type 1 diabetes (46 male, 46 female) attending a young adult clinic completed two psychological self-report assessments; the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Adult Self-Report Scale (ASR). The mean age was 21.6 +/- 2.8 years (SD) and mean duration of diabetes was 9.3 +/- 5.4 years. A questionnaire identified the method of insulin delivery, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance. HbA(1c) was measured.
   Results Of the participants, 35.2% reported depressive symptoms (CES-D >= 16), 23.1% indicating severe depressive symptoms (CES-D >= 24), and 32.2, 40.4 and 35.5% of participants reported significant distress (ASR >= 60) on the ASR total problem scales, ASR internalizing and ASR externalizing scores, respectively. Mean HbA(1c) levels were higher in participants with depressive symptoms compared with those with normal scores (CES-D >= 16, HbA(1c)= 9.4% vs. CES-D < 16, HbA(1c)= 8.4%, P = 0.01). Factors associated with psychological distress included use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (P = 0.02) and increased frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes (P = 0.03). CSII users had higher CES-D (21.3 vs. 11.9, P = 0.001) and ASR-Total (59.7 vs. 53.0, P = 0.02) scores than non-CSII users.
   Conclusions Approximately one-third of young adults with Type 1 diabetes experience psychological distress, which is associated with poorer glycaemic control. Psychological distress was related to frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes and method of insulin administration, with significantly greater distress being observed in those using CSII. These findings support inclusion of a psychologist in the diabetes team.

AB This epidemiological study was aimed at determining the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in a UK community-based population of children and adolescents with epilepsy aged 4-17 using a postal questionnaire survey. The intent was to identify, through this survey, those epilepsy-related and demographic factors predictive of the presence of psychopathology and diminished health-related quality of life, and to distinguish whether such factors differ for differing types of psychopathology. Outcomes were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), Impact of Paediatric Epilepsy Scale (IPES), and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE-AD-48). Information was obtained from main carers for 56 children (25 males and 31 females, mean age = 12 years, SD = 3 years 9 months, range = 5-17). Parent report identified that 23 (47.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-61.7%) children met psychiatric caseness criteria and 32 (61.5%, 95% CI 48-73.5%) had chronic distress and social impairment. Regression analyses identified seizure severity as a risk factor for emotional problems and depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, P < 0.05), whereas cognitive impairment was associated with behavioral problems, specifically conduct problems (OR = 14.0, P < 0.05), hyperactivity/inattention (OR = 9.4, P < 0.01), and peer problems (OR = 28.5, P < 0.01). Cognitive impairment and high seizure frequency were significantly related to increased IPES scores (R-2 = 0.33, P < 0.001) and diminished QOLIE-AD-48 scores (R-2 = 0.39 P < 0.01). In conclusion, children with epilepsy experience considerable psychopathology and reduced quality of life. Epilepsy-related factors appear more closely associated with emotional well-being, and cognitive factors with behavior problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association of immigrant status to adversity and adjustment. Two samples of 12- to 15-year-old public school students in the Athens area were studied: a sample of first generation Albanian and Native Greek students attending two public schools (N = 325), and a sample of first-generation Pontian immigrants (of Greek heritage) and Native Greek students attending a third public school (N = 242). Competence and emotional adjustment were measured with multiple methods and informants, including school grades, number of absences, teacher ratings of achievement and behaviour, peer popularity nominations and self-report measures of emotional symptoms and anxiety. Adversity measures included immigrant status, a risk score based on life events and another based on socioeconomic (SES) variables. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the Albanian schools, SES and life events were associated with worse adjustment in multiple domains. Once these differences were controlled, immigrant status was still associated with lower grades and fewer nominations as friends by classroom peers. In contrast, in the Pontian school, immigrant status did not have unique significance; only SES disadvantage was related to academic achievement as assessed by grades. The "`Greekness" of Pontian students and discrimination against Albanian students are discussed as possible explanations for these results.

AB The two main goals of this longitudinal study were to find different trajectories of substance use throughout adolescence and to analyse consequences of this consumption during early adolescence for emotional and behavioural adjustment at the end of adolescence. The study used a longitudinal descriptive design and was carried out on a sample of 101 adolescents (63 girls and 38 boys). They completed questionnaires three times: when they were 13, 15 and 18 years old. Results showed three different clusters of adolescents according to their trajectory of substance use: low consumption, increasing consumption and early experimentation. Differences among the clusters indicated a better emotional adjustment in late adolescence for those boys and girls included in the early experimentation group. Externalizing problems were higher for the adolescents composing the increasing consumption cluster. Regression analyses also showed that moderate substance use in early adolescence was related to a higher self-esteem and a lower level of internalizing problems in late adolescence. There was no relationship between early substance use and later behavioural problems.

AB Objectives: Conventional pesticides comprise a diverse group of substances intended to destroy, repel or control organisms identified as pests. Compared to the studies on lead, mercury, and PCBs, few epidemiological studies have assessed the developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides. Materials and Methods: Epidemiological studies focused on the neurobehavioural development of children exposed to pesticides were identified by searching the PubMed, Medline, EBSCO, Agricola and TOXNET databases. Results: The findings of the studies reviewed imply that children's exposure to pesticides may bring about impairments in their neurobehavioral development. Children exposed to organophosphate pesticides (OP), both prenatally and during childhood, may have difficulties performing tasks that involve short-term memory, and may show increased reaction time, impaired mental development or pervasive developmental problems. In newborns, the effects of OP exposure are manifested mainly by an increased number of abnormal reflexes, while in adolescents, by mental and emotional problems. The studies investigating association between exposure to organochlorine pesticides and neurodevelopmental effects show inconsistent results. While some studies report impairments in mental and psychomotor functions, other studies do not confirm the above. Conclusion: The information deriving from epidemiological studies indicate a need to increase awareness among people and children exposed to pesticides about the association between the use of pesticides and neurodevelopmental impairments. Therefore, the principle of prudence should become a rule.

AB To temper untoward mental health outcomes in children and adolescents, the World Psychiatric Association's Presidential Global Child Mental Health Programme, in collaboration with the WHO and the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professionals, established a Child Mental Health Awareness Task Force headed by Sam Tyano. Its task was to develop methodologies to increase awareness among policy-makers, community leaders, health professionals, teachers, parents, and children. Based on a prior comprehensive international search for effective techniques for information dissemination, an awareness manual was written for use by health professionals in diverse communities so as to guide the design and implementation of location specific awareness campaigns. We assessed the children, parents and teachers both before and after the campaign to determine changes in knowledge, attitudes and understanding of mental health. The school-based studies were conducted in selected communities in nine countries on five different continents distinguished by their different languages, cultures and their differing levels of economic development: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Russia, and Uganda. In the six sites that completed all assessments, indicators of positive change in awareness of child mental health were identified, and results demonstrated an increased willingness to discuss emotional problems freely. These data support the utility of collaborating with schools so as to foster better child mental health in such under-resourced communities.

AB Background: Suicidal risk begins to increase during adolescence and is associated with multiple biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors. This study examined the prevalence and psychosocial factors of parent-reported suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: A community sample of 1920 adolescents in China participated in an epidemiological study. Parents completed a structured questionnaire including child suicidal behavior, illness history, mental health problems, family history, parenting, and family environment. Multiple logistic regression was used for data analysis.
   Results: Overall, 2.4% of the sample talked about suicide in the previous 6 months, 3.2% had deliberately hurt themselves or attempted suicide, and 5.1% had either suicidal talk or self-harm. The rate of suicidal behavior increased as adolescents aged. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that the following factors were significantly associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior: depressive/anxious symptoms, poor maternal health, family conflict, and physical punishment of parental discipline style.
   Limitations: Suicidal behavior was reported by parents. No causal relationships could be made based on cross-sectional data.
   Conclusions: The prevalence rate of parent-reported suicidal behavior is markedly lower than self-reported rate in previous research. Depressive/anxious symptoms and multiple family environmental factors are associated with suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Three groups of children are involved in bullying: victims, bullies and bully-victims who are both bullies and victims of bullying. Understanding the origins of these groups is important since they have elevated emotional and behavioural problems, especially the bully-victims. No research has examined the genetic and environmental influences on these social roles. Method: Mother and teacher reports of victimisation and bullying were collected in a nationally representative cohort of 1, 116 families with 10-year-old twins. Model-fitting was used to examine the relative influence of genetics and environments on the liability to be a victim, a bully or a bully-victim. Results: Twelve percent of children were severely bullied as victims, 13% were frequent bullies, and 2.5% were heavily involved as bully-victims. Genetic factors accounted for 73% of the variation in victimisation and 61% of the variation in bullying, with the remainder explained by environmental factors not shared between the twins. The covariation between victim and bully roles (r = .25), which characterises bully-victims, was accounted for by genetic factors only. Some genetic factors influenced both victimisation and bullying, although there were also genetic factors specific to each social role. Conclusions: Children's genetic endowments, as well as their surrounding environments, influence which children become victims, bullies and bully-victims. Future research identifying mediating characteristics that link the genetic and environmental influences to these social roles could provide targets for intervention.

AB Validity data are presented for a new measure of threat appraisals in response to community violence. Adolescents (N=358; 45% male; 91% African American, M=12.10 years, SD=1.63) and their maternal caregivers participated in two waves of a longitudinal interview study focused on the consequences of exposure to community violence. Structural equation modeling revealed that a six-factor correlated model best fit the data, indicating that the six subscales of the threat appraisal measure represent distinct but related constructs. The factor structure was invariant across age and gender. Exposure to violence was associated prospectively with caregiver- and adolescent-rated adjustment problems. Each of the six threat appraisals mediated links between exposure to violence at Wave 1 and adolescent-rated internalizing adjustment problems 1 year later.

ID COMPLICATED GRIEF; TRAUMATIC GRIEF; BEREAVEMENT; CHILDREN
AB Some adolescents confronted with loss develop symptoms of complicated grief, depression, and anxiety. Little is known about mechanisms causing such problems in this group. Cognitive behavioral theories of grief hypothesize that negative cognitions are pivotal in emotional problems after loss. The current preliminary study tested this hypothesis among 30 adolescent girls (13-18 years). Findings showed that different types of negative cognitions were significantly associated with complicated grief and depression severity. Global negative beliefs about life and the self and catastrophic misinterpretations of grief reactions were most strongly linked with symptoms. Findings support cognitive behavioral theories of grief.

AB BACKGROUND: Teachers need classroom-based programs to develop and support mental health fitness in adolescents because this age group faces significant challenges to their mental health. There is a paucity of such ready-made programs. This article describes the development and proposed implementation of a low-cost, effective, adaptable, 6-week, classroom-based workshop entitled MasterMind: Empower Yourself With Mental Health. MasterMind provides students with a "toolbox for mental health" by creating a safe environment for discussion of mental health and emotionally charged topics, by increasing student knowledge of mental health issues, and by providing tools to develop and maintain mental health. Instructional materials address topics identified through needs assessments. The program combines instruction and written exercises with "peer-teaching-peer" group activities, individual assignments, and open discussion. Specific methods are included to allow students to ask questions anonymously and to build each other's self-esteem.
   METHODS: MasterMind was implemented as a pilot program to a Seattle, WA, middle school class of 30 students and addressed self-esteem, media literacy, school resources, relationships, emotions, stress and ways to de-stress, and future goals.
   RESULTS: The students' enthusiasm and participation increased throughout the program, and they gave high satisfaction ratings to the topics covered. Additionally, the host teacher continued selected program activities after MasterMind was completed.
   CONCLUSIONS: MasterMind educates all students in a class, not just those with identified emotional problems, and can potentially identify children with mental health needs not already evident. The pilot program implementation of MasterMind shows that such programs have potential for providing adolescents with tools to optimize mental health.

AB Effects of the training program for aggressive children [Training mit aggressiven Kindern, TAK, Petermann & Petermann, 2008] were compared with the effects of a combination of youth welfare service and TAK and psychiatric intervention with TAK. Groups of 8, 12 and 13 children (32 boys, 1 girl, average ages of 9 years and 8 months) took part in the study. At the beginning as well as 6 months after completion of the training behavioral and social problems were measured. A sub-sample of six boys in the psychiatric intervention-TAK group was examined directly after training terminated. Emotional problems, social difficulties with peers, and conduct problems were reduced more effectively with combined interventions. Pre-post comparisons of the ratings in the sub-sample documented a strong decrease in peer relationship and emotional problems. Results indicated that it should be possible to optimize mental health care of aggressive children through the integration of TAK in standard intervention programs.

AB The article deals with internalized problems in children and adolescents, epidemiological data, developmental factors of these disorders, as well as with examples of prevention programmes. International and Croatian epidemiological indicators represent an important guideline for situation analysis and prevention needs assessment. However, due to methodological deficiencies, and the lack of domestic data, a large portion of the epidemiological picture is related to international sources. Only a few internalized problems have been selected related to the severity of clinical picture and the prevalence in the population of children and adolescents: anxiety, depression and suicidality. Special emphasis is put on the prevention programmes based on scientific evidence and indicators, as well as on the need for development of evaluated model programmes in Croatia. The importance of timely, long-term care for mental health in children and adults is also underlined. The article comments on the choice of internationally recognized universal prevention programmes, as well as on selective and indicated prevention model programmes and the possibilities related to the prevention of introversion, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and suicidality. On the basis of the analyzed prevention programmes, practical implications and guidelines for the prevention of internalized disorders in the Croatian context are presented.

AB There is evidence that the male sex and a personality style characterized by low self-control/high impulsivity and a propensity for negative emotionality increase the risk for impulsive aggressive, antisocial and criminal behavior. This article aims at identifying neurobiological factors underlying this association. It is concluded that the neurobiological correlates of impulsive aggression act through their effects on the ability to modulate impulsive expression more generally, and that sex-related differences in the neurobiological correlates of impulse control and emotion regulation mediate sex differences in direct aggression. A model is proposed that relates impulse control and its neurobiological correlates to sex differences in direct aggression.

AB Information about coexisting problems in dyslexia may be vital for diagnostic and remedial procedures. There are few studies in this area, and to our knowledge none for the students in focus in this study. They all have phonological deficits and severely impaired reading abilities, in spite of prolonged educational remediation. The aim was to assess if these students have more behavioural/emotional problems than normal reading students. A clinical sample of 70 students, 59 males and 11 females, were compared to a normal reading control group. The groups were pair-wise matched on age, gender, cognitive level, and whether they lived in rural or urban areas. Mean age for the two groups was 150 months; and mean IQ scores approximately 100. Information on behaviour/emotions was obtained from parents, teachers and participants by means of the Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher's Report Form and Youth Self Report. The dyslexia group showed significantly more problems in all areas than the controls. This was reported from all three groups of informants. Parents reported most problems, internalizing behaviour for more than 50% of the participants and total problem behaviour for nearly 45%. Significantly more attention problems were also reported for the dyslexia group from all informants. Parents reported that nearly half the group demonstrated attention problems. Both groups of participants had more problems reported for those with IQ scores of 100 or lower. Further research is needed in this area, but the results clearly indicate that identifying additional behavioural/emotional problems may be imperative for students with severe reading problems.

AB Psychosocial development in children with chronic disease is a key issue in paediatrics. This study investigated whether psychosocial adjustment could be reliably assessed with the 42-item Adolescent Adjustment Profile (AAP) instrument. The study mainly focused on adjustment-to-obesity measurement, although it compared three patient groups with chronic conditions. All phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Sweden between ages 9 and 18 and their parents and teachers were invited to participate. Patients with neurobehavioural syndromes and obesity were age- and gender-matched with PKU patients. Healthy children constituted a reference group. Psychosocial adjustment was measured using the AAP, which is a multi-informant questionnaire that contains four domains. Information concerning parents' socio-economic and civil status was requested separately. Respondents to the three questionnaires judged the PKU patients to be normal in all four domains. Patients with neurobehavioural syndromes demonstrated less competence and the most problems compared with the other three groups. According to the self-rating, the parent rating and the teacher rating questionnaires, obese patients had internalizing problems. The parent rating and the teacher rating questionnaire scored obese patients as having a lower work capacity than the reference group. Compared with the reference group, not only families with obese children but also families with children with neurobehavioural syndromes had significantly higher divorce rates. Obese patients were also investigated with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), another instrument that enables comparison between two measures of adjustment. The AAP had good psychometric properties; it was judged a useful instrument in research on adolescents with chronic diseases.

AB This study compares clinician appraisal of Bosnian refugee children with independent parent, child and teacher reports. From whom and by what means can children at risk be reasonably identified? Forty-eight Bosnian refugee children (aged 7-20), resettled in Sweden 1994-95, were assessed clinically by means of a semi-structured interview. Thereafter, standardized mental health questionnaires were administered to parents (Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist), children (Achenbach's Youth Self-Report and Macksoud's Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Checklist) and teachers (clinician designed School Competence Scale and Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form). On clinician interview, nearly half of the children (48%) were identified with one or more mental health problem demanding further attention. Depressiveness was the single most prevalent symptom (31%); followed by post-traumatic stress (23%), and anxiety-regressiveness (15%). At the same time, 75% of the children were rated by teachers as quite competent in school. Parent, child and clinician appraisals of primary school children showed broad similarities. Teachers reported a similar prevalence of child distress, but identified different symptoms and different children demanding attention. Evaluation of teenage youths showed greater disparity: teenagers labeled their own symptoms more often as post-traumatic stress reactions and teachers identified few youths in need of attention. Inter-relatedness among parent, child and clinician appraisals supports the robustness of our semi-structured interview. At the same time, apartness of teacher report underscores the need to incorporate an outside-world vantage point in the process of risk assessment. Also, a more concrete presentation of post-traumatic stress reactions and a higher further attention threshold for inward emotional problems seem called for.

AB About a third of all inpatients in psychiatric hospitals are parents of children aged below 18 years. The mental illness of a parent and especially the need of inpatient treatment burdens families. This study was contributed to assess parental stress, behavioural and emotional problems of the children and the needs of psychiatric inpatients for support. Barriers and hindrances as well as positive experience with support for their children were assessed. All psychiatric hospitals in a County with about 1.5 million inhabitants in South-West Germany participated in this study. From 643 inpatients after drop-out 83 (54 female, 29 male) patients with non full aged children were questioned with inventories as the SDQ, the PSS and further assessments. Diagnoses and biographic data were assessed by the documentation of the German Association of psychiatry and psychotherapy. Parents reported about an increased level of stress by parenthood (PSS mean 41.9, SD 9.4). Psychopathology of the children influenced the stress of the mentally ill parents. 40 % of the patients are dissatisfied with the care of their children during their inpatient treatment, but 51 % have strong resentments against the youth welfare custodies and do not ask for support. Our results prove the high negative attitude of mentally ill parents against youth welfare service which must be reduced by active information policy and offers in collaboration with the treating psychiatrist of the parents.

AB Diabetes is a unique disorder in how much it requires a high degree of individual self management strategies. Anxiety and stress can affect glycemic control, and thus management of emotions may be key to good glycemic control. This study is the first to examine how anxiety and coping style, and their interaction, can affect long-term glycemic control. We measured anxiety, coping, and HbA(1C), a measure for mean blood glucose levels in the previous 6-8 weeks, in 115 patients with Type 1 diabetes at baseline and roughly 5 years later. We found that coping predicted outcomes, especially for those high in trait anxiety. Trait anxiety predicted limited increases in HbA(1C) (mean increase = 0.02%). Lower levels of emotion-oriented coping predicted clinically significant increases in HbA(1C), but only for those high on baseline trait anxiety (mean increase = 0.92%). Task-oriented coping predicted decreases in state anxiety. Use of task- and emotion-oriented coping appears especially important for highly anxious patients, both for emotional regulation and glycemic control. So, coping styles, basal anxiety and their interactions should be considered in designing follow-up and interventions with diabetic patients.

AB The study explored how two measures of mother-adolescent dissimilarity in illness representations relate to negative emotional adjustment in mothers and adolescents. Eighty-four adolescents with type 1 diabetes (age 11.5-17.5) and their mothers completed the Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire and measures of negative emotional adjustment. Adolescents viewed diabetes as less chronic, containing fewer negative emotional representations, and that mother had less control over the illness than did mothers. Mother-adolescent mean differences in representations were not associated with negative adjustment for adolescents; mean differences in coherence were related to negative adjustment for mothers, when controlling the individual's own representations. A measure of dissimilarity based on the sum of squared differences between mother and adolescent was associated with negative adolescent adjustment when controlling adolescent's own representations, but no relations were found for mothers. Dyadic approaches to coping with chronic illness will benefit by understanding how dissimilarity in illness representations between patient and caregiver relate to adjustment.

AB Background: Self-injurious behavior ( SIB) is increasingly popular in psychically ill adolescents, especially in girls with posttraumatic stress ( PTSD) and personality disorders. Adolescents with SIB frequently exhibit neurofunctional and psychopathological deficits. We speculated that specific neuropsychological deficits and temperamental factors could predispose patients to SIB and prospectively explored adolescent psychiatric patients with and without SIB in order to find out differences in psychopathology, and neuropsychological or temperamental factors. Sampling and Methods: Ninety-nine psychically ill adolescent girls with SIB, aged 12-19 years and treated at our clinic, were prospectively recruited during a period of 5.5 years ( 1999-2005). The clinical ( ICD-10) diagnoses were mainly substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, PTSD and personality disorders. The control group was also prospectively recruited during the same period and consisted of 77 girls with similar diagnoses and ages but no SIB. All patients were subjected to the same selection of clinical and neuropsychological tests, mainly self-rating questionnaires and tests evaluating executive functions. Results: Adolescent girls with psychiatric disease and SIB were more severely traumatized and depressed. They reported severe emotional and behavioral problems and deficits of self-regulation. In addition, their parents more frequently had psychiatric problems. Temperament, intelligence, investigated executive functions and presence of dissociative symptoms were not different in patients with and without SIB. Conclusions: We could not verify our primary hypothesis that SIB is related to specific neuropsychological deficits or temperamental factors. SIB was associated with traumatic experience, depression, problems of self-regulation and parental psychiatric disease. The prevention of SIB should therefore focus on improving affect regulation, the management of emotional distress and problem-solving strategies. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Background: This study examined parent/youth self-report agreement on emotional and behavioral symptoms among adolescents with eating disorders (ED). Sampling and Methods: Eighty-three parent-adolescent pairs participated. All adolescents (age 11-18 years) were females and met diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-IV for anorexia nervosa restricting type (n = 53) or bulimia nervosa (n = 30). Diagnoses were confirmed using the Structured Inventory for Anorectic and Bulimic Syndromes. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist, and the adolescents completed the corresponding Youth Self-Report. Results: Results of the interclass correlation provide very poor coefficients between parents and adolescents, especially for the internalizing subscale. Analyses of variance of repeated measures revealed significant differences in the total problem score and the internalizing subscore between parents and adolescents. Parents reported significantly more internalizing problems than adolescents. Conclusions: Agreement between parents and adolescents regarding the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with ED is low. In contrast to previous studies in non-ED samples, adolescents with ED reported lower levels of internalizing problems than their parents. Denial and minimization may be underlying reasons for our findings and represent obstacles in the psychological assessment of adolescents with ED. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objectives: This study reports on the concept and method of linear propensity scores used to obtain a comparison group from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth to assess the effects of a longitudinal, structured arts program for Canadian youth (aged 9 to 15 years) from low-income, multicultural communities. Method: This study compares 183 children in a community arts project to 183 children from a national longitudinal survey using propensity score matching. The variables included baseline scores of child-rated conduct problems, indirect aggression, emotional problems, self-esteem, and prosocial behavior and child gender, person most knowledgeable (PMK) education, PMK marital status, household income, and family functioning. Results: Mean score comparison showed that the groups were very similar on all covariates. Conclusions: Propensity score matching offers an alternative to true randomization that is cost-effective and convenient, particularly important for social work research in community-based organizations with a limited budget.

Teacher pairs from six classrooms each completed items contributing to the externalizing composites and subscales for 10 of their students on two occasions approximately 1-3 weeks apart. Pearson correlation coefficients examining consistency between raters, between instruments, and between measurement occasions were generally strong, but dependability coefficients were moderate when rater, instrument, and occasion were considered concurrently. Variance component estimates indicated that individual differences among students accounted for the largest proportion of total variance across all score comparisons, but differences between teacher ratings for particular students and between instruments accounted for relatively large proportions of error variance among subscale scores. The implications of simultaneously considering multiple error sources for test users are discussed.

Using two samples, we analyzed whether personality is related to ambivalence in parenthood decisions and with coping with ambivalence. In the first study, high levels of neuroticism and low levels of agreeableness were related to higher ambivalence. In the second study, psychological vulnerability was associated with higher ambivalence. Individuals with high levels of extraversion were more likely to seek social support if parenthood decisions became too difficult, and persons with higher levels of openness to experience were more likely to make decisions based on their feelings. Associations of neuroticism with avoidant coping were mediated by level of ambivalence. The conclusion drawn is that sex education with adolescents should include information about ambivalence and promote adequate ways of coping with this phenomenon.

AB This study was conducted as a predictive examination of family conflict and parent and peer support on adolescent self-esteem, depression, and problem behaviors. The other aim of the study was to determine whether adolescent self-esteem, depression, and problem behaviors differed according to gender. The study sample consisted of 1,734 high school students. The results support the general hypothesis that perceptions of high conflict in the family context are related to lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of depression; and lower levels of self-esteem are related to higher levels of depression, which are expected to lead to higher levels of involvement in problem behaviors. To increase the level of wellness in adolescents, improving friendship quality and solving parent-adolescent crises are recommended. At the same time, prevention and intervention programs for problem behaviors and emotional problems could be beneficial for adolescents.

AB Most research in health psychology is based on retrospective self reports, which are distorted by recall biases and have low ecological validity. To overcome such limitations we developed Computer assisted diary approaches to assess health related behaviours in individuals'. couples' and families' daily life. The event- and time-sampling-based instruments serve to assess appraisals of the current situation, feelings of physical discomfort, current emotional states, conflict and emotion regulation in daily life. They have proved sufficient reliability and validity in the context of individual, couple and family research with respect to issues like emotion regulation and health. As examples: Regarding symptom reporting Curvilinear pattern of frequencies over the day Could be identified by parents and adolescents; or psychological well-being is associated with lower variability in basic affect dimensions. In addition, we report on preventive studies to improve parental skills and enhance their empathic competences towards their baby, and towards their partner.

AB Resilience refers to the achievement of a functional adaptation to adverse, often traumatic environments resulting in a long term healthy psychological functioning and developmental outcome. Resilience research focuses on the identification of protective factors that act as buffering moderators between adverse environmental conditions and a satisfying adjustment outcome. Resilience is enhanced by adaptive systems on four different levels: personal competencies of the child (coping strategies, self-regulation, motivation, learning), family system (attachment, parent-child-interaction, parenting), resources of the social network (school, peers) and society and culture (norms, values). Biological (genetic, endocrine, neurobiological) protective factors enhance the child's competencies concerning impulse control, executive functioning, and emotion regulation during distressing episodes. Recent research has provided convincing evidence that epigenetic, i.e., experience-dependent modulation of gene expression may increase or decrease psychopathological vulnerability. A conceptual framework is introduced that analyzes the emergence of resilience as a result of successful coping episodes enhanced by the application of functional cognitive schemata and behavioural competencies which the child has assimilated via supportive interaction with strengthening parents and network members. Corresponding to this conceptual framework, parent- and child-centered intervention strategies are outlined that foster resilient developmental processes in adverse contexts.

AB Objective: Research in animals has shown that exposure to stressors during pregnancy is associated with offspring behavioural disorders. We aimed to study the effect of in utero exposure to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and maternal anxiety presumably associated with that exposure, on behaviour disorder observed at age 14.
   Method: Exposed (n = 232) and non-exposed Finnish twins (n = 572) were compared. A semi-structured interview was used to assess lifetime symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms.
   Results: Adolescents who were exposed from the second trimester in pregnancy onwards, had a 2.32-fold risk (95% CI: 1.13-4.72) of having lifetime depression symptoms, an increased risk of fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria of a major depressive disorder (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.06-5.7), and a 2.01-fold risk (95% CI: 1.14-3.52) of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
   Conclusion: Perturbations in fetal brain development during the second trimester may be associated with the increased prevalence of depressive and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.

AB Background: This article focuses on possible relationships between functioning of adolescents with a parent diagnosed with cancer 1-5 years earlier and family environment.
   Patients and methods: In all, 138 patients, 114 spouses and 221 adolescents completed the Family Environment Scale. Additionally, adolescents filled in the Impact of Event Scale and Youth Self-report and parents reported on the adolescents' functioning using the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Patients and spouses reported that their families differ from the norm; they are more expressive and social, better organized, less controlling and have less conflict. Adolescents reported the same and additionally find their family. Family environment was weakly to moderately strongly negatively related to the adolescents' functioning; family relationships related more strongly to the adolescents' functioning than family structure did. No significant relationship was found between family environment and the adolescents' cancer-related distress. Discrepancy in reports of family environment between parents and between parents and adolescents, in general, did not relate to the adolescents' functioning or distress. Parent-adolescent discrepancy only correlated with adolescent self-reports of their functioning.
   Conclusion: Families with parental cancer functioned positively. Despite this, family functioning seems to be a risk factor for behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents.

AB Judgments about the quality of students' experience of school generally focus on their academic performance and indeed this is an important indicator but closer attention needs to be paid to equally important, more broadly based outcomes that include social/emotional adjustment as they also are shown to impact on students'lives at, and beyond school. In this study, students' academic performance and social/emotional adjustment were informed by data collected from both students and teachers. Teachers of years 5 to 9 students in 58 separate classes across 21 South Australia schools reported on randomly selected students in each of their classes yielding data for 888 students who themselves reported through a questionnaire on (a) the extent to which they perceived relationships with family, peers and teachers as sources of stress or support at school; (b) their psychological health; (c) coping strategies; (d) experience of bullying and victimisation; (e) their academic performance; and (0 feelings about and sense of belonging to school. Data were used to estimate direct and indirect effects of a path model of hypothesised influences on students' social/emotional adjustment to school. The model fit the data well. The quality of a student's experience of school is most accurately represented by the inter-relationship of both academic and social/emotional outcomes which are influenced in large part by the quality of the relationships (supportive or stressful) among students, not only with peers and families but also with teachers who exert just as strong, and a sometimes stronger influence, on students' wellbeing.

AB The current study examined whether the association between the occurrence of negative events and increased engagement in risky behavior is moderated by maladaptive and/or adaptive coping strategies. At time 1, 411 adolescents (ages 14-19) from Yue Yang, Hunan, completed self-report measures assessing coping strategies, engagement in risky behaviors, and the occurrence of negative events. Once a month for the subsequent 6 months, adolescents completed measures assessing engagement in risky behaviors and the occurrence of negative events. In line with our hypotheses, results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that adolescents possessing high levels of maladaptive coping strategies reported greater engagement in risky behaviors following the occurrence of negative events than adolescents possessing low levels. In contrast to our hypotheses, the association between the occurrence of negative events and increased engagement in risky behavior was not moderated by adaptive coping strategies.

AB Previous studies have indicated abnormalities in response flexibility in pediatric bipolar disorder (BD). Dysfunction in response flexibility may contribute to the pattern of behavioral and emotional dysregulation that is characteristic of BD, since depressed and manic patients respond inflexibly to emotional stimuli (i.e., anhedonia in the case of depression or inappropriate positive affect in the case of mania). The present study was undertaken to determine if neuronal responses differed between BD and control subjects on a simple motor response flexibility task.
   To elucidate the neural substrates mediating response flexibility in pediatric BD, we studied 25 youth with BD and 17 age-, gender- and IQ-matched controls (CON) as they performed the change task while undergoing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The change task is a new fMRI task that requires subjects to both inhibit and replace a prepotent motor response with another motor response after the initial response has been cued.
   On correctly performed change trials relative to correctly performed go trials, BD patients generated significantly more activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and in the primary motor cortex than did healthy controls, even though performance levels did not differ across groups.
   These results indicate that functional deficits within the left DLPFC may mediate deficits in response flexibility in pediatric BD. This deficit may extend beyond the realm of motor control and also affect emotion regulation.

   We studied a nationwide representative general population sample of 2,856 children and adolescents aged 4-18 years.
   A total of 21 subjects [0.7% of the sample; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5-1.1] met the criteria for the CBCL-PBD phenotype. CBCL-PBD subjects were more pervasively disturbed than clinical controls (n = 118; 4.1% of total sample; 95% CI = 3.4-4.9), demonstrated in significantly more social problems and delinquent behavior, and showed significantly higher rates of suicidality, decreased need for sleep and hypersexual behavior.
   The prevalence of CBCL-PBD subjects in the general German population compares to rates of PBD in US and Dutch epidemiological samples. Regardless of whether these subjects are affected by 'real' PBD or 'severe, pervasive ADHD' with pronounced emotional dysregulation, they constitute a group of seriously disturbed children and adolescents. The high rate of suicidality among CBCL-PBD subjects emphasizes the need for the identification and adequate treatment of children meeting this profile.

AB The need for a multimethod approach to the study of emotion in children and adolescents is crucial, as is a multilevel analysis in which emotional experience is assessed at a variety of levels (Solomon, 2002). This review highlights the critical role of emotion theory when constructing and selecting appropriate assessment tools with a focus on Functionalist theory that emphasizes the importance of contextual variables (Barrett & Campos, 1987). The review begins with an examination of theoretical and pragmatic issues in emotion measurement followed by discussions of four basic methods of emotion assessment (i.e., self-report, other-report, observation, neurophysiology). Implications of emotion assessment for clinical practice and future directions for research conclude the review.

AB This Special Issue of Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice provides a series of articles detailing efforts to consider the concepts of emotion and emotion regulation in relation to clinical assessment and psychopathology intervention efforts across the lifespan. In our commentary, we review some common themes and challenges presented in these articles to move forward the discussion of emotion's role in psychological therapy. We discuss efforts to conceptualize the role of context in defining emotion concepts and maximizing the relevancy of such concepts to treatment. We review the importance of imbuing efforts to develop emotion-focused treatments with emphases on positive, as well as negative, emotions and flexibility in the expression of these emotions. We also highlight the relevance of a lifespan developmental approach to the accurate use of emotion and emotion regulation concepts within treatment. Finally, we discuss the application of these issues to our own treatment development and evaluation efforts regarding a unified approach to the treatment of emotional disorders in adults and adolescents.

AB Problem Statement: Because of the fact that adolescent problem behaviors were increasing in recent years, prevention studies need to be do. Scanning studies have an important place in prevention area.
   Purpose of Study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of Health Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ) which is including adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems.
   Methods: A total of 213 students from three high schools in Izmir participated in this study. Students completed Health Behavior Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Information sheet.
   Results : The results of the factor analysis showed that the scale have two factors structure including behavioral and emotional behaviors. It was found that there was a significant relationship between HBQ and Short Symptom Inventory (p<.001). The internal consistency coefficients of the scale (Cronbach alpha) were respectively .81, .77 and .83 for total scale, behavioral and emotional subscales. Item total score correlation coefficients were ranging between .52-.71 in behavioral problems subscale and .51-.79 in emotional problems subscale and the correlation coefficient of split half was .71 for HBQ.
   Conclusions : The findings indicated that Turkish version of HBQ could be used for Turkish adolescent samples as a valid and a reliable instrument.

AB Background. - The alexithymia construct is mainly characterized by a difficulty in identifying and expressing feelings that is thought to reflect a deficit in cognitive processing and regulation of emotional states. During the last decade, atexithymia has been associated with a large variety of medical and psychiatric disorders in the adult population. Although adolescence is probably an opportune time to explore processes of emotion regulation, atexithymia has been rarely examined during this period. The 20-item Toronto atexithymia scale (TAS-20) is the most widely used self-report measure of atexithymia. For this scale, a three-factor structure was proposed: difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF) and externally oriented thinking (EOT). Research has yielded considerable evidence that the TAS-20 is a reliable and valid measure of alexithymia in normal and clinical adult samples. To date, no psychometric data concerning the use of the TAS-20 with adolescent samples are available.
   Objectives. - The aim of the study is to provide psychometric data concerning the TAS-20 when administered to healthy adolescents. Furthermore, in a developmental perspective, this study explores the evolution of alexithymnia across age groups in adolescence.
   Method. - The TAS-20 was administered to a sample of 264 adolescents aged from 14 to 19 years. In order to compare alexithymia across age groups, the sample was divided into three groups: group 1 (< 16 years old), group 2 (16-17 years old) and group 3 (> 17 years old).
   Results. - Results of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed that the data fitted wet[ to the three-factor model. of the TAS-20 (X-2/df = 2.22, GFI = 0.88, AGFI = 0.84 and RMSEA = 0.068). The internal reliability coefficients and mean interitem correlations are acceptable for DIF (alpha > 0.60; mean interitern correlation = 0.22) and good for DDF (alpha > 0.70, mean interitern correlation = 0. 33). As often reported in most translations of the TAS-20, the internal reliability of EOT is poor. Results of a one-way Anova showed a significant linear trend indicating that, with age, the level of atexithymia (TAS-20 total score), the difficulty in identifying feelings and the externally oriented thinking decreased.
   Discussion. - This study demonstrated that the TAS-20 has sufficient construct validity in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. Our results support the idea that adolescence period is associated with the development of the ability to regulate emotions. (c) L'Encephale, Paris, 2007.

AB An evaluation framework, called the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award, has been developed to enable comprehensive collection and analysis of data reflecting the status of health-promoting schools (HPS) in Hong Kong. The key findings revealed a high prevalence of emotional problems, unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity and risk-taking behaviours, leading to both intentional and unintentional injuries among students with higher prevalence among secondary school students. The results indicated a substantial lack of health policies in schools; it also indicated health services in schools not readily accessible to students and staff, and insufficient staff training in health promotion and education. However, most schools have made initiatives in environmental protection, established safety guidelines and strategies for managing students with emotional problems. The success of HPS depends largely on teachers' understanding of its building blocks. Evidence from the comprehensive mapping of the status of HPS in Hong Kong and from student surveys does show encouraging outcomes as well as identifying priority issues to be addressed in the next 5 years.

AB This paper investigates how the learning environments and family dynamics differ if households have a child with a disability or a parent with a disability. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, results indicate that children with disabilities experience similar learning environments as other children, but have somewhat weaker relationships with their parents. In two-parent families, maternal disability lowers parents' school involvement and is associated with a less enriching home environment. Paternal disability reduces maternal monitoring and positive family activities possibly because mothers divert care-giving resources from their children to their male partners. Children in mother-headed households experience learning environments and family dynamics that are similar regardless of their own disability status or that of their mothers, but these outcomes are markedly inferior to those of children growing up in two-parent households. Future research on adolescent development should consider the disability status of children and parents, with particular attention to patterns of gendered care-giving in American families.

AB Chronic daily headaches are an increasingly recognized neurologic issue in children. Frequent headaches can be a source of significant disability and family discord with work/school absenteeism. Medication overuse and emotional disorder would significantly impact treatment and progression. This study examined the frequency of emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents with chronic daily headache compared with age-related healthy controls. Prevalence of medication overuse in this chronic daily headache group was evaluated. Otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic daily headache (according to International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria) were enrolled from the Headache Clinic. Healthy controls were prospectively enrolled from physician offices. Multiple psychological rating scales, headache diaries, presence of medication overuse, and disability surveys (Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Survey) were completed. A total of 57 healthy controls and 70 patients were studied. The sample consisted largely of females, many of whom (60%) had medication overuse before medical treatment. Headache patients had significantly more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization compared with controls. Patients with chronic daily headache were at higher risk for emotional disorders, and medication overuse was a significant occurrence, suggesting a need for multisystem treatment approach.

AB Objective: To examine the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on health risk behaviors during preadolescence. Methods: The present study examined prenatal cocaine exposure, gender, and environmental risk as predictors of self-reported substance use, aggression, and a disregard for safety precautions on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey in a sample of 10.5 year olds (n = 154, including 60 who were prenatally exposed to cocaine). Results: Gender tended to moderate the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure because exposure effects were found for boys but not girls. Boys who were prenatally exposed to cocaine reported engaging in more high-risk behavior. In examining individual outcomes, cocaine exposed boys had the highest scores for aggression, substance use, and a disregard for safety precautions, although these differences were significant only for the composite health risk behavior measure. Conclusions: The findings extend earlier work showing that prenatal cocaine exposure places boys at risk for problems of inhibitory control, emotional regulation, and antisocial behavior. Research is needed to examine whether the effects of prenatal cocaine on health risk behaviors persist into adolescence, when such behaviors tend to increase.

AB Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or the fear of anxiety sensations, has been shown to independently predict poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adults with chronic pain. Specifically, AS was found to contribute to decrements in psychological well-being and social functioning but not to decrements in physical functioning. Existing studies have not examined the relationship between AS and HRQOL in children with chronic pain. The present study used multivariate regression analysis to test the association between AS and self-reported HRQOL in 87 children (62 girls; mean age = 14.4 years +/- 2.3) presenting for treatment at a tertiary, multidisciplinary clinic specializing in pediatric chronic pain. After controlling for key sociodemographic and pain-related characteristics, higher AS was associated with poorer perceived general and mental health, greater impairment in family activities, lower self-esteem, increased behavior problems, and more social/academic limitations due to emotional problems. AS accounted for 4% to 28% of incremental variance in these HRQOL domains above and beyond the demographic and pain-related variables. However, AS was not significantly associated with physical functioning or with academic/social limitations due to physical health. Additional research is required to delineate possible mechanisms by which AS may influence certain aspects of children's HRQOL but not others.
   Perspective: The present findings support the evaluation of AS in pediatric chronic pain patients as part of a comprehensive assessment battery. The links between AS and multiple HRQOL domains suggest that treatment components aimed at reducing AS may lead to enhanced psychosocial wellbeing in children with chronic pain.

AB A developmental perspective implies similar personality pathology dimensions for adolescents and adults. The present study examined the applicability of a dimensional approach in incarcerated delinquent female and male juveniles using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). A sample of detained adolescents (n = 146) was compared to adolescent students (n = 98) and a healthy control group of adults (n = 82). Additionally, psychopathology was assessed in the incarcerated juveniles using the Youth Self Report (YSR). Analyses of variance revealed higher scores on personality disorder traits for juveniles compared to adult controls; the highest scores were observed in criminal juveniles. Hypothesized relationships could be confirmed within the criminal sample between the DAPP factor Emotional Dysregulation and the YSR Internalization syndrome scale, and between the DAPP factor Dissocial Behavior and the YSR Externalization syndrome scale. Moreover, gender differences in the criminal sample are discussed. Results indicate that the DAPP-BQ can assess personality disorder traits in delinquent and nondetained juveniles with sufficient group and criterion validity.

AB This study explores the relationships between four emotional competencies (i.e., intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, adaptability skills, and stress management skills) and four factors of maladjustment (i.e., antisocial behavior, anger control problems, emotional distress, and negative self problems) in 217 students from Singapore. Multiple regression findings indicated that stress management skills significantly predicted overall maladjustment, antisocial behavior, anger control problems, emotional distress, and negative self problems. With regard to the three remaining emotional competencies, interpersonal skills significantly predicted negative self problems, while intrapersonal skills and adaptability skills were not predictive of any of the four factors of maladjustment. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the potentially facilitative effect of the interaction between older adults and adolescents. For older adults, the interaction was expected to compensate for age-related deficits (e.g., cognitive performance, cognitive-affective complexity). In case of the adolescents, an optimization of development was expected (e.g., prosocial behavior, communion goals). Ninety older women (70-74 years) and 90 adolescent girls (14-15 years) were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions. In each of the conditions, nonfamiliar dyads collaborated on I task. The conditions varied according to the age composition and the type of contextual demand (high vs. low support of generativity [older adults] and identity formation [adolescents]). Individual performance measures were assessed immediately after the interaction. As expected, intergenerational settings characterized by high support of generativity and identity formation resulted in more prosocial behavior in adolescents. Furthermore, the results lent partial support to the hypothesis that in older adults, this setting facilitated higher complexity of emotion regulation as well as higher levels of performance in measures of speed and word fluency.

AB Among the many transitions and passages students face during their school years, the entry into middle school is one of the most difficult. During this period, it is crucial for schools and families to work together in order to establish a constructive framework that can foster positive development. This article discusses the important academic, social and emotional competencies on which schools and families should focus during this critical transition period. Promoting these competencies will help adolescents develop positive bonds to home and school, a greater sense of personal possibilities and a constructive view of themselves in their social contexts. A competence-based framework, based on providing adolescents with opportunities for appreciation, belonging, social-emotional competence development, confidence and contributions is presented to guide home-school collaboration. The article concludes with examples of collaborative activities that have been successfully implemented.

AB Interviews with 75 teenagers and young adults were performed to investigate how young people with dyslexia experienced school in terms of well-being, educational achievement, self-esteem, peer relations and belief in their future. Results from earlier studies suggest that secondary emotional problems are common. The first six grades in school were experienced by the interviewees as full of distress and failure for a majority. Though peer relations were often good, many had experienced bullying. As they grew older, problems were more limited to reading and writing activities. This was thought to be an effect of acknowledgement and compartmentalization of the disability along with choices of school curricula and occupations in line with subjects' talents and capacities. Academic self-esteem seemed low, and most subjects had chosen vocational programmes in secondary school and had decided not to go to college. The most optimistic subjects were those who had finished school and were permanently employed. Early diagnosis along with careful explanation of the disability was recommended as well as the encouragement of dyslexic children in areas where they can do well and which makes them view themselves positively.

AB Introduction. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) is the most commonly used parent-completed instrument that assesses child and adolescent psychopathology. It has been used in epidemiology and clinical studies. The last version contains DSM-oriented subscales.
   Objective. Investigate the psychometric properties of the CBCL/6-18 and develops a valid and reliable Mexican version.
   Method. Psychologists and child psychiatrists adapted the Spanish version of CBCL/6-18, and a back translation was done by a native English speaker. Discrepancies in the adaptation were solved by consensus. The checklist was applied to children in the community and to outpatients from a psychiatric children hospital. Reliability was evaluated by estimating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) on all scales: retest at one week was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). A ROC curve was performed to estimate a cut-off which correctly identified children from the clinically referred patients and children recruited in the community (non-referred). Mean differences for the groups were calculated with the Student's t test.
   Results. The Mexican version of the CBCL/6-18 showed that the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.90 for internalizing problems, 0.94 for externalizing problems and 0.97 for the total problem scale. The ICC was 0.97 for the total problem scale. Significant differences were found between the mean score in broad band, narrow and the new DSM/oriented scales.
   Conclusions. The Mexican version of CBCL/6-1 8 is a reliable and valid screening instrument for clinical and epidemiologic use.

AB This study set out to identify the associations between ergonomics and other factors with back and neck pain among schoolchildren. Self-reported questionnaires were used to record health outcomes and potential risk factors in state schools. Six hundred and seventy-nine schoolchildren from Surrey in the United Kingdom aged 11-14 years took part. Twenty-seven percent of children reported having neck pain, 18% reported having upper back pain, and 22% reported having low back pain. A forward stepwise logistic regression was performed with pain categories the dependent variables. Neck pain was significantly associated with school furniture features, emotional and conduct problems, family history of low back pain and previous treatment for musculoskeletal disorders. Upper back pain was associated with school bag weight (3.4-4.45 kg), school furniture features, emotional problems and previous treatment for musculoskeletal disorders. Low back pain was associated with school furniture features, emotional problems, family history and previous injury or accident. it is important to recognise the influence of physical, psychological and family factors in children's pain.

AB The studies reported herein describe the successful development and validation of a youth mental health screening instrument for identifying psychosocial distress in pediatric care patients. As a subset of 12 items from the well-established Youth Outcome Questionnaire-2.01 (Y-OQ-2.01), the Youth Outcome Questionnaire-12 (Y-OQ-12) screen intends to be the first stage in a two-stage screening process. Patients screened as positive complete the full-length Y-OQ-2.01 in the second stage. A stage two score in the clinical range can serve as a baseline in continuous outcome tracking using the Y-OQ-2.01. The 12 parent-report items of the Y-OQ-12 were selected using a combination of items from the Y-OQ-2.01 using a known-groups approach based on community (n = 500) and outpatient psychiatric (n 500) samples. The sensitivity of the Y-OQ-12 was 0.84, with a specificity of 0.82 and an internal consistency of 0.90. Two factors emerged, accounting for 48% and 9% of the variance ('mood/behavioural symptom distress' and 'quality of life', respectively). A second validation study involving 371 youth from pediatric settings in three US states compared the Y-OQ-12 with the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Present State. The YOQ-12 demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and predictive power that were comparable to the PSC and shows promise for screening in routine practice. The authors encourage the use of the Y-OQ-12 in practice and await the replication of these findings in future research. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Associations between reciprocal and complementary sibling interactions, sibling relationship quality and children's socio-emotional problem solving were examined in 40 grade 5-6 children (M age = 11.5 years) from middle class, Caucasian, Canadian families using a multi-method approach (i.e. interviews, self-report questionnaires, daily diary checklist, narrative task). Findings demonstrated that reciprocal sibling interactions were positively associated with warmth, mutual esteem, happy daily exchanges, and negatively related to rivalry and dominance, whereas complementary interactions were positively related to upsetting daily exchanges. Further, reciprocal and complementary interactions differed significantly in relation to several relationship qualities, with reciprocal interactions emerging as a significantly stronger correlate of happy exchanges. Only reciprocal interactions were positively correlated with socio-emotional problem solving. Finally, birth order moderated the negative association of reciprocal interactions with,rivalry and dominance and the positive association with socio-emotional problem solving. In each case, the effect was stronger for younger members of the sibling dyad. Findings are discussed in light of recent theory on the sibling relationship and children's development.

AB We studied the psychological importance of best friend and intimate partner in the personal network of adolescents and early adults, and links between relationships and emotional problems as well as links between relationships themselves. A series of hypotheses derived from the "intimate partner (IP) general saliency perspective" and "the intimate partner (IP) early adult saliency perspective" was tested. The IP general saliency perspective predicts that the relationship with intimate partner is psychologically more meaningful than the relationship with best friend in adolescence and early adulthood. The IP early adult saliency perspective predicts that the relationship with intimate partner does not have superior psychological value in adolescence and acquires it in early adulthood. Data of Waves 1 and 3 of a six-year longitudinal study of 1041 adolescents and early adults, aged 12-23 at Wave 1, were used. Results showed that when early adults and adolescents make the shift from best friend to intimate partner, relational commitment becomes stronger and emotional problems become smaller, supporting the IP general saliency perspective. Results also showed that only in early adulthood was a stronger commitment to intimate partner related to less emotional problems, and more parental support was linked to stronger relational commitment to intimate partner. These findings clearly support the IP early adult saliency perspective. In sum, when adolescents and early adults make the transition to the intimate partnership they enter a psychologically more meaningful relationship. When individuals enter early adulthood the psychological value of the intimate partner relationship becomes more salient: the quality of the intimate relationship becomes more stable and linked to emotional adjustment.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this article were to examine the literature published from 1982 to 2006 and to evaluate prevalence of dental fear and anxiety (DFA) and dental behaviour management problems (DBMP) in children and adolescents, and their relationships to age, sex, general anxiety, temperament, and general behavioural problems.
   Methods: A broad search of the PubMed database was performed using three combinations of search terms.
   Results: A large proportion of the identified articles could not be used for the review owing to inadequate endpoints, measures or poor study design. Thirty-two papers of acceptable quality were identified and reviewed. The prevalence of both DFA and DBMP were estimated to 9%, with a decrease in prevalence with age. DFA/DBMP were more frequent in girls. DFA/DBMP were related to general fear and both internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems, although these relationships were not clear-cut. Temperament was related to both DFA and DBMP but with different temperamental characteristics, while general behavioural problems mainly correlated with DBMP.
   Conclusions: DFA/DBMP are common, and several psychological factors are associated with the development of these problems. In order to better understand these relationships, a number of issues concerning design of research and measurement of DFA/DBMP have to be dealt with.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury is the intentional destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned. In this practice-friendly review, the authors summarize the empirical research on who self-injures, why people self-injure, and what treatments have demonstrated effectiveness. Self-injury is more common in adolescents and young adults as compared to adults. Common forms include cutting, severe scratching, burning, and banging or hitting; most individuals who self-injure have used more than one method. Although diagnostically heterogeneous, self-injurers typically exhibit two prominent characteristics: negative emotionality and self-derogation. Self-injury is most often performed to temporarily alleviate intense negative emotions, but may also serve to express self-directed anger or disgust, influence or seek help from others, end periods of dissociation or depersonalization, and help resist suicidal thoughts. Psychotherapies that emphasize emotion regulation, functional assessment, and problem solving appear to be most effective in treating self-injury. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Self-injury is a dangerous and pervasive behavior problem among adolescents. Clinical trials testing the effectiveness of psychological treatments for this behavior problem among adolescents are lacking; however, several treatments have shown promise, such as those focused on teaching emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal skills. The authors provide a case illustration of the use of dialectical behavior therapy, which is one of the most promising treatments for adolescent self-injury. They then discuss several important considerations in the treatment of self-injury, such as the use of strategies to increase treatment participation and the assessment of self-injury and related target behaviors over the course of treatment to determine its effectiveness and to manage risk of self-injury.

AB In our well-baby clinic study, we investigated how early maternal sensitivity predicted child behaviour two years later. On the basis of the early (6-8 weeks) maternal sensitivity (the CARE-Index 1), 74 dyads were divided into the groups 'good enough' (73.0%), 'moderate problems' (13.5%) and 'at risk' (13.5%). At child age of 24 months, the mother-child interactive style was assessed using the CARE-Index (11), the mothers reported child behavioural problems on the CBCL/2-3, and public health nurses reported their worries about the children and dyads and the need for extra services. The 'risk group' mothers were assessed as the least sensitive and most unresponsive, and their children as the least co-operative and most passive. Also, the public health nurses were most often worried about the 'risk group' dyads and children. They arranged extra well-baby clinic visits and wished to have supervision for themselves in dealing with the risk group dyads. An unexpected finding was that the 'risk group' mothers reported fewer child behavioural problems than mothers in the 'moderate problem group'. In conclusion, unresponsive mothers may see their children differently than do professionals, and this discrepancy makes both screening and preventive work more challenging. Use of multiple informants and observations is essential when assessing this age group.

AB In this study, we examined the link between appraisals of problem tasks as a threat or challenge, suicidality and the extent to which this link is mediated by hopelessness and problem-solving performance. We also examined the possible role that cognitive rigidity and emotional regulation play in this link. Participants consisted of three adolescent groups: suicidal inpatients, nonsuicidal inpatients, and a nonclinical control group. Participants received a problem-solving task and scales measuring the above-indicated variables. The two inpatient groups differed significantly from the control group on almost all variables. Moreover, appraisals of problem tasks as a threat emerged as a distal factor of suicidality, mediated by hopelessness and problem-solving performance even after controlling for cognitive rigidity and emotion regulation. The discussion focuses on the ways that appraisals of problem tasks can affect suicidal behavior.

AB ONER, P., DIRIK, E.B., TANER, Y., CAYKOYLU, A. and ANLAR, O. Association between Low Serum Ferritin and Restless Legs Syndrome in Patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Tohoku J. Exp. Med., 2007, 213 (3), 269-276 - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. It has been suggested that ADHD symptoms are associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS), which is a neurological condition that is defined by an irresistible urge to move the legs. Increasing evidence suggests iron deficiency may underlie common pathophysiological mechanisms in subjects with ADHD and with RLS. To further define the relationship between iron deficiency and RLS in children and adolescents with ADHD, we evaluated 87 ADHD subjects: 79 boys and 8 girls with age 9.3 +/- 2.5 years (6-16 years). Various psychopathologies and the severity of the ADHD symptoms and serum ferritin levels were assessed. Diagnosis of RLS was made according to the International RLS Group criteria. The patients were evaluated for the iron deficiency (ferritin < 12 ng/ml). RLS was found in 29 (33.3%) of the 87 ADHD subjects. Parent-and teacher-rated behavioral and emotional problems and the severity of ADHD symptoms were not significantly different between ADHD subjects with RLS and those without RLS (n = 58). The rate of iron deficiency was significantly higher in ADHD subjects with RLS (n = 6, 20.7%) when compared with ADHD subjects without RLS (n = 1, 1.7%, p = 0.005). Our results showed that depleted iron stores might increase the risk of having RLS in ADHD subjects. Iron deficiency, which is associated with both ADHD and RLS, seems to be an important modifying factor in the relationship between these two conditions. restless legs syndrome; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; iron deficiency; ferritin; doparnme (c) 2007 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB Sexual assault and rape routinely produce extreme distress and negative psychological reactions in victims. Further, past research suggests that victims are at increased risk of developing substance use or abuse post-rape. The post-rape forensic medical exam may itself exacerbate peritraumatic distress because it includes cues that may serve as reminders of the assault, thereby potentiating post-assault negative sequelae. To address these problems, a two-part video intervention was developed to take advantage of the existing sexual assault forensic exam infrastructure, and to specifically (a) minimize anxiety/discomfort during forensic examinations, thereby reducing risk of future emotional problems, and (b) prevent increased substance use and abuse following sexual assault. Updated findings with a sample of 268 sexual assault victims participating in the forensic medical exam and completing one or more follow-up assessments at: (1)< 3 months post-assault; (2) 3 to 6 months post-assault; or (3) 6 months or longer post-assault indicated that the video was associated with significantly lower frequency of marijuana use at each time point, among women who reported use prior to the assault.

AB Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can have varying degrees of cognitive impairment, and are at risk for social, emotional, and behavioral dysfunction. We undertook an evaluation of social, emotional, and behavioral functioning Of Youth with NF1 and peers from multiple perspectives. We hypothesized that children with NF1 would have more psychosocial difficulties, which would be positively associated with neurological involvement. We compared 58 children with NF1, ages 7-15, with comparison classroom peers, classmates who were same race/gender and closest date of birth. Peer relationships, emotional wellbeing, and behavior were evaluated from multiple perspectives in multiple settings. Results showed that teachers perceived children with NF1 as more prosocial (i.e., polite, helpful to others). Teachers and peers viewed children with NF1 as displaying less leadership behavior and as more socially sensitive-isolated (i.e., often left out, trouble making friends). Children with NF1 had fewer friendships and were less well liked by peers. Mothers and fathers reported more problems with social functioning among children with NF1. Few group differences in emotional well-being and behavior were identified according to child and father report. However, mothers perceived children with NF1 to have more emotional problems relative to comparison peers, predominantly among older children. Neurological involvement was significantly related to psychosocial problems. We conclude that children with NF1 are frequently socially isolated and rejected by peers; and that greater neurological involvement is associated with more emotional problems. Central nervous system involvement appears to play a key role in identifying children at risk for problems with friendships, social acceptance, and emotional functioning (i.e., depression).

AB Three social contexts-family, neighborhood youth centers, and peer relationships-were examined in relation to several measures of adjustment among 1,406 mostly minority, inner-city adolescents. Family and center involvement were directly related to 3 of the 4 adjustment measures (i.e., achievement orientation, emotion regulation, attitudes toward school). Peer connections interacted with family and center involvement to also predict these variables. Substance use, the fourth adjustment measure, was related only to family involvement. Significant 3-way interactions suggested that within urban settings, favorable attitudes toward school may best be achieved when family, neighborhood youth center, and peer involvement are all strong. The combined effects of these 3 contexts appear to be greater among younger adolescents. Implications for promoting urban youth development programs are discussed.

AB Studies have shown that improved parenting mediates treatment outcomes for aggressive children, but we lack fine-grained descriptions of how parent-child interactions change with treatment. The current study addresses this gap by applying new dynamic systems methods to study parent-child emotional behavior patterns. These methods tap moment-to-moment changes in interaction processes within and across sessions and quantify previously unmeasured processes of change related to treatment success. Aggressive children and their parents were recruited from combined Parent Management Training and Cognitive-behavioral programs in "real world" clinical settings. Behavioral outcomes were assessed by reports from parents and clinicians. At pre- and post-treatment, home visits were videotaped while parents and children discussed consecutively: a positive topic, a mutually unresolved problem, and another positive topic. Results showed that significant improvements in children's externalizing behavior were associated with increases in parent-child emotional flexibility during the problem-solving discussion. Also, dyads who improved still expressed negative emotions, but they acquired the skills to repair conflicts, shifting out of their negative interactions to mutually positive patterns.

AB The current study explored the associations between activity-based identity experiences and youth outcomes. Participants were 107 high school students and one parent or guardian of each from three communities in a Northeastern state. Youth completed a measure of activity-based identity experiences (Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) [Waterman, A. S. (1990). Personal expressiveness: Philosophical and psychological foundations. Journal of Mind and Behavior, 11, 47-74]), as well as measures of psychological well-being, substance use, and delinquency. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist [Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 and 1991 profile. Burlington, VT: University of Vermont Department of Psychiatry]. Together, three identity experiences derived from the PEAQ, personal expressiveness, goal-directed behavior, and flow, were significant predictors of adolescent-reported delinquency and well-being. Goal-directed behavior also uniquely predicted adolescent-reported delinquency and well-being. Suggestions for future research and potential implications for intervention are discussed.

AB Although the stability and changeability of personality has long been debated, many studies now agree that personality changes over the life course. Although the changes in rank-order and mean-level stability are well established, the stability in personality type membership during adolescence is not yet clear. Little research has been conducted on the associations between change in personality type membership and anxiety. A total of 827 adolescents (10-20 years) completed personality and anxiety questionnaires on 2 waves of the CONflict And Management Of RElationships study (CONAMORE). We found that the stability in personality type membership was moderate. The change from undercontroller to overcontroller was the most frequently occurring change. Furthermore, the stability in type membership was related to stability in anxiety level and change in type membership was related to anxiety change. More specifically, the resilient-overcontroller group demonstrated an increase in anxiety level, whereas the overcontroller-resilient group demonstrated a decrease.

AB Background: Much of the evidence suggesting that loneliness is a risk factor for socio-emotional adjustment difficulties comes from studies with older children and adolescents. Comparatively less is known about the mental health implications of loneliness in early childhood. The goals of the present study were to provide additional convergent validity of the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire for Young Children (Cassidy & Asher, 1992) and explore potential gender differences in relations between loneliness and behavior problems in early childhood. Methods: A multiple source assessment of 139 kindergarten-aged children (M-age = 64.76 mos., SD = 4.48) was undertaken, including parental ratings, behavioral observations, child interviews, and teacher ratings. Results: Overall, loneliness was positively associated with anxiety, aggression, and peer exclusion. However, several gender differences were also observed. Conclusions: Loneliness may be a marker variable for both early internalizing and externalizing problems. However, gender differences in the behavioral associates of loneliness are also evident.

AB As a basis for theories of psychopathology, clinical psychology and related disciplines need sound taxonomies that are generalizable across diverse populations. To test the generalizability of a statistically derived 8-syndrome taxonomic model for youth psychopathology, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the Youth Self-Report (T. M. Achenbach & L. A. Rescorla, 2001) completed by 30,243 youths 11-18 years old from 23 societies. The 8-syndrome taxonomic model met criteria for good fit to the data from each society. This was consistent with findings for the parent-completed Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) and the teacher-completed Teacher's Report Form (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) from many societies. Separate CFAs by gender and age group supported the 8-syndrome model for boys and girls and for younger and older youths within individual societies. The findings provide initial support for the taxonomic generalizability of the 8-syndrome model across very diverse societies, both genders, and 2 age groups.

AB Objective: To study whether behavioral and emotional problems during childhood predicted early sexual debut, risky sex at age 21 years, and sexually transmitted infections up to age 21 years. Some possible mediational pathways were also explored.
   Method: Participants were enrolled in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (n = 1,037), a prospective, longitudinal study of a New Zealand birth cohort bom in 1972-1973. Data obtained at ages 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 21 years were used. Adjustment was made for gender, socioeconomic status, parenting factors, and residence changes. Results: High levels of antisocial behavior between age 5 and 11 years were associated with increased odds of early sexual debut (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.17, 95% confidence [CI] 1.34-3.54) and risky sex (AOR 1.88, 95% Cl 1.04-3.40). No relationship was observed between hyperactivity and later sexual health outcomes. In contrast, high levels of anxiety were associated with reduced odds of risky sex (AOR 0.45, 95% Cl 0.25-0.80) and sexually transmitted infections (AOR 0.34, 95% Cl 0.17-0.70). Involvement with delinquent peers explained some of the association between antisocial behavior and early sexual debut and risky sex. A poor relationship with parents also explained some of the association between antisocial behavior and early sexual debut. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate links between behavioral and emotional problems occurring early in life and later deleterious sexual health outcomes. Targeting antisocial behavior and teaching accurate appraisals of danger during childhood may help mitigate these negative consequences.

AB Objective: The societal changes experienced by Western societies in recent decades have raised concerns about increases in the level of children's mental health problems. Although studies of secular changes in the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses have indeed shown increases, their results may have been influenced by methodological problems, such as changing diagnostic criteria. Although repeated population studies using identical measures have not indicated such a clear increase in mental health problems, these studies have been limited to school-age children. We therefore investigated changes in Dutch parents'reports of very young children's emotional and behavioral problems over a 14-year period. Method: We compared Child Behavior Checklist scores across two Dutch general population samples of 2- and 3-year-olds, one sample assessed in 1989 and one in 2003. Results: Results revealed only a few changes over time, indicating small decreases in parent-reported problems. Between 1989 and 2003, there were decreases in the mean scores and in the proportions of children with deviant scores on the Anxious/Depressed, Total Problems, Internalizing, and DSM-oriented aftention-deficit/hyperactivity problems scales. Conclusions: Despite indications of increasing problems among school-age children and adolescents, parent-reported problem levels of very young Dutch children have not increased. Our findings even showed some small improvements in parents' reports of very young children's functioning between 1989 and 2003.

AB This study tested associations between problems in parent-youth relationships and problems with alcohol use among college students (N = 1592) using structural equation modeling. Hypotheses were that relationships between both substance-specific parenting factors (parental drinking) and non-substance-specific parenting factors (parental intrusive control and lack of support) and college student drinking behaviors would be mediated by the developmental tasks of managing difficult emotions and establishing a mature psychosocial identity. Sex, ethnicity and age were entered as control variables in the analyses and were tested for moderating effects. Results showed that the unconstrained model for males and females differed significantly from a model in which the two groups were constrained to be similar. Among young women, emotion regulation and psychosocial maturity were partial mediators of the effects of parent problems on alcohol use problems. Among young men, parent problems were indirectly related to alcohol use problems through emotion regulation. Implications for alcohol use prevention activities on college campuses are discussed.

AB The goal of this study was to examine whether the links between attachment security and social behavior in late adolescence were mediated by emotional competence. One hundred and seventeen late adolescents completed self-report measures of parent and peer attachment, social behavior, and emotional competence. Attachment security with both parents and peers was significantly related to aspects of adolescent emotional and social competence. A path model revealed that parent and peer attachment had no direct links with social behavior. Instead, the links between parent and peer attachment and social behavior were indirect, mediated through aspects of emotional competence. These findings suggest that secure attachment relationships foster appropriate social behavior by promoting high levels of emotional awareness, empathy, positive expressiveness, and low levels of negative dominant expressiveness.

AB The Youth Self-Report Form's (YSR's) factor model was derived from traditional exploratory factor analytical procedures. Assuming appropriate model specification, psychometrically invariant items, and that its items provide useful psychometric information across nations omitted from its normative samples, the YSR is widely used in cross-national studies of nonreferred children. Item response theory analytical procedures reveal (a) 2 dimensions partly overlapping with the YSR's Internalizing and Externalizing second-order factors; (b) variance (i.e., differential item functioning) in how well a few items discriminate for nonreferred children across two nations; and (c) variance in estimating severity levels in children with identical psychopathological severity cross-nationally. Addressing psychometric variance, limiting redundancy, and matching children's psychopathological severity levels with items measuring this severity might promote more accurate and economical assessment.

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated that low birth weight (LBW) is associated with the development of medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression. One possible mechanism through which LBW might increase risk for both medical and psychiatric disorders is by altering the biologic systems (such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function) that govern emotion regulation and physical reactivity. In this study, we conducted secondary data analyses in a longitudinal study originally designed to understand the intergenerational transmission of major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined the risk for both medical and psychiatric illnesses known to be influenced by HPA axis dysregulation in the context of parental depression. The study had 2 primary objectives: (1) to examine whether LBW increases the risk of selected adult illness that may be influenced by the HPA axis and (2) to examine whether the increased risk of illness varies by parental depression status. We conducted longitudinal assessments of 244 offspring of depressed and nondepressed parents for more than 20 years. Psychopathology and medical illness were assessed by direct interview conducted by clinicians blind to risk status and previous diagnosis. We examined the effect of BW in 3 categories: less than 2.5 kg (LBW), 2.5-3.5 kg, and more than 3.5 kg (reference group). Offspring with LBW had a significantly increased risk of MDD, anxiety disorders, phobia, suicidal ideation, impaired functioning, allergies, and hypertension compared to those with BW exceeding 3.5 kg. The association between LBW and depression was stronger among children of depressed parents than among children of nondepressed parents, with an interaction term (BW and parental depression status) significant for MDD (P =.05), suggesting that parental depression may augment the impact of LBW on offspring depression: (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

ID DECISION-MAKING; YOUNG-ADULTS; CHILDREN; SAMPLE; HEALTH
AB Much is known about adolescent help seeking for severe mental health problems. Little is currently understood about the professionals that adolescents would seek help from for milder emotional and behavioural difficulties. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 968 adolescents (53% male), aged 13-14 years in school year 9, and 15-16 years in school year 11 (64% male), attending a purposive sample of four medium to large secondary schools in Devon, UK, during February 2005. Questionnaires were completed by adolescents during whole class teaching sessions with all in attendance being willing to participate. However, 39 (4%) responses were uncompleted or incorrectly completed and removed from subsequent analysis. Questionnaires contained a series of commonly experienced difficulties and asked adolescents to indicate who they would seek help from first, if anyone, from a list of professionals identified as common providers of support. Logistic regression analyses indicated that intention to seek help varied between a low of 30 % for adolescents in Year 11 on the difficulty 'were arguing all the time with your parents' to a high of 95% for females on the difficulty 'had been unfairly treated or spoken to by a teacher' with Year and Sex influencing each difficulty separately. With the exception of the difficulty 'were feeling "down" for a long time' there was a high degree of discrimination regarding the professional group (School vs. Health) that would be approached for help. With respect to specific professionals, the Form tutor featured prominently across several difficulties involving school, friends and family (range 53-65%), but also significantly across several difficulties suggestive of emotional problems (range 49-61 %). General practitioners were commonly identified as providing help with difficulties sleeping (76%), and along with the school nurse with problems concerning health advice (range 38-49%). Findings highlight the influence of Year and Sex, and importance of the Form tutor in adolescent help seeking across the range of difficulties. A need is identified for further training of Form tutors in recognition of their role in supporting the interface between adolescents and services aimed at engaging young people and a recognition by health and social care professionals regarding the importance of this role.

AB Behavioural sleep problems (childhood insomnias) can cause distress for both parents and children. This paper reports a model describing predictors of high sleep problem scores in a representative population-based random sample survey of non-Aboriginal singleton children born in 1995 and 1996 (1085 girls and 1129 boys) in Western Australia. Longitudinal repeated data were collected up to age 4 years by caregiver report. Children's sleep rhythmicity levels in their first year, as well as conflicted and lax parenting in their second year, predicted higher scores on the sleep problem scale from the Child Behaviour Checklist/2-3 in the children's third year. Higher scores on the sleep problem scale in the children's third year predicted higher scores on the aggressive behaviour subscale of the Child Behaviour Checklist/ 4-16. The results support a model in which sleep problems mediated the relationship between parental conflict and aggresive behaviour, even when controlling for maternal depression, which has been associated with children's aggressive behaviour.

AB The purpose of the present research was to utilize the Youth Self Report (YSR) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to identify behavioral and emotional characteristics of abused children, and to explore the possibility of clinical application of these instruments. The behavior of children in a children's home was assessed through the Youth Self Report, which was completed by the children themselves, and the Child Behavior Checklist, which was completed by care workers. Valid responses were obtained for 75 boys and 49 girls, whose average age was 12.51 years. Responses on the Youth Self Report and the Child Behavior Checklist were found to be correlated with respect to scores for behavioral problems, but it was also found that differences may exist in the perception of competence. When the data from the children who had and had not been abused were compared, it was found that both instruments revealed that maltreatment of the children had affected their behavioral and emotional problems. It was also found that the care workers objectively grasped social problems and attention problems in a way that may have been difficult for the children to discern. Furthermore, subjective issues, such as somatic complaints and thinking problems, were difficult to perceive. It was suggested that behavioral and emotional problems of abused children may be understood better through cross-informant assessment.

AB Background: We examined whether face-emotion labeling deficits are illness-specific or an epiphenomenon of generalized impairment in pediatric psychiatric disorders involving mood and behavioral dysregulation.
   Method: Two hundred fifty-two youths (7-18 years old) completed child and adult facial expression recognition subtests from the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy (DANVA) instrument. Forty-two participants had bipolar disorder (BD), 39 had severe mood dysregulation (SMD; i.e., chronic irritability, hyperarousal without manic episodes), 44 had anxiety and/or major depressive disorders (ANX/MDD), 35 had attention-deficit/hyperactivity and/or conduct disorder (ADHD/CD), and 92 were controls. Dependent measures were number of errors labeling happy, angry, sad, or fearful emotions.
   Results: BD and SMD patients made more errors than ANX/MDD, ADHD/CD, or controls when labeling adult or child emotional expressions. BD and SMD patients did not differ in their emotion-labeling deficits.
   Conclusions: Face-emotion labeling deficits differentiate BD and SMD patients from patients with ANX/MDD or ADHD/CD and controls. The extent to which such deficits cause vs. result from emotional dysregulation requires further study.

   Results: The percentages of Total Problems scores in the borderline clinical range in this population as found with the CBCL, TRF and SCICA are 28%, 32% and 49-63% respectively. Expert dossier ratings identified psychiatric caseness in 49% and DSM-classifications in 46% of the adolescents (primary classifications: emotional disorder 27%, behavioral disorder 11%, other disorder 7%). Cross-informant agreement between single ratings and expert dossier ratings was better than agreement between single ratings. Logistic regression analyses revealed that low IQ, a signing mode of communication and a history of three or more physical disorders were associated with psychiatric caseness.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest a high prevalence of psychopathology in the population studied and argue for a special focus on the early detection of significant emotional and behavioral problems as well as a multi-informant approach to the assessment of disorder in deaf children and adolescents. The correlational findings support the view that it is not deafness per se that contributes to psychiatric problems.

AB This study examined differences between deaf and hearing students' perceptions of their social emotional adjustment as they transition to college. The 16PF-Adolescent Personality Questionnaire Life Difficulties Scale was completed by 205 deaf students and 185 hearing students. A multivariate analyses of variance and subsequent univariate tests found that deaf students rated themselves as experiencing significantly higher home life difficulties than hearing students, and deaf students rated themselves as having fewer coping difficulties than hearing students. Results also revealed a hearing status by gender interaction with deaf females rating themselves significantly higher on worry than deaf males, hearing females, and hearing males. An exploratory factor analysis of the Life Difficulties subscales yielded three factors of life difficulties for deaf college students but only two factors for hearing college students. These findings suggest that there are differences between deaf and hearing students who are transitioning to college with regards to their social-emotional adjustment.

AB This study compared parents' ratings of behavioral and emotional problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 199 1; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) for general population samples of children ages 6 to 16 from 31 societies (N = 55,508). Effect sizes for society ranged from.03 to.14. Effect sizes for gender were <=.0 1, with girls generally scoring higher on Internalizing problems and boys generally scoring higher on Externalizing problems. Effect sizes for age were <=.0 1 and varied across types of problems. Total Problems scores for 19 of 31 societies were within I SD of the overall mean of 22.5. Bisociety correlations for mean item scores averaged.74. The findings indicate that parents' reports of children's problems were similar in many ways across highly diverse societies. Nonetheless, effect sizes for society were larger than those for gender and age, indicating the need to take account of multicultural variations in parents' reports of children's problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether Learning Sobriety Together, a treatment for substance abuse that combines behavioral couples therapy and individual counseling, had comparable secondary benefits on the internalizing and externalizing behaviors of adolescent versus preadolescent siblings living in homes with their alcoholic fathers (N = 13 1) and their non-substance-abusing mothers. During a 17-month assessment period, the association between parents' functioning (i.e., fathers' drinking as determined by percentage of days abstinent and parents' dyadic adjustment) and children's adjustment (as rated by mothers, fathers, and children's teachers) was stronger for preadolescents than for their adolescent siblings, particularly in terms of children's externalizing behaviors. Interventions that reduce paternal drinking and improve couple functioning may serve as an important preventative intervention for preadolescents in these homes, whereas adolescents may need more intensive interventions to address internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB Objective To examine how children's and mother's appraisals of each other's involvement in coping with diabetes events are associated with emotional adjustment. Methods One hundred and twenty-seven children (ages 10-15 years) with type I diabetes and their mothers reported on their own emotional adjustment and how each other was involved in coping strategies surrounding diabetes stressful events. Results Appraisals that mothers and children were uninvolved with each other's stressors were associated with greater depressive symptoms and less positive mood; children's appraisals of mother's supportive involvement with children's less depressive symptoms, and appraisals of collaborative involvement with less depressive symptoms and more positive mood for both mothers and children. Appraised control was most detrimental for children for older females and for mothers of younger children. Conclusions Collaborative involvement in coping efforts may be an important resource for addressing negative emotions that both children and mothers experience surrounding type I diabetes, especially across adolescence.

AB Objective: To study associations between comorbid psychopathology and long-term outcomes in a large birth cohort sample from age 8 to early adulthood. Method: The sample included long-term outcome data on 2,556 Finnish boys born in 1981. The aim was to study the impact of early childhood psychopathology types (externalizing versus internalizing versus both) and informant sources (self-report versus parent/teacher reports) on young adult outcomes, based on data from a military registry of psychiatric diagnosis, a police registry on criminal and drug offenses, and self-reported problems in late adolescence and early adulthood. Results: Children with combined conduct and internalizing problems at age 8 had the worst outcomes and highest risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders, criminal offenses, and self-reported problems at follow-up, with 62% of these boys manifesting psychiatric disorders, committing criminal offenses, or both at follow-up. Although these children included only 4% of the sample, they were responsible for 26% of all criminal offenses at follow-up. In contrast, children with conduct problems without internalizing problems and those with attention problems had much less severe but nonetheless elevated levels of risk of antisocial personality disorder and criminal offenses. Long-term outcomes for these two groups were substantially better than for children with combined conduct and internalizing problems. Children with "pure" emotional problems had an elevated risk only of similar emotional problems at follow-up. Conclusions: The subjective suffering and long-term burden to society is especially high among children with comorbid conduct and internalizing problems in childhood. A major challenge for child and adolescent psychiatric, education, and social services is to develop effective intervention strategies focusing on these children. Additional longitudinal epidemiological studies of this comorbidity group are needed, and, if replicated, such findings will have important implications for future diagnostic classification systems (DSM-V).

AB Background Aim of this study was to examine effects of an outpatient intervention program for obese children.
   Method 45 obese children were treated with a cognitive-behavioural intervention program (IG) and were compared with 21 children of a waiting list (WG). Weight, self esteem, emotional and behaviour problems were measured at the beginning (TO) and the end (of T1) of the intervention. Additionally, predictors of therapy success were examined.
   Results The intervention program lead to a moderate reduction of weight, whereas there was no weight reduction in the waiting group. Furthermore, self esteem increased and emotional problems decreased in the IG. Neither a positive family history of obesity nor the weight at TO did predict treatment outcome.
   Conclusion Obese children profited from the cognitive-behavioral intervention program, weight reduction was, however, only moderate. Therefore, specific predictors for therapy success should be evaluated in further studies.

AB The main aim of this study was to explore associations between students' perceptions of learning environment factors and their reports of emotional and behavioural problems (EBP) and to what degree students' coping styles could influence this relation. The study was conducted as a survey among a representative sample of 2006 Norwegian ninth-graders. Results showed that students' coping styles accounted for some of the covariance between learning environment factors and EBP. This indicates that associations found between learning environment factors and EBP to some degree could be reflections of students' coping styles, in the sense that coping styles affect students' perceptions of the learning environment or the learning environment itself. However, two-thirds of the covariance between learning environment factors and EBP was not accounted for by individual students' coping styles. The unique effect of learning environment factors on variances in off-task orientation, externalising problems and emotional problems was 22%, 13% and 4%, respectively.

AB This study aimed to identify aggression patterns among students, compare teachers' and students' reports on aggressiveness, and examine whether emotional and behavioral problems and self-control intercorrelate with aggression and can explain it among students. The study investigated 363 students aged 8 to 11 years and their 12 homeroom teachers in two elementary schools in central Israel. As expected, students reported higher verbal aggression than physical without gender differences in the general tendency. Also, students reported a higher rate of others' aggression toward them than their own aggression toward others. Similarities emerged between students' and teachers' reports. Four types of students were classified: the aggressive initiator (proactive), the aggressive responder (reactive), the passive victim, and a neutral type. An important outcome was the significant negative association of aggressiveness with self-control. Students with higher rates of self-control skills presented lower rates of aggressive behavior.

AB Objective Prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems in primary school children was examined 4 years after a baseline survey at preschool age. The scope of symptoms was investigated. Due to anonymity of data only group differences between the two measurements were reported. Method A representative sample of 1,481 children in fourth year primary school was assessed with the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). In addition to the CBCL broadband groups of internalizing (INT) and externalizing symptoms (EXT) a third group of combined internalizing and externalizing symptoms (COM) was defined. Results The 6 month prevalence of child mental health problems at second wave was 18% - a significant increase on the previous baseline rate of 12.4%. Of those 18% of children with child mental health problems 27.3% had exclusively internalizing, 6.0% externalizing symptoms and 52.4% had combined symptoms of INT and EXT. Conclusion The increasing prevalence was associated with an increase of symptoms of the broadband groups INT and COM but not EXT. The results also highlight an age and gender specific vulnerability of boys, both at preschool and primary school.

AB Smoking is a highly addictive behaviour, often initiated during adolescence. It is suggested that smoking is associated with behavioural and emotional problems. This study aims to assess the impact of psychosocial problems on smoking initiation and vice versa.
   Method: We obtained data on self-reported psychosocial problems and smoking of adolescents at the age of 13 years and 2 years later. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 1789 students. 68% of the baseline questionnaire could be linked to a questionnaire of the second measurement.
   Results: 15% smoked at baseline and 29% two years later. Respectively 8% and 9% had a clinical Externalizing problem score or a clinical Internalizing problem score at baseline, 14% had these problems two years later. Externalizing problems at baseline predicted the onset of smoking two years later. Internalizing problems only predicted smoking among girls. This association between psychosocial problems and smoking is most obvious for the onset of regularly smoking and less for the onset of experimenting. Reversibly smoking at baseline is only associated with the onset of externalizing problems two years later.
   Conclusion: Clinical Externalizing and Internalizing problems make the initiation of regular smoking more likely. The effects on experimental smoking are less obvious. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes and tests a theoretical model suggesting that the propensity to suppress unwanted thoughts is associated with an increased presence and frequency of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB). In the model, propensity to suppress unwanted thoughts is hypothesized to be a cognitive mediator of the relationship between emotional reactivity and SITB, and is expected to be related to the extent to which SITB is initiated to escape from aversive emotions. Results of this cross-sectional study of adolescents (N = 87) revealed that the self-reported propensity to suppress unwanted thoughts is associated with the presence and frequency of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Further-more, thought suppression partially mediates the relationship between emotional reactivity and the frequency of NSSI and suicidal ideation. Finally, adolescents with a higher tendency to suppress unwanted thoughts report engaging in NSSI in order to reduce aversive emotions rather than for social communication. Results are discussed within the framework of the negative reinforcement function of SITB. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with suicidal behaviors, some depressed individuals are not suicidal and others evidence various forms of suicidality. We thus investigated whether aspects of temperament and self-regulation of dysphoria represent risk factors for DSM-IV suicidality (recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicide attempt) in depressed youths. Using a sample of children with MDD (N=407; ages 7-14 years), recruited from clinical sites across Hungary, we tested the hypotheses that: (a) suicidality is related to higher levels of trait negative emotionality as well as more maladaptive and fewer adaptive regulatory responses to dysphoria and (b) as the severity of suicidal behavior increases, levels of trait negative emotionality and dysfunctional emotion regulation also increase. We also explored if other aspects of temperament relate to suicidality. Children's DSM-IV diagnoses were based on semi-structured interviews and best-estimate psychiatric consensus. Parents independently provided ratings of their children's temperament, and children separately completed an inventory of emotion regulation (ER). Using multivariate models, we failed to confirm the hypothesized relations of negative trait emotionality and suicidality, but confirmed that high maladaptive and low adaptive ER response tendencies increase the odds of suicidal behaviors, above and beyond the risk posed by depressive illness severity. Unplanned interaction terms between temperament dimensions (other than negative emotionality) and ER suggested that at some high-extremes of temperament, ER has no impact on suicidality but in their absence, adaptive ER lowers the risk of suicidality. The practical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study aimed to assess the prevalence of war experiences and the use of specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies in response to these experiences among 294 formerly abducted adolescents at three rehabilitation centres in Uganda. Cognitive strategies were measured by Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Symptoms of psychopathology were measured by the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Relationships were studied by means of descriptive statistics, correlations and Multiple Regression Analyses. Strong relationships were found between specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies and posttraumatic stress (PTS), Internalizing and Externalizing symptoms. The results may have implications for intervention strategies. (c) 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study was to identify psychosocial correlates of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in pediatric cancer patients after completion of cancer treatment. Multiple regression analyses were performed to predict self-reported HRQoL of 52 patients aged 8 to 15 years, and parent-reported HRQoL of 54 patients aged 1 to 5 years. Cognitive coping, family functioning, parental emotional reactions, communication about the disease, and several medical variables were included in the regression models. Better HRQoL was especially associated with more positive expectations of the further course of the disease and less frequent parental asking after disease-related emotions of the child. Interventions should include "positive thinking" as a coping strategy. Several other psychosocial variables were indicative of better HRQoL but further research is needed to confirm and to understand the relationship between psychosocial variables and HRQoL.

AB Objective: The risk for conduct disorder (CD) is markedly increased in children with specific temperament dimensions. Here, we investigated whether adverse temperament factors might contribute to an impairment in neural mechanisms underlying the regulation of aggressive behaviour.
   Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 13 male adolescents with CD aged 9 to 14 years and in 14 healthy age and sex-matched control subjects at 1.5 T. During scanning, subjects looked at pictures from the International Affective Picture System with neutral or strong negative emotional valence. Temperament was assessed using the German version of the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory. In addition, behavioural control strategies (Wisconsin Card Sorting, Four Pack Card Playing Task) and sociomoral reasoning (Sociomoral Reflection Measure Short Form) were tested to behaviourally characterise the study groups.
   Results: When comparing CD patients with healthy controls, we found reduced activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to negative affective pictures. The temperament dimension 'novelty seeking' was a significant predictor for ACC responsiveness to affective pictures as revealed by a stepwise multiple regression analysis (beta = - 0.53, p < 0.01). Moreover, individuals with high 'novelty seeking' scores chose more disadvantageous strategies in the Four Pack Card Playing Task (P < 0.05) and were characterised by a lower level of sociomoral reasoning (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The results of this study provide a link between temperament factors and neural correlates of emotion processing in adolesecents with conduct disorder. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the need for early intervention for mental health difficulties is widely acknowledged, few studies have attempted to explicitly increase actual help seeking behavior for mental health difficulties. Students in intervention classrooms received two one-hour, in-class workshops on distress and help seeking and were compared to students in non-intervention classrooms in a 2-level hierarchical model. More frequent help seeking behavior and more mental health referrals were observed among students in the intervention group than among students in the comparison group. Effects were moderated by the level of distress experienced by students, but not by help seeking attitudes, and could not be accounted for by school staff referrals or website utilization. Results showed that help seeking behavior for mental health difficulties and mental health referrals can be increased with only a moderate investment in time, but that benefits of school-based intervention may be greatest among students with specific needs, such as high levels of distress.

AB This manuscript presents a study in which the factor structure and validity of the Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory (ASRI) were examined. The ASRI is a theoretically-based questionnaire that taps two temporal aspects of self-regulation (regulation in the short- and long-term). 169 students in the 6th, 8th, and 10th grades of a small, Midwestern school district completed self-report questionnaires focused on self-regulation, parenting behaviors, and psychological adjustment. 80 parents also participated. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the internal consistency of the long-term and short-term factors was satisfactory. Requirements for concurrent and construct validity were met. The ASRI also demonstrated incremental validity, as the inclusion of the long-term factor with a comparison questionnaire significantly increased the proportion of explained variance in adolescent-reported parental warmth, externalizing, and prosocial behavior. The ASRI has the potential to move research on self-regulation in adolescence in a viable new direction.

AB Handedness, emotional problems, and schizotypy. The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between emotional or behavioural problems and schizotypy. An assessment of handedness and schizotypal personality traits were also performed by means of the Thinking and Perceptual Style Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Schizotypal Traits Questionnaire, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, and the Youth Self-Report. The sample comprised 296 participants with a mean age of 13.8 and a standard deviation of 1.34. Data indicate that adolescents with high scores on psychometric factors of schizotypy displayed higher patterns of problem behaviours as well as a significant difference in all the core factors of the Youth Self-Report, compared to those who scored low on these measures. Discriminant analysis showed that the core factors of the Youth Self-Report correctly classified 84% of the adolescents with high or low scores on psychometric schizotypy. Lastly, no significant association between the factors of schizotypy and left-handedness, right-handedness, or mixed-handedness was found.

AB Background: Facial emotions are central to human interaction. Identifying pathophysiology in affect processing circuitry that supports the ability to assess facial emotions might facilitate understanding of affect regulation in pediatric bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Ten euthymic, unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and 10 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Angry, happy, and neutral faces were presented in 30-sec blocks, with a 20-sec rest period between blocks. Subjects were asked to press a button when each face appeared, to ensure that attention was maintained on-task.
   Results: In bipolar patients, in response to both angry and happy faces relative to neutral faces, we observed reduced activation of right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex together with increased activity in right pregenual anterior cingulate, amygdala, and paralimbic cortex. Bipolar patients also showed reduced activation of visual areas in occipital cortex together with greater activation in higher-order visual perceptual areas, including superior temporal sulcus and fusiform gyrus with angry faces and posterior parietal cortex with happy faces.
   Conclusions: Findings document a disturbance in affective neurocircuitry in pediatric bipolar disorder. Reduced activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex might reflect diminished top-down control that leads to the observed exaggerated activation in amygdala and paralimbic areas. Changes in occipital areas might represent an effort to gate sensory input when affective responses to the faces could not be successfully modulated. Disturbances in affect processing circuitry could contribute to emotional dysregulation and social cognitive difficulties in bipolar youth.

AB This study examined the developmental trends of Irritability and Hostile Rumination at different times over the course of adolescence in a sample of 500 youth. Participants were 12 years old at the time of the first assessment and 20 years old at the last assessment time. Three objectives were pursued: (a) investigation of the stability and change of both Irritability and Hostile Rumination; (b) identification of developmental trajectories of Irritability and Hostile Rumination; and (c) determination of whether different trajectories of Irritability and Rumination were significantly related to physical and verbal aggression and violent conduct at age 20. Results showed that Irritability and Hostile Rumination were highly correlated and stable over time. Four developmental trajectories were identified for both dimensions. Whereas most of the participants demonstrated stable mean levels of Irritability, half of the youth either increased or decreased in their level of Hostile Rumination over time. In addition, high Irritability trajectories were associated with high physical and verbal aggression while high Hostile Rumination trajectories were associated with high levels of violent behavior.

AB Many neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence have a strong genetic component, and all present challenging questions about the neural abnormalities that underlie complex and unique behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. A useful research strategy in this setting is imaging genetics, a relatively new approach that combines genetic assessment with multimodal neuroimaging to discover neural systems linked to genetic abnormalities or variation. In this article, the authors review this strategy as applied to two areas. First, the authors present results on dissecting neural mechanisms underlying the complex neuropsychiatric phenotype of Williams syndrome. Second, they examine neural systems that are linked to candidate gene genetic variation that mediate risk for psychiatric disorders in a gene by environmental interaction. These data provide convergent evidence for neural circuitry mediating emotional regulation and social cognition under genetic control in humans.

AB The relation of attachment security to multiple domains of psychosocial functioning was examined in a community sample of 167 early adolescents. Security of attachment organization, assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview, was linked to success in establishing autonomy while maintaining a sense of relatedness both with fathers and with peers, even after accounting for predictions from qualities of the mother-teen relationship. Growth curve analyses revealed links of insecurity to increasing patterns of externalizing behavior and higher and stable patterns of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Implications for a developing theory of the connections of the attachment system to multiple domains of functioning in adolescence are discussed.

AB Co-ruminating, or excessively discussing problems, with friends is proposed to have adjustment trade-offs. Co-rumination is hypothesized to contribute both to positive friendship adjustment and to problematic emotional adjustment. Previous single-assessment research was consistent with this hypothesis, but whether co-rumination is an antecedent of adjustment changes was unknown. A 6-montb longitudinal study with middle childhood to midadolescent youths examined whether co-rumination is simultaneously a risk factor (for depression and anxiety) and a protective factor (for friendship problems). For girls, a reciprocal relationship was found in which co-rumination predicted increased depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased positive friendship quality over time, which, in turn, contributed to greater co-rumination. For boys, having depressive and anxiety symptoms and high-quality friendships also predicted increased co-rumination. However, for boys, co-rumination predicted only increasing positive friendship quality and not increasing depression and anxiety. An implication of this research is that some girls at risk for developing internalizing problems may go undetected because they have seemingly supportive friendships.

AB Background. - The aim of the study was to examine the potential contribution of exposure to bullying and adverse life events to the development of psychopathology in adolescents, and possible effect modification by neighbourhood social capital.
   Methods. - Two waves of routine, longitudinal, standard health examinations at local community paediatric health services, pertaining to 749 adolescents living in Maastricht (The Netherlands) who were attending second grade of secondary school (age 13/14 years) and approximately 2 years later going to the fourth grade (age 15/16 years), were analysed. A self-report questionnaire was used, including measures of psychopathology and two measures of negative life experiences, exposure to bullying and adverse life events, that were available for both age groups and subjected to (multilevel) regression analysis.
   Results. - Exposure to bullying in the past school-year as well as the experience of adverse life events over a 12 month period, at the age of 13/14 years, predicted an increase in psychopathology at follow-up. Exposure to bullying was associated with the development of hyperactivity and emotional problems, while the experience of adverse life events predicted the development of conduct problems. Family-related adverse events had greatest effect sizes. Effects of bullying and adverse life events were not moderated by neighbourhood social capital.
   Conclusion. - Negative life experiences impact on liability to psychopathology in adolescents independent of the wider social environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The interpersonal (e.g., manipulative, deceitful) and affective (e.g., callous, unemotional) features associated with adult psychopathy have been identified in children and adolescents. Although early research suggests that these features have clinical utility in identifying a particularly severe and recalcitrant form of antisocial behavior with unique developmental origins, several issues regarding these features need to be addressed. This special section is designed to address developmental questions regarding the interpersonal/affective features of psychopathy that have been posed by researchers in the field. Articles included in this special section focus on the structure and stability of the interpersonallaffective features of psychopathy from childhood to adolescence as well as the relation between these features and measures of psychopathy in adulthood. Articles also address the relation between the affective components of psychopathy and ADHD symptoms, emotional problems, and parenting practices in young girls, as well as the interactive role of temperamental fearfulness/ anxiety and parenting practices in predicting the development of the affective features of psychopathy. Finally, the influence of a parenting intervention on the affective features of psychopathy in boys diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder is examined.

To facilitate such collaboration, this study tested the 8-syndrome structure of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in 30 societies. Parents' CBCL ratings of 58,051 6- to 18-year-olds were subjected to confirmatory factor analyses, which were conducted separately for each society. Societies represented Asia; Africa; Australia; the Caribbean; Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Europe; the Middle East; and North America. Fit indices strongly supported the correlated 8-syndrome structure in each of 30 societies. The results support use of the syndromes in diverse societies.

AB Objective: To describe an adapted version of dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents with bipolar disorder. Method: The dialectical behavior therapy intervention is delivered over 1 year and consists of two modalities: family skills training (conducted with individual family units) and individual therapy. The acute treatment period (6 months) includes 24 weekly sessions; sessions alternate between the two treatment modalities. Continuation treatment consists of 12 additional sessions tapering in frequency through 1 year. We conducted an open pilot trial of the treatment, designed as an adjunct to pharmacological management, to establish feasibility and acceptability of the treatment for this population. Participants included 10 patients (mean age 15.8 +/- 1.5 years, range 14-18) receiving treatment in an outpatient pediatric bipolar specialty clinic. Symptom severity and functioning were assessed quarterly by an independent evaluator. Consumer satisfaction was also assessed posttreatment. Results: Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were high, with 9 of 10 patients completing treatment, 90% of scheduled sessions attended, and high treatment satisfaction ratings. Patients exhibited significant improvement from pre- to posttreatment in suicidality, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, emotional dysregulation, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Dialectical behavior therapy may offer promise as an approach to the psychosocial treatment of adolescent bipolar disorder.

AB OBJECTIVE. We investigated a national cohort of extremely immature children with respect to behavioral and emotional problems and social competencies, from the perspectives of parents, teachers, and children themselves.
   METHODS. We examined 11-year-old children who were born before 26 completed weeks of gestation in Sweden between 1990 and 1992. All had been evaluated at a corrected age of 36 months. At 11 years of age, 86 of 89 survivors were studied and compared with an equal number of control subjects, matched with respect to age and gender. Behavioral and emotional problems, social competencies, and adaptive functioning at school were evaluated with standardized, well-validated instruments, including parent and teacher report questionnaires and a child self-report, administered by mail.
   RESULTS. Compared with control subjects, parents of extremely immature children reported significantly more problems with internalizing behaviors (anxiety/depression, withdrawn, and somatic problems) and attention, thought, and social problems. Teachers reported a similar pattern. Reports from children showed a trend toward increased depression symptoms compared with control subjects. Multivariate analysis of covariance of parent-reported behavioral problems revealed no interactions, but significant main effects emerged for group status ( extremely immature versus control), family function, social risk, and presence of a chronic medical condition, with all effect sizes being medium and accounting for 8% to 12% of the variance. Multivariate analysis of covariance of teacher-reported behavioral problems showed significant effects for group status and gender but not for the covariates mentioned above. According to the teachers' ratings, extremely immature children were less well adjusted to the school environment than were control subjects. However, a majority of extremely immature children (85%) were functioning in mainstream schools without major adjustment problems.
   CONCLUSIONS. Despite favorable outcomes for many children born at the limit of viability, these children are at risk for mental health problems, with poorer school results.

TI Family and mistreatment as risk factors of antisocial conducts.
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE adolescents; antisocial behaviors; family; mistreatment
AB Antisocial behavior emerges as the result of different factors such as scholar problems, drug consumption, alcoholism, antisocial peer relationships, emotional problems, etc., which may in turn predispose to the individual to develop a pattern of antisocial behavior.
   The present work aims to determine the association of antisocial behavior between the factors of a bad family environment and mistreatment, and to determine if they can predict the presence of antisocial behaviors in adolescents.
   Family plays a primary role in the development of a person, especially in adolescent. In recent times, several problems of family disintegration and inadequate parent-child relationships are observed, and it has been described that antisocial personalities may arise from environments with child abuse, economical problems, humiliation, physical punishment and family disintegration. The experience of such emotions during childhood may lead to a severe impairment in the conformation of an emotionally-adapted personality, and may promote a tendency for the commitment of delictive behaviors in the future.
   It is necessary to close the vicious cycle where mistreated parents mistreat their own children and avoid that the parents who lived unpleasant experiences of hostility, rejection, lack of communication, mestability, etc., repeat these patterns with their children. It is important to revalorize the role of family, its functions and characteristics and the most important, its determinant influence on young people that have behavior problems as antisocial behavior.
   It is vital to create conscience about the harm that some children, adolescents and even adults have from their negative familial experiences of hostility, aggression, and mistreatment, because these experiences increase the possibilities of delictive behavior in these individuals.
   Objective In this context, the present research has its main interest in showing the relationship between past experiences of mistreatment or inadequate familial environments and the presence of antisocial behaviors in adolescents.
   Method The present research is supported on results of the Mexico City Survey on drug consumption in 7(th) to 12(th) grade population carried on October 2003.
   The total sample of the survey comprised 10659 students. For this research we used 3603 students, that corresponds to the number of students that completed the Form A of the questionnaire, that contained the are-as of interest of the study.
   The questionnaire was previously validated an its main indicators have shown adequate stability in different surveys. This instrument was applied in three different times due to its extension. Total time for its application was of 75 minutes.
   Raters were trained for the application of the questionnaire. The course lasted 12 hours and included all the theoretical aspects related to addictions, objectives of the study, management of the questionnaire and the instructions for its application in the groups.
   Results First of all, a comparative analysis by gender was performed. It was observed that antisocial behaviors were more frequent in men than in women. It is important to mention that men committed this acts in a double frequency than women, specially in terms of severe acts, where 10% of men committed them in contrast to the 3.3% observed in women.
   Additionally, two factor ANOVA was performed (gender and antisocial behaviors) with the variables of this study, mistreatment and family environment, to determine if there were differences between groups (p < 0.05) and significant differences were observed in all the areas of family environment.
   The interaction analysis of the two factors: gender, act-non acts with family environment showed that for the area of hostility and rejection there were significant differences where women that committed antisocial acts were the ones that reported higher levels of hostility and rejection. In terms of communication of the son/daughter, women that committed antisocial acts were also the ones that reported a lower level of communication.
   In the area of parent support, women that committed antisocial acts were also the ones that reported the lower levels. In the areas of parent communication and support to the son/daughter, men and women that committed antisocial acts reported less communication and support, respectively.
   For the area of mistreatment, women reported higher levels of prosocial discipline and negative discipline when compared to men. No significant differences emerged between men an women in the area of severe negative discipline.
   Also, no significant differences emerged between adolescents that committed antisocial acts and adolescents than do not committed these acts, in terms of prosocial discipline. Nevertheless, adolescents that committed antisocial acts reported higher levels of severe negative discipline.
   For the analysis of the interaction of the factors gender, acts-non acts in the area of mistreatment, no differences emerged in the area of negative discipline. Significant differences emerge for prosocial discipline, where men that do not committed antisocial acts reported the lowest levels of prosocial discipline. For severe negative discipline, both men and women that committed antisocial acts reported the highest levels.
   Finally, using logistic regression, we find that the main predictors of antisocial behavior were the presence of high hostility, low level of communication from the children, less child support and the presence of higher negative discipline and negative severe discipline. Communication, parent support and prosocial discipline were not predictive variables for antisocial behavior.
   Our results support what is described in other studies where family is the main agent of socialization as family teaches the ways of social interaction, values, habit, etc. Furthermore, several studies that evaluated the relationship of the family and antisocial behavior were performed by analyzing the role of the family as a mediator of behavior and society, on the basis that family teaches children rules, abilities and motivations that in some way constitute their cultural and social patterns.
   We conclude that family environment and mistreatment are factors associated to the presence of antisocial behavior. We must prevent this problem by improving familial relationships and providing a positive family environment to adolescents. In this way, our adolescents may have an adequate development throughout their lives.
   If an adequate and positive environment is provided during childhood and is maintained through adolescence, with positive affective family relationships, the adolescent may see his/her parents as a Ode; a reasonable not arbitrary discipline allows the adolescent to develop a social behavior that leads to an adequate self-control and self-directedness. On the contrary, if the relationships between parents and children are not favorable, the social behavior of the adolescent may be easily impaired and it is very common that these adolescents exhibit severe difficulties for social adaptation.

AB Objective: To assess the validity and the reliability of the self-report version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire in an Austrian sample.
   Methods: The questionnaire was given to 2529 healthy children and adolescents aged 11-18 years (mean age 12.71 +/- 1.4). Evaluation was performed according to given criteria, yielding a Total Problem Score, scores on four clinical subscales, and on one scale for pro-social behaviour. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, and a varimax, rotated factorial analysis were calculated.
   Results: Cronbach's Alpha was > 0.63 for the Total Problem Scale, the Pro-Social Behaviour Scale and Emotional Problems Subscale. Factorial analysis revealed five independent factors explaining 41.8% of the variance. The analysis revealed good item-subscale correlations, but could not replicate the original factorial structure completely. Normative data for the SDQ-Self for Austria are provided.
   Conclusion: The German self-report version of the SDQ should, at the moment, only be used with extended analysis of multi-informant information.

AB Aim: To study the behaviour/emotional problems and depression in adolescents with and without physical illnesses; to compare the same psychological parameters in adolescents with different disorders.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 148 adolescents aged 13-16 years with one of the following physical chronic conditions: diabetes (n = 55), asthma (n = 59), or epilepsy (n = 59). Comparative data were obtained from a group of 301 schoolchildren. Test batteries (Child Behaviour Check-List, Youth Self Report, Beck Depression Inventory, socio-economic status questions) were individually completed by adolescents and their mothers.
   Results: Overall adolescents with physical illness had more behaviour/emotional problems and were more depressed compared to controls although results varied according to the informants and the disease severity. Two risk groups were revealed: girls with asthma and boys with epilepsy.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that mental health in adolescents with chronic physical illnesses is poorer than in controls and their mental health state is very much associated with the disease severity. The findings of the study can help to develop disease targeted and comprehensive interventions in outpatient clinics of Northern Russia in order to reduce behaviour and mood disorders in adolescents with chronic physical illnesses and therefore to smooth the transition through their teenage years.

AB Although diminished self-efficacy has been linked to childhood psychopathology, including depression, it has only recently been studied in relation to childhood anxiety disorders. This study examines the relationship between self-efficacy and self-reported anxiety in children who have been referred for an assessment and possible treatment of anxiety symptoms as well as a comparison group of non-referred children. A self-efficacy questionnaire for children and a childhood anxiety measure were administered to a group of children referred for assessment and treatment of a clinical anxiety disorder (n = 50) and a non-referred control group (n = 50). Results indicate that the two samples differed significantly on measures of emotional self-efficacy, but not in terms of self-reported anxiety or other self-efficacy domains. Potential explanations for observed findings are discussed, including the possibility that self-reports of emotional self-efficacy in children may vary by clinical or referral status, amongst those reporting higher levels of anxiety overall.

AB Although recent evidence implicates the importance of the family for understanding depressive disorders during adolescence, we still lack a coherent framework for understanding the way in which the myriad of developmental changes occurring within early adolescents and their family environments actually operate to increase adolescents' vulnerability to, or to protect them from, the development of depressive disorders. In this review we propose a framework that places the mechanisms and processes of emotion regulation at the centre of these questions. We argue that emotion regulation can provide an organising rubric under which the role of various factors, such as adolescent and parent temperament and emotion regulation, and parental socialization of child emotion, as well as the interaction amongst these factors, can be understood to account for the role of the family in adolescents' risk for depression. In particular, we posit that adolescent emotion regulation functions as a mechanism through which temperament and family processes interact to increase vulnerability to developing depression.

AB In this multilevel investigation, resilience in adaptive functioning among maltreated and nonmaltreated low-income children (N = 677) was examined in relation to the regulation of two stress-responsive adrenal steroid hormones, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as well as the personality constructs of ego resiliency and ego control. Maltreatment status was not related to differences in average levels of morning or afternoon cortisol or DHEA. However, lower morning cortisol was related to higher resilient functioning, but only in it nonmaltreated children. In contrast, among phvsically abused children, high morning cortisol was related to higher resilient functioning. Morning and afternoon DHEA was negatively related to resilient functioning. Although diurnal change in cortisol was not related to resilience. for DHEA. maltreated children with high resilience showed an atypical rise in DHEA from morning to afternoon. Morning and afternoon cortisol/DHEA ratios were positively related to resilient functioning, but did not interact with maltreatment status. Ego resiliency and ego control strongly differentiated maltreated and nonmaltreated children, and the personality variables were Substantially predictive of resilience. When considered together, demonstrated effects of personality. cortisol, and DHEA maintained independent contributions ill predicting resilience among high-risk youth.

AB This article offers a multilevel perspective on resilience to depression, with a focus on interactions among social and neurobehavioral systems involved in emotional reactivity and regulation. We discuss models of cross-contextual mediation and moderation by which the social context influences or modifies the effects of resilience processes at the biological level, or the biological context influences or modifies the effects of resilience processes at the social level. We highlight the socialization of emotion regulation as a candidate process contributing to resilience against depression at the social context level. We discuss several factors and their interactions across levels-including genetic factors, stress reactivity. positive affect, neural systems of reward, and sleep-as candidate processes contributing to resilience against depression at the neurobehavioral level. We then present some preliminary supportive findings from two studies of children and adolescents at high risk for depression. Study I shows that elevated neighborhood level adversity has the potential to constrain or limit the benefits of protective factors at other levels. Study 2 indicates that ease and quickness in falling asleep and a greater amount of time in deep Stage 4 sleep may be protective against the development of depressive disorders for children. The paper concludes with a discussion of clinical implications of this approach.

AB Adolescent eveningness is associated with age, parental monitoring, daytime sleepiness, sleep problems, moodiness, and the use of coffee. This study investigated the association between adolescent morningness-eveningness and psychopathology, substance use, and suicidality in 1332 students ages 12 to 13. Each student-participant completed the Chinese version of the Child Morningness/Eveningness Scale (CMES), the Pubertal Development Scale, and a questionnaire about their sleep schedule, trouble sleeping, habitual substance use, and suicidality. Their mothers completed the Child Behavioral Checklist and Chinese Health Questionnaire. The morning (n = 412), intermediate (n = 740), and evening (n = 180) groups were operationally defined by the CMES t scores. The mixed model was used for data analysis. The evening group had shorter weekday sleep time, longer weekend sleep time, more daytime napping, and greater sleep compensation on weekends and was more likely than the other 2 groups to have behavioral/emotional problems, suicidality, and habitual substance use. Internalizing and externalizing problems partially explained the association between eveningness, substance use, and suicidality. The findings suggest that eveningness may be an indicator for adolescents with behavioral/emotional problems and risky behaviors and suggest an investigation for possible intervention.

AB Background: This study is the follow-up in early adolescence of children born to families with a history of dyslexia (Gallagher, Frith, & Snowling, 2000). Methods: Fifty young people with a family history of dyslexia and 20 young people from control families were assessed at 12-13 years on a battery of tests of literacy and language skills, and they completed questionnaires tapping self-perception and print exposure. One parent from each family participated in an interview documenting family circumstances (including family literacy) and a range of environmental variables considered likely correlates of reading disability. They also rated their child's behavioural and emotional adjustment and their own health and well-being. Parental literacy levels were also measured. Results: Forty-two per cent of the 'at-risk' sample had reading and spelling impairments. A significant proportion of the literacy-impaired group were affected by behavioural and emotional difficulties, although they were not low in terms of global self-esteem. The children in the at-risk subgroup who did not fulfil criteria for literacy impairment showed weak orthographic skills in adolescence and their reading was not fluent. There were no differences in the literacy levels or activities of the parents of impaired and unimpaired at-risk children, and no significant correlation between parent and child reading levels in the at-risk group. The impaired group read less than the other groups, their reading difficulties impacted learning at school and there was evidence that they also had an impact on family life and maternal well-being. Conclusions: The literacy difficulties of children at family-risk of dyslexia were longstanding and there was no evidence of catch-up in these skills between 8 and 13 years. The findings point to the role of gene-environment correlation in the determination of dyslexia.

AB Mental health problems in children and adolescents constitute health impairments with major implications regarding individual wellbeing as well as daily and social functioning. In addition, these problems often burden the social partners of the individual. Within the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), the parents of 14478 children and adolescents aged 3-17 answered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) which assesses behavioral problems and strengths in the areas emotional problems, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, peer problems and prosocial behavior, According to the results of the Total Difficulties Score (SDQ) 11,5 % girls (G) and 17,8 % boys (B) are classified borderline or abnormal, respectively. 92,5 % (G) and 86,3 % (B) display an adequate prosocial behavior. Most prevalent problem areas are behavioral problems (G = 11,9 %, B = 17,9 %), emotional problems (G =9,7%, B = 8,6%) and hyperactivity problems (G =4,8%, B = 10,8 %). The test-data of approximately 8,1 % of the respondents with high socio-economic status (SES), 13,4 % of those with middle SES and 23,2 % of those with low SES hinted at mental health problems. Migrants are more frequently affected than non-migrants. Results point at the need for early detection and prevention of commencing mental health problems. Especially the noneasily accessible groups like those with low socioeconomic status or migrants have to be considered.

AB Early adolescents' (11-14 years) responses to marital hostility were examined in a sample of 416 families. The cognitive-contextual perspective and emotional security hypothesis guided the study and 9 adolescent responses were identified. Prospective associations were examined in several structural equation models that included adolescent problems as outcomes. Self-blame and perceived threat uniquely mediated the association between Year 1 marital hostility and Year 3 adolescent externalizing problems (p < .05). Self-blame, lower constructive representations, internalization of feelings, avoidance, and emotional dysregulation uniquely mediated the association between Year 1 marital hostility and Year 3 internalizing problems. Specific cognitive and emotionally based responses are important to understanding how martial hostility affects youth and need to be considered within an integrated model.

AB Genetic and environmental influences on childhood antisocial and aggressive behavior (ASB) during childhood were examined in 9- to 10-year-old twins, using a multi-informant approach. The sample (605 families of twins or triplets) was socioeconomically and ethnically diverse, representative of the culturally diverse urban population in Southern California. Measures of ASB included symptom counts for conduct disorder, ratings of aggression, delinquency, and psychopathic traits obtained through child self-reports, teacher, and caregiver ratings. Multivariate analysis revealed a common ASB factor across informants that was strongly heritable (heritability was .96), highlighting the importance of a broad, general measure obtained from multiple sources as a plausible construct for future investigations of specific genetic mechanisms in ASB. The best fitting multivariate model required informant-specific genetic, environmental, and rater effects for variation in observed ASB measures. The results suggest that parent, children, and teachers have only a partly "shared view" and that the additional factors that influence the "rater-specific" view of the child's antisocial behavior vary for different informants. This is the first study to demonstrate strong heritable effects on ASB in ethnically and economically diverse samples.

AB Background: We aimed to describe similarities and differences in the developmental course of psychopathology between children with and without intellectual disabilities (ID). Methods: Multilevel growth curve analysis was used to analyse the developmental course of psychopathology, using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), in two longitudinal multiple-birth-cohort samples of 6- to 18-year-old children with ID (N = 978) and without ID (N = 2,047) using three repeated measurements across a 6-year period. Results: Children with ID showed a higher level of problem behaviours across all ages compared to children without ID. A significant difference between the samples in the developmental courses was found for Aggressive Behaviour and Attention Problems, where children with ID showed a significantly larger decrease. Gender differences in the development of psychopathology were similar in both samples, except for Social Problems where males with ID showed a larger decrease in problem behaviour across time than females with ID and males and females without ID. Conclusions: Results indicate that children with ID continue to show a greater risk for psychopathology compared to typically developing children, although this higher risk is less pronounced at age 18 than it is at age 6 for Aggressive Behaviour. Contrary to our expectations, the developmental course of psychopathology in children with ID was quite similar from age 6 to 18 compared to children without ID. The normative developmental trajectories of psychopathology in children with ID, presented here, can serve as a yardstick against which development of childhood psychopathology can be detected as deviant.

AB Objective: To explore the contributions of genetic and environmental influences to individual variation and covariation of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales (DOS) originally proposed by Achenbach and associates in 2001. Method: A classic twin study of 398 twin pairs ages 8 to 17 years belonging to the population-based Italian Twin Registry, assessed by parents using the CBCL for Ages 6 to 18 (CBCU6-18). Results: Univariate analyses showed that compared with the classic CBCL/6-18 empirical subscales, the DOS have higher heritability (lowest 0.54 for Anxiety Problems, highest 0.71 for Conduct Problems) and simpler causal structure in that the phenotypic variance was satisfactorily explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors only. Multivariate analyses showed that the causes of phenotypic correlation among the different DOS can be attributed to one common genetic factor and to two idiosyncratic environmental factors, each loading differently on the Internalizing (Anxiety and Affective Problems) and the Externalizing (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity, Oppositional Defiant, and Conduct Problems) CBCU6-18 DOS. Conclusions: Several common risk factors of both genetic and environmental nature can simultaneously affect a child's proneness to develop the psychopathological signs and symptoms captured by the CBCU6-18 DOS.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Objectives: This report presents the national estimates of maternal depressive symptomatology prevalence and its socio-demographic correlates among major racial/ethnic-nativity groups in the United States. We also examined the relationship of mental health-seeking patterns by race/ethnicity and nativity. Methods: Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Birth Cohort Nine-month data, we present the distribution of Center for Epidemiological Study-Depression (CES-D) score by new mothers' nativity and race/ethnicity. The mental health-seeking pattern study was limited to mothers with moderate to severe symptoms. Weighted prevalence and 95% confidence intervals for depression score categories were presented by race/ethnic groups and nativity. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to obtain the adjusted odds ratios of help-seeking patterns by race/ethnicity and nativity in mothers with moderate to severe symptoms. Results: Compared to foreign-born mothers, mothers born in the U.S. were more likely to have moderate to severe depressive symptoms in every racial/ethnic group except for Asian/Pacific Islanders. These US-born mothers were also more likely to be teenagers, lack a partner at home, and live in rural areas. Among Asians, Filipina mothers had the highest rate of severe depressive symptoms (9.6%), similar to those of US-born black mothers (10.2%). Racial/ethnic minorities and foreign-born mothers were less likely to consult doctors (OR: 2.2 to 2.5) or think they needed consultation (OR: 1.9 to 2.2) for their emotional problems compare to non-Hispanic White mothers. Conclusion: Our research suggests that previous "global estimates" on Asian American mental health underestimated sub-ethnic group differences. More efforts are needed to overcome the barriers in mental health services access and utilizations, especially in minority and foreign-born populations.

AB Objective: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depressed mood, and self-esteem in adolescents with heart disease and compare them with age-matched healthy adolescents (control group). Methods: Ninety adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years with congenital or acquired heart disease) and 87 controls completed the HRQoL (TAAQOL-CHD), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and Rosenberg self-esteem questionnaires. Relevant medical details were collected. The patients and their parents were asked to rate their perceived severity of heart disease. Results: Adolescents with severe heart disease reported higher levels of depressed mood and lower self-esteem than did adolescents with moderate and mild heart disease and age-matched healthy controls. Adolescents with severe heart disease also reported worse HRQoL than those with moderate and mild disease. According to the multiple regression analysis, 44% of variance of HRQoL was explained by the study variables. Disease severity alone explained 11% of the variance, but when entered with the other study variables, depressed mood, self-esteem, and adolescents' perceived severity of disease were the only significant contributors to the explained variance of HRQoL. An exploratory mediation analysis, using the Sobel test, was therefore applied, and it showed that depressed mood and perceived disease severity, but not self-esteem, mediated the relationship between disease severity and HRQoL. Conclusions: Lower HRQoL was found in adolescents with severe heart disease. Psychosocial factors have a significant effect on the psychological state of adolescents, and they should be addressed and treated.

AB This study examined whether justification of violence beliefs and social problem solving mediated between maltreatment experiences and aggressive and delinquent behavior in adolescents. Data were collected on 191 maltreated and 546 nonmaltreated adolescents (ages 14 to 17 years), who completed measures of justification of violence beliefs, social problem-solving dimensions (problem orientation, and impulsivity/carelessness style), and psychological problems. Findings indicated that maltreated adolescents' higher levels of delinquent and aggressive behavior were partially accounted for by justification of violence beliefs, and that their higher levels of depressive symptoms were partially mediated by a more negative orientation to social problem-solving. Comparisons between boys and girls indicated that the model linking maltreatment, cognitive variables, and psychological problems was invariant.

AB Objective. This study aims, firstly, to investigate the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in unaccompanied refugee children and adolescents living in Belgium. Secondly, this study compares the perspectives of the adolescents with those of social workers on the adolescents' emotional well-being.
   Design. A total of 166 unaccompanied refugee children and adolescents, living in different large- and small-scale centres, in foster care or alone, participated in the study. Of them, 142 completed self-report questionnaires on emotional and behavioural problems (HSCL-37A, SDQ-self and RATS) and traumatic experiences (SLE), and for 124 refugee youths, social workers filled in two questionnaires on emotional and behavioural problems (CBCL/6-18 and SDQ-parent).
   Results. Between 37 and 47% of the unaccompanied refugee youths have severe or very severe symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Girls and those having experienced many traumatic events are at even higher risk for the development of these emotional problems. Social workers also report a high prevalence of internalising problems in this population and they also report important externalising problems in unaccompanied refugee youths.
   Conclusion. Being unaccompanied is an important risk factor for the emotional wellbeing of refugee children and adolescents. Therefore, appropriate measures on reception and care should be taken in order to support these youths.

AB This study examined maternal parenting stress in a sample of 430 boys and girls including those at risk for externalizing behavior problems. Children and their mothers were assessed when the children were ages 2, 4, and 5. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to examine stability of parenting stress across early childhood and to examine child and maternal factors predicting parenting stress at age 2 and changes in parenting stress across time. Results indicated that single parenthood, maternal psychopathology, child anger proneness, and child emotion dysregulation predicted 2-year parenting stress. Child externalizing behaviors predicted initial status and changes across time in parenting stress. Stability of parenting stress was dependent upon child externalizing problems, as well as interactions between child externalizing problems and gender, and child externalizing problems and emotion regulation. Results are discussed in the context of mechanisms by which parenting stress may influence the development of child externalizing behaviors.

AB The aim of this study was to validate a French version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ; Garnefski, N., Kraaij, V., & Spinhoven, P., 2001. Negative life events, cognitive emotion regulation and emotional problems. Personality and Individual Differences, 30, 1311-1327) and to explore its relationships with impulsivity and depression. Teenagers from a junior secondary (n = 107, 13-16 years) and a secondary school (n = 110, 15-19 years) completed the CERQ, which assesses regulation strategies in response to negative events. The secondary school adolescents also completed the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale (Whiteside, S. P., & Lynam, D. R., 2001. The five factor model and impulsivity: Using a structural model of personality to understand impulsivity. Personality and Individual Differences, 30, 669-689) and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (Reynolds, W. M., 1987. Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale: Professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources). Factor analysis for the CERQ confirmed the presence of the nine original regulation strategies. In the secondary school students, impulsivity was related to depression. A path analysis revealed that regulation strategies mediated this relationship. The role of emotion regulation in the development of adolescent psychopathology is discussed. (c) 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rescorla, 2001) by adolescents in general population samples from 24 countries (N = 27,206). For problem scales, country effect sizes (ESs) ranged from 3% to 9%, whereas those for gender and age ranged from less than 1% to 2%. Scores were significantly higher for girls than for boys on Internalizing Problems and significantly higher for boys than for girls on Externalizing Problems. Bicountry correlations for mean problem item scores averaged .69. For Total Problems, 17 of 24 countries scored within one standard deviation of the overall mean of 35.3. In the 19 countries for which parent ratings were also available, the mean of 20.5 for parent ratings was far lower than the self-report mean of 34.0 in the same 19 countries (d = 2.5). Results indicate considerable consistency across 24 countries in adolescents' self-reported problems but less consistency for positive qualities.

AB The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with palatal abnormalities, cardiac defects, a characteristic facial appearance, learning difficulties, and delays in speech and language development. Various behavioral disorders and psychiatric illnesses have also been reported. There is Much debate as to whether the behavioral problems are caused by factors Such as medical discomfort, facial abnormalities or a lower intelligence, or whether they are independently related to the genetic abnormality ("behavioral phenotype"). We examined the relationship between intelligence level and behavioral problems. A group of 69 children with 22q11DS was compared with 69 children with craniofacial anomalies (CFA) using the child behavior checklist (CBCL). The matches between individual children were based on their total IQ scores. Use of the CBCL norm scores covered the corrections for age and sex. The group of 22q11DS children showed significantly more behavioral problems than the CFA group: this was especially apparent on the CBCL, subscales "withdrawn," "anxious/depressed," "delinquent behavior," "aggressive behavior," "somatic complaints," and "social problems." We found no correlation between IQ score and behavioral problems in the 22q11DS group, which was remarkable because, comparable with the general population, intellectual disabilities were a predictor of behavioral problems in the CFA group. 22q11DS children with relatively higher IQs showed more problems of an internalizing than an externalizing nature, whereas the 22q11DS children with lower IQs showed various behavioral problems. The absence of a statistically siganificant correlation between intelligence and behavior problems in the group of 22q11DS children is tentative evidence for a 22q11DS behavioral phenotype.

AB Using a cross-lagged effect model with 3 waves of data from a 6-year longitudinal study with 3-year intervals, transactional relations between parental marital distress and adolescent emotional adjustment were examined. The sample consisted of 531 parent-adolescent dyads. Results showed that marital distress as reported by parents and emotional adjustment as reported by adolescents were reciprocally related in a transactional model over time. This was principally true for girls and for late adolescents and young adults. For older adolescent girls, an almost full transactional model was found, whereas associations between marital distress and emotional adjustment were less strong for younger girls and were absent for boys.

AB This study assessed the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) community match programs at the national level. Following a standardized protocol, 71 intake families (parents and children ages 7-14 years) and 30 adult mentors were recruited over 12 months from two BBBS agencies. Families were randomly assigned to the BBBS program (n = 39) or a waiting list control (n = 32). Information on children's behavior and psychosocial outcomes was obtained from children and parents using face-to-face interviews and questionnaires administered after enrolling in the study (but prior to knowledge of assigned condition) and at 12 months follow-up. Tests of equivalence revealed nonsignificant group differences on most baseline outcomes. Twelve families dropped out prior to the post-test assessment. ANCOVA results revealed beneficial program effects for five outcomes (child self-reports): symptoms of emotional problems, symptoms of social anxiety (fear of negative peer evaluations and generalized social anxiety and distress), teacher social support, and social skills (self-control). The study demonstrated the feasibility of an RCT to evaluate the BBBS programs. However, the design may be challenged ethically given the evidence of positive benefits and the requirement that control group children remain unmatched for a minimum of 12 months.

AB Emotion regulation is an emerging field in psychology concerned with the processes involved in recognizing, monitoring, evaluating and modifying emotional reactions. Few measures have been developed specifically to assess individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies. This paper reports on a new self-report instrument designed to assess the frequency with which adolescents use both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, which draw on both internal Untrapersonal) and external (interpersonal) resources to regulate emotions. The new measure was used in a cross-sectional survey of 225 adolescents. Factor analyses supported the structure of the measure, which has four scales: 'internal-functional', 'internal-dysfunctional' 'extemal-functional' and 'external-dysfunctional' emotion regulation. The new measure demonstrated good psychometric properties. Frequent use of dysfunctional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with parent reports of level of emotional and behavioural problems, and also with self-reported level of psychosomatic health problems. Frequent use of functional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with self-reported quality of life across a number of different dimensions. These results provide evidence for the validity of the measure. The results also highlight that assessment of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation is important.

AB Children referred for externalizing behavior problems may not represent a homogeneous population. Our objective was to assess neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might distinguish subtypes of externalizing children from each other and from their normal age mates. Children with pure externalizing (EXT) problems were compared with children comorbid for externalizing and internalizing (MIXED) problems and with age-matched controls. Only boys were included in the analysis because so few girls were referred for treatment. We used a go/no-go task with a negative emotion induction, and we examined dense-array EEG data together with behavioral measures of performance. We investigated two event-related potential (ERP) components tapping inhibitory control or self-monitoring-the inhibitory N2 and error-related negativity (ERN)-and we constructed source models estimating their cortical generators. The MIXED children's N2s increased in response to the emotion induction, resulting in greater amplitudes than EXT children in the following trial block. ERN amplitudes were greatest for control children and smallest for EXT children with MIXED children in between, but only prior to the emotion induction. These results were paralleled by behavioral differences in respons 6 time and performance monitoring. ERP activity was localized to cortical sources suggestive of the dorsal anterior cingulate for control children, posterior cingulate areas for the EXT children, and both posterior cingulate and ventral cingulate/prefrontal regions for the MIXED children. These findings highlight different mechanisms of self-regulation underlying externalizing subtypes and point toward distinct developmental pathways and treatment strategies.

AB The aims of this study were to compare the perceived health of young adults with spina bifida with a population without disability, and to determine the effect of the disease characteristics and resulting impairments on perceived health. This cross-sectional study is part of the Adolescents with Spina Bifida in the Netherlands study. Data were collected by physical examination and a questionnaire. In total, 179 patients (age range 16-25y) participated in the study and perceived health data were completed for 164 participants (92 females, 72 males; mean age 20y 7mo [SD 2y 9mo]). Twenty-six participants had spina bifida occulta and 138 had spina bifida aperta, of whom 115 also had hydrocephalus. Perceived health was measured with the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short-form Health Survey (SF-36), a generic health status measure. SF-36 scores of young adults with spina bifida were below those of an age-matched population group for six of the eight domains. This difference was largest for the physical functioning domain. Although these differences were statistically significant they were small. Findings for the emotional health domains (vitality, mental health, role problems due to emotional problems) did not differ at all from the population group.

AB This study examined whether detrimental childhood relationships with parents were related to partner relationship quality and emotional adjustment in adulthood. The authors tested a theoretical model in which (a) low-quality parent-child relationships were related to conflict and low-quality communication with parents in adolescence, (b) parent-adolescent conflict and low-quality communication were linked to low-quality partner relationships in young adulthood, and (e) low-quality partner relationships in young adulthood were predictive of low-quality partner relationships as well as depression, anxiety, and dissatisfaction with life at midlife. Multi-informant data were used from 212 Swedish individuals who were followed from birth into adulthood. Results demonstrated that, as hypothesized, negative parent-child bonds were indirectly related to low-quality partner relationships and dissatisfaction with life in adulthood (but not anxiety and depression) through conflictual parent-adolescent communication and low-quality partner relationships in young adulthood.

AB Objective To investigate whether parent-teacher disagreement regarding the presence of psychopathology predicts poor outcome in children who have been referred to mental health services Methods A total of 532 6- to 12-year-old children who had been referred to an outpatient department for child and adolescent psychiatry were followed up across an average period of 6.3 years. At initial assessment, standardized parent and teacher ratings of the child's psychopathology were obtained with the Child Behavoir Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Reprot form (TRF). At follow-up, indices of poor outcome were assessed. Results Several CBCL and TRF scale scores predicted poor outcome. Discrepancies between CBCL and TRF scores were not useful as additional predictors. Some additive effects were found; future police/ judicial contacts and disciplinary problems in school were predicted by CBCL and TRF scores. Conclusions The findings underscored the need for information from different informants in clinical practice. However, discrepancies between parent and teacher ratings do not predict Outcome, and should not alert clinicians.

AB Background Involving parents in the treatment of youth referred for mental health problems is an important agenda. Parent involvement is associated with treatment retention, greater family participation, and positive outcomes. The main goal of the present study was to examine the role of youth and parent report of the youth's psychopathology and interpersonal problems on parent involvement in outpatient treatment of the youth. Methods Data were gathered from 63 referred youth in treatment in an outpatient clinic. Subjects reported the youth's interpersonal problems and problem syndromes. The direct account of the youth and parents was examined for association with two indices of parent involvement, namely, the mothers' behavioral involvement (BI) and personal emotional involvement (PEI) in the treatment process. Results Results showed that while direct reports of the youth and parents were not significant predictors of parent involvement, discrepancy scores predicted parent involvement. Further, there were twice as many scales of interpersonal problems that were related to parent involvement as the syndrome scales. Conclusion The ability of discrepancy scores in predicting parent involvement underscores that it is not only a risk factor for later development of adverse outcomes, but also related with essential treatment processes. Clinicians may be able to address these issues and aid in treatment processes leading to desired outcomes.

AB Although much has been written about adolescent adjustment and coping in Western countries, relatively little is known about similar issues in Asia. The authors examined the emotional adjustment of young adolescents in Singapore. They report adolescent concerns and how they influence adaptive functioning and emotional well-being. Data were obtained from three self-report measures: the Adolescent Concerns Measure (R. P Ang, W. H. Chong, V. S. Huan, & L. S. Yeo, in press), selected scales of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children Personality Self-Report (C. R. Reynolds & R. W. Kamphaus, 1998), and the Emotional Distress Scale of the Reynolds Adolescent Adjustment Screening Inventory (W. M. Reynolds, 2001). Emotional well-being emerged as a dominant concern for Singaporean youths with significant gender differences. Girls reported a more positive attitude toward school, better friendship skills, and stronger relationships with parents than did boys. However, girls registered significantly greater worries about self and emotional distress compared to boys. The authors discuss implications for teachers and mental health professionals.

AB This study makes an important contribution to the literature by using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a paediatric clinic population to measure morbidity. It is not surprising that half the children and over 60% of adolescents attending clinics for developmental and behaviour problems were found have scores in the 'abnormal' range by parental rating. These patients were referred for disruptive behaviour, anxiety problems and relationship difficulties, learning difficulties, language and communication disorders, habit and sleep disorders. Many of these problems are identical with those presented to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and we know that chronic health problems, learning problems and developmental weaknesses are potent risk factors for psychiatric disorders.(1) While CAMHS clients had higher Emotional problem scores, and Behaviour Clinic clients had higher Hyperactivity scores, there was considerable overlap in total scores and impact scores, especially in older groups.

AB Background: Fibromyalgia is a chronic health condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points on physical examination, generalized muscular aching, stiffness, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep pattern, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbance. Recently, the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Fibromyalgia Syndrome Workshop ranked and prioritized the domains that should be consistently measured in fibromyalgia clinical trials, specifically, pain, generic health-related quality of life, fatigue, sleep quality, and physical function. The focus of these deliberations was exclusively on adult patients, and to our knowledge, these domains have not been previously tested within a multidimensional framework in children and adolescents with fibromyalgia.
   Methods: An analysis to determine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the PedsQL(TM) 4.0 ( Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory T) Generic Core Scales, PedsQL T Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and PedsQL(TM) Rheumatology Module Pain and Hurt Scale as patient-reported outcome ( PRO) measures for pediatric patients with fibromyalgia. The PedsQL T Scales were completed by 59 families in a pediatric rheumatology clinic in a large children's hospital.
   Results: The PedsQL(TM) evidenced minimal missing responses (0.53% patient self-report, 0.70% parent proxy-report), achieved excellent reliability for the Generic Core Scales Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.88 patient self-report, 0.87 parent proxy-report), the Multidimensional Fatigue Scale Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.94 patient self-report, 0.94 parent proxy-report), and acceptable reliability for the 4-item Rheumatology Module Pain and Hurt Scale (alpha = 0.68 patient self-report, 0.75 parent proxy-report). The PedsQL(TM) Generic Core Scales and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale significantly distinguished between pediatric patients with fibromyalgia and healthy children. Pediatric patients with fibromyalgia self-reported severely impaired physical and psychosocial functioning, significantly lower on most dimensions when compared to pediatric cancer patients receiving cancer treatment, and significantly lower on all dimensions than pediatric patients with other rheumatologic diseases. Patients with fibromyalgia self-reported significantly greater pain and fatigue than pediatric patients with other rheumatologic conditions, and generally more fatigue than pediatric patients receiving treatment for cancer.
   Conclusion: The results demonstrate the excellent measurement properties of the PedsQL(TM) Scales in fibromyalgia. These PedsQL(TM) Scales measure constructs consistent with the recommended OMERACT Fibromyalgia Syndrome Workshop domains. The findings highlight the severely impaired HRQOL of pediatric patients with fibromyalgia. Regular monitoring of pediatric patients with fibromyalgia will help identify children and adolescents at risk for severely impaired HRQOL. These PedsQL(TM) Scales are appropriate outcome measures for clinical trials and health services research for pediatric patients with fibromyalgia.

AB In science, theories lend coherence to vast amounts of descriptive information. However, current diagnostic approaches in psychopathology are primarily atheoretical, emphasizing description over etiological mechanisms. We describe the importance of Polyvagal Theory toward understanding the etiology of emotion dysregulation, a hallmark of psychopathology. When combined with theories of social reinforcement and motivation, Polyvagal Theory specifies etiological mechanisms through which distinct patterns of psychopathology emerge. In this paper, we summarize three studies evaluating autonomic nervous system functioning in children with conduct problems, ages 4-18. At all age ranges, these children exhibit attenuated sympathetic nervous system responses to reward, suggesting deficiencies in approach motivation. By middle school, this reward insensitivity is met with inadequate vagal modulation of cardiac output, suggesting additional deficiencies in emotion regulation. We propose a biosocial developmental model of conduct problems in which inherited impulsivity is amplified through social reinforcement of emotional lability. Implications for early intervention are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To explore the long-term physical, educational, behavioural, and emotional outcome of patients undergoing surgical correction of congenital cardiac disease at school age, and to investigate the relation, if any, between the outcome and comorbidity, age and sex, and level of complexity of the cardiac surgery. Methods: Information was obtained concerning 101 patients who underwent open-heart surgery for correction of congenital cardiac malformations between 1992 and 2000 whilst aged from 6 to 16 years. The patients, and their parents, completed the questionnaire "Outcome of congenital heart disease and surgery", the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, and the Child Behaviour Checklist/Youth Self-Report/Young Adult Self-Report. Results: Of the patients, 26% had comorbidity. Of those without comorbidity, 39% had frequent physical complaints, and 28% experienced limitations due to the cardiac disease. Nevertheless, the patients reported a good subjective state of health, and did not report any behavioural or emotional problems. Patients did show academic difficulties. They had received special education more frequently than their healthy peers, and many had needed to repeat a grade, or had received remedial teaching. Consequently, the educational level of patients was lower than that of their healthy peers. Patients with comorbidity, female patients, and patients who underwent complex surgery, seemed to be most at risk for physical, behavioural, and emotional problems. Conclusion: It is necessary to distinguish between physical state and its appraisal, and clinicians should be aware of this. Further research is needed to find out the cause and nature of the academic difficulties. Groups of patients at risk should be followed closely to enable early interventions.

AB This study examined associations between victimization by peers and intention to respond to provocative events as a function of anger arousal and motivation to improve the situation in a cross-sectional sample of school-age children (N = 506, 260 males, 246 females). Results demonstrated that more intense anger and more retaliatory motivation were positively associated with intentions to aggress and with frequency of victimization. The association between aggressive intentions to respond to anger provocation and victimization could be accounted for by subjective feelings of anger and motivation to retaliate. The contribution of emotion processes was stronger for boys than for girls. A post hoc examination of non-bullying participants revealed that motivation accounted for aggressive intentions among the non-bullies. Results support including anger management programs in prevention efforts that target the school climate andvictims' risk for psychopathology.

AB The present study describes the development of the child version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-k). Like the adult version of the CERQ, the CERQ-k measures nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies that children may use after having experienced negative life events. The original CERQ was considered suitable for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. The CERQ-k was constructed for children of 9, 10 and 11 years of age. The present study describes some psychometric properties of the CERQ-k and relationships with measures of depression, fearfulness and worry among 717 primary school youngsters. Principal component analyses confirmed the allocation of most items to subscales, while Cronbach's alphas of most sub-scales exceeded 0.70. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were found to be related to the reporting of symptoms of depression, fearfulness and worry, which provided some evidence for criterion-related validity.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate which homogeneous groups, according to teacher reports of attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADH) Problems on the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), can be identified in a referred sample (n = 4,422; age = 6-18 years; mean age = 9.9 years; 66% boys, 34% girls). Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted on ADH Problems. In addition, co-morbidity levels in the different ADH Problems groups were compared. LCA yielded three different groups of children and adolescents with both Inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, and one group with high scores on Inattention but low scores on hyperactivity-impulsivity. A group of patients with predominantly hyperactivity and impulsivity was not found. Individuals in groups with higher levels of ADH Problems had significantly higher levels of oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems, and, although to a lesser extent, significantly higher levels of affective and anxiety problems than individuals in groups with lower levels of ADH Problems. It may not be useful to discern the hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD.

AB Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measurement has emerged as an important health outcome in clinical trials, clinical practice improvement strategies, and healthcare services research and evaluation. While pediatric patient self-report should be considered the standard for measuring perceived HRQOL, there are circumstances when children are too young, too cognitively impaired, too ill or fatigued to complete a HRQOL instrument, and reliable and valid parent proxy-report instruments are needed in such cases. Further, it is typically parents' perceptions of their children's HRQOL that influences healthcare utilization. Data from the PedsQL(TM) Database(SM) were utilized to test the reliability and validity of parent proxy-report at the individual age subgroup level for ages 2 - 16 years as recommended by recent FDA guidelines.
   Methods: The sample analyzed represents parent proxy-report age data on 13,878 children ages 2 to 16 years from the PedsQL(TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales Database(SM). Parents were recruited from general pediatric clinics, subspecialty clinics, and hospitals in which their children were being seen for well-child checks, mild acute illness, or chronic illness care (n = 3,718, 26.8%), and from a State Children's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP) in California ( n = 10,160, 73.2%).
   Results: The percentage of missing item responses for the parent proxy-report sample as a whole was 2.1%, supporting feasibility. The majority of the parent proxy-report scales across the age subgroups exceeded the minimum internal consistency reliability standard of 0.70 required for group comparisons, while the Total Scale Scores across the age subgroups approached or exceeded the reliability criterion of 0.90 recommended for analyzing individual patient scale scores. Construct validity was demonstrated utilizing the known groups approach. For each PedsQL T scale and summary score, across age subgroups, healthy children demonstrated a statistically significant difference in HRQOL ( better HRQOL) than children with a known chronic health condition, with most effect sizes in the medium to large effect size range.
   Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of parent proxy-report at the individual age subgroup for ages 2 - 16 years. These analyses are consistent with recent FDA guidelines which require instrument development and validation testing for children and adolescents within fairly narrow age groupings and which determine the lower age limit at which reliable and valid responses across age categories are achievable. Even as pediatric patient self-report is advocated, there remains a fundamental role for parent proxy-report in pediatric clinical trials and health services research.

AB Objective: To investigate if parent-teacher discrepancies in reports of behavioral/emotional problems in children predict poor outcome.
   Method: A total of 1154 4- to 12-year-old children from the general population were followed up. At the first assessment, parent and teacher ratings were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Fourteen years later, DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed, and ratings of self-reported and parent-rated behavioral and emotional problems were obtained.
   Results: CBCL and TRF scores predicted most of the outcomes, but in general, discrepancies between CBCL and TRF scores did not. There were some exceptions. For instance, higher parental vs. teacher ratings of aggressive behaviors increased the risk of suicide attempts/self-mutilation.
   Conclusion: Risk factors for self-mutilating behaviors may be supplemented with parent-reported aggressive behaviors that are not observed by the teachers. In general, whereas CBCL and TRF scale scores were useful predictors of outcome, parent-teacher discrepancies were not.

AB Long-term institutional care in childhood is linked with behavioral and emotional problems and can negatively affect personality development. This study tested the hypotheses that institutional care constitutes a risk factor for adult personality psychopathology and that conduct disorder acts as a mediator to the institutional care effects, based on 544 community individuals and 470 prisoners aged 18-64 years. Childhood institutional care was associated with elevated dependent, histrionic, and narcissistic traits in the community sample and with schizoid traits in prisoners. Initial findings of associations of institutional care with cluster B personality traits in the two populations disappeared after adjusting for conduct disorder symptoms. Identification and treatment of conduct/behavior problems in children before or during care may help to reduce the risk of developing certain personality disorder traits.

AB Research on coping "during-childhood and adolescence is distinguished by its focus on how children deal with actual stressors in real-life contexts. Despite burgeoning literatures within age groups, studies on developmental differences and changes have proven difficult to integrate. Two recent advances promise progress toward a developmental framework. First, dual-process models that conceptualize coping as "regulation under stress" establish links to the development of emotional, attentional, and behavioral self-regulation and suggest constitutional underpinnings and social factors that shape coping development. Second, analyses of the functions of higher-order coping families allow identification of corresponding lower-order ways of coping that, despite their differences, are developmentally graded members of the same family. This emerging framework was used to integrate 44 studies reporting; age differences or changes in coping from infancy through adolescence. Together, these advances outline a systems perspective in which, as regulatory subsystems are integrated, general mechanisms of coping accumulate developmentally, suggesting multiple directions for future. research.

AB We investigated the psychological profiles and emotional regulation characteristics of women involved in risk-taking sports. The research sample (N=180) consisted of three groups of women engaged in: ( 1) non-risk sports (N=90); ( 2) risk-taking sports for leisure purposes (N=53); or ( 3) risk-taking sports as professionals (N=37). Each participant completed five questionnaires, the Sensation Seeking Scale, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Risk & Excitement Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The results revealed significant differences between the groups' profiles. Of particular interest are the differences that exist between the profiles of Group 2 ( escape profile, masculine gender identity, and high scores on sensation seeking, impulsivity, alexithymia) and Group 3 ( compensation profile, androgynous gender identity, average score on sensation seeking, and low scores on impulsivity, alexithymia). We propose that the professional woman might be considered a model for preventing destructive risk-taking behaviors.

AB Recent cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to treatment of substance use disorder (SUD) have emphasized the need for clients to explore emotional regulation and experiential avoidance. This study aimed to determine whether music therapy programs situated within a CBT framework facilitated the exploration of emotions in 24 adults with SUD attending a hospital open group CBT program. In a 7-week trial, the impact of a single music therapy session on participants' emotional experience was assessed using a self-report questionnaire at the end of each participant's first session. Results indicated that music therapy sessions facilitate the experiencing of predominantly positive emotions, and that these were experienced to a moderate or high degree. Participants reported that music therapy was beneficial in allowing them to experience emotions without the need for substance use. It is recommended that clinicians include interventions that encourage the exploration of negative emotions so that clients can experience these in a safe environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To report on the backgrounds and physical and emotional well-being of street children using two street. shelters in Kyiv, Ukraine. This study is important because personal accounts of street children may highlight individual or family factors that are associated with vulnerability for and risk of poor mental health, and these could have serious repercussions for the future. This study also poses a challenge to research because street children are a highly elusive population that services find hard to reach.
   Methods: Ninety-seven children were recruited and interviewed using a semistructured, psychosocial interview schedule; psychopathology was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ).
   Results: Seventy percent of street children scored for behavioral and emotional difficulties on the SDQ, and 74% scored for depression on the MFQ. Current health problems were reported by 78%, with 43% described as persistent or severe. Two thirds of the children in this sample were not homeless but had chosen life on the streets in preference to permanent residence with their families. Their "survival" history on the streets contributed to the development of three different profiles of vulnerability.
   Conclusions: High rates of physical and emotional problems in a population of street children, many of whom were still connected to their families, emphasize the importance of developing different approaches for children with different vulnerabilities. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of embedding on-going field research into the service dimension of "front-line" social care agencies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) form a heterogeneous population. There is a need for psychotherapeutic interventions that give therapists the flexibility to tailor the treatment plan to the needs of an individual patient. To detect essential ingredients for treatment, three different cognitive-behavioral theories of DSH will be reviewed: (1) the cognitive-behavioral theory of Linehan (1993a), (2) the cognitive theory of Berk, Henriques, Warman, Brown, and Beck (2004), and (3) the cognitive-behavioral theory of Rudd, Joiner, and Rajab (2001). A review of these theories makes it possible to compare the different approaches to the essential aspects in the treatment of DSH: a trusting patient-therapist relationship, building emotion regulation skills, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral pattern breaking. An overview will be given of therapeutic techniques that can be used to address the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal problems associated with DSH.

AB The psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) as well as its prospective relationships with symptoms of depression and anxiety were studied in an adult general population sample. The results showed that the CERQ had good factorial validity and high reliabilities, with Cronbach's alpha s ranging between.75 and.87. In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for considerable amounts of variance in emotional problems and strong relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up. The CERQ might therefore be considered a valuable and reliable tool in the study of individual risk and protective factors associated with emotional problems, while providing us with important targets for intervention.

A total of 532 Italian preadolescents recruited in their schools took part in this study. They completed a self-report questionnaire measuring direct child abuse from mothers and fathers, exposure to mother-to-father and father-to-mother violence, and externalizing delinquent and aggressive behaviors. Results indicated high levels of delinquent and aggressive behavior, compared to normative data, as wet] as high levels of reported direct and indirect family abuse. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated an independent significant effect for gender, mother-to-father violence, and both paternal child abuse and maternal child abuse. Discussion includes the importance of addressing externalizing problems of adolescents as indicators of family-related abuse, which may require multiple interventions and coordination between different agencies that work with children.

AB Data on 96 foster families with a foster child and a birth child between the ages of 10 and 21 years were used to analyze the association between support and conflict processes within the foster family and youths' reports on four indexes of well-being: self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotional problems, and behavioral problems. The self-esteem of foster children was more strongly affected by support and conflict processes in the foster family than was the self-esteem of birth children in the same family. For birth children as well as for foster children, parental support significantly related to emotional problems. For foster children, but not for birth children, more conflicts with the foster parents related to more behavioral problems. The results are compared with other studies, and implications for practice are suggested.

AB The present study examined the relationship between sub-clinical depressive symptoms and children's anticipated cognitive and behavioral reactions to two written vignettes depicting emotion-eliciting stressors (i.e., fight with one's best friend and failure at a roller blade contest). Participants (N = 244) ranging in age between 10 and 13 were presented each vignette and then asked to rate their anticipated utilization of each of seven emotion-regulation strategies (ERs), along with the anticipated mood enhancement effects of each strategy. In addition, ratings of participants' perceived coping efficacy to manage the stressful situation were collected. Results indicated that participants were more likely to endorse ERs for which they have greater confidence in their mood enhancement effects. Moreover, marked differences were observed between ratings for conceptually distinct cognitive ERs. Consistent with expectations, results revealed that participants displaying higher levels of depressive symptoms were more likely to endorse cognitive and behavioral ERs that are negative, passive, and/or avoidant in nature. Children's ratings of the anticipated mood enhancement effects of several ERs were inversely related to their level of depressive symptoms, as was their perceived self-efficacy to manage the stressor.

AB Behavioral responses to stress and challenge are based in emotional and physiological arousal reactions. Adolescents with maladaptive or problematic behavior patterns, such as internalizing or externalizing problems, are likely to show atypical emotional and physiological reactions to stress. Relations between problems and reactions to stress were examined in a sample of 55 young adolescents with normal to clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Youth had their self-reported emotional states, heart rate, and blood pressure levels measured before and after engaging in two socially challenging, evaluative manipulations. Internalizing problems were associated with less positive affect but greater anxiety and cardiovascular arousal, whereas externalizing problems predicted greater hostility and positive affect but less cardiovascular arousal. The necessity of recognizing and incorporating comorbid characteristics and multiple response systems into studies of the links between problems and reactivity is emphasized in the discussion.

AB It is well known that many suicidal young people avoid asking for help; however, the reasons why are less understood. A sample of 101 American Indians (age 15-21 years) who had thought about or attempted suicide was asked open-ended questions about barriers to seeking formal and informal help while suicidal. The 74 participants who avoided at least one type of help most commonly reported internal factors, such as embarrassment, lack of problem recognition, a belief that nobody could help, and self-reliance. Structural barriers, such as lack of money or service availability, were only rarely cited. Findings indicate that efforts to increase help seeking among young, suicidal American Indians should target beliefs about emotional problems and help seeking.

AB Background: The realization that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood has led to increased frequency of diagnosis and treatment in adults. Osmotic release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate is a long-acting stimulant demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD.
   Method: Forty-seven adults entered and 41 completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of OROS methylphenidate. Each double-blind arm lasted 4 weeks; data were collected from August 2004 through December 2005. Subjects met both DSM-IV-TR and Utah Criteria for ADHD in adults. Outcome measures included the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS), the adult ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I). At baseline, subjects were categorized as having significant emotional symptoms with the WRAADDS and/or significant oppositional-defiant symptoms using a self-report scale assessing the DSM-IV criteria for oppositional defiant disorder.
   Results: 17% of the sample (N=8) had ADHD alone, 38% (N=18) had ADHD plus significant emotional symptoms, and 40% (N=19) had ADHD with both significant emotional and oppositional symptoms. At a mean +/- SD dose of 64.0 +/- 23.3 (0.75 mg/kg), OROS methylphenidate proved superior to placebo for all clinical measures: total WRAADDS score decrease of 42% versus 13%, respectively, p<.001 and total ADHD-RS score decrease of 41% versus 14%, respectively, p=.003, plus the subscales addressing inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation.
   Conclusions: OROS methylphenidate proved effective in treating adult ADHD. ADHD alone was relatively uncommon. Over 80% of our patients had ADHD with a combination of emotional and/or oppositional symptoms.

AB This longitudinal study had 2 goals. The 1st goal was to describe trajectories of academic and emotional adjustment in college science pro-rams. The 2nd goal was to determine whether these trajectories differed as a function of students' self-reports of the quality of their relationships with parents and teachers. The sample consisted of 498 students recruited during their last year of high school. Assessment of adjustment continued until the end of the 2nd year of college. For a number of students, the authors observed a significant decline in both academic and emotional adjustment. Moreover, it was possible to identify an at-risk profile characterized by poor academic and emotional adjustment. In examining the students' perceptions of their family and school environments, the authors found that poorly and well-adjusted students differed from each other on the basis of parental but not teachers' relationship quality.

AB Disturbances in affect have been linked to problem behavior in adolescence and future psychopathology, but little is known about how such disturbances manifest themselves in everyday contexts. This study investigated daily mood in Dutch 7th graders, aged 11-14. Cluster analysis of problem measures distinguished high-risk (n=25) and low-risk (n=106) subgroups. Participants completed experience-sampling reports of mood, social context, and location nine times daily for 5 days. Multilevel regression analyses of four mood measures confirmed higher anxiety and depressed mood in the high-risk group. Moods varied by location and social context, with significant differences between groups in two specific social contexts. First, when with family, low-risk adolescents felt less depressed than when alone, whereas high-risk adolescents felt more depressed. Second, high-risk adolescents showed more pronounced anxiety in social situations outside the network of family and friends. These findings point to everyday social contexts in which young adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems appear to be particularly vulnerable.

AB Objective: To examine the use and impact of a dedicated health information Web site for adolescents. Method: Five hundred fifty-eight (27.2%) of all students in grades 7 through 12 from 4 schools logged onto the Web site; 1775 (86.4%) of all students in these grades completed a year-end health survey, with 455 (81.5%) of the students who used the Web site completing the survey. Dependent variables were help seeking and satisfaction ratings plus visits to specific Web site sections. Predictor variables were demographic characteristics, mental health, and psychosocial difficulties assessed at years' end. Results: Students logged on > 11,000 times during the year. Female students, students wanting professional help, those scoring higher on depressive vulnerability measures, and students reporting more severe mood problems were related to logging on frequently over longer periods of time, as well as viewing information sheets, posting and viewing questions and answers, and completing the symptom screen. Students accessing the Web site from 1 to 7 A.M. reported higher levels of distress than did students who accessed the Web site at other times of the day. Visits to the Web site were positively associated with visits to school health centers and guidance counselors and referrals to a health professional. Conclusions: Results are consistent with a health-needs model of utilization of this Internet-based health resource. A school-based health information Web site holds significant promise for health promotion and early self-identification for emotional problems.

ID DISORDER; YOUTHS; NEEDS
AB The juvenile justice system in the United States is experiencing a social movement aimed at responding to the mental and emotional problems of delinquent youths. Ironically, this movement arose in the wake of a decade of reform in juvenile justice that had set aside the system's 100-year tradition of rehabilitation for delinquents in the interests of their punishment and a primary emphasis on public safety. This article describes the recent juvenile justice and mental health movement, discusses the circumstances that motivated it, and provides examples of its progress. Now that the movement has taken hold, however, its future is threatened by several unintended consequences of the motives and strategies of those who succeeded in promoting the movement. Those potential perils are described with an eye to reducing their impact, thereby sustaining the movement and its potentially positive effects.

AB Objective. To study the correlation between adolescents' psychical disorders and their difficulties of psychosocial adaptation.
   Methods and materials. There were 63 adolescent participants in our study (47 girls and 16 boys) who were hospitalized in Department of Children and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital (Lithuania) during the period from September to December, 2005. Twenty-seven adolescents (19 girls and 8 boys) had suicidal and self-harming behavior. Psychical disorders were diagnosed according to ICD-10 diagnostic criterions. We used Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire SDQ-lit adapted for Lithuania.
   Results. While comparing the mean scores in both sexes of adolescents with diagnoses of depressive, behavioral and adaptation disturbances, we found a statistically significant difference only in emotionally disturbance scale results (P=0.016). Analyzing groups of girls and boys separately, girls showed to be worse psychosocially adapted and had more emotional problems. Girls who tried to commit suicide had more emotional (P=0.006) and psychosocial problems (P<0.001). Girls who were diagnosed with affective disorders had more expressed emotional (P<0.001) and general adaptation (P=0.031) difficulties. Parents noted that those who committed a suicide and had behavior disturbances had more expressed emotional (P=0.007) and general adaptation (P=0.053) problems.
   Conclusions. 1. Adolescent girls who were diagnosed depressive illnesses had more emotional and general adaptation problems than girls who were diagnosed behavior or adaptation disorders. 2. Adolescent girls who tried to commit suicide had more expressed behavior problems and difficulties of emotional, general adaptation. 3. Most expressed difficulties of emotional and general adaptation were typical to girls who were diagnosed with depression and who tried to commit a suicide.

AB Similar to the state of the broader intellectual disabilities field, many gaps exist in the research and treatment of mental health concerns in people with Down syndrome. This review summarizes key findings on the type and prevalence of behavior and emotional problems in children, adolescents, and adults with Down syndrome. Such findings include relatively low rates of severe problems in children, and well-documented risks of depression and Alzheimer's disease in older adults. The review also considers emerging data on autism, and the paucity of studies on adolescents. Three next steps for research are highlighted, including a need to: (1) connect research on psychiatric status and diagnoses across developmental periods, including adolescence, and to examine such associated processes as sociability, anxiety and attention; (2) unravel complicated bopsycho-social risk and protective factors that serve to increase or diminish psychopathology; and (3) identify evidence-based treatments that both reduce distressful symptoms and enhance well-being in individuals with Down syndrome.

AB Objective Epidemiological data indicate prevalence rates at about 5 % for behavioural and emotional problems in kindergarten-children in Germany. We present an outpatient diagnostic special service for young children and a preliminary evaluation. Observations in everyday situations support diagnoses and serve as a base for parent counselling. Complementary services such as kindergartens, youth welfare departments or pediatricians may be included for placement decisions.
   Methods Multiaxial diagnoses of 23 children treated so far as well as parents' ratings on the SDQ (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) are reported.
   Results Our data show a wide spectrum of developmental and behavioural disorders with substantial impact upon children and parents. However, psychosocial risks were rather low so that presumably not all patients needing this service were reached.
   Conclusions This diagnostic service extends child psychiatric services to an age group which has been undertreated in the local area so far. The need for this service has been established.

   Methods Study participants (n=1004) were recruited in the context of their medical examinations for military service and were asked to complete self-rating scales.
   Results Results demonstrate a risk of male depression in 22% of the respondents, which was especially pronounced in males with low masculinity/instrumentality. 41% of those at risk of male depression denied their emotional problems, and only 9 had consulted professional help.
   Conclusions The relationship between male depression and different aspects of masculinity requires further research. The need of early information about depression and destigmatisation of helpseeking among male adolescents is supported by the findings.

Adolescents' attachment representations and their representations of parental support of their autonomy and competence were assessed in a sample of N = 41, 18-year-olds by means of two separate interviews, the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), and an Achievement-Autonomy-Competence-Interview. In addition, their emotion regulation patterns were assessed by a Q-sort measure. Results revealed moderately positive associations between attachment representations and support of autonomy and competence by mothers but not by fathers. The effects on self-regulation (perceived autonomy and emotion regulation) were domain-specific. Adolescents' perceived autonomy was significantly associated with parental support of autonomy and competence. However, parental support of attachment was significantly associated with adolescents' emotion regulation. The results suggest that in late adolescence attachment and supportive parenting result in different domains of self-regulation.

AB Background: Previous studies have found considerable overlap between attention/hyperactivity problems, aggressive/oppositional problems and delinquent/conduct problems in adolescents. Sampling and Methods: Mothers of 1,965 11- to 18-year-olds ( 1,116 boys, 849 girls), referred to mental health agencies, completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Latent class analysis was conducted on the Attention Problems scale ( representing problems with attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity), Aggressive Behavior and Rule-Breaking Behavior scales of the CBCL. Results: Six latent classes were found. One of these classes contained individuals who suffered predominantly from attention problems and to a far lesser degree from aggressive or rule-breaking behaviors. The other 5 classes represented individuals with varying degrees of attention problems, aggressive behaviors and rule-breaking behaviors. Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies, the present study indicated that, in a large referred sample, problems with attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity can be considered as a diagnostic construct that should be distinguished from aggressive or rule-breaking behaviors. However, the present study did not support the existence of diagnostic classes constituted by individuals who primarily suffer from aggressive behaviors or rule-breaking behaviors, and not from attention problems or hyperactivity. Implications of these findings for future research and clinical practice are discussed. The value of the study was limited by the use of parent reports only. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI Brief questionnaire on screening and diagnosis of mental health problems
   in children and adolescents: Algorithms for syndromes and their
   prevalance in Mexico City. Second part
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish

ID PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; CARE
AB Introduction Studies on developmental psychopathology have shown that several problems and disorders that started during childhood persist into adulthood. Recent epidemiological studies have emphasized the need for the early identification of problems and disorders in childhood and adolescence that may eventually lead to other psychopathologies in adulthood.
   A previous paper presented the rationale and development of a brief instrument which could be used to early identify clinical risk conditions in children by health professionals: the Brief Screening and Diagnostic Questionnaire, CBTD. The CBTD is a 27-item questionnaire which is answered by the parents of the child exploring symptoms frequently reported as motives for seeking attention at the out-patient mental health services. The instrument showed good reliability, K-R-20= 0.81, and construct validity for identifying groups of symptoms that suggest the presence of the most frequent psychiatric syndromes in children and adolescents.
   As our goal was to identify probable psychiatric disorders, and diagnostic criteria are not equal to clusters of symptoms identified by factor analyses, the next task was to explore the data using a different statistical technique and to develop observational units, syndromes, for further clinical evaluation. The objectives of this paper are: 1. to present the resulting algorithms and 2. their prevalence in children and adolescent population in Mexico City.
   Method The CBTD was included as part of the instruments used in an epidemiological study on psychiatric morbidity in Mexico City. The study was designed as a household survey on a representative sample of the adult population aged 18-65 years in Mexico City. In addition, information was obtained about all the respondents' children aged 4-16 years living at the same household. The total sample included 1685 children and adolescents with the following distribution by age-groups: 16.3% were 4-5 years old; 25.5%, 6-8 years old; 30.9%, 9-12 years old, and 27.4%, 13-16 years old.
   Once the independence of the observations was assured, logistic regression analyses were performed between cardinal symptoms for different diagnoses and the rest of the items from die questionnaire. Statistically significant associations were evaluated clinically and compared to psychiatric syndromes as defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications. Based on these results, algorithms for probable psychiatric syndromes were created.
   Results Using the results from logistic regression analyses, algorithms were created considering different levels of severity for probable disorders: attention-deficit and hyperactivity distinguishing three subtypes, depressive with two definitions and two severity degrees, anxiety with two subtypes, oppositional behavior, conduct disorder, specific language disorder, epilepsy, and other clinical conditions such as problems related with eating attitudes, enuresis and impulsivity,
   Depressive and hyperactive attention-deficit syndromes were the most frequent in the population. Among these groups of syndromes, depression, as defined in terms of the presence of irritability or sadness and three or more associated symptoms, and the combined subtype of hyperactive attention-deficit, were the most prevalent. Oppositional behavior and anxiety syndromes were also frequent, and all of the afore mentioned syndromes appeared predominantly associated at least with another one. Mixed externalizing and internalizing syndromes were found in 5% of the population, while only internalizing syndromes were reported in 4.5% and only externalizing syndromes in 2.4%.
   Although as a whole no significant differences by sex were found on the number of syndromes presented, in males the frequency increased with age, while in girls more syndromes were reported on the youngest and elder age-groups.
   Discussion This paper has presented operational definitions for screening syndromes based on the associations among symptoms explored by the CBTD in children and adolescents of the general population in Mexico City.
   It is important to highlight that the CBTD is based on symptoms which are frequently reported as motives for consultation. So, the instrument does not merely translate diagnostic criteria into questions but rather use the way in which the population perceive and express concern about their children's behavior, in order, first, to define caseness and, second, to identify probable disorders.
   ]Recently, Goodman designed an interesting brief instrument, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), that generates scores for conduct problems, inattention-hyperactivity emotional symptoms, peer problems, and prosocial behavior. One difference between the CBTD and the SDQ is that the former includes items exploring language problems, enuresis, and seizures, which are clinically relevant and frequently associated with conduct and emotional problems. Furthermore, 4% of our study population presented these kind of problems associated with externalizing or internalizing syndromes.
   Results indicating that attention-deficit and depressive syndromes are the most common in the population are consistent with the most frequent disorders attended at the Pediatric Psychiatric Hospital in Mexico City. Also interesting is the fact that in a National Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey, 2% of the adult population with depressive disorders reported having their first depressive episode during childhood or adolescence with a mean duration of 31 months. Likewise, results from the present study found that 2.6% of the children and adolescents have the most severe depressive syndrome, IDEP-2S, which also has the highest diagnostic specificity in clinical settings.
   These results suggest that the CBTD accomplishes the goal of being a useful tool for epidemiological studies and for the surveillance of mental health in childhood and adolescence. The presence of a syndrome does not lead automatically to a psychiatric diagnosis. The intention is that, in those cases, corroboration should be sought by evaluating interference caused by the reported symptoms in familial, school, social and personal functioning.

AB This study compared teachers' ratings of behavioral and emotional problems on the Teacher's Report Form for general population samples in 21 countries (N = 30,957). Correlations between internal consistency coefficients in different countries averaged .90. Effects of country on scale scores ranged from 3% to 13%. Gender effects ranged from <1% to 5%, and age effects were all <1%. With great consistency across countries, scores were higher for boys than. for girls on eight scales: Total Problems; Externalizing; the Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior syndromes; and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-orienied Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Problems, Oppositional Defiant Problems, and Conduct Problems. Correlations between mean item ratings in different countries averaged .74. Teacher's Report Form results were thus similar across 21 very diverge countries, despite differences across these countries in school systems, models of pedagogy, and curricula.

AB Standardized assessment instruments developed in one society are often used in other societies. However, it is important to determine empirically how assessment instruments developed in one society function in others. The present study tested the fit of the Teacher's Report Form syndrome structures in 20 diverse societies using data for 30,030 6- to 15-year-old students from Asia; Australia; the Caribbean; eastern, western, southern, and northern Europe; and the Middle East. A correlated seven-syndrome model and a hierarchical Attention Problems model were tested separately in each of the 20 societies via confirmatory factor analyses. The results supported the fit of the models in the tested societies.

AB This article reviews current literature examining associations between components of the family context and children and adolescents' emotion regulation (ER). The review is organized around a tripartite model of familial influence. Firstly, it is posited that children learn about ER through observational learning, modeling and social referencing. Secondly, parenting practices specifically related to emotion and emotion management affect ER. Thirdly, ER is affected by the emotional climate of the family via parenting style, the attachment relationship, family expressiveness and the marital relationship. The review ends with discussions regarding the ways in which child characteristics such as negative emotionality and gender affect ER, how socialization practices change as children develop into adolescents, and how parent characteristics such as mental health affect the socialization of ER.

AB Research using the Adult Attachment Interview has largely examined its predictive significance for interpersonal behavior within the context of observations of parent-child and romantic relationships. A limitation of this state of affairs is that the literature does not make clear whether or when attachment-related variation becomes reflected in other kinds of interpersonal encounters. This study demonstrates that links between adults' states of mind regarding childhood attachment experiences and the quality of their interpersonal interactions are evident in first meetings between same-sex strangers in a non-attachment-related context. More specifically, in a study of 50 stranger dyads (50% female), secure adults demonstrated positive emotional engagement during a challenging puzzle-building task. In contrast, preoccupied adults dominated the task, whereas dismissing adults evidenced negative emotion during the interaction. Results held controlling for the Big Five personality dimensions and suggest a middle ground position regarding the narrow versus broad correlates of adult attachment security.

AB An extensive body of research documents the high prevalence of comorbidity among child and adolescent disorders in general and between conduct problems and depression in particular. These problems co-occur at significantly higher rates than would be expected by chance and their comorbidity may have significant implications for nosology, treatment, and prognosis. Four main hypotheses have been put forth to account for these high rates of comorbidity. First, comorbidity may be a result of shortcomings associated with referral or informant biases. Second, comorbidity may be an artifact of overlapping definitional criteria. Third, one disorder may cause the other disorder by influencing the developmental trajectory and placing an individual at increased risk for further difficulties. Finally, comorbidity between two disorders may be explained by shared underlying causal or risk factors. The purpose of this review is to explore these possibilities, concentrating primarily on the common risk factors of parent psychopathology, emotion regulation, and cognitive biases that may underlie the co-occurrence of these two disorders. Based on our review, we propose a model for the development of comorbidity between these two disorders.

AB Purpose of review This article reviews selected parenting programs for children aged 2-8 years old to inform primary-care pediatricians about options for families of children with behavior problems.
   Recent findings Young children with aggressive and oppositional behavior are at risk for serious antisocial behavior that may persist into adolescence and adulthood. Most parents wish to discuss parenting difficulties and their child's social and emotional development during well-child visits. Parent training programs are an effective option to promote positive parenting and discipline strategies and enhance a child's social skills, emotional self-regulatory skills, and problem-solving ability. Key parenting principles can be incorporated into developmental surveillance and anticipatory guidance during periodic well-child visits to prevent disruptive behavior problems, address parenting concerns, and nurture the optimal development of children's social-emotional competency.
   Summary The literature on the effectiveness of evidence-based parenting programs is growing. This information can enhance practicing pediatricians' understanding of available community resources and parenting support. These programs are feasible with families of various cultures and those at risk for parenting difficulties. Pediatricians can easily incorporate positive parenting principles into primary-care visits and developmental surveillance.

AB Objectives To describe the associations between a range of demographic, family and clinical factors and clinician-rated measures of global impairment in children with ADHD symptoms obtained at the baseline assessment in the ADHD Observational Research in Europe (ADORE) study. Methods Global impairment was measured by clinicians using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGIS) scale and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Associations with independent variables were investigated using forward-stepwise regression models. Results For the CGI-S and CGAS analyses, complete data sets were available for 1,265 and 985 children, respectively. The baseline mean CGI-S score in this population was 4.4 (SD 0.9) and the mean CGAS score was 55.0 (SD 10.6). Factors significantly associated with increased impairment on both outcome measures were: increased severity of ADHD symptoms, increased peer relationship problems and presence of oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder. Also, the presence of anxiety and/or depression and the presence of somatic symptoms were associated with increased impairment on CGI-S, while family health problems and premature birth were associated with increased impairment on CGAS. Conclusions The severity of clinician-rated impairment in the ADORE sample is increased by the presence of disruptive behaviour problems and emotional problems, somatic symptoms, peer relationship difficulties, family health problems and premature birth.

AB We examined children's behavioral coping in response to an in vivo peer rejection manipulation. Participants (N=186) ranging between 10 and 13 years of age, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either peer rejection (i.e., being voted out of the game) or non-rejection control. During a five-min. post-feedback waiting period children's use of several behavioral coping strategies was assessed. Rejection elicited a marked shift toward more negative affect, but higher levels of perceived social competence attenuated the negative mood shift. Children higher in depressive symptoms were more likely to engage in passive and avoidant coping behavior. Types of coping were largely unaffected by gender and perceived social competence. Implications are discussed.

AB Background: Both the professional and the general media have recently published concerns about an 'epidemic' of child and adolescent depression. Reasons for this concern include ( 1) increases in antidepressant prescriptions, ( 2) retrospective recall by successive birth cohorts of adults, ( 3) rising adolescent suicide rates until 1990, and ( 4) evidence of an increase in emotional problems across three cohorts of British adolescents. Methods: Epidemiologic studies of children born between 1965 and 1996 were reviewed and a meta-analysis conducted of all studies that used structured diagnostic interviews to make formal diagnoses of depression on representative population samples of participants up to age 18. The effect of year of birth on prevalence was estimated, controlling for age, sex, sample size, taxonomy ( e. g., DSM vs. ICD), measurement instrument, and time-frame of the interview ( current, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months). Results: Twenty-six studies were identified, generating close to 60,000 observations on children born between 1965 and 1996 who had received at least one structured psychiatric interview capable of making a formal diagnosis of depression. Rates of depression showed no effect of year of birth. There was little effect of taxonomy, measurement instrument, or time-frame of interview. The overall prevalence estimates were: under 13, 2.8% ( standard error ( SE) .5%); 13-18 5.6% (SE .3%); 13-18 girls: 5.9% (SE.3%); 13-18 boys: 4.6%( SE.3%). Conclusions: When concurrent assessment rather than retrospective recall is used, there is no evidence for an increased prevalence of child or adolescent depression over the past 30 years. Public perception of an 'epidemic' may arise from heightened awareness of a disorder that was long under-diagnosed by clinicians.

AB Current widespread use of the same youth assessment measures and scales across different nations assumes that youth psychopathology syndromes do not differ meaningfully across nations. By contrast, the authors' syndromal sensitivity model posits 3 processes through which cultural differences can lead to cross-national differences in psychopathology syndromes. The authors tested this model in a comparison of Child Behavior Checklist syndromes for adolescents in Thailand and the United States. In support of the model, about half of the Thai-U.S. syndrome comparisons showed poor agreement (kappa < .40), and distinctive Thai syndromes emerged reflecting 3 prominent themes in Thai research literature: delayed maturation, indirect aggression and/or delinquency, and sex problems in boys. Such syndromal dissimilarity carries significant implications for assessment, diagnosis, epidemiology, and intervention across national boundaries.

AB Reports of adolescents' coping with recurrent pain, symptoms of anxiety/depression, and somatic complaints were obtained from a sample of 164 adolescents with recurrent abdominal pain and their parents. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that coping consisted of 3 nonorthogonal factors: Primary Control Engagement Coping (problem solving, emotional expression, and emotional regulation), Secondary Control Engagement Coping (positive thinking, cognitive restructuring, acceptance, and distraction), and Disengagement Coping (denial, avoidance, and wishful thinking). Structural equation modeling using latent variables revealed that secondary control engagement coping predicted lower levels of anxiety/depression symptoms and somatic complaints, and disengagement coping was related to higher levels of anxiety/depression and somatic complaints. Implications for understanding child and adolescent coping with pain are highlighted.

AB The authors examined short-term temporal stability of reactive and proactive aggression, as well as short-term consistency of differential relations of reactive versus proactive aggression to 4 correlates. The authors used parent, teacher, peer, and self-report measures twice across I year to assess reactive aggression, proactive aggression, hyperactivity, social skills, anger expression, and depressive symptoms of 2nd-grade boys and girls (N = 57). Both subtypes of aggression remained stable across the year, even when the other subtype of aggression was explained at each assessment. Reactive aggression, but not proactive aggression, was consistently positively related to hyperactivity, poor social skills, and anger expression at each assessment.

AB Background Behavioural and emotional problems occur at a high rate in children and adolescents with intellectual disability, often from a young age. Some studies have indicated that children and adolescents with autism present with even higher rates. Less is known about the presentation, development and family impact of these difficulties in young children with autism. This study aimed to explore these issues in toddlers with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), those with delay without a PDD, and their families.
   Methods Participants were 123 children aged 20-51 months, referred to a developmental assessment clinic. Parents completed a checklist on child behavioural and emotional problems, and individual questionnaires on family functioning, their own mental health, and stress in relation to parenting their child. The child's language and cognitive skills, adaptive functioning and behaviour were assessed by standardized measures. Measures were repeated 1 year postdiagnosis. Behavioural and emotional problems in young children with a PDD were compared with those in children with developmental delay without a PDD, and their impact on parental outcomes explored over time.
   Results Initial and follow-up measures of child behaviour and emotional problems, parent mental health problems, parent stress and family functioning were significantly correlated, providing some evidence of stability over time. Child emotional and behavioural problems contributed significantly more to mother stress, parent mental health problems, and perceived family dysfunction than child diagnosis (PDD/non-PDD), delay or gender. Compared with mothers, all fathers reported significantly less stress in relation to parenting their child.
   Conclusion Results highlighted the importance of addressing emotional and behavioural problems in very young children with autism and/or developmental delay. The need for early support and intervention for mothers, fathers and families in this context was also evidenced. As research has shown that behavioural and emotional problems persist into adolescence and young adulthood, understanding of these issues in very young children and their parents has important implications for intervention and long-term outcomes.

AB In this investigation, the authors examined the perceptions children had of their relationships with parents, peers, and teachers; their bonds with schools and neighborhoods; and their social, behavioral, and emotional adjustment. Participants were 96 students in the fifth and sixth grades who were receiving special education services for learning disabilities (n = 40), emotional and behavioral disorders (n = 18), mild mental retardation (n = 18), and other health impairments (n = 20). Findings indicated that both positive and negative aspects of these children's relationships and bonds were associated with social, behavioral, and emotional adjustment. Furthermore, different aspects of these relationships and bonds were differentially associated with adjustment variables. These findings suggest that it is important to consider how social relationships and social contexts relate to the adjustment and functioning of children with high-incidence disabilities.

AB Communication between children and parents has been the subject of several studies, examining the effects of, for example, disclosure and secrecy on adolescents' social relationships and adjustment. Less attention has paid to adolescent deception. We developed and tested a new instrument on lying behavior in a sample of 671 parent-adolescent couples. Analyses on the psychometric properties showed that this instrument had one principal component, and high internal consistency, item-total correlations and inter-item correlations. Lying was moderately associated with other indicators of parent-child communication, the quality of the parent-child relationship, and with parenting practices. In addition, frequent lying was moderately related to behavioral problems and emotional problems.

AB This study used self-report and observational methods to examine associations between depressive symptoms and patterns of emotional experience and expression during late adolescence. Fiftyone male and 49 female first and second year college students completed questionnaires on emotion experience and were videotaped while completing a frustrating task with a friend. Emotion expressions were coded from videotapes. Findings revealed associations between depressive symptoms and reporting high anger experience in the past month but displaying low anger with a friend, reporting low happiness but showing high happiness in the task, and reporting high sadness experience. Gender differences were found in depressive symptoms and in observed and reported happiness. Findings highlight the importance of anger and happiness, in addition to sadness, for depression.

AB The present study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental influences on behavioral problems, personality features, and neuropsychological performance among adolescents in Taipei, Taiwan. Between 1996 and 1998, with the assistance of the Twin Association and junior high schools in Taipei City, we solicited a list of twins from 51 junior high schools in Taipei. Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the twins enrolled in these schools were obtained. The vast majority of the recruited twins were between 12 and 16 years old. The recruited twins received assessments for behavioral problems, general and schizotypal personality, and cognitive functions. Their parents rated their children on behavioral/ emotional problems and were assessed on their own general and specific personality. Same-sex sibling pairs (ages vary within 2 years) and their parents from three schools were also recruited to increase sample size for the group with a kinship coefficient of .50. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. The Mx program was used to estimate parameters for the full model and its reduced models. The recruitment, measurements, data managements, and published results are described in this article.

AB This review evaluates empirical reports of relations among exposure to violence in the community, dimensions that characterize families and parenting, and the distress and maladjustment of children and adolescents. Family functioning variables that have been examined in relation to community violence exposure include family conflict and violence, social support, structure and cohesion, parenting practices, maternal distress, and sociodemographic characteristics. Evidence is reviewed for three hypotheses regarding family dimensions: (1) that they are associated with children's community violence exposure in bivariate relations, (2) that they moderate relations between community violence exposure and child outcomes, and (3) that they mediate relations between community violence exposure and child outcomes. Following the empirical review, theoretical and methodological gaps in the literature are identified; guidelines are proposed for ecologically valid family-based research on community violence.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Children born very preterm (VP; < 32 weeks' gestation) or with very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500 9; hereafter called VP/VLBW) are at risk for behavioural and emotional problems during school age and adolescence. At school entrance these problems may hamper academic functioning, but evidence on their occurrence at this age in VP/VLBW children is lacking.
   Aim: To provide information on academic functioning of VP/VLBW children and to examine the association of behavioural and emotional problems with other developmental problems assessed by paediatricians.
   Design, setting and participants: A cohort of 431 VP/VLBW children aged 5 years (response rate 76.1 %) was compared with two large national samples of children of the same age (n = 6007, response rate 86.9%).
   Outcome measures: Behavioural and emotional problems measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and paediatrician assessment of other developmental domains among VP/VLBW children.
   Results: The prevalence rate of a CBCL total problems score in the clinical range was higher among VP/VLBW children than among children of the same age from the general population (13.2% v 8.7%, odds ratio 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.17)). Mean differences were largest for social and attention problems. Moreover, they were larger in children with paediatrician-diagnosed developmental problems at 5 years, and somewhat larger in children with severe perinatal problems.
   Conclusion: At school entrance, VP/VLBW children are more likely to have behavioural and emotional problems that are detrimental for academic functioning. Targeted and timely help is needed to support them and their parents in overcoming these problems and in enabling them to be socially successful.

AB This study examined the effect of child temperament, symptom severity, verbal ability and level of functioning on maternal stress in 43 Greek mothers of children and young people with autism spectrum disorder. Symptom severity was assessed by the CARS, level of functioning by the PEP, temperament by the Dimensions of Temperament Scale (DOTS-R) and maternal stress by the Clarke Modification of Holroyd's Questionnaire on Resources and Stress (QRS). Lower-functioning children and those with high activity level, low flexibility and low mood scores were perceived to be more stressful. Counter to expectation, children with ASD who were rated high on rhythmicity and task orientation were perceived as more stressful. Best predictors of maternal stress were high activity level, low mood and high symptom severity. Mothers of non-verbal children were more stressed than those of verbal. The relevance of child temperament for understanding maternal stress is discussed with particular relevance to the Greek culture and available supports.

AB Though behavioral genetic studies of aggression have implicated heritable and environmental factors, there is limited understanding of how these factors influence aggression across different settings and over time. Ratings for 732 twins were collected from parents and teachers during middle childhood and early adolescence. Total aggression scores on the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF) were examined at each age, across both settings, and developmentally. In this sample, aggressive behavior was moderately to largely heritable at each age within the home (.76-.84) and school (.42-.61). Across each age, ratings by parents and teachers were moderately correlated (.19-.36). Genetic and environmental effects that were limited to a particular setting were important etiological factors for aggressive behavior consistently within each setting, while only genetic factors influenced levels of aggression across both settings. Stability during these ages was due to genetic effects common to each age and the persistence of child-specific environmental experiences within each setting. These results suggest that genetic and environmental influences on children's aggressive behavior are largely setting specific. Levels of aggression seen consistently across both settings are due to genetic influences. Developmentally stable levels of aggressive behavior result from genetic influences common to all ages and individual environmental influences whose effects persist across ages.

AB Objectives. Little evidence has been available about the functioning and outcomes of child mental health services operating at the primary care interface. This study investigated the effectiveness and quality of one particular model of outreach clinic.
   Design. The study used a quasi-experimental design comparing outcomes of children attending the outreach clinics with a waiting list comparison. The intervention group (n = 88) was assessed at referral, four months and twelve months later. The comparison group (n = 99) completed measures at referral and four months.
   Method. The main carers of participant children completed self-report measures of problem severity, impact, burden, parental stress and parent satisfaction. Clinicians provided clinical activity information.
   Results. There were significant reductions in children's problem severity, distress and impairment, particularly for behavioural difficulties. In contrast, the results showed no effect upon the outcomes of children's emotional problems or parental stress. High ratings of satisfaction were obtained for many aspects of care.
   Conclusions. The children receiving care through this system of decentralised, outreach clinics derived clinical benefits that were maintained over time. The outreach clinics received strong consumer support suggesting the service offered a high level of acceptability to parents.

AB Classroom emotional climate was hypothesized to moderate psychosocial adjustment in 1st grade for children with an early childhood history of anxious solitude. Participants were 1,364 children in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and their mothers, child-care providers, and teachers. As anticipated, children with an early childhood history of anxious solitude were more rejected, poorly accepted (boys), and victimized (girls) by peers and demonstrated more depressive symptoms (girls) in 1st-grade classrooms with negative observed emotional climate. Results support a Child X Environment model of children's social and emotional adjustment.

AB This study examined children's spontaneous use of behavioral emotion regulation (ER) strategies and their effects on subsequent mood change in response to an in vivo peer rejection manipulation. Participants (N = 186), ranging between 10 and 13 years of age, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either peer rejection (being voted out of the game) or nonrejection control. In response to rejection, more than one third of the participants (38%) displayed a marked worsening (i.e., reliable change) in state mood. After receiving feedback, time spent on several behavioral ER strategies during a 5-minute postfeedback period was assessed. At the end of the postfeedback period, children's cognitive activity was also assessed. More time spent on behavioral distraction was positively linked to subsequent increases in positive affect, whereas the reverse pattern was found for disengagement/passive behavior. Moreover, higher endorsement ratings for the strategy of "cognitive analysis" were associated with stronger increases in negative affect.

ID PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; ADOLESCENTS; CHECKLIST
AB The principal purpose of this study was to assess behavioral and emotional problems in children with epilepsy to investigate if specific behavioral and emotional problems are associated with specific medical epilepsy-related factors. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess parent-reported behavioral and emotional problems in 108 5- to 18-year-old children with various epilepsy syndromes. Specific medical epilepsy-related factors, such as etiology, age at onset, seizure symptoms, prognosis, seizure frequency, electroencephalography (EEG), and anticonvulsive therapy, were recorded during a regular follow-up examination in our pediatric outpatient epilepsy clinic, and 22.2% of our patients showed moderate to severe behavioral or emotional problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist total score. Higher Child Behavior Checklist scores were associated with such specific medical epilepsy-related factors as etiology, age at onset, and polypharmacy. Higher scores on the Social Problem scale were associated with symptomatic epilepsy syndromes and an earlier age at onset. Higher scores on the Social Problems, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior scales were associated with anticonvulsive polytherapy. There were no statistically significant associations between the Child Behavior Checklist scores and seizure symptoms and frequency and EEG at the time of evaluation. The demonstrated frequency of behavioral and emotional problems in children with epilepsy suggests the necessity to address psychosocial issues during the course of clinical treatment.

AB Despite frequent targeting of health beliefs in pediatric chronic pain treatment interventions, there are currently no reliable and valid self-efficacy measures for children with chronic pain and their parents. The current study examined the psychometric properties of parent and child versions of a self-efficacy measure related to the child functioning normally when in pain. Pediatric pain patients, 9-18 years of age, and a caregiver completed questionnaires before an initial tertiary care clinic appointment. The 67 patients in our sample had an average of 1.7 pain locations, including abdominal pain (43.3%), headaches (50.7%), body pain (25.4%), back pain (23.9%), limb pain (20.9%), and/or chest pain (9.0%). Reliability for the new measures was excellent; the Cronbach's alpha was .89 for the 7 child items and .90 for the 7 parent items. Strong evidence for construct validity was also obtained as 23 of the 27 hypothesized correlations were confirmed. As predicted, parent and child ratings of increased self-efficacy for the child functioning normally when in pain were significantly correlated with each other, and to parent reports of fewer problems functioning due to physical or emotional problems; parent reports of fewer somatic, behavioral or emotional symptoms; parent reports of increased self-esteem, and unrelated to child pain, age and gender. Additionally, child ratings of increased self-efficacy were significantly correlated with child reports of increased self-esteem and fewer somatic symptoms. Replication with a larger sample size, more complex modeling, and prospective studies are indicated. (c) 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we compared several aspects of the emotional functioning of schoolchildren reporting very few somatic complaints (n = 59), schoolchildren reporting many somatic complaints (n = 61), and a clinical group of children with functional abdominal complaints who visited the outpatient clinical of the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam (n = 33). The children had an average age of 10.6 years. We studied whether general moods (happiness, anger, fear, and sadness), symptoms of depressiveness, emotion awareness, and sense of coherence contributed to group classification. Eighty-three percent of the schoolchildren reporting very few somatic complaints were identified correctly on the basis of better emotional functioning. However, there was little difference in the emotional functioning of schoolchildren with many somatic complaints and that of the clinical group. We concluded that the variables studied are valuable for differentiating children who are troubled by somatic complaints from children experiencing few somatic complaints. The results stress the existence of emotional problems in children reporting many somatic complaints. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years a number of reports have documented an increase in the number of homeless families in the US. Using a sample of 195 mothers who were veterans of the US armed forces we assessed the association of maternal homelessness and clinical status, with measures of children's mental health, school enrolment and attendance. Although maternal homelessness had no significant association with children's reported emotional problems it had a profound effect on school enrollment and attendance. Mothers' mental health status, history of incarceration and cumulative history of trauma, as well as children's exposure to trauma and their self-esteem were the factors most strongly associated with measures of children's emotional problems. The study suggests that preventive interventions are needed to minimize the effects of exposure to trauma, both in the community and at home, as well as family interventions to address both the mother's and child's emotional and physical needs. A longitudinal study is needed to understand better the association between residential instability and children's mental health.

AB Objective To study the continuity of psychopathology from the age of 3-12 years. Methods In a population-based birth cohort, children's emotional and behavioral problems were assessed at age 3 using the Child Behavior Checklist 2-3 (CBCL 2-3), and at age 12 by parents using the CBCL 11-18, and the Youth Self Report (YSR) completed by the children. Behavioral ratings were obtained from 800 subjects at both time points. Results externalizing problems at age 3 predicted both externalizing and internalizing problems among both genders in preadolescence. In girls, internalizing behavior at age 3 predicted parent-reported internalizing behavior, and associated negatively with externalizing behavior in self-reports at age 12. Aggressive behavior was found to be remarkably stable, and both aggressive and destructive behavior independently predicted a wide range of later externalizing and internalizing problems. Parent ratings of withdrawal showed stability from early childhood to preadolescence in both genders. Somatic complaints of 3-year-old girls independently predicted both externalizing and internalizing problems. Conclusions The results show the complexity of pathways in psychopathology from early childhood to preadolescence. In particular, aggressive and destructive behaviors in very early childhood predict later problems and necessitate early recognition and possible intervention at an early age. An instrument like the CBCL 2-3 is valuable in the early detection of children at risk of long-term problems.

AB Emotional problems are common after breast cancer, but patients differ in their vulnerability. Childhood abuse is a risk factor for emotional problems in adult women, and we tested whether it explains some of the variability in emotional problems after breast cancer. Women with primary breast cancer (N = 355) 2-4 d after surgery (mastectomy or wide local excision) self-reported current emotional distress, post-traumatic stress, self-blame, bodily shame and recollections of childhood sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Multiple logistic regression analyses tested the relationship of each emotional problem to abuse, distinguishing three age-groups, divided at 50 and 65 years. Emotional distress, post-traumatic stress, self-blame and shame were present in 49%, 8%, 22% and 13% of women, respectively. Each problem was more common in women who recalled one or other form of abuse. Apart from emotional distress, emotional problems were less common in older women. Older women were also less likely to recall abuse, and recall of abuse contributed statistically to explaining the relationship of youth to emotional problems. Childhood abuse is a risk factor for emotional problems after surgical treatment for breast cancer, and the challenge of identifying and helping those patients in whom emotional problems reflect pre-morbid vulnerabilities needs careful consideration. Because both emotional problems and abuse are strongly age-linked, future research should avoid generalisations across the age spectrum. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study tested models of perfectionism predicting psychological distress and academic adjustment and moderators and mediators of those associations in 2 successive cohorts of high-achieving university honors students (N = 499). Participants completed measures early and late in the semester. Adaptive (high standards) and maladaptive (self-critical perceptions of inadequacy in meeting performance expectations) dimensions of perfectionism were found to be significantly associated, in generally expected directions, with concurrent and prospective perceived stress, social connectedness, depression, hopelessness, and perceived academic adjustment. However, some perfectionism effects were reduced when earlier psychological distress and adjustment were controlled in analyses predicting later distress and adjustment. Several effects were moderated and at least partially mediated by perceived stress and social connection. The results suggest several counseling implications for high-achieving perfectionistic students.

AB Emotional deficits in anorexia nervosa can be expressed in autobiographical memory recall. The aim of this study is to test whether deficits in autobiographical memory exist in anorexic patients and concern specifically negative or positive emotional valence. Moreover, it is unclear whether these deficits are dependent upon comorbid aspects (depression, alexithymia, and anxiety) or upon illness duration. Anorexic patients (n = 25) were compared to healthy volunteers based on their clinical assessment, explicit memory test score, and autobiographical memory test score. The study makes use of the autobiographical test of Williams and Scott, which involves specific emotional cues to elicit memory. Anorexic patients recalled more general memories than controls in autobiographical memory test, but had no deficit in explicit memory test. This pattern, observed both for negative and positive cues, was neither related to depression or alexithymia, nor to anxiety severity, but increased significantly with illness duration. These results show that anorexic patients are characterized by relative difficulty in the integration of both negative and positive emotional experiences, and that this impairment is reinforced by illness duration.

AB Objective: To compare prevalence of serious emotional and behavioral problems and mental health contacts for these problems among American and British children and adolescents.
   Method: Data on children and adolescents ages 5 to 16 years were drawn from the 2004 U.S. National Health Interview Survey (response rate = 79.4%) and the 2004 survey of Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain (response rate = 76.0%). Emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and conduct problems were assessed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Psychometric properties of SDQ scales were compared across countries.
   Results: The SDQ has similar psychometric properties across countries. More British than American children met the criteria for emotional and conduct problems, but not hyperactivity/inattention. Prevalence was higher for all problems in 5- to 8-year-old British boys and for emotional problems in 13- to 16-year-old British girls. American children with serious emotional and behavioral problems had a higher prevalence of mental health contacts overall and with mental health providers but not with general medical providers.
   Conclusions: British children have a higher prevalence of parent-reported serious emotional and behavioral problems than American children. However, British children with these problems are less likely than American children to receive mental health care.

AB Study Objectives: Childhood sleep disorders are consistently shown to affect behavior and cognition, but first-night effects on these measures are generally unknown. We sought to examine how sleep in the home versus the laboratory differed among healthy toddlers and how such differences relate to standardized scores on assessments the morning following polysomnography.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: Twenty healthy 14-month-olds wore actigraphs during nighttime sleep at home for 5 nights preceding and during standard overnight laboratory polysomnography. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) were administered once the morning after polysomnography.
   Measurements and Results: All subjects had normal polysomnography. Sleep-start times at home and during polysomnography did not differ, whereas, during polysomnography, subjects awoke earlier (p = .008, d = .58), their total sleep time (p < .001, d = 1.1) and sleep efficiency (p = .004, d = .57) were reduced, and they had shorter sleep-bout lengths (p = .004, d = .03), less immobility (p = .003, d = .62), and greater average activity during sleep (p < .001, d = .98). Standardized assessments were not affected by differences between home and polysomnography night sleep, but children with greater emotional regulation difficulty had a lower percentage of immobility (r = -0.67, p = .001) and increased sleep fragmentation (r = -0.60, p = .005) during polysomnography.
   Conclusions: Although sleep-onset times were preserved, sleep in the laboratory was disrupted, compared with at home. These differences did not affect standardized scores, but the magnitude of the difference was associated with worse emotional regulation. The effects of sleep disturbance during polysomnography, or the influence of poor emotional regulation on sleep in the laboratory, should be considered in studies of young children.

AB This study examined the relationship between perception of communication and report of symptoms among second-generation Cambodian children and their parents using a matched-control design of clinic and community children. Children reported significantly higher symptoms than parents in both samples. Clinic parents reported more symptoms than community parents, but no differences were observed between children, and the mean level of child-reported symptoms was similar to past studies examining clinic populations. Parents reported better communication than children, and community respondents reported better communication than their clinic counterparts. Same-informant communication predicted symptom report. These data suggest that communication is a key factor in understanding symptoms in this group, provide evidence that child perception of communication is particularly important, and that the use of a matched control design might reveal high symptom levels in community samples that are otherwise undetected.

AB Few studies have examined factors in an out-of-home care sample and explicitly tested these in a predictive model. The purpose of our study was to build an exploratory predictive model of psychological adjustment, defined in terms of anxiety and physical aggression. Participants comprised 220 young people, aged 14 to 17, residing in Ontario, Canada. Selected predictors consisted of the factors most commonly thought to favor positive psychological adjustment among young people. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to test predictive models of psychological adjustment. The findings revealed a significant association between lower levels of anxiety and higher-quality relationships with the female caregiver, a greater number of close friendships, and higher self-esteem. Less frequent physically aggressive behaviors were associated with a smaller number of primary caregivers, higher-quality relationships with the female caregiver, a greater number of close friendships, higher self-esteem, greater use of approach coping strategies, and less frequent use of avoidant coping strategies. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To conduct a qualitative evaluation of parenting among families with school-aged and young adolescent children with craniofacial anomalies (CFAs).
   Methods: Interview responses were obtained from nine mothers of children ages 9 to 14 years old with CFAs. Mothers were asked to describe their perceptions of their children, their children's special needs because of CFAs, and their parenting strategies. Narratives were coded into categories, including maternal concerns and worries, children's strengths, proactive maternal behaviors, and role of CFAs in the families' lives.
   Results and Conclusions: Mothers' responses indicated concern and protectiveness because of the challenges of having a CFA, as well as parenting strategies intended to promote autonomy and positive social and emotional adjustment.

AB This review addresses the phenomenology of mania/bipolar disorder from a developmental psychopathology perspective and uses cases with longitudinal information to illustrate major points. Beginning with a summary of the phenomenology of bipolar illness as it occurs in adults, the authors identify diagnostic complexities unique to children and adolescents. These include the challenges of characterizing elation and grandiosity; differentiating mania from comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis. We conclude with the observation that a significant difference between early and later onset bipolar disorder is that, in the former, there appears to be a global delay or arrest in the development of appropriate affect regulation; whereas in adult-onset bipolar illness, emotion dysregulation generally presents as an intermittent phenomenon. At this juncture, the study of childhood bipolar illness would benefit from a developmental psychopathology perspective to move beyond the level of cross-sectional symptom description to begin to study individuals over time, focusing on developmental, environmental, genetic, and neurobiological influences on manifest behavior.

AB Much controversy has surrounded the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) in children and adolescents. However, recent work from an affective neuroscience perspective has advanced what is known about the boundaries of emotion regulation in BD compared to typically developing youth. In this article, we first briefly review the clinical issues that have contributed to this diagnostic controversy. Second, we discuss our phenotyping system, which can be used to guide neurobiological research designed to address these controversial issues. Third, we review what is known about the fundamentals of emotion regulation in human and nonhuman primate models. Fourth, we present recent data demonstrating how children and adolescents with BD differ from those without psychopathology on measures of emotion regulation. Taken as a whole, this work implicates a neural circuit encompassing the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and striatum in the pathophysiology of pediatric BD.

AB The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of the sleep-wake cycle in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. After presenting an overview of the measurement and function of human sleep, we describe changes in sleep and circadian functioning across the life cycle. We then review evidence that, in adults, sleep and/or circadian rhythms are of considerable influence in the multifactorial causal chain implicated in relapse in bipolar disorder, discussing relevant mechanisms. The latter include abnormalities in the amount and timing of sleep, the role of social zeitgebers, and the importance of sleep in regulating emotional responses and mood. We next present preliminary data indicating considerable sleep disturbance among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Given the considerable sleep disturbance evident among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder along with a key role for sleep in emotion regulation and learning, we conclude that sleep among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder is a critical domain for future research. An agenda for future research is presented that includes descriptive studies, investigations of causality, and treatment development research.

AB This study inventoried the types of developmental and negative experiences that youth encounter in different categories of extracurricular and community-based organized activities. A representative sample of 2,280 11th graders from 19 diverse high schools responded to a computer-administered protocol. Youth in faith-based activities reported higher rates of experiences related to identity, emotional regulation, and interpersonal development in comparison with other activities. Sports and arts programs stood out as providing more experiences related to development of initiative, although sports were also related to high stress. Service activities were associated with experiences related to development of teamwork, positive relationships, and social capital. Youth reported all of these positive developmental experiences to occur significantly more often in youth programs than during school classes.

AB The current paper reviews four research perspectives that have been used to investigate the development of risk-taking. Cognitive developmental research has investigated the development of decision-making capacities that potentially underlie risk-taking development, including sensitivity to risk, probability estimation, and perceptions of vulnerability. Emotional development research has found that affective decision-making and emotional regulation skills improve with development through adolescence. Psychobiological research has analyzed the cognitive and affective neurological and biochemical bases of risk-taking, and their development. Social developmental research has explored the effects of parent-child relationship quality, parenting strategies, and peer influences on the emergence of risk-taking tendencies. Although they have remained largely independent, it is argued throughout that factors within each of these perspectives interact to influence the probability that an individual will engage in risky activities, which should be the topic of future research.

AB Aggressive behavior in childhood has long been separated into that which is proactively motivated and that which is reactive. We report a meta-analytic review of the existing empirical literature that examines the associations of each type of aggression with six indices of psychosocial adjustment: internalizing problems, emotional dysregulation and ADHD-type symptoms, delinquent behaviors, prosocial behavior, sociometric status, and peer victimization. Even though not detectable in most single studies, meta-analytic combination revealed that reactive aggression was more strongly related to most of the indices of adjustment than was proactive aggression. This difference was small, however, and we argue that the difficulty in detecting differential correlates is due to the high intercorrelation between the functions of aggression, which appears to be an artifact of traditional measurement procedures. It is recommended that future research use measures that provide distinct assessment of the functions in order to more clearly distinguish the correlates of proactive and reactive aggression.

AB The prevalence, etiology, and consequences of adolescent risk behavior have stimulated much research. The current study examined relationships among anger and depressive symptomatology (DS), risk perception, self-restraint, and adolescent risk behavior. Telephone surveys were conducted with 290 14- to 20-year-olds (173 females; M = 15.98 years). Anger and perceptions of risk directly predicted risk behavior. An indirect effect of depressive symptomatology on risk behavior through perceptions of risk was revealed. Anger predicted risk behavior, particularly for adolescents with low self-restraint. The association between risk perception and risk behavior was stronger for older than for younger adolescents. Findings offer insight into the affective influences of risk behavior and may be used to inform prevention and intervention programs aimed at adolescents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed, along with attachment style, forgiveness, empathy, and emotional expressiveness. Securely attached individuals were more forgiving of the specific offense, had higher levels of trait forgiveness, and expressed more positive emotion. Securely attached adults had lower interview systolic blood pressure and exhibited greater blood pressure recovery. Attachment style may be an independent antecedent of forgiveness.

AB This is the 1st national study to examine whether the level of contact between adoptive and birth family members is associated with the behavioral and emotional adjustment of adolescents adopted in infancy (n = 92). Adoptive family members were interviewed twice, 8 years apart, to determine the level of contact taking place throughout adoptees' childhood and adolescence. The Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach, 1991 a) and Youth Self-Report (T. M. Achenbach, 1991b) were administered in adolescence. Adoptive parents' reports indicate no significant associations between openness and adolescent adjustment. Adoptees experiencing long-term direct contact reported significantly lower levels of externalizing than adoptees without contact. Adoption policies and legal procedures will best serve families by facilitating voluntary openness agreements that accommodate openness decisions on a case-by-case basis.

AB This study examined the degree to which male youth ice hockey players' (N = 229, M age = 14.15 years; SD = 1.03) perfectionist orientations were associated with anger vulnerability in competition. Perfectionism and trait anger were measured as domain-specific constructs. Athletes were also asked to speculate on the likely intensity of anger responses if they were to commit mistakes in high- and low-criticality situations in competition. Canonical correlation results indicated that heightened perfectionist orientations were associated with heightened competitive trait anger. Cluster analyses produced three clusters of athletes who possessed either low, moderate, or high levels of perfectionism. Significant between-cluster differences on anger responses to mistakes were obtained, with highly perfectionistic athletes anticipating significantly higher levels of anger following mistakes than low and moderately perfectionistic athletes. A significant situation-criticality main effect was also observed, with athletes anticipating higher levels of anger following personal mistakes in high- as opposed to low-criticality situations. Results are discussed within the context of cognitive motivational theories of emotion.

AB This study examined children's presentations of the "LD experience" as expressed in online messages on a public website designed for children with learning and attention problems. Earlier research has demonstrated that children view the Internet as a social medium that enables communication and promotes personal relationships. In the current study, we assumed that students with LD would treat this specially designed website as a "safe environment," enabling them to present their self-identities as children with LD and to share the personal meaning of their challenges. By studying their online messages, we sought to develop a deeper understanding of the children's thoughts, feelings and attitudes, as well as the ways they present themselves online. Theme analysis was performed on 4,903 e-mails sent from 164 self-identified LD participants ages 9-18. Six major themes emerged: (a) LD identity presentation; (b) disclosure of academic difficulties; (c-d) disclosure of emotional problems and social distress; (e) requests for help; and (f) description of positive aspects of LD. Results demonstrated the potential the study of online messaging has for understanding the LD experience. Implications for practice, considerations regarding future studies, and study limitations are discussed.

The sample consisted of 250 twin pairs (age 12-17). Scores of three groups of respondents (adolescents, parents and teachers) are compared. It is revealed that such adolescent properties as insularity, somatic complaints and aggressiveness are developed under the influence of specific to every adolescent genetic and environmental factors. Individual differences in anxiety/depression and social disadaptation are connected with the influence of common environmental factors and specific to every adolescent environmental experience. Individual differences in attention/hyperactivity are developed under the influence of common and individual environmental factors. The significant sex differences in hereditability in such properties as attention/hyperactivity and delinquency are revealed.

DT Article
DE adolescent; deafness; prevalence; psychiatric assessment; sign language
ID BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS; HEALTH; CHILD; PARENT
AB Objective: There are no empirically validated measures of psychopathology that can be easily understood by signing deaf children and little reliable data on the prevalence of psychiatric disturbance in this population. The aim was to meet this need by developing an Australian Sign Language (Auslan) version of a widely used measure (the Youth Self-Report; YSR) which could be administered in an interactive CD-ROM format, to assess its reliability, and to compare the prevalence of clinically significant psychopathology in deaf adolescents when using the Auslan questionnaire versus the standard written version. This would also allow examining the validity of written questionnaires in this population.
   Method: Twenty-nine male and 25 female adolescents with severe or profound hearing loss from public and private schools in the Australian States of Tasmania (n = 11) and New South Wales (n = 43) agreed to participate and completed the written and the interactive Auslan versions of the YSR. Parallel forms were completed by parents (Child Behaviour Checklist) and teachers (Teacher's Report Form).
   Results: The Auslan version showed comparable reliability to that reported for the standard YSR: internal consistency ( a) ranging from 0.77 to 0.97 and test-retest agreement (r) from 0.49 to 0.78. The interactive Auslan version yielded a prevalence of clinically significant emotional and behavioural problems in deaf adolescents of 42.6% compared with 21.4% when using the standard English version. Prevalence for the wider Australian adolescent population (18.9%) was similar to that obtained among deaf adolescents when using the standard YSR (21.4%). However, it was higher among deaf adolescents (42.6%) when using the Auslan version (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.83 - 5.58). According to the Auslan version, the syndromes Withdrawn/Depressed (OR = 6.5, 95% CI = 2.96 - 14.25), Somatic Complaints (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.53 - 9.22), Social Problems (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 4.16 - 16.47) and Thought Problems (OR = 5.7, 95% CI = 2.50 - 12.80) were much more prevalent among deaf adolescents than in the wider adolescent population, while Attention Problems (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.39 - 3.17) and Rule-Breaking Behaviour (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.73 - 3.17) were not.
   Conclusions: An interactive Auslan version of the YSR is reliable, better accepted and yields higher rates of disturbance than the standard written questionnaire. Clinicians should be aware that using written instruments to assess psychopathology in deaf adolescents may produce invalid results or may underestimate the level of disturbance, particularly emotional problems.

AB Objectives: This study investigated social skills deficits among adolescents with bipolar disorder. Methods: Adolescents with DMS-IV bipolar disorder (n = 18) and their parents completed social skills assessments when they were experiencing minimal mood symptoms. The control group ( n = 18) consisted of adolescents with no history of psychiatric disorders. Participants and their parents rated the adolescents' social performance using the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters. We measured the adolescents' knowledge of appropriate social skills using the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategy Interview. Raters 'blind' to psychiatric status rated the adolescents' responses and their social interactions with an examiner during the assessment.
   Results: Adolescents with bipolar disorder displayed significantly more social skills performance deficits than controls. No significant differences emerged between the groups in social skills knowledge. Ratings of social interactions with the examiner failed to distinguish bipolar from control teens, but raters were successful in guessing the psychiatric status of the participants.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that bipolar adolescents lag behind their peers in social skills performance, but not social skills knowledge. Results support the hypothesis that difficulties with emotion regulation interfere with the consistent exhibition of appropriate social behaviors.

AB Behavioral symptomatology was compared in 26 children and adolescents with Autistic Disorder ("autism") and 25 children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified ("PDD-NOS"). Relative to individuals with PDD-NOS, those with autism had more symptoms of depression, social withdrawal, atypical behavior, and immature social skills-and fewer family problems. These differences remained even when group differences in intellectual ability were statistically controlled. No group differences emerged in somatization, anxiety, or hyperactivity. Findings suggest that although both groups demonstrate considerable evidence of behavioral and emotional problems, those with autism are at particularly high risk for comorbid behavioral and emotional disabilities.

AB The objective of this study is to validate the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) for the legal guardians of unaccompanied refugee minors residing in the Netherlands. The legal guardians (caseworkers) of the unaccompanied minors (N=920) that participated in the study all received a CBCL to report on the mental health of the unaccompanied minor. The guardians filled in and returned 478 CBCLs. The results of the hierarchical confirmative factor analyses support a one-factor and a two-factor structure of Externalizing and Internalizing scales equally well. Moreover, the fit of the original individual eight first order factor models of the a priori CBCL subscales was found to be moderate. The total, Internalizing, and Externalizing scales show good internal consistency. The construct and concurrent validity of the CBCL were also examined and found to be moderate to good. The findings of this study suggest that the CBCL is a reliable and valid measure for use by guardians to assess the maladaptive emotional and behavior problems of unaccompanied refugee minors.

AB Autobiographical memory retrieval is fundamental to the developing self-concept in adolescence, to emotion regulation, and to social problem solving and has been shown to be compromised in adolescents diagnosed with depression (R. J. Park, I. M. Goodyer, & J. D. Teasdale, 2002). The authors of the present study assessed autobiographical memory overgenerality in a sample of depressed adolescent participants with, versus without, a reported history of trauma and never-depressed control participants by using an emotion word-cueing paradigm. The authors' analyses showed for the first time that adolescents with major depression and with no reported history of trauma exhibited an overgeneral memory bias. They also revealed that depressed adolescents who reported a history of trauma retrieved fewer overgeneral memories than did depressed adolescents who reported no history of trauma. Among depressed adolescents who reported a history of trauma, more severe posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with less overgenerality. Possible accounts of these findings are suggested.

AB Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at risk for the development of comorbid conduct disorder ( CD) and depression. The current study examined potential psychosocial risk factors for CD and depression in a clinic-based sample of 203 boys ( aged 6-10 years) with ADHD. Methods: The boys and their mothers participated in an evaluation that involved assessments of cognitive, behavioral, academic, and family functioning. Potential predictors of CD and depression involved four domains: parenting behaviors, family environment, academic/cognitive functioning, and peer relations. ADHD groups were defined using mother- and teacher-report of DSM-IV symptoms. Mother-ratings of DSM-IV symptoms were obtained for a subsample of 91 boys approximately 5 years after the initial assessment. Results: For both mother- and teacher-defined ADHD groups, social problems were related to depression symptoms; hostile, inconsistent, and detached parenting behaviors were related to CD symptoms; and family environment characterized by low cohesion, high conflict, and low marital satisfaction was related to CD and depression symptoms. For the teacher-defined ADHD group, parenting variables also predicted depression symptoms. Academic and cognitive variables did not predict CD or depression symptoms when parenting, family, and peer relationship variables were taken into account. Depression prospectively predicted CD, but not the reverse, and parental hostile control and familial conflict prospectively predicted CD for the teacher-defined ADHD group only. Conclusions: Source-specificity is a useful consideration when describing the relation of parenting and home environment with CD and depression symptoms in boys with ADHD. Intervention efforts that address these parenting, family, and peer relationship variables may aid in preventing the development of comorbid conditions.

AB Objective: To pilot test the acceptability and efficacy of contextual emotion-regulation therapy (CERT), anew, developmentally appropriate intervention for childhood depression, which focuses on the self-regulation of dysphoria. Method: Two samples of convenience (n = 29, n = 2) served to verify some CERT constructs; it was then operationalized in a treatment manual. To pilot test CERT, 20 children (ages 7-12; 35% girls) with DSM dysthymic disorder (mean duration 24.4 months) entered an open, 30-session, 10-month, 4-phase trial, with 6- and 12-month follow-up. Assessments included independent clinical evaluations and self-rated questionnaires. Results: Fifteen children completed therapy, four were administratively terminated, and one dropped out. Completers did not clinically differ from the rest, but they were more likely to have better educated and less depressed mothers and intact families. At the end of treatment, 53% of the completers had full and 13% partial remission of dysthymia (remission from superimposed major depression was 80%). By 6- and 12-month follow-up, 79% and 92% had full remission of dysthymia (p < .0001). Self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly declined by the end of treatment (p < .001) and remained so throughout follow-up. Conclusions: CERT enables clinicians to "match" the intervention to children's emotion regulatory needs and symptoms and was readily accepted by families. The promising results suggest the need for a randomized trial.

   psychiatric problems?

DT Editorial Material
DE behavioral problems; children; parents; prediction; psychiatric
   disorders
AB BACKGROUND
   A considerable proportion of children and adolescents have a psychiatric disorder, but they usually depend on the adults around them to identify the problem. At present, psychiatric conditions in young patients are often overlooked.
   OBJECTIVE
   To investigate whether parental concerns about their child's emotions or behavior can be used to predict a psychiatric disorder.
   DESIGN AND INTERVENTION
   The present analysis includes data on 10,438 children aged 5-15 years who were sampled from the 1999 Child Benefit register in the UK. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders according to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition) were obtained using the Development and Well-Being Assessment instrument. In addition, parents were interviewed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire a screening questionnaire that evaluates the extent of behavioral symptoms and assesses the impact of these symptoms at home, at school and with peers. Parents were also asked whether their child had problems in any of the following psychological areas: 'hyperactivity', 'behavioral problems' or 'emotional problems'. Furthermore, information was collected on whether teachers had complained about the child's concentration, activity level or impulsiveness.
   OUTCOME MEASURES
   Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity and sensitivity of parental responses to a few simple questions for predicting a child's psychiatric illness.
   RESULTS
   In total, 9.5% of parents stated that their child had psychological difficulties, with 5.5% reporting behavioral problems, 4.1% reporting emotional problems and 3.4% reporting hyperactivity; 2.9% of parents reported problems in more than one area. Nearly half of the children whose parents expressed concern had a DSM-IV psychiatric disorder; the PPV of parental concerns was 47.2% (95% Cl 44.1-50.3%), and the sensitivity was 47.8% (95% Cl 44.7-51.0%). Children whose parents expressed concern tended to have significant psychological difficulties even if they were not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, as indicated by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire symptoms and impact scores of 13.9 (SD 5.3) and 0.9 (SD 1.4), respectively; by comparison, children whose parents stated no concern had scores of 7.5 (SD 4.9) and 0.2 (SD 0.7), respectively. Parents were most accurate at identifying conduct disorders, followed by attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHDs) and emotional disorders (sensitivities 53.0% [95% Cl 48.5-57.4%], 35.3% [95% Cl 29.2-41.9%] and 27.1% [95% Cl 23.1-31.5%], respectively). The predictive power for identifying children with a hyperactivity disorder was markedly increased if both parents and teachers reported concern (PPV 62.1% [95% CI 51.0-72.3%], compared with a PPV of 23.2% [95% Cl 18.9-27.9%] if only the parent reported hyperactivity). A lack of parental concern was highly indicative of the absence of significant mental health problems, with an NPV for the presence of at least one psychiatric problem of 94.6% (95% Cl 94.1-95.0%) and a specificity of 94.4% (95% Cl 94.0-94.9%).
   CONCLUSION
   If parents express concern about a child's emotions or behavior, there is a 50:50 chance that the child has a psychiatric disorder. Parents are highly accurate in ruling out mental health problems in their child.

AB BACKGROUND. Very low birth weight survivors are at increased risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems and low social and academic competencies. Information on such problems in very low birth weight adolescents is still sparse.
   OBJECTIVES. Our purpose for this work was to study gender-specific emotional and behavioral problems and social and academic competencies in a cohort of very low birth weight adolescents in north Norway.
   METHODS. Families with very low birth weight adolescents aged 13 to 18 years, born between 1978 and 1989 (n = 162) were addressed by mail and asked to complete the Child Behavior Check List and the Youth Self-Report. Data were compared with 2 normative adolescent populations (Child Behavior Check List, n = 540; Youth Self-Report, n = 2522). Scores given by very low birth weight adolescents and their parents on identical items in Child Behavior Check List and Youth Self-Report (cross-informant syndrome constructs) were compared in pairs. To explore predictive effects, demographic and early medical characteristics were entered into a hierarchical multiple regression analysis.
   RESULTS. There were 156 eligible families, and 99 (63.5%) responded. All completed the Child Behavior Check List, and 82 (52.6%) completed the Youth Self-Report. Very low birth weight boys reported less externalizing and internalizing behaviors and thought and attention problems and higher activity score, whereas very low birth weight girls reported less externalizing behavior and less social, thought, and attention problems and higher activity score compared with normative adolescents. Very low birth weight parents, however, reported more social and attention problems and less social and school competence in boys and more internalizing behavior and social and attention problems and less school competence in girls compared with normative parents. They scored high proportions of both genders within the borderline/clinical range on all of the scales, except for externalizing behavior and social problems in girls. Female very low birth weight adolescents, in contrast to males, reported more problems than parents when compared in pairs, and externalizing problems in particular were not recognized by parents.
   CONCLUSIONS. From parents' point of view, significant proportions of very low birth weight adolescents experience more emotional and behavioral problems and less competence than normative adolescents. In contrast, very low birth weight adolescents state less problems and similar or higher competence than normative adolescents. Very low birth weight adolescent girls report more emotional and behavioral problems compared with their parents than very low birth weight adolescent boys do. Externalizing problems in very low birth weight adolescent girls are often not recognized by parents. To better understand these seemingly paradoxical findings and to develop adequate intervention programs, there is a need for prospective longitudinal studies.

AB This study examined how previously suicidal adolescents and emerging adults perceived their emotional experiences while being suicidal. Forty-one females and 9 males previously suicidal between the ages of 15 and 24 were interviewed. Qualitative data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Three major themes were identified in participants' perceptions of their emotional experiences: (a) overwhelming despair (b) shame and self-loathing, and (c) alienation and personal isolation. These emotional states were viewed within the multidimensional process of responding to emotions. Participants' inability to deal with intense negative emotions appeared to be related to their suicidal state.

AB Background: The goal of this study was to investigate the stability and correlates of adolescent suicidal risk across adolescence. Methods: Suicidal risk was studied longitudinally in N = 593 subjects in 1994, 1997, and 2001 at mean ages of 13, 16, and 20 years. Three partly overlapping suicidal risk groups were compared to three control groups matched by age and gender regarding behavioural and emotional problems, number and impact of life events, coping capacities, self-related cognitions, and the size and efficiency of the social network. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained in young adulthood. Results: The group stability of suicidal risk was 43% from time 1 to time 2 and 18% from time 1 to time 3. Intra-individual stability of suicidal risks across adolescence was significantly higher than expected. At all three times of assessment, there was a clear excess of abnormal psychosocial findings in the suicidal risk groups as compared to the matched controls. Substance abuse disorders, depressive disorders, phobias and any psychiatric disorders in young adulthood were predicted by suicidal risk in preadolescence irrespective of behavioural and emotional disorders. Conclusions: Suicidal risk individuals are remarkably stable across adolescence and show a very consistent pattern of associated behavioural and emotional problems and psychosocial variables across time from preadolescence to young adulthood. They also display an increased risk for some mental disorders in young adulthood.

Eleven children (ten females) with idiopathic central precocious puberty, with a mean chronological age of 75 +/- 1.8 years and a bone age of 9.7 +/- 0.8 years were recruited. Testicular volume in the male was 15 ml. In females, Tanner stage for breast development was between 2-4 and mean ovarian volume was 2.3 +/- 0.8 ml. They were treated during 18 months with aLHRH, 11.25 mg administered intramuscularly every three months. Results. Clinical, hormonal and ultrasonographic signs of puberty regressed in all patients. The degree of suppression of LH was 87.7 +/- 5.1% at the end of the 18 months. No significant changes in bone mineral content were observed during the treatment period. Conclusions. Leuprolide (aLHRH) 11.25 mg, injected every three months, is effective for the control of central precocious puberty and allows to reduce the number of yearly injections from 12 to 4 (Rev Med Chile 2006; 134: 821-6).

AB Emotional difficulties, and especially depressive symptomatology, constitute a serious and relatively frequent childhood problem which are often overlooked. Teachers' responses to pupils' depression seem to be related to their understanding concerning the causes of this problem. Thus, the, aims of the present research are: (a) to estimate the proportion of pupils displaying depressive symptomatology; (b) to examine teachers' readiness and ability to identify those pupils; (c) to search for teachers' perceptions concerning the causation of pupils' behavioural-emotional problems including depression and (d) to explore the differences between younger and older teachers' ausal attributions. The sample consisted of 323 pupils from the fifth to sixth grades and their teachers, in the area of Volos, Greece. Pupils completed the Children's Depression Inventory, while their teachers completed a questionnaire concerning their perceptions of the incidence and causes of their students' emotional-behavioural problems and depressive symptoms. The results indicate that approximately 30 percent of the students indicated a high level of depressive symptoms, while their teachers seemed to lack readiness and skills for identifying this; they reported more often behaviour problems and tended to attribute students' difficulties to factors lying outside the school context. Implications are discussed in terms of developments in teachers' training and policies leading to greater support for pupils experiencing depressive symptoms.

AB This study reports young people's assessment of own problems and strengths from a Norwegian survey (n=29,631, age range 10-19), based on the self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (response rate 84.3%). Differences according to the age and gender are illuminated. Girls reported most emotional problems and boys most conduct and peer problems. Compared to other countries, Norwegian adolescents reported more hyperactive behaviour. Total problem scores were highest in early-adolescence for boys (Mean=10.8, SD=6.1), and for girls it is in late adolescence (Mean 11.3, SD=5.2). One third of the subjects reported at least minor perceived difficulties. All symptom scales were strongly associated with perceived difficulties, impact and burden to others (P < 0.001) with significant gender and age effects. Impact scores were included in the estimate of possible caseness. Combining symptom scores and impact scores, 3.7% of the sample was defined as a high risk group, while 8.8% needed special attention from mental health services. The results also suggested that SDQ could be a valuable screening instrument for older adolescents.

AB Relatively little is known about attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among students receiving special education in terms of their demographic characteristics, instructional settings, and programming, nor about how these factors differ from students with disabilities who do not have ADHD. Data from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS), a nationally representative study of students receiving special education, show that students with ADHD now constitute the majority of students in the categories of emotional disturbance and other health impairment. Hispanic students were underrepresented. Students with ADHD were more likely to receive accommodations and services than their non ADHD special education peers.

AB The authors describe a neurodevelopmentally relevant, clinically derived model for understanding and treating aggressive behavior in youth. Based on case experience and literature review, the authors divide aggressive behavior into five symptomatic domains with respective neurobiological/neurodevelopmental underpinnings. These five symptom domains (impulsivity, affective instability, anxious/hyperarousal, cognitive disorganization, and predatory aggression) emerge as logical and clinically useful targets for treatment. The authors aim to establish a relationship between these symptom domains and brain structure and function that offers a clinically relevant approach to the complexities of understanding aggression and its treatment.

AB The current study examined the relations between two aspects of emotional competence-emotion knowledge and emotion expression, and children's attentional competence during one school year. Participants were 263 first- and second-grade students at two rural elementary schools. A multiple regression analysis showed that emotion knowledge predicted attentional competence while controlling for age, gender, verbal ability, and initial levels of attentional competence. Multiple regression analyses examining predictors of peer nominations of emotion expression showed that attentional competence predicted peer nominations of happiness, sadness, and anger expression, and emotion knowledge predicted peer nominations of anger expression. Potential improvements for prevention programs and the importance of the findings for school personnel are discussed.

A 30-year longitudinal venture is described-its theoretical motivation, methodological rationale, and details of implementation. Some of the novel and implicative findings the study has generated are briefly described. Common to all of, the results is an absolute reliance on long-term, widely ranging, independent data. Although specific aspects of the study have appeared over the years, its intentions and scope are recounted only here. By and large, the organizing constructs of ego-control and ego-resiliency find impressive support in various empirical inquiries, here quickly described. Methodologically, a number of savvy research procedures useful and perhaps even necessary in longitudinal research are conveyed. The troublesome burdens but ever-alluring attractions of longitudinal inquiry are noted.

AB Context: Research has suggested that some types of parental child-rearing behavior may be associated with risk for offspring personality disorder (PD), but the association of parenting with offspring PD has not been investigated comprehensively with prospective longitudinal data.
   Objective: To investigate the association of parental child-rearing behavior with risk for offspring PD during adulthood.
   Design: The Children in the Community study, a prospective longitudinal investigation.
   Setting and Participants: A community-based sample of 593 families interviewed during childhood (mean age, 6 years), adolescence (mean ages, 14 and 16 years), emerging adulthood (mean age, 22 years), and adulthood (mean age, 33 years) of the offspring.
   Main Outcome Measure: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders.
   Results: Ten types of parenting behavior that were evident during the child-rearing years were associated with elevated offspring risk for PD during adulthood when childhood behavioral or emotional problems and parental psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically. Parental behavior in the home during the child-rearing years was associated with elevated risk for offspring PD at mean ages of 22 and 33 years. Risk for offspring PD at both assessments increased steadily as a function of the number of problematic parenting behaviors that were evident. Low parental affection or nurturing was associated with elevated risk for offspring antisocial (P = .003), avoidant (P = .01), borderline (P = .002), depressive (P = .02), paranoid (P = .002), schizoid (P = .046), and schizotypal (P < .001) PDs. Aversive parental behavior (eg, harsh punishment) was associated with elevated risk for offspring borderline (P = .001), paranoid (P = .004), passive-aggressive (P = .046), and schizotypal (P = .02) PDs.
   Conclusions: Parental behavior during the child-rearing years may be associated with risk for offspring PD that endures into adulthood. This risk may not be attributable to offspring behavioral and emotional problems or parental psychiatric disorder, and it may not diminish over time. Low parental nurturing and aversive parental behavior during child rearing may both be associated with elevated risk for offspring PDs.

AB In people with velo-cardio-facial syndrome [or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS)], a single interstitial deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 causes a wide spectrum of cognitive deficits ranging from global learning difficulties to specific cognitive deficits. People with 22qDS are also at high risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders in childhood, and schizophrenia in adolescence or adult life. However, the neurobiology of 22qDS, and the relationship between abnormalities in brain anatomy and behaviour, is poorly understood. Thus, we studied the neuroanatomy of 22qDS children using fully automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and manually traced single region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Also, we investigated whether those brain regions that differed significantly between groups were related to behavioural differences within children with 22qDS. We compared the brain morphometry of 39 children and adolescents with 22qDS (mean age: 11 years, SD +/- 3, IQ = 67, SD +/- 10) and 26 sibling controls (mean age: 11 years, SD +/- 3, IQ = 102, SD +/- 12). Using VBM, we found, after correction for IQ, that individuals with 22qDS compared with controls had a significant reduction in cerebellar grey matter, and white matter reductions in the frontal lobe, cerebellum and internal capsule. Using single ROI analysis, we found that people with 22qDS had a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in bulk volume bilaterally in the occipital-parietal lobes, but a larger right caudate nucleus and lateral ventricles. Further, within people with 22qDS, there was a significant positive correlation between severity of (i) schizotypy score and grey matter volume of the temporo-occipital regions and the corpus striatum; (ii) emotional problems and grey matter volume of frontostriatal regions; and (iii) social behavioural difficulties and grey matter in frontostriatal regions. Thus, subjects with 22qDS have widespread changes in brain anatomy, particularly affecting white matter, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Also, within 22qDS, regionally specific differences in brain development may partially underpin behavioural differences. We suggest that there is preliminary evidence for specific vulnerability of the frontostriatal and cerebellar-cortical networks in 22qDS.

AB This study reports on the longitudinal examination of a structured arts program for Canadian youth, aged 9 to 15 years, from low-income communities. Evaluated were the extent to which community-based organizations successfully recruited and retained youth in the program and whether they demonstrated improvement with respect to artistic ability (combination of theatre, visual, and media arts) and psychosocial indicators. The results suggest successful recruitment and good retention rates. Multilevel growth curve analyses of observational and behavioral outcomes are presented Observer ratings showed significant gains in artistic and social skills. Comparisons with matched controls using estimated linear propensity scores revealed a significant reduction in emotional problems for the intervention group. The overall conclusion is that youth from low-income communities benefit from structured arts programs.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of identification of psychosocial problems in Latino children by primary care providers (PCPs). This was a cross-sectional study of 269 low-socioeconomic status (SES), Latino children, ages 2-16 years, seen at a community clinic for well-child care. Primary care providers completed a World Health Organization checklist, which organized provider assessment of child psychosocial problems. Clinicians identified one or more psychosocial problems in 39.8% of children. Clinicians recognized only 20% of children with clinically significant aggression symptoms, 18% of children with clinically significant attention/hyperactivity symptoms, and none (0%) of the children with clinically significant anxiety/depression symptoms with clinical data from parent-completed child-behavior checklists used as the benchmark. Despite high rates of identification of psychosocial problems in a low-SES, Latino population, PCPs still miss symptoms of mental health difficulties, especially anxiety and depression. Since symptoms of anxiety and depression are likely to be more pronounced in Latino populations, there is a continued need for improvement in detection of mental health concerns among these children.

AB The Youth Self Report (YSR) is a popular and widely used instrument assessing adolescent emotional and behavioral functioning. The goals of the present study were to address some of the limitations of the YSR, to examine its factor structure and equivalence across four racial/ethnic groups, and to determine if another combination of items could accurately represent the constructs Achenbach sought to elucidate in a more parsimonious way. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were utilized with random split-half samples to determine primary and secondary factors. Correlational analyses were then performed to determine the suitability of unit-weight factors as measures of the factors. And to examine the invariance of the short form YSR over ethnic groups, the covariance matrices were compared using structural equation modeling. Results revealed a seven factor scale that is shorter (66 vs. 119 items), is invariant across racial/ethnic groups, and has a simple structure. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Objective To study the prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems and the scope of symptoms in preschool children. The results serve as baseline in a 4-year follow-up study.
   Method The sample consisted of 1887 preschool children who started primary level education within 6 months upon data collection. The sample represented the complete 1-year intake of all first year primary school children in a northern German town of 254,000 residents. The data were collected with standardized parent questionnaires.
   Results The 6-month prevalence of behavioural and emotional symptoms was 12.4%. The overall score for internalizing symptoms (INT) was significantly higher than the score for externalizing symptoms (EXT). The disturbed children had the highest mean scores on the syndrome scale "Anxious or Depressed".
   Conclusions The level of psychopathology in preschool children was already as high as levels seen elsewhere in school children. The predominant role of INT was unexpected, particularly for boys. The attention of child mental health services need to focus on preschool children as on school children and on INT as much as on EXT, especially in boys.

AB Objective To investigate whether using ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is preceded by symptoms of behavioural and emotional problems in childhood and early adolescence.
   Design Prospective, longitudinal, population based study.
   Setting The Dutch province of Zuid-Holland.
   Participants A sample of 1580 individuals, followed up across a 14 year period, From childhood into adulthood.
   Main outcome measures The first assessment took place in 1983 before MDMA appeared as a recreational drug in the Netherlands and included the child behaviour checklist to obtain standardised parent's reports of their children's behavioural and emotional problems. Use of the drug was assessed with the composite international diagnostic interview 14 years later.
   Results Eight syndrome scales of childhood behaviour were examined. Scores in the deviant range for the scales designated as anxious or depressed in in childhood were significantly related to use of MDMA in adolescents and adults, resulting in an increased risk (hazard ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 4.11, P=0.01).
   Conclusions Individuals with childhood Symptoms of anxiety and depression may have all increased tendency to use MDMA in adolescence or young adulthood. Its effects are supposed to include enhanced feelings of bonding with other people, euphoria, or relaxation. Especially individuals With Symptoms of anxiety or depression may be susceptible to these positive effects.

AB Aims To study childhood precursors of drunkenness frequency among 18-year-old boys in a representative, nation-wide 10-year follow-up study. Design In 1989, a general population sample of 2946 8-year-old boys was collected. Three different informant sources were used: parents, teachers and the boys themselves. The follow-up was 10 years later in 1999, when the boys were called up for their obligatory military service at age 18. Information about drunkenness frequency was obtained from 78.3% (n = 2306) of the original sample. Setting Finland, nation-wide; in 1989 at schools, in 1999 at the obligatory military call-up. Participants General population sample of Finnish boys born in 1981. Measurements At age 8, the Rutter A2 scale, Rutter B2 scale and Child Depression Inventory (CDI) were used. At age 18, self-reported drunkenness frequency during the previous 6 months was determined. Findings Of the subjects, 15.0% reported never being drunk from alcohol, 74.6% reported being occasionally drunk and 10.4% reported being drunk at least once a week during the previous 6 months. After adjusting for other variables, teacher's estimate of the child's problem behaviour at age 8 predicted frequent drunkenness in late adolescence. Hyperactive problems predicted both occasional and frequent drunkenness. Conduct problems at age 8 predicted only frequent drunkenness. High teacher-reported scores of emotional problems predicted lower occurrence of drunkenness-orientated alcohol use. Conclusions The educational system has a potential role in detecting boys at risk of later risk-taking behaviours, such as frequent drunkenness. Early interventions in children with conduct problems and hyperactivity are called for.

   OBESITY; HEALTH; TIME; HOME
AB Objective: To examine whether social interactions influence the television viewing choices of adolescents in grades 7 through 12.
   Design: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey were used to examine the association between individual-level and school-level television choices. An instrumental variables approach was used to solve the simultaneity problem found in models that examine the association between individual and aggregate choices.
   Setting: In-home interviews in the United States collected in 1996.
   Participants: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7 through 12 in 132 US public and private schools who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
   Main Exposure: The reported television viewing choices of an individual's schoolmates. Main Outcome Measure: The number of hours of television individuals reported viewing in a week.
   Results: The number of hours of television that adolescents report viewing per week was associated with their peers' reported hours of television viewing. Adjusted for other covariates, a 1-hour increase in average school-level television viewing was associated with an increase in almost half an hour of television viewing at the individual level.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that social interactions within schools influence the hours of television that adolescents report viewing. This finding is important for both future attempts at modeling the determinants of adolescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy interventions. The presence of social interactions implies that interventions that affect the social norms of television viewing within schools could also change individual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours of television watched, these interventions could also positively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and academic achievement.

AB Research findings show that there is marked variability in children's response to parental separation, but few studies identify the sources of this variation. This prospective longitudinal study examines the factors modifying children's adjustment to parental separation in a community sample of 5,635 families in England. Children's behavioral/emotional problems were assessed when children were aged 47 and 81 months; marital quality, maternal depression, socioeconomic circumstances, and demographic variables were assessed prior to the separation from maternal report. Results indicated that 346 mothers separated from their partners in the 3-year period. Preseparation differences were found for measures of family process and parent risk factors, with effect sizes ranging from small to trivial. Parental separation was associated with a significant but modest increase in behavioral/emotional problems, independent of marital quality, maternal depression, socioeconomic circumstances, and demographic variables. Moderation analyses showed that children of cohabiting parents had a greater increase in adjustment problems following parental separation than children of married parents. Further research elucidating the factors that moderate children's adjustment to parental separation is needed to improve our understanding of who may most likely benefit from preventive interventions.

AB Theorists and investigators have emphasized an important role for control in emotional problems such as anxiety and anxiety disorders in youth. However, the term "control" is subject to theoretical ambiguities because of the broad conceptual bases for the term. In this article, we examine the concepts of locus of control, learned helplessness/attributional style, self-efficacy, and perceived control to develop an integrative model of control based on research and theory. The review emphasizes each of the theories distinguishing features in order to show how these distinctive features relate to real versus perceived control and how they may be differentially associated with childhood anxiety. We attempt to clarify the various definitions of control and the implications of these various definitions with respect to childhood anxiety, its disorders and their treatment and present a model of control that is integrative but also addresses the complexities of the different definitions of control (i.e., is multifaceted). The model developed from our review of the literature postulates that individuals differ in the extent to which they actually have control and differ, also on a continuum, in their perceptions of control. The need for this integrative model is highlighted by methodological, developmental, and clinical considerations. In particular, research has operationalized control and related constructs such as emotion regulation in ways that may be confounding actual control and perceived control. The need for an integrative but also multifaceted conceptualization of the role of control in childhood anxiety is also highlighted by clinical and developmental considerations. For instance, different facets of control may have differential relevance to clinical anxiety and at different points in childhood. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Within the past two decades, an "affect revolution" [Fischer and Tangney, Self-conscious Emotions: The Psychology of Shame, Guilt, Embarrassment, and Pride 1995:3-22] in research has revolutionized the ways in which emotion processes have been conceptualized and subsequently studied. This review discusses the literature on emotion regulation (ER) in childhood and adolescence by first summarizing the trajectory of emotional development from infancy through adolescence, followed by a discussion of the biological and environmental influences on ER, and then a review of the literature linking ER to psychosocial functioning. The penultimate section offers practical suggestions for identifying ER difficulties in children and strategies for intervention efforts. Potential areas for future research conclude the review.

AB To understand whether difficulties in emotional functioning distinguish between body dissatisfaction and disordered eating, a set of emotion regulation (i.e., negative emotion, emotional awareness, coping), demographic (i.e., age), and physical (i.e., BMI (Body Mass Index)) factors were assessed in 234 early adolescent girls, grades six to eight. Compared to younger girls, older girls had higher BMI and reported increased body dissatisfaction. Age, BMI, and negative affect predicted body dissatisfaction, whereas BMI, body dissatisfaction, and lack of emotional awareness predicted disordered eating. Further, girls who reported high levels of disordered eating reported experiencing increased levels of negative affect, greater difficulties with emotional awareness, and more difficulty coping constructively with negative emotion than girls who reported low levels of disordered eating. Results support the contention that body dissatisfaction, combined with difficulties in emotional awareness are related to disordered eating.

AB School psychologists have a critical role in identifying social-emotional problems and psychopathology in youth based on a set of personality-assessment competencies. The development of competencies in assessing personality and psychopathology is complex, requiring a variety of integrated methods and approaches. Given the limited extent and scope of formal preparation in personality assessment in school psychology training programs, it is important to develop models using multiple methods of assessment. It is proposed that an integrated paradigm associated with a combination of empirical and clinical methods serve as a framework for the development of school psychology practice competencies in personality assessment.

AB The present experiment was designed to determine whether individual variation in neurobiological mechanisms associated with Substance abuse risk moderated effects of a brief preventive intervention oil social competency skills. This study was conducted in collaboration with the ongoing preventive intervention study at Johns Hopkins University Prevention Intervention Research Center (JHU PIRC) within the Baltimore City Public Schools. A subsample (N = 120) of male 9th grade students was recruited from the larger JHU study population. Approximately half of the participants had a current or lifetime diagnosis of CD while the other half had no diagnosis of CD or other reported problem behaviors. Measures of executive cognitive function (ECF), emotional perception and intelligence were administered. In a later session, participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent a facilitated session using excerpted materials from a model preventive intervention, Positive Adolescent Choices Training (PACT), and controls received no intervention. Outcomes (i.e., social competency skills) were assessed using virtual reality vignettes involving behavioral choices as well as three social cognition questionnaires. Poor cognitive and emotional performance and a diagnosis of CD predicted less favorable change in social competency skills in response to the prevention curriculum. This study provides evidence for the moderating effects of neurocognitive and emotional regulatory functions oil ability of urban male Youth to respond to preventive intervention materials.

AB This paper discusses the evidence for parenting skills training and behavioral family intervention (BFI), and the need for early intervention and prevention programs. It presents a conceptual framework for a comprehensive multilevel parenting and family support strategy for reducing the prevalence of parenting difficulties and other family risk factors associated with child maltreatment and the development of behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. The framework for the system of intervention known as the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is described. Also discussed are issues in the dissemination of evidence-based psychological interventions. A dissemination approach is presented which is based on a systems-contextual perspective that views practitioner uptake as being influenced by a range of program design, training, quality maintenance, organizational and motivational variables. Our experience in the widespread dissemination and implementation of Triple P at a population-level are shared and recommendations and future directions for dissemination of evidence-based preventive family interventions are noted.

AB In this article, we review empirical research on the role of individuals' parenting and maltreatment histories as developmental antecedents for symptoms and diagnosable episodes of unipolar and bipolar spectrum disorders. Our review is focused on the following three overarching questions: (1) Do negative parenting and a history of maltreatment contribute risk to symptoms or diagnosable episodes of unipolar and bipolar disorders? (2) Are the associations of negative parenting and maltreatment histories with bipolar disorders similar to those for unipolar depression? and (3) Are the associations between negative parenting and maltreatment histories and unipolar and bipolar symptoms or disorders mediated by cognitive vulnerability to depression? We begin by discussing the methodological requirements for demonstrating a psychosocial risk factor and the methodological issues that plague the parenting and maltreatment literatures. Next, we review the extant studies on the role of parenting histories in unipolar and bipolar disorders. We consider the specificity and possible moderators of the parenting-mood disorder relationship, as well as cognitive vulnerability to depression as a mediator of this relationship. Then, we review studies on the association of maltreatment histories with unipolar and bipolar disorders and the role of cognitive vulnerability to depression as a mediator of this association. We conclude with an assessment of the state of the parenting and maltreatment literatures in unipolar and bipolar disorder with regard to our guiding questions.

AB We examined the impact on adolescent socioemotional functioning of maternal postnatal depression (PND) and attachment style. We also investigated the role of earlier aspects of the child's development-attachment in infancy, and 5-year representations of family relationships. Ninety-one mother-child pairs, recruited in the postnatal period, were followed tip at 13 years. Adolescents were interviewed about their friendships, and their level of emotional sensitivity and maturity were rated. Emotional sensitivity was heightened in girls whose mothers experienced PND; notably, its occurrence was also linked to insecure attachment in infancy and raised awareness of emotional components of family relationships at 5 years. High emotional sensitivity was also associated with adolescent depressed mood. Raised social maturity was predicted by a secure maternal attachment style and, for girls, by exposure to maternal PND. Precursors of adolescent social maturity were evident in the narrative coherence of 5-year family representations. Higher social maturity in the friendship interview was also associated with overall good adjustment.

AB This study examined the etiology and course of anxiety symptoms from infancy through adolescence in a longitudinal high-risk community sample. One hundred fifty-five subjects were assessed using a variety of observational, projective, and objective measures. Results of path analyses revealed the following: (a) anxiety symptoms showed moderate stability during childhood and adolescence: (b) heightened neonatal biobehavioral reactivity and poor regulation predicted emotion regulation difficulties in preschool, which predicted anxiety symptoms in childhood: (c) developmental incompetence in childhood predicted anxiety symptoms in preadolescence, and anxiety symptoms in preadolescence predicted incompetence in adolescence; (d) insecure attachment relationships in infancy predicted negative peer relationship representations in preadolescence, and these representations predicted anxiety symptoms in adolescence; (e) compared to males, females showed similar rates of anxiety symptoms in childhood but greater and more stable rates in adolescence; however, males and females showed similar patterns of association between risk factors and anxiety symptoms across childhood and adolescence: and (f) the model tested was specific in predicting anxiety symptoms and not psychopathology in general. The results support a developmental model of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety symptoms in childhood and highlight factors to consider in efforts to prevent and treat childhood anxiety.

AB Objective: To assess the prevalence of mental health problems in children in foster care, their families' use of services and the associated costs. Methods: Information on mental health problems, service use and costs was collected, by postal questionnaires and home interviews, on 182 children, their foster carers and teachers from 17 local authorities in Central Scotland. Results: Over 90% of the children had previously been abused or neglected and 60 % had evidence of mental health problems including conduct problems, emotional problems, hyperactivity and problems with peer relations. When compared with 251 children from local schools, the children in foster care had significantly higher symptom scores for Reactive Attachment Disorder. Those children with highest scores for mental health problems were attracting a high level of service support from a wide range of agencies, except Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Costs were associated with learning disability, mental health problems, and a history of residential care. Conclusions: Children in "mainstream" foster care are at greater risk of mental health problems, and are attracting greatest costs, but CAMHS are not successfully targeting these problems. CAMHS may need to develop new models of service delivery.

AB Psychologists consider emotion regulation a critical developmental acquisition. Yet, there has been very little research on the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation across childhood and adolescence. We selected two ERP components associated with inhibitory control-the frontal N2 and frontal P3. We recorded these components before, during, and after a negative emotion induction, and compared their amplitude, latency, and source localization over age. Fifty-eight children 5-16 years of age engaged in a simple go/no-go procedure in which points for successful performance earned a valued prize. The temporary loss of all points triggered negative emotions, as confirmed by self-report scales. Both the frontal N2 and frontal P3 decreased in amplitude and latency with age, consistent with the hypothesis of increasing cortical efficiency. Amplitudes were also greater following the emotion induction, only for adolescents for the N2 but across the age span for the frontal P3, suggesting different but overlapping profiles of emotion-related control mechanisms. No-go N2 amplitudes were greater than go N2 amplitudes following the emotion induction at all ages, suggesting a consistent effect of negative emotion on mechanisms of response inhibition. No-go P3 amplitudes were also greater than go P3 amplitudes and they decreased with age, whereas go P3 amplitudes remained low. Finally, source modeling indicated a developmental decline in central-posterior midline activity paralleled by increasing activity in frontal midline regions suggestive of the anterior cingulate cortex. Negative emotion induction corresponded with an additional right ventral prefrontal or temporal generator beginning in middle childhood.

AB Background: Despite the increasing numbers of pediatric heart and lung transplants being performed worldwide, longitudinal psychological evaluation of children and adolescents undergoing transplantation remains uncommon. The objective of this study was to assess psychological functioning in a group of patients at 12 months and 3 years after transplantation.
   Methods:. Thirty-four children and adolescents (mean age at 12-month assessment: 7.9 years [range 1.3 to 15.3 years]) were evaluated after heart (n = 24) or heart-lung (n = 10) transplantation for congenital heart disease (CHD; n = 10), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), cardiomyopathy (CM; n = 21) or primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 2). Standardized measures were used to assess development, cognitive function, mood state and behavior at each test occasion.
   Results: Measures of developmental, cognitive and academic function were within the normal range with each test and showed stability over time. About 33% of patients had behavior problems at each test occasion, which is higher than the 10% reported for the normal population, but the prevalence of depression fell from 23% at 12 months to 13% at 3 years. Although there were no significant differences between heart and heart-lung recipients, children with a pre-transplant diagnosis of CHD had poorer scores on cognitive and behavioral parameters than those with CM. In particular, while the prevalence of behavior problems showed a slight decrease over time in the CM group, it increased from 33% at 12 months to 75% at 3 years in the CHD group.
   Conclusions: A number of pediatric patients continue to have psychological difficulties 3 years after transplant. Initial diagnosis is an important factor in post-transplant psychological functioning, with a diagnosis of CHD appearing to be a risk factor for greater psychological morbidity, at least in the short and medium term. Further follow-up must address whether such differences persist in the longer term. Patients at risk for poorer psychological outcome need to be identified so that interventions can be implemented to reduce psychological morbidity.

AB Dissemination of evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches for child and adolescent with behavioral and/or emotional problems is now a priority in the field worldwide. However, developing staff competence in evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches in different countries is complicated by some environmental and economic constraints. In this paper a distance training/supervision model is discussed. We describe seven specific challenges encountered and solutions used for overcoming the obstacles in order to implement evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches in different sites in Brazil, Egypt, Israel, and Lebanon.

AB Implementation of evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches for youth with behavioral and/or emotional problems is rising to recognition worldwide. Feasibility research is critical to examine what characteristics of systems allow for success or barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practices into real-world settings, especially when working cross-culturally. This paper briefly reviews the experience of 4 international sites to understand how the overall structure and specific site variables directed the implementation of the World Health Organization and the World Psychiatry Association project. Discussion includes a thematic summary of the successes and challenges experienced by the sites, and future directions of feasibility studies.

AB Aims To study predictors at age 3 and at age 12 for parent and self-reported perceived global psychological difficulties at age 15. Method A representative birth cohort was prospectively followed from early childhood to age 15. Ratings of children's behavioral and emotional problems were collected at age 3 (Child Behavior Check List 2/3) and at age 12 (Child Behavior Check List 4-16, Youth Self Report). Mothers and fathers separately completed a questionnaire on their own well-being, health and mental distress when the child was 12. At the same time-point, family functioning was measured with the Family Assessment device. Outcome variables included both parent and self-reports of children's perceived psychological difficulties at age 15. Results At age 15, of the 707 children with both parent and self-reports on perceived difficulties available, 10% had more perceived difficulties than peers of the same age in parent or self-reports. There was a significant increase in perceived difficulties from age 12 to age 15 in self-reports but not in parent reports. The parent-child agreement on difficulties at both time-points was very low (proportion of agreement 0.12-0.17). At age 3, externalizing problems, especially aggressiviness, predicted parent reports of child's difficulties at 15 years of age in univariate analysis. At age 12, parent-reported child's externalizing symptoms and perceived difficulties, poor social competence in self-reports, and mothers' reports of her own poor well-being, independently predicted parents' reporting of their child's perceived difficulties at age 15. Self-reports of internalizing problems and mother's own reports of her depressiviness when the child was 12 independently predicted the 15-year old's self-reported difficulties. Furthermore, in univariate analysis, poor family functioning at age 12 predicted perceived difficulties in parent and self-reports. Conclusions Both parent and self-reports of a child's difficulties are the outcome of an accumulation of the child's psychopathology, parental distress, and family dysfunction. The results emphasize the importance of early detection of children at risk of negative developmental pathways. In clinical practice and in prevention interventions, it is important to take into account the child's individual psychopathology, parental distress, and family dysfunction.

AB Some studies of the event-related potentials demonstrated a reduction of the voluntary component P3 (P300 or P3b) in youngsters with the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or in conduct disorders (CD), and a reduction of the automatic processing component, mismatch negativity, in patients with both ADHD and CD (ADHD + CD). Recently, a passive auditory P3 potential has been elicited by a single stimulus. We therefore tried this potential study in 20 healthy subjects and 20 teenagers with ADHD + CD to search for further evidence of the altered automatic cerebral processing in the latter. Subjects also answered a self-report Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP). The patient group scored significantly higher on most DAPP traits that reflect problems of emotion control, showed significantly prolonged P2, N2, and P3, and reduced P3. In all subjects Stimulus Seeking was positively correlated with P3 latencies at Fz, Cz, and Pz, and with P3 amplitude at Cz. This study suggests that youngsters with ADHD + CD had pronounced emotion dysregulation, and prominent deficit in passive attention, as reflected by the automatic processing of auditory stimuli.

AB To examine indices of behavioural and emotional problems and temperamental traits in clinically referred children and adolescents suffering from tension headache or migraine. Headache in childhood and adolescence (< 18 years) has been associated with the presence of behavioural and emotional difficulties, but limited data are available on the relationship between these problems and different types of headache. Clinically referred children and adolescents (N = 114), 6-16 years of age, suffering from primary headache according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society, 47 with tension-type headache (TH) and 67 with migraine (M), and 36 normal controls without headache (NC) were assessed using the Parent Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS), and Emotionality-Activity-Sociability-Shyness Scale (EAS). Psychological and personality self-rating assessments were obtained also on the children's parents and siblings. Although most headache patients had scores within the normative non-pathological range, both TH and M patients had higher CBCL total, internalizing, and externalizing scores than NC (P < 0.001), and TH patients had higher scores than M patients. TH and M had higher CDI and MASC scores than NC (P < 0.05), with no difference between the headache groups. TH patients had higher Emotionality and Shyness scores, and lower Sociability scores than M patients. Clinically referred children and adolescents with TH and M had higher scores of behavioural and emotional symptoms, both of internalizing and externalizing type, than normal peers. The TH group had greater psychological and temperamental difficulties than the M group.

AB This study tests a model of children's emotion regulation (ER) as a moderator of the link between maternal depression and child internalizing problems. Participants were 78 children (ages 4 to 7), including 45 children of mothers with a history of childhood-onset depression (COD) and 33 children of mothers who had never been depressed. ER was assessed observationally during a laboratory mood induction. ER behaviors were empirically reduced into 3 categories: (a) negative focus on delay, (b) positive reward anticipation, and (c) behavioral distraction. Linear mixed models indicated that positive reward anticipation moderated the effects of maternal COD on children's internalizing problems, particularly if mothers had current depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that generating positive affect in the face of a potential frustration may be a protective ER strategy for children at risk for depression.

AB This study explored the correlates of self-reported coping strategies from both an appraisal (e.g., severity, impact, desirability of the event, as well as perceived stress) and a dispositional (e.g., preferred/typical coping style, self-concept clarity, self-esteem, emotion regulation, problem-solving style, anxiety) perspective. Participants were 211 African American undergraduate and graduate students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The results indicated that dispositional traits (especially problem-solving style) are associated uniquely with preferred/typical coping styles. The results also provided modest evidence that dispositional traits and subjects' appraisals (e.g., challenge, harm/threat, impact) are predictive of subjects' coping strategies in specific ongoing stressful situations. The general findings from this study appear to mirror research on Caucasian subjects.

AB Sports camps for children with cardiac anomalies have existed for many years. However, no formal evaluation of the benefits of attending such camps has been undertaken heretofore. We assessed potential changes in the self-perceived health of children with congenital heart disease who attended a special sports camp. Thirty-one children with cardiac anomalies attended a 3-day multisports camp. Sixteen children, all of whom were 10 years or older, literate, and Dutch- or French-speaking, completed the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-CF87) before and after attending the camp. The scores of the children were compared with those of healthy peers by calculating mean standardized differences. After attendance at the sports camp, the children achieved significant improvements in the self-perception of their physical functioning, role functioning due to emotional problems, role functioning due to behavioral problems, mental health, and general behavior. The children's self-esteem and general behavior after the camp were significantly better than that of their healthy counterparts. We conclude that children with congenital heart disease who participate in activities at special sports camps may reap benefits in terms of their subjective health status. Although further research is needed, we recommend the participation in sport activities by children with heart defects, and more specifically their participation in sports camps.

AB To identify factors linked with emotional and behavioural problems in school age (6- to 17-year-old) children of women with breast cancer. Reports of children's emotional and behavioural problems were obtained from patient mothers, their healthy partners, the children's teacher and adolescents using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Mental Health subscale of the Child Health Questionnaire. Parents reported on their own level of depression and, for patients only, their quality of life. Family functioning was assessed using the Family Assessment Device and Cohesion subscale of the Family Environment Scale. Using a cross-sectional within groups design, assessments were obtained (N = 107 families) where the patients were 3-36 months postdiagnosis. Risk of problems in children were linked with low levels of family cohesion, low affective responsiveness and parental over-involvement as reported by both child and mother. Adolescents reported family communication issues, which were associated with externalising behaviour problems. Maternal depression was related to child internalising problems, particularly in girls. Whether the mother was currently on or off chemotherapy was not associated with child problems nor was time since cancer diagnosis. These findings held across child age. Where mothers have early stage breast cancer, a substantial minority of their school-aged children have emotional and behavioural problems. Such cases are characterised by the existence of maternal depression and poor family communication, rather than by the mother's treatment status or time since diagnosis. Targeted treatments, which focus on maternal depression and family communication may benefit the children and, through improved relationships, enhance the patients' quality of life.

AB This article reports on the factor structure and the pyschometric properties of a revised questionnaire (SSKJ 3-8) for the measurement of coping in children and adolescents. Coping was assessed with the subscales seeking social support, problem solving, avoidant coping, palliative emotion regulation, and anger related emotion regulation. The results were based on studies with a total of 1,991 pupils attending class levels 3 to 8. The reliabilities (Cronbach's Alpha, retest) of all five subscales were sufficiently good. The postulsted 5-factor structure could be found in exploratory factor analyses and confirmatory factor analyses, respectively. Convergent and discriminant associations with coping, personality variables, and quality life variables indicated the validity of the SSKJ 3-8.

AB This article reports data on the the German adaptation of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) from a sample of 718 preschool children using ratings from 715 mothers and 566 fathers. The item analysis showed a broad range of intensity and problem scores together with satisfactory item-test correlations and homogeneity of the 36 ECBI-items. A psychometric analysis of the ECBI scales revealed satisfactory reliability scores similar to the US version. However, we found higher intensity and problem scores, a result which at least partially reflects cultural differences. In line with international findings, boys had higher intensity and problem scores than girls, and mothers reported a higher rate of the child's behavioral problems and parenting problems than fathers. Validation data using the Social Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) showed substantial correlations within the same informant and relatively low cross-informant correlation (parents, preschool-teacher). In sum, the German adaptation of the ECBI seems to be a reliable, sensitive, and economical diagnostical instrument for the assessment of behavioral problems at least in preschool children.

AB This study investigates some psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure for screening behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. In two independent Flemish community samples of young children, parents (Sample 1: N = 532; Sample 2: N = 1086) and teachers (Sample 1: N = 512; Sample 2: N = 1049) of children aged 4-8 completed all items of the SDQ. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for both a three- and a five-factor solution. Internal consistency and interrater reliability of the different SDQ scales were found to be satisfactory, except for the Conduct problems and the Peer problems scales. A good construct validity with the subscales of the well-established Child Behavior Checklist was found. A 2 (gender) x 2 (age groups:. 4-5 and 6-7 years) ANOVA indicated that more hyperactivity/inattention problems and more internalizing behavior was reported for the oldest age group. More behavior problems were reported for boys than for girls, whereas girls were attributed more prosocial behavior.

AB The present study investigated children's anticipated emotional response and anticipated coping in response to peer rejection, as well as the qualifying effects of gender, depressive symptoms, and perceived social competence. Participants (N = 234), ranging in age between 10 and 13 years, were presented with two written vignettes depicting peer rejection. The most highly endorsed coping strategies were behavioural distraction, problem-focused behaviour, and positive reappraisal. Results indicate that children higher in depressive symptoms reported a more negative anticipated mood impact. Moreover, children higher in depressive symptoms were less inclined to endorse behavioural and cognitive coping strategies typically associated with mood improvement (e.g., behavioural distraction, positive reappraisal). Independent of depression, children scoring higher on perceived social competence reported more active, problem-oriented coping behaviour in response to the stressors. Types of coping were largely unaffected by gender, however girls reported higher levels of anticipated sadness than boys in response to the rejection vignettes. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study examined how four different types of self-construal affected perception of socio-emotional adjustment (i.e., anxiety, depression, distress, self-esteem, family cohesion, peer support, pro-substance abuse attitude) and perception of relationship with community (i.e., sense of community, adverse neighborhood) in a sample of 152 Vietnamese-American high-school adolescents. Using cluster analysis, the four-type self-construal model postulated by Kim, Hunter, Miyahara, Horvath, Bresnahan, & Yoon (1996) was replicated in this sample. The bicultural students (i.e., those with strong interdependent and independent self-construal) reported greater perceived adjustment across all measures except anxiety when compared to other groups (marginal, interdependent, and independent) in the study. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Parental ratings of 695 adopted Chinese girls' internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors were analyzed in 4 stages to: (1) Compare adjustment profiles of Chinese adoptee samples with relevant US normative data; (2) analyze age differences in behavioral adjustment differences of Chinese adoptees; (3) examine interrelationships among the 3 behavior problem scores and child's age at adoption, current age, pre-adoption neglect, and post-adoption initial rejection behaviors; and (4) explore the degree to which the 4 child-level independent variables worked individually or collectively to predict behavioral adjustment outcomes. Chinese adoptees had better adjustment scores than normative samples from the U.S. Preschool-age adoptees had better adjustment scores than school-age adoptees. No relationships were observed between the age-related variables and behavioral adjustment measures. However, pre-adoption neglect and post-adoption initial rejection behaviors were predictors of behavioral adjustment scores. The implications of these findings for future research, clinical practice and parenting education were discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   The overall physical impact of asthma was perceived equivalently to diabetes and arthritis, but less than epilepsy, Down's syndrome, leukemia, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, asthma was rated to more commonly cause physical disability ( p < 0.001) and restrict activities ( p < 0.0005). The social impact of asthma was perceived equivalently to diabetes, but more favorably than the other chronic diseases surveyed. Specifically, teens with asthma were perceived as having fewer behavior problems, being more honest, popular, and fun to be around, but less adept at sports. Only 6 of 149 (4%) teens surveyed expressed any degree of reluctance to befriend peers with asthma.

AB Background: This study examines emotion regulation strategies used by children of mothers with childhood-onset depression (COD) and children of never-depressed mothers (NCOD). Methods: Participants were 49 COD offspring (ages 4-7) and 37 NCOD offspring (ages 4-7) and their mothers. Emotion regulation strategies were assessed observationally during a laboratory mood induction paradigm. Results: COD offspring were more likely to focus on the delay object or task than NCOD offspring. Daughters of COD mothers were also more likely to wait passively and less likely to engage in active distraction than daughters of NCOD mothers. These findings were replicated using number of maternal depressive episodes. Conclusions: COD offspring, especially daughters, exhibit a more passive style of regulating emotion that may place them at risk for developing psychopathology.

AB Background: Despite findings that parent depression increases children's risk for internalizing and externalizing problems, little is known about other factors that combine with parent depression to contribute to behavior problems. Methods: As part of a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study on childhood-onset depression (COD), we examined the association of mother history of COD, child frontal electroencephalogram asymmetry, and affective behavior with children's concurrent behavior problems. Results: Children in the COD group had higher anxious/depressed and aggressive problems than did children in the control group, but this was qualified by a COD-by-asymmetry interaction effect. For COD but not control children, left frontal asymmetry was associated with both anxious/depressed and aggressive child problems. Children with left frontal asymmetry and low affect regulation behavior had higher anxious/depressed problems than did those with high affect regulation behavior. Boys with left frontal asymmetry had higher aggressive problems than did those with right frontal asymmetry. Conclusions: In children of mothers with COD, physiological and behavioral indices of affect regulation may constitute risks for behavior problems.

AB Researchers have suggested that good-quality school climates foster a sense of connection to the school and in this way contribute to fewer emotional and behavioral problems. However, few studies have directly assessed the role of school connectedness as a mediator of school climate effects. Using path analysis, this brief report examined whether four aspects of student perceived school climate (cohesion, friction, competition among students, and overall satisfaction with classes) were indirectly associated with subsequent early adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms through school connectedness. Participants were four hundred and eighty-nine 10- to 14-year old middle school students involved in two waves of a study. The results showed that school connectedness mediated the relations between perceived cohesion, perceived friction, and overall satisfaction with classes and subsequent student conduct problems 1 year later. School connectedness was not, however, predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms and thus did not mediate the school climate effects on early adolescent emotional problems.

AB Objective: There are big discrepancies among the reported prevalence rates of emotional/behavioral problems for deaf children. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence rate of emotional and behavioral problems and to assess the effect of subject characteristics on these problems in a group of deaf Turkish children and adolescents.
   Method: Seventy-two students from a regional residential school for the deaf children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18 years, were recruited as the study group. The control group consisted of 45 age-matched healthy children and adolescents. A questionnaire on sociodemographic features and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were administered to the parents of the children and adolescents.
   Results: The deaf students group showed significantly more internalizing problems than controls. The largest difference was found for the Anxious/Depressed and Somatic Complaints scale. Deaf adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years had significantly higher anxious/depressed and somatic complaints subscores of CBCL than deaf children aged between 6 and 11 years. Furthermore girls had significantly higher subscores of Anxious/Depressed and Somatic Complaints than the boys in the deaf group. The correlation analysis revealed that degree of hearing loss, academic achievement, and teacher-rated communication level were not related to any emotional or behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Deaf children and adolescents have more internalizing problems than normal hearing controls. The results underline the need of screening the deaf children and adolescents more often concerning their mental health.

AB Objective: To describe structure and methods of a longitudinal developmental follow-up program for children born to substance dependent mothers, including 270 children and their caregivers up to now. To assess long term developmental outcome of the first 95 unselected children, enrolled between 3/1995 and 9/1999 and followed up to 6 years of age. To discuss biological and psychosocial risk factors in relation to biological, psychological and socioemotional outcome parameters. Methods: The follow up program is part of a multidisciplinary comprehensive care project including pre- and postnatal opioid maintenance therapy, psychosocial care, intensified obstetrical and standardized neonatal treatment by a network of clinics in Vienna. The following data were collected: head circumference, morphological abnormalities, standardized neurodevelopmental assessment up to 6 years, offline evaluation of videotaped spontaneous motor activity and infant-caregiver interaction, investigator's scoring of psychosocial stability, sensomotor developmental scales at 12 months, standardized intelligence measurement at 4-5 years of age, psychopathological assessment up to 3 years (DC:0-3) and preschool period (ICD 10), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) at 30 months and 4-6 years, documentation of foster placement. Basic prenatal and perinatal parameters including drug urine analysis and duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome were contributed by the other clinics. Statistical analysis (Kendall correlation coeffizients) was performed for correlations between risk and outcome parameters. Results: Signs of prenatal CNS impairment were found in a low frequency: constant microcephaly (8,4%), subtle facial dysmorphic features (12,6%) developmental motor delay (5,3%) and constant strabism (7,2%). Mild to moderate signs of developmental dyspraxia were obvious at preschool age in 31,7% (20/63). There is a higher proportion of psychosocial risks factors and socioemotional disturbance however: relationship disturbances(28,6 %) in the first year of life, infant (21,1%) and preschool (33,3%) psychopathological signs, including 8% (5/63) with ADHD syndrome. Unstable caregiver systems resulted in foster placement in about one third of the children after birth rising to half of the cases by the end of observation period. Cognitive performance at 4-5 years was slightly but significantly reduced according to age standards. Additional polytoxicoman and especially benzodiazepine consumption in pregnancy - expressing psychoemotional and leading to psychosocial instability - was predicitive for deficits in neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcome as well as for eventual foster placement of the children. Conclusions: Comprehensive pre- and perinatal care for drug dependent mothers and their infants substancially reduces biological risk. High frequency longitudinal follow-up in the first years with a focus on infant-caregiver relationship has proved helpful for early bonding and should be intensified in case of psychosocial instability. A complex network of biological and psychosocial risk factors interacting over time seem to determine developmental outcome of the children at preschool age. Follow-up into adolescence is planned.

AB The ability to characterise psychopathologies on the basis of their underlying neurobiology is critical in improving our understanding of disorder etiology and making more effective diagnostic and treatment decisions. Given the well-documented relationship between temperament (i.e. core personality traits) and psychopathology, research investigating the neurobiological substrates that underlie temperament is potentially key to our understanding of the biological basis of mental disorder. We present evidence that specific areas of the prefrontal cortex (including the dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices) and limbic structures (including the amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens) are key regions associated with three fundamental dimensions of temperament: Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Constraint. Proposed relationships are based on two types of research: (a) research into the neurobiological correlates of affective and cognitive processes underlying these dimensions; and (b) research into the neurobiology of various psychopathologies, which have been correlated with these dimensions. A model is proposed detailing how these structures might comprise neural networks whose functioning underlies the three temperaments. Recommendations are made for future research into the neurobiology of temperament, including the need to focus on neural networks rather than individual structures, and the importance of prospective, longitudinal, multi-modal imaging studies in at-risk youth.

AB Anxiety and stress experienced by the mother during pregnancy are reported to have a negative association with the cognitive development of the child. An integration of recent evidence from cognitive reaction time tasks pointed to a deficit in endogenous response inhibition, a function ascribed to prefrontal cortex. To further delineate the cognitive sequelae associated with antenatal maternal anxiety, we reviewed recent neuro-imaging literature to create a cortical map of regions commonly and selectively activated by well-known cognitive tasks. The pragmatic value of this cortical map was tested in a follow-up sample of 49 17-year old adolescents. Adolescents of mothers with high levels of anxiety during week 12-22 of their pregnancy performed significantly lower in tasks which required integration and control of different task parameters. Working memory, inhibition of a prepotent response, and visual orienting of attention were not impaired. Based on the established cortical map, these results were related to subtle developmental aberrations in a part of, or in cortical and sub-cortical regions linked to, the orbitofrontal cortex.

AB Objective: Children's psychosocial problems are often not identified accurately. The present study addresses the effect of training of Child Health Doctors (CHDs) in a structured method to identify psychosocial problems on the accuracy of this identification in children aged 5-6.
   Method: The study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a baseline and two follow-up measurements. A volunteer sample of 58 CHDs participated, randomly assigned to intervention or control condition. CHDs selected a population-based sample of 5-6-year-old children (n = 6375).
   Results: The first follow-up showed that sensitivity had improved by 9% and specificity by 5% in the intervention condition, especially in children with severe problems (odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-11.8). The second follow-up showed a decrease in sensitivity and specificity in both conditions.
   Conclusion: The training improves identification of psychosocial problems, especially severe ones. although the availability of time and resources also influences the accuracy with which psychosocial problems are identified. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antenatal maternal anxiety has been shown to be related to infant temperament, childhood disorders, and impulsivity in adolescence. This study prospectively investigated whether antenatal maternal anxiety is associated with performance on a continuous performance task. Sixty-four adolescents (mean age, 15 y; 34 boys, 30 girls) were examined with a computerized continuous performance task (CPT) measuring sustained attention. Results showed that the CPT performance of boys of mothers with high levels of state anxiety during the 12th to 22nd postmenstrual week of pregnancy declined as the task progressed: their processing speed became slower and the variability in their reaction times increased. The study controlled for the possible confounding influences of postnatal maternal anxiety, the parents' educational level, and intelligence. Establishing a link between antenatal maternal anxiety and an objective measure of sustained attention/self-regulation, our results extend the growing evidence for an association between antenatal maternal anxiety and the neurobehavioral development of the offspring up into adolescence.

AB OBJECTIVE. Few investigations have assessed the primary care detection of adolescent posttraumatic emotional distress after an injury. We aimed to determine (1) the level of attachment to primary care providers (PCPs) and school providers among this group of high-risk adolescents, (2) the emotional status of this population postinjury, (3) continuity of care between trauma center and community care, and (4) PCPs' detection of emotional problems in adolescents after an injury.
   METHODS. This was a prospective cohort study of traumatically injured adolescents aged 12 to 18 who were admitted to a level I regional trauma center. Adolescents were screened for posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, and alcohol use on the surgical ward and 4 to 6 months postinjury. PCPs were contacted by telephone 4 to 6 months postinjury to assess follow-up care and the detection of emotional distress.
   RESULTS. In the surgical ward, 39.4% of the adolescent patients or their parents reported no identifiable source of regular medical care. Only 24.3% of the patients had visited a PCP during the 4 to 6 months after injury. At 4 to 6 months postinjury, 30% of the adolescents were experiencing high posttraumatic stress symptom levels, 11% were experiencing high depressive symptom levels, and 17% had high levels of alcohol use. PCPs did not detect any new emotional distress or problem drinking during postinjury office visits.
   CONCLUSIONS. Injured adolescents represent a high-risk pediatric population, a substantial number of whom develop mental health problems postinjury. Furthermore, almost 40% of adolescents in our study reported no source of primary care. These results suggest that referrals from trauma centers to PCPs are necessary and that an increase in awareness of and screening for adolescent emotional distress postinjury during follow-up appointments and at school should be routine components of postinjury care.

AB Current literature suggests an executive and/or motivational deficit to explain the deficit in behavioural inhibition of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, results of neuropsychological and psycho-physiological studies are inconsistent (Nigg 2001). Although in his earlier work in 1997 Barkley postulated an association between behavioural inhibition and emotion regulation, this subject has been widely neglected so far. First studies suggest an impaired emotion regulation of children with ADHD (e. g. Braaten a. Rosen 2000). The present study was aimed to scrutinize the results of experimental studies on an executive and/or motivational deficit in response inhibition and impairments in emotion regulation with a newly developed go-/nogo-task. A three factorial design (group x age x condition) with repeated measurements on the last factor was used to examine differences between 19 boys with ADHD and 19 male normal controls of two age groups (8-10 years old and 11-12 years old). A go-/nogo-task modified from the Testbattery for Attentional Performance (Zimmermann a. Fimm 1994) with five conditions was administered: neutral, feedback, reward only, response cost only, reward, and response cost. Apart from performance (commissions, omissions, reaction time, and its variability) emotional well-being and coping were recorded. Boys with ADHD showed a deficit in behavioural inhibition as well as reduced attention independent of condition. Young children with ADHD showed a higher reaction time variability than older ADHD-children. Additionally, all boys with ADHD reported increased challenge and more rumination but also enhanced situation control. Finally, response inhibition of all children was improved by feedback. First hints were given that especially the emotion regulation of the younger ADHD children seemed to be impaired. Thus, the study contributes to the fundamental discussion on an executive or motivational deficit in behavioural inhibition. But the results also draw attention to the importance of emotion regulation for the development of effective treatments of ADHD.

AB Coping and quality of life among children and adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
   First studies suggest an impaired emotion regulation especially with negative emotions among children and adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which particularly emerged in the subgroup with comorbid conduct disorder. Moreover, first results have shown that quality of life of children and adolescents with ADHD are negatively affected compared to healthy controls. The present study examined differences in age and subgroup on coping and quality of life among boys with ADHD. Furthermore, coping and quality of life were compared to healthy norms. In total, N = 48 boys with ADHD with and without conduct disorder (ages 8 to 12 years) were asked to complete self-report questionnaires on coping and quality of life. Fifth and sixth graders with ADHD reported less distraction than third and fourth graders. The subgroup with ADHD and conduct disorder showed more passive avoidance and resignation compared to the subgroup with ADHD alone. Compared to normative data, especially third and fourth graders with ADHD showed an increased maladaptive coping. Additionally, the subgroup with conduct disorder scored higher on all maladaptive coping strategies than the normative sample. Finally, all domains of quality of life were impaired among children and adolescents with ADHD compared to normative data. These findings support the consideration of emotion regulation and quality of life in the research of ADHD in childhood and adolescence to develop effective programs for prevention and intervention.

AB Theory and research on sex differences in adjustment focus largely on parental, societal, and biological influences. However, it also is important to consider how peers contribute to girls' and boys' development. This article provides a critical review of sex differences in several peer relationship processes, including behavioral and social-cognitive styles, stress and coping, and relationship provisions. The authors present a speculative peer-socialization model based on this review in which the implications of these sex differences for girls' and boys' emotional and behavioral development are considered. Central to this model is the idea that sex-linked relationship processes have costs and benefits for girls' and boys' adjustment. Finally, the authors present recent research testing certain model components and propose approaches for testing understudied aspects of the model.

AB Preventive interventions focus on reducing risk and promoting protective factors in the child as well as their cultural ecologies (family, classroom, school, peer groups, neighborhood, etc). By improving competencies in both the child and their contexts many of these interventions promote resilience. Although there are now a substantial number of preventive interventions that reduce problem behaviors and build competencies across childhood and adolescence, there has been little integration with recent findings in neuropsychology and neuroscience. This article focuses on the integration of prevention research and neuroscience in the context of interventions that promote resilience by improving the executive functions (EF); inhibitory control, planning, and problem solving skills, emotional regulation, and attentional capacities of children and youth. Illustrations are drawn from recent randomized controlled trials of the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum. The discussion focuses on the next steps in transdisciplinary research in prevention and social neuroscience.

AB Children with aggressive behavior problems may have difficulties regulating negative emotions, resulting in harmful patterns of interpersonal behavior at home and in the schoolyard. Ventral and dorsal regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been associated with response inhibition and self-control-key components of emotion regulation. Our research program aims to explore differences among aggressive and normal children in the activation of these cortical regions during emotional episodes, to the extent possible using electrophysiological techniques, to identify diagnostic subtypes, gain insights into their interpersonal difficulties, and help develop effective treatment strategies. This report reviews several recent studies investigating individual and developmental differences in cortical mechanisms of emotion regulation, corresponding with different patterns of interpersonal behavior. Our methods include event-related potentials (ERPs) and cortical source modeling, using dense-array electroencephalography (EEG) technology, as well as video-taped observations of parent-child interactions, with both normal and aggressive children. By relating patterns of brain activation to observed behavioral differences, we find (i) a steady decrease in cortical activation subserving self-regulation across childhood and adolescence, (ii) different cortical activation patterns as well as behavioral constellations distinguishing subtypes of aggressive children, and (iii) robust correlations between the activation of cortical mediators of emotion regulation and flexibility in parent-child emotional communication in children referred for aggressive behavior problems. These findings point toward models of developmental psychopathology based on the interplay among biological, psychological, and social factors.

AB Building on the respective strengths of parent-led and professional-led groups, a parent-professional team leadership model for group interventions was developed and evaluated for families of youths with emotional and behavioral problems. The model was developed based on feedback from 26 parents in focus group sessions and recommendations from mental health professionals in staff meetings. Evaluations of an implementation of the model in a support, empowerment, and education group intervention (S.E.E. group) have demonstrated the usefulness of this approach in work with families of children with behavioral and emotional problems. This article discusses the challenges of instituting the model in an S.E.E. group. It explores how parents and professionals build the team leadership model and the strengths of this approach in working with parents of youths with serious emotional disturbances.

AB Diagnosis: This case history describes the inpatient behavior therapy of a 17-year-old male patient of average intelligence with a pronounced photosensitivity in the sense of a somatoform disorder and underlying childhood autism. Therapy: Following detailed psychoeducation and careful reattribution of the patient's somatic illness concept, step-by-step exposure exercises for reducing photosensitivity were carried out. Independence and social competence training in order to support the development of autonomy and to improve social competencies were initiated. In addition, during the inpatient stay, the patient regularly took part in group therapy sessions in order to foster social skills. Moreover, in order to promote the perception and recognition of emotions, verbal and nonverbal expressions of feelings and the ability to address emotions, an emotional regulation training took place. Results: The goals formulated at the beginning of the therapy were extensively reached: The pronounced photosensitivity, which had caused the patient to wear sunglasses day and night for 22 weeks and constantly keep his eyes closed, was no longer discernible after only the third week of treatment. The patient increasingly learned to express his desires and needs. He increasingly managed to endure and adequately cope with situations he found difficult or stressful. In social situations, he was able to assert himself with ever-greater frequency and to voice his own opinion. His tendencies to withdraw reduced steadily and he sought out contact in the group to an increased extent. Both on the ward and during the weekends at home he showed himself to be increasingly more autonomous and active. The patient learned to put forward his own opinion more strongly to his parents and to assert his desires and interests. Conclusion: Altogether, this case history shows a successful behavior therapy treatment of a somatoform disorder with underlying childhood autism.

AB Objectives: Many studies demonstrate the precariousness of hearing-impaired children's socio-emotional development and bring home the necessity of early and reliable diagnosis. The German version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-D) is a fairly new screening procedure examined here with a view to its usefulness ill diagnosing hearing-impaired children.
   Methods: The SDQ-D parent version was completed by 213 mothers and 2 13 fathers of hearing-impaired children within their families as part of a larger study on familial socialisation. The procedure's factorial structure and measurement, accuracy were tested, and the prevalence rate of emotional and behavioural disorders was determined in comparison to the German standardization sample (Woerner et al., 2002a) in the context of other variables (age. sex, communicative competence, educational status).
   Results: With the exception of the "Behaviour Disorders" scale, the SDQ-D factorial structure can be reproduced in a satisfactory manner The same can be said for its measurement accurracy. The prevalence of behaviour disorders under the condition "Hearing Impairment" is clearly hi-her oil almost ail scales, as well as for the total problem score. Special attention should be paid to the scores in the fields "Emotional Problems" and "Peer Problems" because of their significant correlation to the children's age.
   Conclusions: The SDQ-D provides a valid yet economical screening procedure which call also be applied ill the diagnosis of hearing-impaired children: children whose psychological development is especially endangered at ail early age call be identified and referred for a more exact diagnosis and continuing counselling and therapy.

AB Background: There is a lack of sound evaluations of developmental prevention programs in Germany. Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a child social skills training program, a parenting training, and a combination of both. Method: From a sample of 675 kindergarten children and their families, 227 participated in one of the three training schemes and 227 were assigned to equivalent control groups. Outcomes were measured 2-3 months and up to 24 months after the programs by using preschool teachers' reports on the Preschool Social Behavior Questionnaire and a content analysis of the school report cards in first grade. Results: The programs showed positive short-term effects on conduct problems, hyperactivity, and emotional problems. Effects were most pronounced for the combined programs and for children with more problems. Long-term effects were less consistent across programs but revealed an overall reduction of problematic children at school. Conclusions: Results are concordant with international meta-analyses and justify a cautious optimism toward such programs.

AB A substantial proportion of children and adolescents come to suffer from psychological disorders. This article focuses on the temperament factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of child psychopathology. It is argued that besides the reactive temperament factor of emotionality/neuroticism, the regulative process of effortful control also plays an important role in the etiology and maintenance of internalizing and externalizing problems in youths. More specifically, vulnerability to child psychopathology is determined by a temperament that is characterized by high levels of emotionality/neuroticism and low levels of effortful control. Models are hypothesized in which reactive and regulative temperament factors either have interactive or additive effects on the development of psychological disorders in children, and conceptualized in terms of a developmental psychopathology perspective. Directions for future research and clinical implications of this temperamental view on psychopathology are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the childhood predictors of externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescence in an epidemiological sample. Behavior ratings were obtained from 609 children at two time-points, accounting for 71% of the target sample. At age 8, children were evaluated with parental and teacher Rutter scales, and with the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), and at age 16 with the Child Behavior Checklist. Evaluations by all informants had a unique contribution to later outcome. In multivariate analysis, among boys, parental reports of hyperactivity independently predicted externalizing problems and teacher reports of hyperactivity independently predicted internalizing problems. Teacher reports of conduct problems independently predicted externalizing problems among both boys and girls. Furthermore, parent reports of emotional problems independently predicted internalizing problems among both boys and girls. Children's own reports of internalized distress measured with CDI predicted a high level of internalizing problems among girls. Perceived need of treatment was the strongest predictor for outcome among girls. Change in family structure (e. g., divorce or remarriage) during follow-up independently predicted externalizing and internalizing problems among boys. The study supports the findings from earlier studies showing that the stability of behavior problems from childhood to adolescence is substantial. This implies a need for early recognition and initiation of treatment efforts.

Mean age at T1 was 14.4 years and mean age at T2 was 18.4 years. Parental divorce was prospectively associated with a relative change in anxiety and depression, subjective well-being, self-esteem, and school problems. Considering boys separately, parental divorce was prospectively associated only with school problems. Among the girls, divorce was prospectively associated with all variables. The effect of divorce on relative change was partially mediated by paternal absence. (c) 2005 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because anger in close relationships is not only a source of strain, but can also serve to further emotional competence, a questionnaire was constructed on nine strategies of anger regulation within a same-sex friendship (SAR). A factor analysis of the children's version resulted in four factors. A confirmatory factor analysis corroborated the comparability of the factor structures of the children's and the adolescents' version of the SAR. Results of a 5-year longitudinal study suggest that participants tended to use negotiation more frequently as adolescents than as children. Aggressive and distancing strategies declined in adolescence. Results are discussed under the perspective that learning to manage conflicts of interest and anger without resorting to hostility (or avoidance) is a social task in friendship.

AB Objective: To devise and test a model describing the process of help-seeking for child psychopathology in professional and informal service settings. Method: Using structural equation modeling, associations between several help-seeking stages, and the influence of child, family, and context characteristics on these stages were investigated in 246 Dutch children (4-11 years old) between April 2000 and July 2002. Children were selected for having emotional or behavioral problems from a representative general practice sample; 68% of the selected children participated. Results: School personnel played an important role in the process of help-seeking for child psychopathology, in both detecting service need and the provision of and the referral for help. Although Dutch general practitioners are supposed to be gatekeepers of mental health care, their role in help-seeking for child psychopathology was limited. Various family characteristics were shown to influence service need and informal or professional help-seeking. The influence of child characteristics on the help-seeking process was limited. Conclusions: Educating parents about child psychopathology and the availability and accessibility of care, improving general practitioners' skills in detecting child psychopathology, and direct contact of mental health professionals with general practitioners and schools may enhance access to care for children in need.

AB This time-trend study was conducted during and after the severe economic recession and the period of high unemployment in Finland in the 1990s. The changes in the behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents placed in children's homes were studied in the same area using the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire at three different time points ( 1993, 1996 and 1999), and the Children's Global Assessment Scale in 1996 and 1999. Internalizing symptoms of the children increased significantly. The level of psychosocial problems among boys was already high at the first rating in 1993, and it remained high during the whole study period. Behavioral and emotional problems of the girls placed in children's homes increased significantly, being at the same level as the boys' by the end of the study period.

AB In this study, Social Information Processing (SIP) and behaviour problems of incarcerated juvenile delinquents and non-delinquent peers were compared. Specific associations of SIP patterns with reactive and proactive aggression were assessed, and mediation of the relationship between intelligence and delinquency by SIP was examined. Participants were 42 incarcerated male delinquents, 40 non-delinquent adolescents in lower education, and 54 non-delinquent adolescents in higher education. Measures of behaviour problems, intelligence, and SIP were completed. juvenile delinquents showed more externalizing behaviour problems and proactive aggression than their non-delinquent peers. Delinquent juveniles were more reactively aggressive than higher educated peers but no more than lower educated peers. Concerning SIP, juvenile delinquents attributed less sad emotions, generated fewer adaptive emotion-regulation strategies, and generated more aggressive responses than their higher educated peers. No group differences were found for hostile intent attribution or own emotions. Hostile intent attribution and adaptive emotion regulation related specifically to reactive aggression. The relation between intelligence and delinquency was not mediated by SIP.

AB Background With the increasing number of immigrants worldwide, it is essential to have insight into the factors associated with internalizing problems in immigrant youth. However, little research on this subject has been conducted. The aim of the current study is to contribute to the knowledge in this field. Methods Data were obtained from the general population of 11- to 18-year-old Moroccan immigrant adolescents in the Netherlands. Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), 415 parent, 376 self-, and 238 teacher reports were available for analysis. Results The data showed relations between internalizing problems and several child (externalizing and chronic health problems), proximal family (paternal and maternal support and parent-child conflict), contextual family (conflicts between parents about parenting and total number of life-events), school/peer (being bored), and migration variables (adolescent's perceived discrimination). Moreover, a modest relation was found between internalizing problems and parental psychopathology. Few associations occurred with the global family factor (e.g., family educational level). Several relations between the predictors and YSR internalizing proved to be gender-specific. Conclusions Our results suggested that the child, school/peer, and proximal family factors are the most important in predicting the development of internalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. The impact of the migration factor was small.

AB Background: Literature on patient disclosure has highlighted policy proposals, practitioner attitude and practices, and issues specific to already identified vulnerable populations (eg, human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients and adolescents). We investigated the topics and concerns that led less-studied primary care patients to deliberate disclosure to their physician and the range of actions taken following such deliberation.
   Methods: This descriptive qualitative study used semistructured in-depth interviews with 85 self-selected female primary care patients recruited from 2 hospital-associated primary care practices and through advertisements in local newspapers.
   Results: Topics that led subjects to deliberate over disclosure included sex, sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive health, drug use, mental health, and domestic circumstances. Concerns prompting this deliberation fell into 2 categories. The first, extraindividual concerns, included fear of information circulating to employers or insurance companies and the need to disclose for adequate treatment. The second, intrapersonal concerns, centered on feelings of comfort, embarrassment, or shame in the act of disclosing during the clinical encounter. While the majority of women did eventually disclose all or part of the information in question, a significant minority did not disclose. There were no significant demographic differences associated with patterns of disclosure.
   Conclusions: Primary care patients have concerns that affect and sometimes limit disclosure. Physicians are encouraged to explore patients' concerns about the uses and circulation of medical information, as well as anxiety over anticipated shame or embarrassment at the moment of information disclosure to physicians. This is especially important in primary care settings, where failure to disclose can mean lack of referral to needed specialized care.

AB This study aimed to evaluate whether twinning might influence handedness and the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to handedness in a total of 321 pairs of twins, 36 same-sex sib-pairs, and 1020 singletons, aged 12-16 and systematically recruited from the junior high schools in Taipei. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. The direction and consistency of handedness in twins did not differ from that seen in singletons. Compared with the full model containing additive genes (A), shared (C), and non-shared (E) environment, both AE and CE models had equivalently acceptable fit. The contribution from additive genes in the AE model was estimated to be 16% (directional) to 13% (consistent) for the continuous handedness and 34-10% for the categorical one, whereas the corresponding contribution from shared environment in the CE model was 14-14% and 32-11%, respectively. Handedness in adolescents appears to be not influenced by twinning and not substantially heritable, whereas environmental factors, especially those not shared between siblings, are the most important ones for explaining individual variations.

AB Interviews were conducted with 336 mother-child dyads (children's ages ranged from 6 to 17 years; mothers' ages ranged from 20 to 59 years) in China, India, Italy, Kenya, the Philippines, and Thailand to examine whether normativeness of physical discipline moderates the link between mothers' use of physical discipline and children's adjustment. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that physical discipline was less strongly associated with adverse child outcomes in conditions of greater perceived normativeness, but physical discipline was also associated with more adverse outcomes regardless of its perceived normativeness. Countries with the lowest use of physical discipline showed the strongest association between mothers' use and children's behavior problems, but in all countries higher use of physical discipline was associated with more aggression and anxiety.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine reports of adherence to oral medications, parent-child concordance in reports of adherence, and factors associated with poor adherence in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Participants were 50 children with IBD 11 to 17 years of age and their parents. Parents completed an adherence interview and the Child Behavior Checklist, Family Assessment Device, and demographics questionnaires. Separately, adolescents completed the adherence interview and the Piers Harris Self-Concept Scale, Children's Depression Inventory, and Coping Strategies Inventory questionnaires. The treating gastroenterologists of participating children completed the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index during a clinic visit within a week of completion of the questionnaires. Mean parent- and child-reported adherence scores fell between the "most of the time" and "always" categories, although perfect adherence was low. Among IBD-specific medications (5-ASAs, immunomodulators, steroids), 48% of children and 38% of parents reported being always adherent to all medications. Parent-child concordance was high. Family dysfunction and poor child coping strategies were associated with worse adherence. The correlation between more behavioral/emotional problems and lower adherence approached significance. Adherence should be monitored in families that lack appropriate child discipline and in children who cope by simply wishing stressors would go away. Because these issues are associated with poor adherence, it has been suggested that psychotherapy addressing these areas may contribute to improved adherence.

AB Background: Comorbidity between anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in adolescents Occurs very frequently. The aim of this study was to investigate if anxiety and depression represent distinct disease entities.
   Methods: Two thousand thirty two 11- to 18-year-olds, referred to mental health services, were investigated. Self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression were analyzed with latent class analysis.
   Results: The numbers of adolescents with severe depression symptoms, but with less severe, or absent, anxiety symptoms, were negligible. Further, two subgroups could be discerned in those with severe anxiety symptoms: one with severe depressive symptoms, and one with mild depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: A self-report questionnaire was used, whereas diagnostic interview information regarding DSM-IV disorders was not available.
   Discussion: It seems less useful to develop treatments, or to conduct studies aimed at etiological mechanisms, that are specifically aimed at depression and not at anxiety. Further, it may be relevant to discern specific subgroups of anxious adolescents, with severe versus mild comorbid depression symptoms. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Research suggests that negative affect is an important mediator in the relationship between body dissatisfaction and bulimic symptoms. This study examines the mediational role of specific emotion regulation processes (i.e., negative emotionality, poor awareness of emotion, nonconstructive coping with negative emotion) in bulimic symptoms. In addition to these emotion regulation variables, body dissatisfaction and bulimic symptoms were assessed in 234 girls in Grades 6 to 8 (mean age = 12 years, 11 months). The results indicated that negative affect, poor awareness of emotion, and nonconstructive coping with negative emotion partially mediated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and bulimic behaviors. The findings are discussed in light of previous research that suggests emotion regulation needs to be viewed as a multidimensional construct.

AB We assessed the effects of a stringent reception policy on the mental health of unaccompanied adolescent asylum seekers by comparing the mental health of adolescents in a restricted campus reception setting and in a setting offering more autonomy (numbers [response rates]: 69 [93%] and 53 [69%], respectively; mean age, 16 years). Unaccompanied adolescent asylum seekers in a restricted reception setting reported more emotional problems on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist than their counterparts in the more autonomy group (mean scores [SD]: restricted, 59.3 [13.1]; other, 53.4 [10.5]; p = 0.033 F test). Main effects concerned a rise in anxiety. Girls showed larger differences than boys. A restrictive reception may therefore affect the mental health of minor asylum seekers. Health care workers and policy makers should be aware of this adverse effect.

AB Aggressive and violent behavior of children often is caused by a lack of social and emotional competences, which blocks contructive problem- and conflict-management. Therefore lots of different US-American prevention approaches for the promotion of crucial social competences have been developed. Faustlos is the first German violence prevention curriculum, which promotes the social and emotional competences of first grade pupils and kindergarten aged children. The curriculum builds on the promotion of empathy, impulse control and anger management. Evaluation studies on the effectiveness of Faustlos prove its positive effects on aggressive behavior and on the promotion of social-emotional competence. Further, the feedback of people working with Faustlos concerning the acceptance and practicability of the programm is postive too. Besides the development of additive materials (e.g. Faustlos for parents) evaluation studies on the long-term effects of the program are needed.

AB Aim: To describe the psychosocial situation of children/adolescents with heart disease and their families, an inventory method was worked out. Methods: Ninety-seven children/adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) were graded into three categories with respect to complexity of CHD. Group I included 42 patients with malformations requiring standardized operations. Group II included 20 patients with more complicated malformations, and group III included 35 patients with very complex malformations. The patients were compared with controls without heart disease, matched for age and gender. The psychosocial impact of CHD was measured by the inventory. Results: The most frequent problems in the patient group were healthcare and treatment-related needs (71/97) in the external sphere, family symptoms (68/97) in the interpersonal sphere, and somatic symptoms (19/97) in the personal sphere. Corresponding numbers in the controls were treatment-related needs (15/97), family (9/97) and somatic symptoms (25/97). Fifty per cent of the symptoms in the patient groups were mild, 30% moderate and 20% severe. The most severe symptoms were found in the interpersonal sphere, where family symptoms constituted the most severe variable. The frequency of severe problems in the personal sphere was 11% in the patients and 1% in the controls. This inventory method differentiates the grades of medical complexity both regarding number and severity of psychosocial symptoms. It indicates severe personal problems in the most complex group and shows that they have severe personal problems independent of family problems.
   Conclusion: This study elucidates the psychosocial complexity in children/adolescents with CHD, which has clinical implications in developing a psychosocial care programme.

AB In contrast with other systemic rheumatic diseases in childhood, no systematic studies exist that focus on possible long-term risks for central nervous system involvement in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (SJRA). We investigated 31 children and adolescents with SJRA, aged 6 to 24 years (mean, 12.5 years; standard deviation, 4.3 years), with mean disease duration of 6.2 years (standard deviation, 3.5 years; range, 0.6-14 years) for their cognitive and fine motor abilities. We also examined 31 matched healthy control subjects. In addition, parents assessed social activities and social and emotional problems in their children. Patients and control subjects performed within normal limits of intelligence quotient, memory and learning, attention, and fine motor scores. Less social activities were reported for patients. Patients and control subjects, however, had normal social and emotional problem scores. SJRA, although a burdensome chronic disease, is not associated with cognitive impairment or increased social and emotional problems. Cognitive performance and social adjustment of young patients with SJRA are not affected by disease activity and duration.

AB Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of the FRIENDS programme.
   Methods: Uncontrolled before and after assessment of the FRIENDS programme, a 10 session cognitive behaviour therapy programme. A total of 213 children aged 9 - 10 years from six primary schools were studied. Main outcome measures: Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, Culture Free Self-Esteem Questionnaire, qualitative assessment of acceptability.
   Results: End of programme data from 197 children ( 92.5% of eligible sample) showed significantly lower rates of anxiety ( t = 2.95, df = 384) and significantly improved levels of self-esteem ( t = 3.13, df = 386). Significant improvements were obtained in over half of those children with the most severe emotional problems. A total of 190 children ( 89.2%) completed a qualitative assessment of acceptability: 154 ( 81%) thought it was fun, 147 ( 77.4%) would recommend it to a friend; 137 ( 72.8%) thought they had learned new skills, and 78 ( 41.1%) had helped someone else with their new skills.
   Conclusions: The FRIENDS programme appears to be an efficacious and acceptable way to promote emotional resilience ( reduced anxiety and increased self-esteem) in primary school aged children, consistent with previous studies in Australia. Further controlled studies are needed to assess natural history of anxiety and self-esteem and whether benefits are maintained over time.

Internalizing and Externalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies were measured by the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), in a cross-sectional design.
   Results: First, adolescents with Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, comorbid Internalizing and Externalizing problems and a control group were compared on their specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that adolescents with Internalizing problems (both pure and comorbid) scored significantly higher on the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of self-blame and rumination than those with Externalizing (pure) problems or the control group.
   Unique relationships between the separate cognitive strategies and Internalizing and Externalizing problems were tested by means of Multiple Regression Analyses. Specific relationships were found between Internalizing problems and self-blame, rumination and positive reappraisal and between Externalizing problems and positive refocusing. No 'common' correlates were found.
   Conclusions: Theoretical models designed for the prediction of Internalizing problems might not simply be used for the prediction of Externalizing problems. Different (cognitive) intervention strategies should be used for adolescents with Internalizing problems and Externalizing problems.

AB Objectives: Currently there is a lack of screening instruments suitable for use by preschool and kindergarten teachers to assess behavioural and emotional problems in preschool children The C-TRF/1 1/2-5 (Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for the ages 1 1/2-5) is a screening instrument designed by Achenbach to assess behavioural and emotional problems in this age group. In a joint project of the Fachhochschule Dortmund and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Ulm, in cooperation with the Youth Welfare Office Dortmund, the C-TRF/1 1/2-5 was used to assess the prevalence of psychological disturbance among kindergarten children.
   Methods: 1,050 children aged 3-6 years from 46 kindergartens from the, greater Dortmund urban area were rated by their caregivers on the basis of the German version of the C-TRF/1 1/2-5.
   Results: The reliability of C-TRF/1 1/2-5 proved to be good-to-sufficient, with internal consistencies ranging from .94 to .58. The number of behavioural and emotional problems, which is very close to that found among American preschool children, decreases with age and more strongly so among girls. The externalizing problems among boys do not decrease much, but remain quite stable from age 3 to age 6. The prevalence of internalizing problems among preschool boys and girls does not differ.
   Conclusions: The German version of the C-TRF/1 1/2-5 proved to be an instrument sufficiently reliable for screening behavioural and emotional problems in preschool children. The prevalence of these psychological problems among German and American children is very similar.

Results revealed that lower GPA, longer length of residence in the United States, subjects' poor self-esteem, greater severity of conflict with parents, and poor relationships with peers were significant predictors of emotional problems. The findings could be beneficial for social work practitioners and educators in determining the service needs of Korean American adoelscents and designing interventions for their problems.

AB The relationship between children's self-reported problems on the Personality Inventory for Youth (PIY) and peer descriptors derived from the Pupil Evaluation Inventory was examined in a regular education sample of 156 children in fourth through eighth grade. The relative contributions of the PIY scales and subscales to the prediction of peer ratings were compared. Peer ratings of withdrawn, disruptive, and prosocial behaviors were substantially correlated to self-report problem scales made up of logically related content. The addition of more content-specific PIY subscales contributed to the prediction made by PIY scales of peer-reported disruptive behaviors and withdrawal.

AB Earlier studies on attachment and substance use disorders using the Hazan and Shaver (1987) self-report mainly indicate a link with "avoidant" attachment styles. Studies working with the Adult Attachment Interview (Main & Goldwyn, 1998) have produced inconsistent results. The present study used the Bartholomew (1990) interview coding system to assess attachment in a sample of 71 German opiate using, drug dependent adolescents (DDAs, age 14-25) and 39 non-clinical controls. Fearful attachment was predominant in DDAs, while controls were predominantly secure. Severity of drug use, as assessed with the European Addiction Severity Index (Gsellhofer, Fahrner, & Platt, 1994) and urinalyses, was positively correlated with fearful attachment, but negatively correlated with dismissing attachment. The presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders was associated with fearful attachment but not with addiction severity.

AB Empirical evaluations suggest that problem orientation, the initial reaction to problems, differentiates suicidal youth from nonclinical controls and nonideating psychiatric controls. One promising area for intervention with suicidal youth relates to enhancing this specific coping skill. Nonclinical participants (N = 110) with active suicidal ideation were randomly assigned to receive a brief problem-orientation intervention or a control procedure. The current study evaluated the benefits of a brief prevention intervention based on the Problem-Solving Therapy model. Exposure to a brief video intervention regarding problem solving and coping skills was sufficient to elicit significant decreases in suicidal ideation and depression, but the intervention did not elicit improvements in problem orientation or other problem-solving abilities. These findings provide preliminary support for a brief, video-based problem-solving and coping skills module. However, considerable work in developing secondary prevention interventions remains.

AB In a 3-wave longitudinal study (with assessments 2 years apart) involving 186 early adolescents (M ages of approximately 9.3, 11.4, and 13.4), the hypothesis that parental warmth/positive expressivity predicts children's effortful control (EC) (a temperamental characteristic contributing to emotion regulation) 2 years later, which in turn predicts low levels of externalizing problems another 2 years later, was examined. The hypothesis that children's EC predicts parenting over time was also examined. Parents were observed interacting with their children; parents and teachers reported children's EC and externalizing problems; and children's persistence was assessed behaviorally. Children's EC mediated the relation between positive parenting and low levels of externalizing problems (whereas there was no evidence that children's EC predicted parenting).

AB Due to the rising cost of mental health care, increasing numbers of mental health care facilities require outcome management programs to monitor the cost-effectiveness of treatments delivered to youth. These programs require outcome instruments that are sensitive to change, psychometrically sound and easy to administer, score and interpret. This study uses community and outpatient youth samples to investigate the psychometric quality of the Y-OQ((R))-30.1, an outcome tracking and screening instrument specifically designed to meet this need. The Y-OQ((R))-30.1 is a single instrument that can be used by parents or adolescents to assess observed behavior and symptom change in youth undergoing mental health treatment. Results show the Y-OQ((R))-30.1 possesses adequate levels of internal consistency, test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and can detect statistically and clinically meaningful differences between community and clinical samples. Clinical implications of the results are discussed, along with directions for future research. Copyright (R) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Although no prospective epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between family interactions and the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD), there is considerable evidence for the central role of family interactions in the development of BPD. This paper describes the role of family interactions or processes, especially those that might be regarded as invalidating or conflictual, negative or critical. and the absence of more validating, positive, supportive, empathic interactions, in the development of BPD. Perhaps more importantly, the proposed model considers how these parental and family behaviors transact with the child's own behaviors and emotional vulnerabilities, resulting in a developmental model of BPD that is neither blaming of the family member with BPD nor of her or his parents and caregivers, and has important and specific implications for both prevention and intervention.

AB Although parasuicidal behavior in adolescence is poorly understood, evidence suggests that it may be a developmental precursor of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Current theories of both parasuicide and BPD suggest that emotion dysregulation is the primary precipitant of self-injury, which serves to dampen overwhelmingly negative affect. To date, however, no studies have assessed endophenotypic markers of emotional responding among parasuicidal adolescents. In the present study, we compare parasuicidal adolescent girls (n = 23) with age-matched controls (n = 23) on both psychological and physiological measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology. Adolescents, parents, and teachers completed questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, substance use, trait affectivity, and histories of parasuicide. Psychophysiological measures including electrodermal responding (EDR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) were collected at baseline, during negative mood induction, and during recovery. Compared with controls, parasuicidal adolescents exhibited reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline, greater RSA reactivity during negative mood induction, and attenuated peripheral serotonin levels. No between-group differences on measures of PEP or EDR were found. These results lend further support to theories of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity in parasuicidal teenage girls.

AB Recently there has been a growing interest and research regarding the relationship among personality and psychopathologies in children, with a main focus in the area of behavioral and emotional problems, drugs use, etc. However, there is a lack of instruments of proper measurement in spite that those are not adapted to our culture and environment. This problem is also aggravated due to imprecision in diagnostic definitions. Simultaneously, it has been observed an increased demand of attention and counseling for conduct problems and/or conduct disturbances in children. That is why, ex post facto study was developed in order to know the internalized and exteriorized conduct problems in children in the fifth and sixth grade of elementary school in Mexico city (M=11 years of age) A non probabilistic sample of 671 children (357 boys and 314 girls) answered the Achenbach and Rescorla adapted and reviewed questionary for Mexican population. The results showed differences among boys and girls. Boys showed more externalizing problems, and girls had more internalizing, somatic and anxiety conduct problems.

Less evident in the special section articles but equally important are the need to cope with multicultural issues, avoid premature closure regarding diagnostic labels, assess caregivers, and standardize broad-spectrum assessment procedures.

AB In this study, the authors examine the equivalence of the factor structure of a commonly used symptom checklist of behavioral and emotional problems-the Behavior Problem Index (BPI)-across African American, Hispanic, and White children in the United States. The sample is drawn from the 1998 data file of the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a U.S. data set. The results of the study suggest that the BPI is not equivalent across the three ethnic groups. These findings are consistent when equivalence is tested for a one-factor model, a two-factor model using the internalizing and externalizing dimensions of the BPI, and a six-factor model using the subscales of the BPI. Item-level analyses identify the statistically significant items that are associated with nonequivalence across ethnic groups. The implications of non-equivalent measures for cross-cultural research and practice with families and children are discussed.

AB Adolescents in junior high school (n = 237), completed a questionnaire on bullying as it relates to victim and to perpetrator status, suicidality and biographical data. Psychological symptoms were assessed by the Youth Self Report (YSR) and the Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) supplemented by school health officers blind assessments. Bullying was common: bully only (18%), victim only (10%) and victim and bully (9%). Bullies had mainly externalizing symptoms (delinquency and aggression) and those of the victim and bully group both externalizing and internalizing symptoms as well as high levels of suicidality. Adolescents in the bully only group were more likely to be boys and to have attention problems. Moreover, a substantial proportion of the adolescents in the victim only group were judged by school health officer to have psychiatric symptoms and to function socially less well.

AB This study investigates emotional and behavioural problems in children of parents diagnosed with cancer and examines the relationship with demographic and illness-related variables. Furthermore, agreement and differences between informants regarding child's functioning were examined. Members of 186 families in which a parent had been diagnosed with cancer participated. More emotional problems were reported for latency-aged sons (ill parents) and adolescent daughters (ill parents; self-reports), whereas also better functioning was reported in adolescent children (spouses), compared to the norm group. Age and gender-effects were found: latency-aged sons were perceived as having more emotional problems than adolescent sons (ill parents); adolescent daughters as having more emotional and behavioural problems than adolescent sons (ill parents; self-reports). Results indicated a higher prevalence of problems when the father was ill than when the mother was (spouses and self-reports). The treatment intensity affected adolescent daughter's functioning (spouses), whereas adolescent son's functioning was affected by relapsed disease (self-reports). Adolescents and mothers perceived comparable levels of problems, but fathers perceived problems in children to be less prevalent. Findings suggest that adolescent daughters and latency-aged sons are at risk for emotional problems following the diagnosis of cancer in a parent. The perception of child's functioning and potential influencing variables varied according to informant. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Animal studies suggest that prenatal stress is associated with long-term disturbance in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, but evidence in humans is lacking. This study examined the long-term association between prenatal anxiety and measures of diurnal cortisol at age 10 years.
   Methods: Measures of cortisol were collected at awakening, 30 min after awakening, and at 4 Pm and 9 PM on 3 consecutive days in a sample of 10-year-olds (n = 74) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of mothers and children on whom measures of anxiety and depression were collected in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Analyses examined the links between symptoms of prenatal anxiety and multiple indicators of cortisol, an index of HPA axis functioning.
   Results: Prenatal anxiety was significantly associated with individual differences in awakening and afternoon cortisol after accounting for obstetric and sociodemographic risk (partial correlations were .32 and .25, p < .05). The effect for awakening cortisol remained significant after controlling for multiple postnatal assessments of maternal anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions. This study provides the first human evidence that prenatal anxiety might have lasting effects on HPA axis functioning in the child and that prenatal anxiety might constitute a mechanism for an increased vulnerability to psychopathology in children and adolescents.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the concordance of parental and adolescent reports of adolescents having emotional and behavioral problems. Data were collected from youths (age 11-17) and adult caregivers from a community-based sample of households. The sample consisted of 4175 youths and their caregivers (37.8% European, 35.0% African, 25.4% Latino, and 1.8% other American). Indicators of emotional and/or behavioral problems were global indicators: perceived mental health, life satisfaction, happiness, interpersonal problems at home, and problems at school. Overall, parent-child concordance on the indicators of mental health was low, with a mean K value of 0.12. In multivariate analyses, European American parent-youth dyads were significantly more likely to be concordant on reports of perceived mental health, problems at home, and problems at school than African American and Latino dyads. Our data suggest that ethnicity is a significant factor in parental labeling and awareness of adolescent mental health problems. Future research should examine whether the extent to which greater lack of concordance on the indicators of mental health by minority parent-child dyads plays a role in entry into and retention in mental health care.

AB Little is known about behavioural and emotional adjustment in children in Sri Lanka, and this study is the first attempt to assess mental health problems in this population. Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman R (1994) A modified version of the Rutter parent questionnaire including items on children's strenghts: a research note. J Child Psychol Psychiatry 35:1483-1494) with parent, teacher and child informants, in a large sample of 10- to 13-yearold school children from Colombo, we found rates and types of problems consistent with other international studies of child mental health. Problem rates were higher in boys and were associated with lower SES and poorer academic performance. Relationships between behavioural adjustment and Tamil ethnicity and Hindu religion emerged in this sample and could possibly be associated with the experience of longstanding ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. The study confirms the need for development of child and adolescent health services in Sri Lanka.

AB In the past decades, an extensive body on early intervention research programs has grown with numerous scientific publications in the English language litterature, while such studies remain rare in France. This study reports the outcome of families whose children were followed in an out-patient treatment centre, the Unite de Soins Specialises et Domicile (USSD) in Paris. This institution, created in 1975, was designed to promote healthy parent-infant relationships and prevent difficulties for families exhibiting psycho-emotional and or psychiatric risks. The objectives are to enhance infant and early child development, to support parenting competences and to fight against intergenerational process of maltreatment and child placement. The theoretical references of the multidisciplinary team are the psychoanalysis, the attachment theory and the clinic of interactions. Thirty-height families were selected from the files of the USSD: They all had a child aged before the age of 18 months, born between 1985 and 1990 and were cared for more than one year; the other children received intervention after this age. Assessment of parents and children was made when the families had been out of treatment for at least five years. As it is a preliminary study without a control group, we have choose a psychosocial and comprehensive approach more focused on family issues than individual ones. For each child and family, institutional data were collected and argued with the all the professionals still present in the institution: admission in the institution, parental problems and infant symptoms (with reference to the DSM IV and the Zero-to-Three classification), therapeutic interventions (psychodynamic or interpersonal, parents-children groups, parental or children groups, home visiting...), child's re-educations, relationship with other social or psychiatric teams, orientation after the intervention. Thirty-one situations were re-evaluated. Standardized materials (WISC-R subtests, Rutter A scale for children, Nottingham Health Profile for parents) and semi-structured interviews were used for the assessments. Parental consent and administrative authorizations (for children in foster families or institutions) were obtained and interviews were registered. Two groups of families were studied. Group I included families without specific pathology, they received therapeutic intervention for a mean of 2 1/2 years, most of the mothers were depressed. It was composed of 2 sub-groups : in 8 families, the child's birth with severe perinatal problems had brought about the parental trauma, for 7 families, psycho-emotional problems were blew up again after the child's birth, signs of maltreatment could be detected. Group 11 included families at high risk for child abuse and neglect with numerous psychosocial stress, most of them were followed by social workers; interventions had lasted for a mean of 6 years. It was composed of two sub-groups: seven disorganized family situations with alcohol abuse and depressed mothers, and nine families with psychotic mothers, most of the babies were placed in foster care. We met 16 parental couples and 13 monoparental families twice and seven foster families. Twenty-five young people were interviewed and complementary information was obtained for seven others from the Child Protection services and foster agencies.
   Results focus on: 1) the families' present situation, healh representations and their social/relational and parental competences; 2) for the young people: the intellectual and scholastic competences, behaviour, social reltionships with their peers. They are presented in each of the sub-groups for parents and for children; differences and common points are noted in the two groups of families I and II. Mean ages at assessment were 12,3 years for children in group I and 13,3 in group II. Except in one case (children became Wards of the State), parents are able to carry out their responsibilities, totally in group I or partially in group 11 where it was shared with the Child Protection services for most children and adolescents were still placed. No serious child abuse or neglect was detected and there was a positive evolution for the parents' social and family relationships especially in group I. The family support is more precarious in group 11, counterbalanced by social and medical support. Concerning children and adolescents, two third are in the normal school system, the others are in classes for slow learners, one is in a day care hospital. A third have behaviour problems. For all of these young people, verbal subtests (Vocabulary and Similarities, were more succeeded than the performance subtest (Block Design), this result is associated with facilities in verbal expression showed during the interviews. The impact of early therapeutic intervention is notable among children of the families at high risk who had received such care before the age of one: the all have better social competences with peers, less behaviour problems and school failure than the others. Given these results, we can assume that early therapeutic intervention mediates psycho-social risk in these families. As this study is mostly descriptive, it should be followed by complementary research on larger populations. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tons droits reserves.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to use the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), a 23-question modular instrument designed to measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents, to compare the HRQOL in children with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) with the HRQOLs reported for healthy children and children with other chronic medical conditions.
   Methods: The PedsQL version 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 questions in 4 subscales (Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Functioning) for parent-proxy reporting on the HRQOL in children ages 2 to 4 years, parent reporting for children 5 to 18 years, and child self-reporting for ages 5 to 7 years (age-adjusted questions and rating scales) and 8 to 18 years. The questionnaires were administered in person or by telephone to 22 children with RRP and (or, for children 2 to 4 years of age) one parent recruited from a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology practice. The results were compared with validated norms for healthy children and scores for children whose parents reported a chronic medical condition.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, the children 5 to 18 years of age with RRP self-reported a significantly (p <.05) worse HRQOL as measured by the PedsQL Total Score, Psychosocial Health score (a combination of Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scores), and Social Functioning and School Functioning scores. Self-reported scores for the children 5 to 18 years of age with RRP compared with children with other chronic illnesses followed the same trend, and the difference approached statistical significance (p =.05) for the School Functioning Subscale scores. The parent-proxy report (for children 2 to 18 years of age) scores for children with RRP were significantly lower (p <.000 1) on every scale and in total compared with scores for healthy children. Compared with scores of children with other chronic medical conditions, the parent-proxy report scores were significantly lower for psychosocial health (p =.005) and school functioning (p <.0001).
   Conclusions: Children with RRP report a lower quality of life than do those who are healthy, and a quality of life similar to that of those who have other chronic medical problems. The parent reports also reflect a lower quality of life for children affected by this disease, as compared with healthy children. The PedsQL demonstrated a statistically significant low HRQOL in children with RRP; however, the clinical implications of this finding appear trivial. A distinct, disease-specific survey for RRP, if developed, would have enhanced responsiveness and sensitivity to change (due to the natural course of the disease and/or surgical treatments).

AB We examined longitudinally collected behavioral reports by teachers on a unique twin sample at the ages of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years. As twin and adoption studies implicate the role of genetic influence on behavioral problems found to be stable in epidemiological samples, the current study employs a developmental behavior genetic model to examine the extent to which genetic and environmental contributions to problem behaviors are stable and/or change during development. In this sample of 410 monozygotic (MZ) and 354 dizygotic (DZ) twins, MZ twins were rated as more similar than DZ twins on average. In general, boys were more frequently rated as displaying externalizing behaviors than were girls across each of the six observations, while girls' internalizing problems were found not to be significantly different from boys'. For both sexes, stability in externalizing problem behaviors was due to a single common genetic factor whose effects acted pleiotropically at each age in the presence of unique environmental influences that were transmitted from age-to-age. Change was largely due to uncorrelated age-specific non-shared environmental and additive genetic effects. Contributions to stability for internalizing problems were due to age-to-age transmission of earlier expressed genetic effects. Change for girls and boys internalizing problems were largely due to environmental experiences unique to siblings along with uncorrelated age-specific genetic effects. These results further inform the notion that individual environments are important factors in the etiology of problem behaviors, but suggest that heritable contributions to phenotypic stability are largely the same across middle childhood and early adolescence. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This article examines the portrayals and myths of child and adolescent psychiatry relevant to the current practitioner. Although behavioral and emotional problems abound onscreen, the formal diagnosis of youth mental illness is uneven and rare. Common myths of brainwashing, incarceration, parent blame, parent supplantation, violence, and evil are explored, with current commercial examples of each. The impact of these portrayals on young patients, peers, parents, and the public at large are examined through the prevalence of different stereotypes across different genres more likely viewed by different ages. Positive and negative depictions of illness and treatment are identified for education and awareness, and the authors provide advice for using Hollywood films successfully as a helpful intervention in the mental health treatment of children and adolescents.

AB This longitudinal study investigated the effects of witnessing violence on committing violence among diverse urban middle school students (11 - 15 years old) over a 1-year period (N = 51,599). It examined parent support and prosocial cognitions as moderators that might interact with one another in buffering adolescents from the effects of witnessing violence. The study also explored gender and ethnicity differences across these protective processes. According to the results, both average and high levels of parent support may offer male adolescents who witness violence protection against committing subsequent acts of violence. Adolescent females who witness violence appear to be uniquely protected from committing acts of violence if they have highly prosocial cognitions. Applications to resilience and competency models are discussed.

AB Purpose of review 1995 saw the publication of a major review of time trends in psychosocial disorders of youth across the second half of the twentieth century. It found evidence for substantial increases in rates of youth crime, alcohol and drug use, depression and suicide in most industrialized countries in the decades following the Second World War, slowing in some instances in the 1980s. Ten years on, we review findings on more recent trends in rates of these and other indicators of child and adolescent mental health.
   Recent findings Prevalence estimates for autism spectrum disorders have increased in recent decades, as has public and professional awareness of hyperactivity and attention deficits. Trends in adolescent conduct problems, and in alcohol and drug use, appear to reflect culture-specific influences. Rates of suicide among young males, and self-harm among females have risen in many countries in recent years; trends in emotional disorders are more varied, but there is little evidence for any rise in rates of anorexia nervosa. Although some contributors to these trends have been identified, much remains to be learned about the key risks involved.
   Summary Monitoring time trends in child and adolescent mental health is essential for service planning; knowledge of changing trends can also provide important pointers to potential risk factors. Current data sources allow relatively reliable tracking of trends in some areas, but remain severely limited in others. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying recently identified trends in child and adolescent mental health.

AB The aim of this article is to compare the kinds of behavioural and emotional problems of youth in relation to type of out-of-home placement in Croatia. Children living in children's homes manifest significantly more behavioural and emotional problems than other groups of children in out-of-home care or children living in their primary families. Children living in foster families or in family-type homes integrated in the community do not differ from a comparative group of children living in primary families. Regardless of differences among sub-samples regarding behavioural and emotional problems, the current problems of individual children in all groups of children in out-of-home placement were connected more to currently experienced stressors than to unfavourable circumstances before their removal. This indicates that there are benefits to be gained by improving services in the children's present care environment.

ID ADJUSTMENT; SURVIVORS; FAMILY
AB Standardized behavior rating scales have been used in the routine care of children during medical visits because they provide an objective, norm-based index for the child's behavioral functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine behavior problems among children (aged 2.5-18 years) with burn injuries using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, a multi-informant system of standardized rating scales that assesses clinical and adaptive behavior areas. Parents and youth (ages 8 -18) completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children with reference to the pediatric patient's behavioral functioning before hospital admission for a burn injury. In total, data were collected on 94 children. Results suggested that a substantial portion of the sample endorsed significantly elevated levels of behavioral difficulties across a broad range of problem behaviors. On the basis of parent report, preschoolers exhibited concerns related to hyperactivity, anxiety, aggression, and attention problems, whereas school-aged children were reported to have these same concerns as well as depression and conduct problems. Twenty percent of our adolescent sample (ages 12-18 years) were described to be experiencing even more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems relative to the two groups of their younger counterparts. Boys were found to contribute to the cause of their burn injury significantly more often than girls. The strengths, limitations, and clinical implications of our findings are discussed.

AB Objective. Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common complaints of childhood and is associated with several adverse outcomes in adulthood. Few large, population-based, longitudinal studies have been conducted. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and epidemiologic features of RAP through early childhood.
   Design. We report findings from a large, population-based, cohort study of childhood (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children). The prevalence and continuity of RAP from 2 to 6 years of age were explored, with associated physical and psychological symptoms among the children and their parents.
   Results. In a population cohort of 13 971 children, RAP was reported for 11.8% of 6-year-old children. It was less common at ages 2 years (3.8%) and 3 years (6.9%). There was a striking degree of continuity of RAP between the ages of 2 and 6 years. RAP was associated with headaches and limb pains among children and with higher rates of anxiety among both children (adjusted odds ratio: 2.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.70-2.65) and their mothers (odds ratio: 1.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-2.36).
   Conclusions. In a large, population-based, cohort study, RAP was found to be increasingly common up to the age of 6 years. Children with RAP at a young age have a high risk of RAP later in childhood. RAP is associated with other somatic pain symptoms among children and with symptoms of anxiety among children and their mothers. These findings highlight the high prevalence and continuity of RAP through early childhood and the importance of considering psychological symptoms for these children and their families.

Academic achievement in boys was predicted by parent's education level and intact family; in girls, parent education, DOTS-R Flexibility and General Rhythmicity together accounted for 31% of variance. Conduct Problems in boys were predicted by GWPQ Behavioural Activation and DOTS-R General Rhythmicity; in girls, the only significant predictor was Flexibility. Emotional Problems were influenced by living conditions and GWPQ Behavioural Inhibition. Total Difficulties were predicted by living conditions, Flexibility and Psychoticism.

AB Background Although an increasing proportion of the population in Western countries originates from non-Western parts of the world, little research has been conducted on predictors of externalizing problems in immigrant adolescent samples. This study on the predictors of externalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant adolescents in the Netherlands was aimed to contribute to the knowledge in this field. Methods We obtained 415 parent-reports, 376 self-reports and 238 teacher-reports on problem behavior in a general population sample of randomly selected 11- to 18-year-old Moroccan immigrant adolescents, using the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report and Teacher's Report Form. Results The data revealed a clear relation between externalizing problems and several child (gender, internalizing problems), proximal family (parental monitoring and affection, support from father and mother, and parent-child conflict), contextual family (conflicts between parents about parenting, destructive communication between parents, and total number of life-events), school/peer (problems at school, involvement with deviant peers, hanging out), and migration variables (adolescent's perceived discrimination). Hardly any association was observed between externalizing problems and parental psychopathology, and between externalizing problems and global family variables (e.g., family employment level). Most findings matched results found in earlier studies on non-immigrant youth. Conclusions Our results suggest that the child, school/peer, and proximal family factors are essential in models predicting the development of externalizing behavior. The impact of the migration factor on externalizing problems turned out to be relatively small.

AB Research has shown insecure attachment style is associated with ineffective emotional regulation leading to maladaptive behaviors in adulthood. In the present study, we examined the association between attachment style and illicit substance use within a sample of adoptees (n=148). It was predicted that insecure attachment style would be associated with a higher incidence of lifetime illicit substance use and that perceived social support would mediate this association. Logistic regression analyses showed higher prevalence of illicit substance use among both insecure attachment groups as compared to the secure group. No difference was found between the two insecure types. Perceived social support was found to mediate the association between attachment style and illicit substance use for the insecure-preoccupied group only. The findings from the present study further implicate attachment style in the risk for illicit substance use, as well as preventions designed to identify those at risk for use. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the self-reported psychosocial functioning of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to that of healthy children in the areas of behavioral/emotional functioning, social competence, self-esteem, stress coping strategies, and social support.
   METHODS: Participants were 50 children with IBD diagnosed at least 1 yr before enrollment, and 42 healthy comparison children aged 11-17 yr. They completed a series of well-validated questionnaires assessing psychosocial functioning. The treating gastroenterologists of participating children with IBD completed the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index during a clinic visit within a week of completion of the questionnaires.
   RESULTS: Mean scores fell in the normal range on all normed measures, and there were no significant differences between group means on any of the measures. A subset of 20% of children with IBD reported clinically significant behavioral/emotional symptoms, even a year after diagnosis, which was similar to results found in the healthy comparison group. Most children with IBD were in remission or had mild disease activity at the time of the study. Neither past nor current disease factors differentiated those with significant emotional problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that most children with currently mild IBD who have been diagnosed for at least a year report normal psychosocial functioning that is similar to that of healthy children. A subset of these children report significant behavioral/emotional difficulty, and future research should seek to identify which children are most at risk for these problems and how best to intervene.

AB Objective: The purpose of the study was to examine adaptive, emotional, and family functioning in a well-characterized group of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to evaluate the influence of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the levels of impairment in various functional domains.
   Method: The study group included 287 children and adolescents (191 boys, 96 girls) ages 7-18 years. Fifty-six subjects had a diagnosis of OCD only, 43 had both OCD and ADHD, 95 had ADHD, and 93 were unaffected comparison children. Best estimate DSM-IV diagnoses were assigned on the basis of structured interviews and clinical ratings. The children's functioning was evaluated with a comprehensive battery of well-established, standardized measures, including the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, parents' ratings of social and family functioning, and children's self-reports of emotional adjustment.
   Results: The children with OCD only were more impaired than were unaffected comparison subjects in most areas of adaptive functioning and emotional adjustment. Children with OCD plus ADHD had additional difficulties in social functioning, school problems, and self-reported depression. Impairment in daily living skills, reduced number of activities, and self-reported anxiety were uniquely associated with the diagnosis of OCD. Family dysfunction was associated with ADHD but not with OCD.
   Conclusions: Children and adolescents with OCD are impaired in multiple domains of adaptive and emotional functioning. When comorbid ADHD is present, there is an additional burden on social, school, and family functioning.

AB Objective: To assess the functional and behavioral health of unaccompanied Sudanese refugee minors approximately 1 year after resettlement in the United States.
   Design: A descriptive survey.
   Setting: Local refugee foster care programs affiliated with the US Unaccompanied Refugee Minors Program.
   Participants: A total of 304 Sudanese refugee minors enrolled in the US Unaccompanied Refugee Minors Program.
   Main Outcome Measures: Health outcomes were assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Child Health Questionnaire. Outcomes included the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and scores on all Child Health Questionnaire subscales and global single-item assessments.
   Results: Twenty percent of the minors had a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and were more likely to have tower (worse) scores on all the Child Health Questionnaire subscales. Low functional and behavioral health scores were seen mainly in functioning in the home and in subjective health ratings. Social isolation and history of personal injury were associated with posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Conclusions: Unaccompanied Sudanese minors have done well in general. The minors function well in school and in activities; however, behavioral and emotional problems manifest in their home lives and emotional states. The subset of children with traumatic symptoms had characteristics that may distinguish them from their peers and that may inform future resettlement services for unaccompanied minors in the United States.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between maternal representations of attachment, as assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996), and mothers' thoughts and feelings about their own emotions and emotions emerging in their toddlers. Eighty-nine adolescent mothers completed the AAI and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) and Katz, Gottman, Shapiro, and Carrere's (1997) metaemotion interview for parents of toddlers. Autonomous mothers demonstrated the most open and flexible mindset around a variety of emotions in themselves and their toddlers. Dismissing mothers exhibited a tendency to minimize internalizing emotions in themselves and their children, while unresolved mothers described the most emotion regulatory difficulties.

AB Using a cross-sectional comparison group design, 4,746 ethnically diverse middle and high school students from 31 public schools in a metropolitan area were surveyed about their health, emotional factors (self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and suicidality), and behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use). Based on regression analyses that adjusted for gender, race, school level, and socioeconomic status, adolescents with chronic health conditions were significantly more likely to report depressive symptoms and low self-esteem than adolescents without chronic health conditions; they were almost twice as likely to have considered suicide and over 31/2 times more likely to have attempted suicide. They also reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and illicit drugs. Given the extent of behavioral and emotional problems among adolescents with chronic health conditions, appropriate referrals and mental health services for these adolescents are warranted.

AB Adolescent daughters of women with breast cancer (BC) are themselves at risk for heritable BC. Although some preliminary evidence suggests this group is at an increased risk for emotional problems, evidence is limited to studies with small samples and no comparison groups. This study examined psychological and family functioning, health attitudes and beliefs about genetic risks in adolescent females. A case-comparison design was used to compare 55 mother - daughter pairs in which the mother had been treated for BC (BC group) to 55 families from the general population (GP). Participants completed an assessment battery measuring perceptions of personal risk for BC and attitudes about gene testing for BC susceptibility, family functioning, and adolescent psychological adjustment. Based on MANOVA, no significant differences were found between the two groups on measures of the psychological functioning. However, BC group adolescents reported significant (p < 0.01) worries about their future health and genetic risk for BC. About 68% of BC adolescents compared with 12% of GP adolescents reported being moderately to greatly concerned about their susceptibility to genetic mutations. Further, 85% of BC group adolescents believed they were susceptible to BC compared with 10% of GP adolescents. The results indicated no evidence of emotional, behavioral, or familial distress in these families. However, BC adolescents have significant worries about their future health. The results of this study demonstrate the need to develop a comprehensive model of care where accurate information about genetics and health risks can be provided. The adolescents also need support to help them cope and communicate with their mothers their worries about BC.

The second goal was to compare boys-girls problem scales data and CBCL-TRF-YSR differences in our sample. The mean value of CBCL scores for the Total Problems scale for different groups (children/adolescents; boys/girls) ranged from 17.07 to 20.71. Overall instruments' internal consistency ranged from 0.83 to 0.86. In almost all the scales parents reported higher scores than teachers (p < 0.01). In all the scales adolescents reported significantly higher scores than their parents and teachers (p < 0.01). This study standardized the questionnaires for our specific socio-cultural circle, which satisfy complex psychopathology study criteria. Problem scales results in our sample suggest similarity to previous European researches.

AB From an affective neuroscience perspective, the goal of achieving a deeper, more mechanistic understanding of the development of depression will require rigorous models that address the core underlying affective changes. Such an understanding will necessitate developing and testing hypotheses focusing on specific components of the complex neural systems involved in the regulation of emotion and motivation. In this paper, we illustrate these principles by describing one example of this type of approach: examining the role of disruptions in neural systems of positive affect in major depressive disorder in school-age children and adolescents. We begin by defining positive affect, proposing that positive affect can be distinguished from negative affect by its neurobehavioral features. We provide an overview of neural systems related to reward and positive affect, with a discussion of their potential involvement in depression. We describe a developmental psychopathology framework, addressing developmental issues that could play a role in the etiology and maintenance of early-onset depression. We review the literature on altered positive affect in depression, suggesting directions for future research. Finally, we discuss the treatment implications of this framework.

AB We hypothesized that youth with elevated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk who exhibit diminished social-emotional competence and frequent anger in adolescence experience increased occupational stress after becoming adults. Perceived job control and support from coworkers in 57 young Black and White men and women were regressed on measures of social problem-solving skill (SPS) and anger arousal (AR) obtained 5 years earlier when participants were in high school. In models controlling for grade point average (GPA), SPS and GPA independently predicted coworker support in adulthood; anger in high school predicted diminished job control. These findings suggest that occupational stress may have identifiable social-emotional antecedents early in life.

AB This study examined the association between early child care on the development of behavior problems. At the age of 5 years, child care information was collected from parents on a large group of twins who were born between 1985 and 1997. Mothers and fathers rated the behavior of the child at ages 3, 7, and 10 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers reported on the same children's behaviors using the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) at ages 7 and 10. At the age of 3 years, children with nonparental child care experiences had more externalizing problems than children with only parental child care. The long-term effects of quantity of child care were mixed and were only significant for mother ratings and for children from families with a low socioeconomic status. Overall, the effect sizes of child care were very small (effect sizes were between .12 and .23). Children with a larger amount of child care did not show more behavior problems, therefore it was questioned whether the increased levels of behavior problems could be attributed to quantity of child care.

AB Objective: Most studies of borderline personality disorder have drawn patients from among hospital inpatients or outpatients. The aims of this study were to examine the nature of borderline personality disorder patients in everyday clinical practice and to use data from a sample of borderline personality disorder patients seen in the community to refine the borderline construct.
   Method: A random national sample of 117 experienced psychiatrists and psychologists from the membership registers of the American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association provided data on a randomly selected patient with borderline personality disorder (N=90) or dysthymic disorder (N=27) from their practice. The clinicians provided data on axis I comorbidity, axis II comorbidity, and adaptive functioning, as well as a personality description of the patient using the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 ( SWAP-200) Q-sort, an instrument designed for assessment and taxonomic purposes. Analyses compared borderline personality disorder and dysthymic disorder groups on variables of interest and aggregated SWAP-200 items across all borderline personality disorder patients to create a composite portrait of borderline personality disorder as seen in the community.
   Results: The borderline personality disorder sample strongly resembled previously studied borderline personality disorder samples with regard to comorbidity and adaptive functioning. However, the SWAP-200 painted a portrait of borderline personality disorder patients as having more distress and emotion dysregulation, compared to the DSM-IV description.
   Conclusions: Borderline personality disorder patients in research samples are highly similar to those seen in a cross-section of clinical practice. However, several studies have now replicated a portrait of borderline personality disorder symptoms that places greater weight than the DSM-IV description on the intense psychological pain of these patients and suggests candidate diagnostic criteria for DSM-V.

AB This study assessed the hypothesis that popularity in adolescence takes on a twofold role, marking high levels of concurrent adaptation but predicting increases over time in both positive and negative behaviors sanctioned by peer norms. Multimethod, longitudinal data, on a diverse community sample of 185 adolescents (13 to 14 years), addressed these hypotheses. As hypothesized, popular adolescents displayed higher concurrent levels of ego development, secure attachment, and more adaptive interactions with mothers and best friends. Longitudinal analyses supported a popularity-socialization hypothesis, however, in which popular adolescents were more likely to increase behaviors that receive approval in the peer group (e.g., minor levels of drug use and delinquency) and decrease behaviors unlikely to be well received by peers (e.g., hostile behavior with peers).

AB This study examined the social-cognitive and behavioral attributes of children who are concurrently aggressive and victimized by their peers. The characteristics of these "aggressive victims" were examined in comparison to bullies, passive victims, and normative comparison children. The sample included 240 urban Los Angeles elementary school children (mean age = 9.5 years), who completed a series of self-report inventories, a social-cognitive interview, and a peer nomination inventory. Ratings of behavioral adjustment were obtained from teachers and academic functioning was obtained through a review of school records. Subgroup comparisons indicated that aggressive victims were characterized by impairments in self-regulation as well as difficulties across domains of functioning. In contrast, bullies tended to exhibit aggression-related biases in social-cognitive processing, but did not suffer from other adjustment problems, and passive victims were characterized by nonassertive behaviors and low levels of social skills. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinctiveness and theoretical importance of the aggressive victim subgroup. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The anterior cingulate is a key component of neural networks subserving attention and emotion regulation, functions often impaired in patients with psychosis. The study aimed to examine anterior cingulate volumes and sulcal morphology in a group of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) compared with controls. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in 13 COS and 18 matched control children, ages 6-17 years. Volume measures for the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) were obtained through manual labeling. A determination of cingulate sulcal pattern (single or double) was made for each hemisphere. The COS group had a reduced leftward skew of the double cingulate sulcal pattern, and absence of the normal left > right ACG volume asymmetry. The right ACG was larger in the COS than in controls. The schizophrenic children showed decreases in all ACG volumes with age, while the controls showed increases or no change. The data suggest that significant cingulate abnormalities may result from deviations in progressive neurodevelopmental processes, beginning before birth and continuing through childhood and adolescence, in persons who develop schizophrenia. These structural differences may relate to the well-described cognitive deficits these children display, and to the cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aim: To study psychosocial adjustment and mental health in children with upper-limb reduction deficiency and a myoelectric prosthetic hand. Methods: Sixty-two parents of children aged 8 to 18 y old answered a questionnaire concerning competence and behaviour/emotional problems in their children. Of the 62 children, 37 adolescents aged 11 to 18 y old answered questionnaires concerning competence, problems and mood state. The results were compared with Swedish normative data. The children were divided into five groups based on degree of myoelectric prosthetic use. Results: Children with upper-limb reduction deficiency and a myoelectric prosthetic hand showed social competence and behaviour/emotional problems similar to Swedish standardized norms. However, withdrawn behaviour was significantly higher in all children, social competence was significantly lower in girls, and social activities were significantly lower in older children with upper-limb reduction deficiency. There was a significant difference between prosthetic use groups. Non-users had significantly more delinquent behaviour problems than full-time users. There was an interaction between gender and prosthetic use in their affect on competence and behaviour/emotional problems, yielding two contrasting patterns.
   Conclusion: Children with upper-limb reduction deficiency and a myoelectric prosthetic hand are as well adjusted psychosocially as their able-bodied peers. There are indications, however, of social stigmata related to the deficiency, which have to be considered differently in boys and girls.

AB Many studies have demonstrated that boys are more aggressive than girls (see J. D. Cole & K. Dodge, 1997, for a review) and that emotion regulation difficulties are associated with problematic behaviors (N. Eisenberg & R. A. Fabes, 1999; M. Gilliom, D. S. Shaw, J. E. Beck, M. A. Schonberg, & J. L. Lukon, 2002). However, recent findings indicate that gender differences in aggressive behaviors disappear when assessments are broadened to include relational aggression-behaviors designed to harm the relationship goals of others by spreading rumors, gossiping, and eliciting peer rejection of others. Moreover, although difficulties regulating emotions have been reported for physically aggressive children, little research has examined these processes in relationally aggressive children. This article argues that investigation into the associations between emotion regulation and relational aggression is a critical direction for future research on the etiology and prevention of mental health problems in girls.

AB A substantial number of children in foster care exhibit psychiatric difficulties. Recent epidemiological and historical trends in foster care, clinical findings about the adjustment of children in foster care and adult outcomes are reviewed, followed by a description of current approaches to treatment and extant empirical support. Available interventions for these children can be categorized as either symptom-focused or systemic, with empirical support for specific methods ranging from scant to substantial. Even with treatment, behavioral and emotional problems often persist into adulthood resulting in poor functional outcomes. We suggest that self-regulation may be an important mediating factor in the appearance of emotional and behavioral disturbance in these children.

AB The goal of this study was to examine some of the mechanisms underlying emotion regulation in childhood affective disorders by examining the impact of distracting emotional information during performance on a working memory task ("Emotional n-back" or E-n-back). The sample included 75 children (38 girls and 37 boys) between 8 and 16 years of age meeting criteria for: Anxiety disorder (ANX, n = 17), Major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 16), Comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD, n = 24), or Low-risk normal control (LRNC, n = 18). Results showed that the MDD and CAD groups had significantly longer reaction times on negative emotional backgrounds compared to neutral backgrounds, whereas the LRNC group had significantly longer reaction times on positive backgrounds. These results suggest altered processing of emotional information particularly associated with depression. Because the E-n-back task engages higher-order cognitive processes, these results suggest that these alterations in processing emotional information also interfere with the cognitive processes that govern how attentional resources are allocated. Further, research is needed to replicate this study and delineate underlying neural mechanisms.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the severity of behavioral and emotional problems among adolescents with poor and typical single word reading ability (N = 188) recruited from public schools and followed for a median of 2.4 years. Youth and parents were repeatedly assessed to obtain information regarding the severity and course of symptoms (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, aggression, delinquent behaviors, inattention), controlling for demographic variables and diagnosis of ADHD. After adjustment for demographic variables and ADHD, poor readers reported higher levels of depression, trait anxiety, and somatic complaints than typical readers, but there were no differences in reported self-reported delinquent or aggressive behaviors. Parent reports indicated no differences in depression, anxiety or aggression between the two groups but indicated more inattention, somatic complaints, and delinquent behaviors for the poor readers. School and health professionals should carefully assess youth with poor reading for behavioral and emotional symptoms and provide services when indicated.

AB Background: This study examined the impact of family transitions, that is, parental separation, divorce, remarriage and death, upon the lives of Australian children and adolescents in a longitudinal study of temperament and development. Methods: Using longitudinal and concurrent questionnaire data, outcomes for young people experiencing transitions were compared with those of a random comparison group whose biological parents remained together. Results: No significant group differences were found with regard to behavioural and emotional adjustment concurrently or across time, nor on academic outcomes and social competence. Significant differences between the groups were revealed in measures of parent-teen conflict and parent-child attachment. A number of gender differences were found, with female participants displaying both greater adaptive and maladaptive behaviours. Particular dimensions of temperament, as well as the parent's overall rating of their child as easy or difficult, were found to be important predictors of adjustment status for both transitions and comparison groups. Conclusions: Despite some methodological limitations, this study illustrated the resilience of children experiencing family disruption across childhood and adolescence.

AB This study prospectively investigated the influence of antenatal maternal anxiety, measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory at 12-22, 23-31 and 32-40 postmenstrual weeks of pregnancy, on cognitive functioning in 57 adolescents (mean age 15 years). ANCOVAs showed effects of State anxiety at 12-22 weeks, after controlling for influences of State anxiety in later pregnancy and postnatal maternal Trait anxiety. Adolescents of high anxious pregnant women reacted impulsively in the Encoding task; they responded faster but made more errors than adolescents of low anxious women. They also scored lower on two administered WISC-R subtests. In the Stop task no differences in inhibiting ongoing responses were found between adolescents of high and low anxious pregnant women. We suspect that high maternal anxiety in the first half of pregnancy may negatively affect brain development of the fetus, reflected by impulsivity and lower WISC-R scores at 14-15 years.

AB This preliminary study examined intervention effects of a universal prevention program offered by classroom teachers to public elementary school students. The Unique Minds School Program (M.B. Stern, 1999) is a teacher-led program designed to promote cognitive-social-emotional (CSE) skills, including student self-efficacy, problem solving, social-emotional competence, and a positive classroom climate, with the dual goal of preventing youth behavioral problems and promoting academic learning. During 2 consecutive school years, 119 students and their teachers were assessed in the fall and spring of Grade 4 and again in the spring of Grade 5. As compared to students in the comparison school, students in the intervention showed gains in student self-efficacy, problem solving, social -emotional competencies, and math grades. Incremental gains within CSE domains were found after I and 2 years of intervention. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OUTCOMES; QUESTIONNAIRE; DISABILITY; ISSUES
AB Study design: Prospective multidimensional study by means of: (1) clinical assessment, (2) parental-administered questionnaire for general health (CHQ-PF50), and (3) standardised disability measurements.
   Objectives: To assess the health-related quality of life (QoL) and disability in children with spina bifida (SB) and to correlate them with the clinical picture and our previous study on adolescents with SB.
   Setting: SB Centre at a University Hospital in Italy.
   Methods: A total of 29 consecutive children with SB (mean age 11.4, range 4-14 years) were evaluated through Child Health Questionnaire Parental Form (CHQ-PF50), the FIM instrument, and the Barthel index.
   Results: Disability was inversely related only (r = 0.49; P = 0.007) to the physical aspect of the QoL of children. Similarly, the disability was inversely related (r = 0.37; P = 0.005) to the emotional aspect of QoL of patient's parents. Unexpectedly, for the mental aspects of QoL of patients, major disability was not associated with higher psychological distress and severe role disability due to emotional problems. At clinical examination, findings especially for continence and number of catheterisations were usually related to deterioration of physical aspects of QoL (r = 2.28; P = 0.02) in children.
   Conclusion: The multiperspective assessment showed that there is a linear inverse correlation between disability and QoL in children with SB only for physical aspects. Conversely, there is linear inverse correlation between disability and QoL in patient's parents regarding only emotional aspects. Moreover, this study provided useful information for clinical practice underlining that continence problems are those that most affect QoL in children with SB and their parents.

AB Objectives. The objective was to evaluate the relationship between self- and informant-rated symptoms of ADHD and performance on neuropsychological tests of attention and impulsivity (Letter Cancellation Test [LCT], Continuous Performance Test [CPT] and Matching Familiar Figures test [MFF]).
   Design. Participants were clinical referrals for assessment of ADHD in adulthood and healthy controls.
   Method. ADHD adults were compared with individuals with mild psychiatric disorders (including attention problems), a healthy control group on neuropsychological measures of attention (CPT and LCT) and on impulsivity (MFF). Secondly, the scores obtained on these measures were correlated with the Young ADHD Questionnaire-S (YAQ-S) and Young ADHD Questionnaire-I (YAQ-1) self- and informant-reported scales of ADHD symptomatology, emotional problems, delinquency, and social functioning.
   Results. The ADHD group were more impaired than the healthy controls on neuropsychological measures, but only the MFF differentiated them from the psychiatric controls. Tests of attentional control positively correlated with the self-reported functioning of the ADHD group but not among the psychiatric or normal controls. There was a positive correlation between tests of attention (but not impulsivity) and self-ratings of ADHD symptomatology for the ADHD group, suggesting that ADHD adults are better at recognizing attentional problems than impulse control. A positive correlation was found between the Delinquency scale and a test of impulsivity for the ADHD group only.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that there are neuropsychological underpinnings of the ADHD syndrome but neuropsychological tests may discriminate poorly between ADHD and mild psychiatric disorders. ADHD adults may be more reliable informants of adult functioning than their parents, although they may underreport impulsive behaviour.

   Aims To examine the reliability and validity of a Q-sort instrument-for assessing adolescent personality pathology designed for clinically experienced informants.
   Method A sample of 294 randomly selected psychiatrists and psychologists each provided-data on a current patient, aged 14-18 years. Clinicians completed several measures, including the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure for Adolescents (SWAP-200-A).
   Results, Factor analysis identified 11 diimensions of adolescent personality. psychopathology/malignant narcissism, dysphoria/inhibition, psychological health, histrionic sexualisation, schizotypy, sexual conflict, emotional dysregulation, anxious obsessionality, peer rejection, delinquent behaviour and attentional dysregulation. These correlated in,predicted ways with a range of criterion variables, including measures of adaptive functioning, Axis II pathology, the Five Factor Model and the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Conclusions The SWAP-200-A shows promise as an instrument for asses sing personality pathology in adolescents. Trait dimensions such as delinquent behaviour and emotional dysregulation may prove useful additions to a classification of personality

AB Within-family covariation between interparental hostility and adolescent behavior across three interactions over a 2-year period was explored in a sample that included 37 typical adolescents and 35 adolescents recently hospitalized for psychiatric difficulties. More interparental hostility across the three interactions was associated with more adolescent hostility and more positive engagement (at a trend level) regardless of psychiatric background. Parent-to-child hostility in each interaction mediated the link for adolescent hostility but not for positive adolescent engagement. Emotion regulation capacities and age were linked to variability in adolescents' behavior in the presence of interparental conflict. In interactions with more interparental hostility, adolescents with greater capacity to tolerate negative affect were more likely to show increased positive engagement, and adolescents who were better able to modulate their emotional expression were less likely to show increased hostility. Covariation between interparental and adolescent hostility across the three family interactions decreased as the adolescent aged. These findings are consistent with the theory that exposure to inter-parental hostility is emotionally disequilibrating, and that adolescent responses may reflect differences in emotion regulation and other developmentally based capacities. Gender and variations across families in overall levels of hostile parenting were also linked with adolescent behavior in the presence of interparental hostility.

AB This study examined whether attachment theory could be used to shed light on the often high degree of discordance between self- and observer ratings of behavioral functioning and symptomatology. Interview-based assessments of attachment organization, using the Adult Attachment Interview, were examined as predictors of the lack of agreement between self- and other reports of behavioral and emotional problems among 176 moderately at-risk adolescents. Lack of agreement was measured in terms of concordance of adolescent and parent or close friend report on equivalent measures of behavioral and emotional adjustment. Insecure-dismissing attachment was linked to less agreement in absolute terms between self- and mother reports of externalizing symptoms, and between adolescent and close friend reports of behavioral conduct. Insecure-preoccupied attachment was associated with higher levels of adolescent reporting of internalizing and externalizing symptoms relative to parent reports of adolescent symptornatology. The findings suggest that attachment organization may be one factor that accounts for individual differences in the degree of discordance between self- and other reports of symptoms in adolescence.

AB Objective: The current study investigated psychosocial correlates of abnormal adolescent eating behavior at three times during adolescence and young adulthood and its association with psychiatric diagnosis in young adulthood in a community sample.
   Method: Sixty-four (10.5%) high-risk subjects (mean age 15 years) with abnormal eating behavior were identified at Time 1, another 252 (16.9%) were identified at Time 2 (mean age 16.2 years), and 164 (16.9%) were identified at Time 3 (mean age 19.7 years) and compared with three control groups matched for age and gender. Dependent measures included emotional and behavioral problems, life events, coping capacities, self-related cognition, social network, and family functions. Outcome was measured additionally by structured psychiatric interviews, and stability of abnormal eating behavior was studied in a longitudinal sample of 330 subjects.
   Results: Few subjects showed more than one of five criteria of abnormal eating behavior. High-risk subjects shared a very similar pattern at all three times. They were characterized by higher scores for emotional and behavioral problems, more life events including more negative impact, less active coping, lower self-esteem, and less family cohesion. Among 10 major psychiatric disorders, only clinical eating disorders at Time 3 shared a significant association with abnormal eating disorder at the same time whereas high-risk status at Times 1 and 2 did not predict any psychiatric disorder at Time 3. Stability of abnormal eating behavior across time was very low. Stability of abnormal eating behavior across time was very low.
   Discussion: Abnormal eating behavior in adolescence and young adulthood is clearly associated with various indicators of psychosocial maladaption. in adolescence, it does not significantly predict any psychiatric disorder including eating disorder in young adulthood and it is predominantly a transient feature.

ID MIDDLE SCHOOL; SELF-WORTH; AGGRESSION
AB This study investigated an integrative model of the effects of peer victimization (PV) and peer rejection (PR) on youth adjustment using data from 508 middle-school students. In the proposed model, PV and PR each contribute independently to problems in emotional, behavioral, and academic adjustment. The adverse consequences of PV and PR are each mediated by their more proximal contributions to lower self-esteem in the form of negative self-evaluations for peer relations and global self-derogation, respectively. Results of structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses provided support for the overall model, including significant indirect linkages of PV and perceived PR with adjustment problems via their intermediary negative associations with lower levels of self-esteem. Additional analyses revealed that indirect linkages of victimization and perceived rejection with emotional problems via self-esteem were evident only for girls. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The authors examined the developmental course of self-regulation in a cohort of children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The longitudinal sample included 646 children (48% girls; 52% boys; 36.2% Black, 23.4% Hispanic, 40.4% White) who were 4 to 5 years old in 1986 and who were followed up at ages 8 to 9 and ages 12 to 13. Levels of self-regulation (assessed with 12 maternal-report items that measured regulation of affect, behavior, attention) increased from early childhood (when sample children were 4 or 5 years old) to middle childhood (ages 8 or 9), but not from middle childhood to early adolescence (ages 12 or 13). Girls exhibited significantly higher levels of self-regulation than did boys at all 3 time points. Individual differences in self-regulation were fairly stable across the 8-year span (rs = .47 to .50). Comparisons of 1-, 2-, and 3-factor models suggested that the different aspects of self-regulation are highly interrelated, and support adoption of a single-factor model for both genders. The authors discuss implications of these findings for theory and intervention.

AB The primary purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of a program designed to improve adolescents' relationships with at least one teacher in an urban high school. All participating students were nominated by teachers as having significant emotional and behavioral problems and approximately half of these youth were randomly assigned to an intervention that included increased positive involvement between each student and one teacher within the school. Teacher ratings of students' social, behavioral, emotional, and academic adjustment at pre- and post-intervention indicated that students in the intervention group had higher grade point averages than did students in the control group following the 5-month intervention but no differences were observed on other variables. Challenges associated with conducting school-based, relationship-focused interventions in high-poverty urban environments and several lessons that were learned in the process of initiating this project are discussed.

AB Background. Disasters are believed to have large effects on the mental health of adolescents but the lack of prospective pre- and post-disaster data on affected and control populations have limited our knowledge on the validity of these claims. We examined the medium-term, 12 months' effects of a severe disaster on the mental health of adolescents, and compared them to effects after 5 months.
   Method. A cafe fire in The Netherlands injured 250 adolescents and killed 14. We obtained data 15 months before and 12 months after the disaster about behavioural and emotional problems (using the Youth Self-Report) and substance misuse, in 124 students of an affected school of whom 31 were present at the fire (response 77(.)5%) and 830 other students (56(.)4%); mean age at baseline, 13(.)8 years.
   Results. We found differences between students from the affected school and others for excessive use of alcohol (odds ratio 3(.)42, 95 % confidence interval 2(.)00-5(.)85, p < 0(.)0001), but not for behavioural and emotional problems and use of other substances. Effects had decreased compared to those after 5 months.
   Conclusions. In the long run, the effects of disaster decrease regarding self-reported behavioural and emotional problems, but they remain regarding alcohol misuse among those present at the disaster, and their peers.

AB Aim To estimate the frequency, type, and severity of psychological trauma among Bosnian refugee adolescents during the process of repatriation after the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   Methods A sample of 239 pupils (120 girls and 119 boys), with a mean age (+/- standard deviation) of 15.2 +/- 2.1 years were assessed for war traumatic events, acculturation and repatriation maladjustments, school behavioral problems, and presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The sample consisted of adolescents who were in the process of repatriation after exile in a foreign country (n = 120) and internally displaced adolescents,(n = 119).
   Results Adolescents who had been exposed to severe psychological war trauma still had high level of trauma more than three years after the end of war. The level of recalling traumas they experienced (mean standard deviation = 3.9 +/- 1.2 on a scale from 0 to 5) and frequency of PTSD symptoms (1.5 +/- 1.0 on a scale from 0-5) were significantly lower among repatriated than internally displaced adolescents (4.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.2 +/- 1.1, respectively; P < 0.001). The prevalence of PTSD did not differ between repatriated (56.7%) and internally displaced adolescents (68.1%). Returnees with more acculturation problems reported more functional and relational problems after return but less psycho-emotional dysfunctions. Those who adapted to the culture in the exile country had difficulties in adapting back to the culture in the home country.
   Conclusions PTSD was still very frequent among Bosnian refugee adolescents 3.5 years after the end of war. Adolescents who had spent more than five years as refugees in foreign countries had significantly lower level of experienced trauma recall and frequency of PTSD symptoms, as well as less anxious/depressed and withdrawn/depressed behavioral problems, and somatic complaints. Returnees who had more acculturation problems in exile reported more functional and relational problems but less psycho-emotional problems after repatriation. Schools and other institutions involved in the education of adolescents should develop programs to;,address these issues.

AB Parent ratings of behavior problems in childhood show substantial genetic influence and modest shared environmental influence. However, few studies have compared these results to teacher ratings and no previous studies have compared same-teacher ratings to different-teacher ratings. 3,714 7-year-old twin pairs in the Twins Early Development Study were rated by parents and teachers on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Substantial heritability and negligible shared environmental influence were found for data from all three raters for total behavior problems, hyperactivity, prosocial behavior, peer problems, conduct problems, and emotional symptoms. Sex-limitation models revealed similar results for males and females, although there was some evidence for greater heritability for boys, especially when twins were rated by the same teacher.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL SEPARATION; ATTACHMENT; MODEL; CLARITY; ANXIETY
AB The objective of this study was to test our alternative interpretation of the separation-individuation hypothesis. This interpretation states that separation from the parents is not a precondition for individuation, but rather separation and individuation are two parallel processes of development during adolescence. We investigated our interpretation in two ways. Firstly, we looked at descriptive age differences in parental support and development of relational and societal identity. Secondly, we investigated the variation with age of the associations between parental support and emotional adjustment, and identity and emotional adjustment. Data of a representative Dutch sample of 2814 adolescents, aged 12-24 were used. In both cases, the findings supported our interpretation of the separation-individuation hypothesis and similar results were found in the descriptive analyses and the structural equation models. Parental support decreased with age, and so too did its association with emotional adjustment. In other words, as adolescents become older, they experience less parental support, while its importance for their emotional adjustment also declines. The opposite pattern was observed with respect to identity development: as adolescents become older, their relational and societal identity commitments develop, and the degree to which these commitments are developed also becomes more important for their emotional adjustment.

AB A two-year prospective study (n = 82) examined the extent to which adolescents' attributional style for p er-related events predicts socio-emotional adjustment. Peer-social attributions were assessed using rating scales on three dimensions (locus, stability, and globality). Three attributional composites were derived: two generality scales measured the extent to which positive and negative events were attributed to stable and/or global factors, while the locus composite indicated the relative absence of a self-serving bias. Outcome measures at both time points were loneliness, victimisation, and depression. Controlling for Time I adjustment, longitudinal analyses revealed no significant predictive relations between the attributional variables and Time 2 adjustment variables. However, a post hoc analysis revealed that a combined generality composite (i.e. attribution of both positive and negative events to stable/global factors) predicted depression and loneliness despite not being concurrently associated with these variables. This finding raises the possibility that attributional style in this domain may have unique associations with emotional adjustment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative review was conducted of cross-national studies on peer-directed aggression to determine whether cross-national differences in aggression could be predicted from differences in national values. Cross-national differences on dimensions of cultural-level values derived from the works of Hofstede 11980, 19831, Bond [Chinese Culture Connection, 1987], and Schwartz 119941 were used to predict effect sizes of cross-national differences in aggression for 185 comparisons between pairs of cultures from a total of 36 studies. Each of the three classification systems of national values were found to predict differences in aggression, providing support for their use in future studies. In general, cultures characterized by collectivistic values, high moral discipline, a high level of egalitarian commitment, low uncertainty avoidance, and which emphasize values that are heavily Confucian showed lower levels of aggression than their counterparts.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a newly designed psychosocial treatment program for war traumatized child and adolescent refugees. The program was designed to reduce emotional distress and improve psychosocial functioning.
   Method: Ten young Kosovan refugees (mean age 13.3 years) residing in Germany participated in the manual based intervention program. This multimodal program consists of individual, family and group sessions using a psychoeducational approach beside trauma and grief focusing activities, creative techniques and relaxation. Kind and severity of traumatic experiences were gathered by interviewing the child and their caretakers using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Psychiatric diagnoses (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, K-SADS) were assessed prior to the intervention. Post-traumatic symptomatology (HTQ), emotional problems (Diagnostic System for Psychological Disorders, DYSIPS) and the overall psychosocial functioning (Child Global Assessment Scale, CGAS) were assessed before and after the 12-week intervention.
   Results: Following the intervention the degree of overall psychosocial functioning increased substantially in 9 of 10 participants. Furthermore, post-traumatic, anxiety and depressive symptoms were reduced significantly. The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses fell from 60% to 30%. The number of patients with PTSD and a high rate of comorbid symptoms (depression and anxiety) as well as a history of severe traumatization remained at 30%.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the psychosocial treatment program specified for war traumatized adolescents may be useful for the relief of psychiatric sequelae and for an improvement in overall psychosocial functions, but not for the subgroup of severely traumatized patients with complex psychiatric disturbances.

AB Background: Attenuated amplitude of the P300 wave has been frequently documented in youths at high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). This investigation bad two aims: 1) determine whether P300 amplitude in late childhood is a predictor of SUD outcome by age 19; and 2) evaluate whether neurobehavior disinhibition (ND) mediates this association.
   Methods: Boys (aged 10-12) were recruited through proband biological fathers with either a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis of SUD (N = 67) or no adult psychiatric disorder (N = 94). P300 amplitude was recorded during an auditory oddball task. Neurobehavior disinhibition was evaluated using tests of executive cognitive function, behavior undercontrol, and emotion dysregulation. The relationship is assessed using multiple and logistic regressions.
   Results: Substance use disorder by age 19 was significantly predicted by P300 amplitude (odds ratio [OR] = .958; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .918-.999; Wald chi(2) = 3.992; df = 1; p = .045) and ND score (OR = 1.060; 95% CI = 1.023-1.098; Wald chi(2) 10.267; df = 1; p = .0014) measured at age 10 to 12. P300 amplitude also significantly correlated with ND severity (beta = -.217; t = -2.412; df = 6,160; p = .017). Low P300 amplitudes were observed in children who succumbed to SUD by age 19.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that ND mediates the association between attenuated P300 amplitude in childhood and SUD at age 19; however, P300 amplitude is not a specific childhood marker of SUD.

AB The study presents the emotional regulation from the perspective of attachment theory. It describes briefly the theoretical concepts of emotional regulation, attachment, inner working model of attachment, respectively, and their mutual interconnection. The inner working model of attachment rise from the integration of internalised experience of individual from early interaction with primary persons. According to the up-to-date research results, the differences in inner model of attachment are significantly related to differences in effectiveness of emotional regulation and furthermore to the individual adaptation. The secure attachment is associated with effective emotional regulation and adequate adaptation. The non-secure organisation of attachment leads to dis-regulation and non-sufficient adaptation of an individual. In this field, the urgent need of further research activity appears. The research results have broad application in supporting the health emotional development of children and adolescents, in psychological counselling and therapy.

AB Improving parental discipline practices is a central target of behavioral parent training programs, but little research has examined how discipline varies as a function of gender. Based on the assumption that socialization practices might be related to gender differences in psychopathology, we examined relations: between parenting and problem behaviors in children. We predicted that parents would be overreactive toward children displaying symptoms inconsistent with gender stereotypes and lax towards those with gender stereotype-consistent behavior. Parents of 112 preschool-aged children reported on their children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and their own lax and overreactive parenting. As hypothesized, internalizing symptoms in girls and externalizing symptoms in boys predicted lax parenting, while externalizing behaviors in girls and internalizing symptoms in boys were associated with overreactive parenting. Exploratory analyses suggest that relations differed somewhat as a function of sociocultural status, pointing to the need for future studies to consider social context.

AB Epilepsy is a common neurological disease, which affects people of all ages. Patients often have deficits regarding their knowledge of epilepsy. Many of them have recurrent seizures, psychosocial, and emotional problems and report restrictions in daily living as a result of their epilepsy. Meanwhile, a variety of psychoeducational programs have been developed with the intention to improve knowledge, coping with epilepsy, quality of life, compliance, and health status.
   This review article discusses the content and designs of formal patient educational programs for persons with epilepsy and reviews their role in improving patient outcomes. A systematic research of medical and psychological literature reveals that a sizeable amount of literature has been produced within the last decade that focuses on (psycho-) educational programs for adults, adolescents, and children with epilepsy as well as their families. These educational programs vary considerably in regard to content, didactic approach, and objectives. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate educational programs from psychological treatments or other interventions (e.g. by specialist epilepsy nurses). Information given about the theoretical frameworks guiding interventions, teaching strategies, and methodological approach of the programs is often sparse or lacking.
   The crucial point is that only very few educational programs have been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, the methods of evaluation (e.g. questionnaires, inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization, follow-up period) vary substantially and sometimes the number of subjects included in the study is too small for sufficient statistical evaluation.
   Overall, from the small number of evaluated programs it is evident that educational programs can improve epilepsy-related knowledge, improve the management of seizures, and reduce misinformation and misconceptions about epilepsy. They can support adults, adolescents, and children with epilepsy and their families and enable them to cope with the disease; they can sometimes also reduce seizure frequency and improve compliance with antiepileptic drugs. The effects on emotional disorders (e.g. depression) and quality of life are less obvious.
   Evaluated or standardized psychoeducational programs are available for specific target groups of patients with epilepsy. The review indicates that it is reasonable to perform or to adapt these educational programs for the benefit of the patients. Future research should focus on controlled evaluation studies of educational programs.

AB Cross-sectional data from 1359 boys and girls aged 10-14 years investigated whether parenting behaviours are directly or indirectly (through building self-control) associated with emotional (depression, stress, low self-esteem) and behavioural (delinquency, aggression) problems among adolescents. Replicating existing findings, both types of problems were directly, negatively related to adaptive parenting behaviour (high parental acceptance, strict control and monitoring, and little use of manipulative psychological control). Extending existing findings, self-control partially mediated the link between parenting behaviour and adolescent emotional and behavioural problems. Contrary to earlier suggestions, there was no sign that high self-control a,as associated with drawbacks or increased risk of psychosocial problems.

AB A study to test the validity of the Urdu version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was carried out in Pakistan. The study population consisted of 212 children aged 4 to 16 years presenting to psychiatric (case group: n = 72) and Paediatric outpatient clinics (comparison group: n = 140). Parents of these children were interviewed using the extended version of the SDQ. The case group was further subjected to diagnostic ICD-10 criteria by child psychiatrists, who were blind to SDQ scores. The Urdu version was able to discriminate between the study groups. The mean difficulties score was higher in the case group (mean = 21-7) than the comparison group (mean = 14.4), the difference (mean difference = 7.3) being statistically significant (p < 0.01, 95% CI = 5.3, 9.3) with an effect size of 1.1. Adequate sensitivity ( >= 61%) was obtained for each type of psychiatric disorder in the case group using the abnormal category of the SDQ symptom scores as a cutoff. A simple 'pencil-and-paper' algorithm combining symptom and impact scores further identified children in need of intervention. A ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve > 0.70 for all scores. The choice of optimal cutoffs for the Urdu version is discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB One way teachers can help adolescents who have learning disabilities and behavioral problems cope with social and emotional problems is through the use of videotherapy. Similar to bibliotherapy, in which students learn through the experiences of characters they read about in books, videotherapy uses videos for the same purpose. In videotherapy, the students identify with the characters in the film with the help of teacher-facilitated dialogue. This article provides a lesson plan featuring the movie Rudy and suggests films with themes relevant to adolescents.

AB This study examined the representation of internal states in childhood recollections of male and female adolescents with and without abuse histories. Participants' (N = 71) exposure to spousal violence, physical abuse, and sexual abuse was documented when they were 6 to 12 years old and 6 years later when they were 12 to 18 years old. At the Year 6 assessment, teens recollected childhood experiences related to positive, negative, and neutral cues. Recollections were coded for references to emotions, cognitions, perceptions, and physiological states. Emotion terms varied according to childhood abuse history, whereas other internal states language did not. Teens with childhood abuse histories used fewer emotion terms than other teens but only for memories related to conflict and punishment. Emotion terms were unrelated to depression measured at the second assessment, regardless of abuse history. Explanations for abuse-related patterns of emotional language and possible links to coping and emotion regulation are discussed.

AB Background Over the past decade, increased attention has been paid to identifying and responding to the emotional and behavioural needs of children and adolescents with intellectual disability (ID). The aims of the present study were to add to this body of knowledge by identifying factors associated with emotional and behavioural needs among a sample of children with ID drawn from a large urban conurbation.
   Method Information was collected by postal questionnaire (or interview for family carers who did not have English as their first language) from teachers and from family carers of 615 children administratively identified as having ID (47% of all children with ID).
   Results Results indicated that: (1) the administrative prevalence of moderate but not severe ID was associated with social deprivation whereas the prevalence of severe but not moderate ID appeared to be associated with ethnicity; (2) 54% of children scored above the threshold on the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC)-primary family carer, and 37% of children scored above the threshold on the DBC-teacher; (3) social deprivation, male gender, less severe ID and having fewer physical or sensory impairments were associated with antisocial and disruptive behaviour; and (4) more severe ID and additional impairments were associated with anxiety, communication disturbance, social relating and self-absorbed behaviours.
   Conclusions These results identify a range of risk factors associated with behavioural and emotional problems experienced by children with ID.

AB Self-report measures of psychosocial maturity and screening measures of achievement and intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI) were used to investigate the influence of psychosocial maturity on male juvenile offenders' comprehension and appreciation of the Miranda warning (Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding and Appreciation of Miranda Rights; GUAM). A sample of 67 male juvenile offenders, placed in a short-term detention facility or juvenile boot camp facility, participated in the study. Demographic differences revealed that youths in short-term detention were approximately one year older than boot camp youths. The two groups did not differ in IQ or measures of psychosocial maturity. Detention youths had GUAM subtest scores that were slightly higher than, but comparable to, those of boot camp youths. Consistent with previous research, verbal IQ correlated positively with GUAM subtest scores and was a significant predictor of all four scores after controlling for setting and age in a series of hierarchical regressions. In addition, the psychosocial maturity factor of Responsibility was a significant predictor of two GUAM subtests (CMR and FRI), while the Temperance and Perspective factors were not.

   REDUCTASE
AB Relatively little attention has been focused on mechanisms related to neural plasticity and drug abuse in adolescence, compared with abundant research using adult animal models. As smoking is typically initiated in adolescence, an important question to address is whether the adolescent brain responds differently to nicotine compared with the adult. To investigate this question, we examined the expression of a number of early response genes (arc, c-fos and NGFI-B) that have been implicated in synaptic plasticity and addiction, following acute nicotine in adolescent and adult rats. Baseline expression of arc and c-fos was higher in adolescent brains compared with adults. Following acute nicotine treatment (0.1, 0.4 mg/kg), we found a marked induction of arc mRNA in the prefrontal cortex of nicotine-treated adolescents compared with a less pronounced increase of arc in the adult. c-fos and NGFI-B were also upregulated by nicotine, but not in an age-related manner. In contrast, nicotine induced less arc, c-fos, and NGFI-B expression in the somatosensory cortex of adolescents compared with adults. A fourth gene, quinoid dihydropteridine reductase was expressed at lower levels in white matter of the adolescent forebrain compared with the adult, but was not affected by nicotine. These results suggest that in adolescence, the activity of specific early response genes is higher in brain regions critical for emotional regulation and decision-making. Further, nicotine affects key plasticity molecules in these areas in a manner different from the adult. Thus, adolescence may represent a neurobiologically vulnerable period with regard to nicotine exposure. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

AB Assessment of quality of life (QoL) has thus far been a neglected approach in describing psychological adaptation in siblings of seriously ill children. The present results concern differences and correspondences between parent- and child-reported QoL in siblings of pediatric cancer patients, at 1 month and 2 years after the diagnosis in the ill child. A total of 83 Siblings aged 7-18 participated in the study at 1 month after the diagnosis; 57 of these siblings (69%) participated in follow-up assessment 24 months later. The parent and child form of the TNO-AZL Children's Quality of Life questionnaire (TACQoL) and the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) were used to assess QoL and behavioral problems in siblings. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to assess parent mental health. Mean differences, correspondences between informants, and partial correlations with parent mental health were assessed at both measurement informants, and partial correlations with parent mental health were assessed at both measurement occasions. Correspondence between parent and child was low to moderate for most domains at both assessments. Low agreement was observed on several domains in our study group compared to reference data. Young siblings (ages 7-11) reported significantly more physical and motor problems at 1 and 24 months and less positive emotions at 24 months than their parents. Adolescent siblings reported more physical complaints at 1 month and more emotional and behavior problems (YSR) at both assessments, but also reported higher social QoL than their parents at 24 months. Parent psychological distress was negatively correlated with parent-reported physical QoL in the sibling. The findings suggest that siblings of children with cancer experience a more serious burden from the illness than is perceived by the parents. Physical complaints and emotional problems remain mostly unnoticed, although distressed parents are more focused on the child's physical health. These results imply that assessment of self-reported well-being is especially relevant in siblings of a critically ill child, to obtain a realistic image of siblings' QoL. Further studies on sibling QoL are needed.

AB Objectives: This study examined the relationship of community-level stressors to behavioral and emotional problems among African-American and white children with special health care needs. Methods: The authors interviewed 257 low-income caregivers of children with special health care needs in an urban Midwestern city who brought their child for a primary health care visit to a community health center between September 2001 and May 2002. Sociodemographic characteristics as well as information about the childrens behavioral and emotional problems, the health status of the children, perceptions of urban community stress, access to health care, and satisfaction with health care were collected to determine racial differences in the impact of urban stress on behavioral and emotional problems. Results: Urban community stressors, race, and child's health status were significantly associated with behavioral and emotional problems among children with special health care needs. The association between urban stress and total behavioral problems did not differ by race. Conclusions: When caring for children with special health care needs, especially those with emotional or behavioral problems, primary care providers may be better able to identify important aggravating factors if they also assess urban stress. Systems of care are needed that can assist in addressing urban community-level stressors.

AB Objective: Data from a nationwide child mental health survey were analyzed to examine relationships between asthma and psychological adjustment. Methods: Survey design with random selection based on national computer records of 10,438 children aged 5 to 15 from 12,529 eligible families (83%). Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was completed by parents, teachers, and 11- to 17-year-olds, providing scores for total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, social behavior, and total impact. The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) generated ICD-10 diagnoses. Parents reported physical disorders and disabilities, other child mental health risk factors, and rated child's general level of health. Results: Children with organic conditions other than asthma were excluded, leaving 9,834 children, 49.9% male. Preliminary comparisons indicated higher parent and teacher rated scores for children with asthma. New variables combined asthma and general health to produce four groups. Logistic regressions were conducted with children without asthma and in good health as the reference group. Children with asthma in good health showed greater parent-rated emotional problems, but otherwise, few elevated odds ratios. Children without asthma in poor health were at significantly greater risk of disorder, as were children with asthma in poor health. Findings on ratings of hyperactivity are discussed. Conclusion: Findings that children with asthma have elevated psychological difficulties may result from poor health rather than asthma itself.

AB Current tools for assessing children's social behavior in school psychology research and practice typically do not adequately measure issues most salient for young girls (e.g., experiences of relational victimization). The relation among teacher, peer, and self-reports of relational and physical peer victimization was examined for 119 fourth grade boys (n = 58) and girls (n = 61) as part of a larger, longitudinal study. Girls were more likely to be victims of relationally aggressive acts, whereas boys were more often targets of physical victimization. Teacher reports added unique information in the prediction of social-emotional adjustment (acceptance, rejection, internalizing, and externalizing) beyond that accounted for by peer and self-reports. Teacher reports of relational victimization differentially contributed to the prediction of adjustment beyond that accounted for by physical victimization for boys and girls. The need for further research and implications of these findings is discussed.

AB Background We examined the association of area deprivation with the occurrence of psychosocial problems among children aged 4-16 in a representative national sample of children based on standardised measures of parent-reported problems and diagnoses made by doctors and nurses working in child healthcare (child health professionals, CHPs). Methods The study comprised 4480 children aged 4-16 years, eligible for a routine health assessment (response: 90.1%), in 19 Child Healthcare Services across the Netherlands that routinely provided preventive child healthcare to nearly all school-aged children. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). CHPs examined the child and interviewed parents and child during their routine health assessments. Main outcome measures concerned psychosocial problems as reported by parents (i.e. a clinical score on the CBCL) and as identified by CHPs. Results Prevalence rates of psychosocial problems were 8.6% for parent-reported problems and 10.1% for CHP-identified problems. They were much higher in the most deprived third of the areas. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) compared with the least deprived third were 1.93 (1.41-2.64) regarding parent-reported problems and 1.76 (1.30-2.38) regarding CHP-identified problems. Regarding parent reports, associations were slightly stronger for behavioural problems than for emotional problems. Less than a quarter of the area differences could be explained by individual and family characteristics. Conclusions Child psychosocial problems occur more frequently in deprived areas. Both preventive and curative health services should be better equipped for this concentration of child and adolescent morbidity in deprived areas.

A prospective sample was used consisting of 1861 12-13year-olds at 11 secondary schools. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at a follow-up 6 months after the baseline assessment. Findings showed that higher depressive mood, low self-esteem, and low self-efficacy appeared to be related to enhanced levels of smoking in cross-sectional analyses. Short-term longitudinal analyses indicated that depressive mood and self-esteem were only related to the onset of smoking in girls. In three out of four cross-sectional analyses, self-efficacy x emotional adjustment interactions revealed that in particular adolescents with low levels of self-efficacy and low levels of emotional adjustment are likely to smoke.

AB Peers are conceived of as valid and reliable informants. This may explain why there is no evaluated German questionnaire to assess the ratings of adolescent behavior by peers. To fill this gap, we translated the Adjustment Scales for Sociometric Evaluation of Secondary-School Students (ASSESS) by Prinz, Swan, Liebert, Weintraub, and Neale (1978) and evaluated them on a sample of 301 adolescents. Five factors were extracted that explained about 67% of the variance. The internal consistencies (Cronbachs Alpha) of the 34 item enclosing ASSESS-D ranges between alpha =.81 and .95. Retest reliability assessed after 3 weeks ranges between r =.75 and .95. Correlations with externalising problems are predominantly in agreement with expectations, while no important connections to internalising problems could be observed. Analyses of variance showed the expected differences between gender, age and type of school. The German version of the ASSESS seems to be an economical and reliable instrument for recording the behavior of adolescents by peers.

AB Background: In the German speaking countries there is a significant lack of behavioral checklists for the assessment of children with profound developmental delay, most notably mental retardation.
   Objective: The Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) is an internationally widely used procedure for the assessment of behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents with significant developmental delays. The DBC was translated into German and standardized based on data from a large sample of N = 721 children and adolescents with mental retardation in Germany. Psychometric properties were also assessed.
   Methods: Psychometric analyses included various checks of both validity and reliability. Before constructing norm tables the effects of age, gender, and severity of mental retardation were controlled. Results: The 5 factors of the DBC were replicated for the German version (VFE). Internal consistency coefficients were good to excellent for 4 of the 5 subscales. Retest reliability after a long time interval of 1.8 years was very high. The resulting norm tables consider severity of mental retardation.
   Conclusions: The WE as a German version of the DBC represents a well constructed checklist of behavioral and developmental problems for children and adolescents with significant developmental delay that has adequate psychometric properties and German norms.

AB Aim To determine whether adolescent alcohol use and/or other adolescent health risk behaviour predisposes to alcohol dependence in young adulthood.
   Design Seven-wave cohort study over 6 years.
   Participant A community sample of almost two thousand individuals followed from ages 14-15 to 20-21 years.
   Outcome measure Diagnostic and Statistical Manual volume IV (DSM-IV) alcohol dependence in participants aged 20-21 years and drinking three or more times a week.
   Findings Approximately 90% of participants consumed alcohol by age 20 years, 4.70% fulfilling DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria. Alcohol dependence in young adults was preceded by higher persisting teenage rates of frequent drinking [odds ratio (OR) 8.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2, 16], binge drinking (OR 6.7, 95% CI 3.6, 12), alcohol-related injuries (OR 4.5 95% Cl 1.9, 11), intense drinking (OR 4.8, 95% Cl 2.6, 8.7), high dose tobacco use (OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.3, 13) and antisocial behaviour (OR 5.9, 95% CI 3.3, 11). After adjustment for other teenage predictors frequent drinking (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2, 7.7) and antisocial behaviour (OR 2.4, 95% Cl 1.2, 5.1) held persisting independent associations with later alcohol dependence. There were no prospective associations found with emotional disturbance in adolescence.
   Conclusion Teenage drinking patterns and other health risk behaviours in adolescence predicted alcohol dependence in adulthood. Prevention and early intervention initiatives to reduce longer-term alcohol-related harm therefore need to address the factors, including alcohol supply, that influence teenage consumption and in particular high-risk drinking patterns.

AB Objective. Children of cancer patients may go through a distressing time. The aim of this review was to survey present knowledge on the impact of parental cancer on children and the family.
   Design. Studies published between January 1980 and March 2004 addressing emotional, social, behavioural, cognitive and physical functioning of children of a parent diagnosed with cancer, as well as the association with child, parental and familial variables were reviewed.
   Results. Fifty-two studies were found. Emotional problems in school-aged children (less than or equal to 11 years) were reported in several qualitative studies, but in only one quantitative study. Quantitative and qualitative studies reported anxiety and depression in adolescents (greater than or equal to 12 years), in particular in adolescent daughters of ill mothers. Quantitative studies generally showed no behavioural and social problems in school-aged children and adolescents. One quantitative study found physical complaints in school-aged children. However, qualitative studies revealed behavioural problems in school-aged children and also described restrictions in cognitive and physical functioning in children of all ages. The most consistent variables related to child functioning appeared to be parental psychological functioning, marital satisfaction and family communication. Intervention studies directed to the needs of children and their families reported positive effects.
   Conclusion. While quantitative studies reported especially disturbed emotional functioning, qualitative studies reported problems in all domains of child functioning. Well-designed studies are needed to gain more insight into the psychosocial functioning of children of cancer patients in order to develop tailored care. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of the present longitudinal study was to examine the links between chronicity of maltreatment and child behavioral and emotional problems.
   Method: Forty-nine maltreated children (32 victims of continuous, or chronic, maltreatment; 17 victims of transitory maltreatment) and their mothers were evaluated in their homes three times over a period of 6 years: at the time of recruitment (T1), 3 years following the initial evaluation (T2) and 6 years following the initial evaluation (T3). The home visits were designed to obtain longitudinal assessments of different types of behavioral and emotional problems in the children, and of the mothers' self-reported potential for abuse to help determine the chronic/transitory aspect of the maltreatment situation. Child Protection Services (CPS) files were also consulted at each assessment time in order to obtain more accurate information regarding the chronic/transitory aspect of the maltreatment situation.
   Results: The results show that over time the victims of chronic maltreatment (Chronic group; CH) had significantly more emotional problems (i.e., Anxiety/Depression) than those victims of transitory maltreatment (Transitory group; TR). There was also a tendency for CH children to exhibit more aggressive behavior and social withdrawal problems than the children in the TR group. Furthermore, at T3, the proportion of children in the CH group showing a clinical level of behavior problems in general was significantly higher than in the TR group.
   Conclusions: The study confirms that there are differences among maltreated children in levels of behavior and emotional problems and shows that chronicity must be taken into consideration in order to identify more clearly the impact of maltreatment on the child. Chronically maltreated children appear to be at high-risk for developing clinical levels of problems. The results also suggest that intervention efforts resulting in an improvement of the family situation (i.e., reduction or elimination of maltreatment), also lead to an improvement in the behavior of children.

AB Select research and practice issues that merit further attention are described. Specifically, we argue that the Pathways for profitable research include studies of normative development, assessment and diagnostic considerations, the role of parents, and the ways to optimize the conduct and evaluation of treatment. At present, the field is too uninformed about the development of emotions (e.g., anxiety) and emotion regulation, about adolescence and particular vulnerabilities associated with adolescence, and about the longitudinal course of anxiety in youth. Improved measures, as well as a better understanding of and recommended solutions for parent-child disagreements are needed. How do parents maintain distressing anxiety in their children, and what is the optimal role for parents in the treatment Of anxious children? The role of parents may vary across development, and there may be differential advantages and disadvantages for younger children, middle-aged children, and adolescents, and for the different types of anxiety disorders. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy is a probably efficacious treatment, and well on its way to becoming a well-established treatment, much more information is needed about the potential role of medications and the merits of enhancing the therapeutic alliance. Our discussion focuses on mapping the further evolution and maturation of the field of child anxiety.

AB Development of the psychosomatic problems picky eating and headache and stomachache complaints in middle childhood was investigated from an emotion regulation perspective. The role of negative emotionality and family emotion regulatory factors (attachment to mother and parental perceived control) was studied. The sample (N = 87) was a predominantly middleclass, community sample. The study was longitudinal, based on data from several data collections between child age 11 months and 9 years. The results showed that headache and stomachache complaints were mainly predicted by early negative emotionality, and picky eating by the family factors. More negative emotionality, insecure attachment and less perceived control were related to more psychosomatic problems in linear and interaction models. The findings were interpreted as showing that by considering emotion regulation, a fruitful perspective for understanding the development of psychosomatic problems could be elaborated.

AB This study examined emotion management skills in addition to the role of emotional intensity and self-efficacy in emotion regulation in 26 children with anxiety disorders (ADs) ages 8 to 12 years and their counterparts without any form of psychopathology. Children completed the Children's Emotion Management Scales (CEMS) and Emotion Regulation Interview (ERI), and mothers reported on their children's emotion regulation using the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC). Results indicated that children who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (4th ed., American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for an anxiety disorder had difficulty managing worried, sad, and anger experiences, potentially due to their report of experiencing emotions with high intensity and having little confidence in their ability to regulate this arousal. These findings indicate that emotion regulation needs to be considered centrally in research with anxious populations.

AB Research has consistently shown low to moderate correlations between parent and teacher reports on children's behavioral problems in Western samples. Little is known about the agreement between parent and teacher reports on behavioral problems among Chinese children. The authors examined the agreement on behavioral and emotional problems in a community sample of 2836 Chinese children aged 6 to 11 years from Mainland China. Children's behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Consistent with most previous studies in Western samples, our results indicated that parent-teacher agreement was low to moderate for attention, externalizing, and internalizing problems. Parent-teacher agreement was higher for attention and externalizing problems than for internalizing problems and decreased with increased behavioral problems. Child's gender, age, and academic performance and father's age were correlated with parent-teacher agreement on ratings of behavioral problems.

AB Parent-reported problem behaviors of 94 children with visual and auditory disabilities, attending elementary regular schools, were compared with problems reported in a general population sample of nondisabled children. Both samples were matched by means of a pairwise matching procedure, taking into account age and sex. Problem behavior was measured by Achenbach's (1991) CBCL (Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 and 1991 Profile, University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT). No significant main effects of type, degree, and nature of disability were found on the CBCL Total Problems scale, nor on the syndrome scales. In general, children with sensory disabilities attending elementary regular schools did not show more problems in comparison to nondisabled children. Merely on the Social Problems scale there was a significant difference between both samples, the children with sensory disabilities getting higher scores than their nondisabled peers. Further, children with sensory disabilities ran considerable risks of developing deviant scores on the Social Problems and the Thought Problems syndromes, the odds being respectively 3.2 and 5.2 times higher than in the general population sample. To optimize the benefits from placement in integrated classrooms for children with sensory disabilities, school counselors and teachers should not only focus on the academic achievements of these children, but also on their social skills and peer sociometric status.

AB Relations between adolescent violence exposure, daily stress, and psychological outcome were examined. Parent/adolescent dyads (N = 80) completed questionnaires, which included parent ratings of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems and adolescent self-ratings of emotional adjustment. Severity of daily stress moderated the relation between levels of violence exposure and extent of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems. The relation was significant at higher levels of daily stress, but nonsignificant at lower levels of stress. In contrast, daily stress did not emerge its a moderator in the relation between violence exposure and adolescent emotional adjustment. Results suggest that adolescents experiencing high levels of violence exposure and daily stress should be considered at great risk for poor psychological outcome.

AB Purpose of review This paper focuses on socio-emotional problems in early schizophrenia. According to recent empirical studies, difficulties in interpersonal relationships during childhood and adolescence are the strongest predictors of schizophrenia. This finding is traced back to its historical antecedents. By reconsidering the works of those psychopathologists, like Hecker, Kahlbaum and Kretschmer, who first worked out the idea that schizophrenia develops out of the vulnerable condition that is immanent in adolescence, the nature of social, emotional and interpersonal abnormalities is clarified.
   Recent findings Building on recent empirical studies, a hypothetical identikit of at-risk adolescents is sketched, including five main psychopathological dimensions: difficulties in interpersonal relations, abnormal emotional contact, self-disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neuropsychological disorders. Research supporting this identikit is reviewed.
   Summary Matching recent empirical studies with early descriptions, the hypothesis that an adolescent having persistent difficulties in managing the emotional side of interpersonal relationships is a candidate for schizophrenia is discussed. The aim is to shed new light on the controversial concept of social and emotional dysfunction.

ID CONDUCT DISORDER; FOLLOW-UP; ADOLESCENTS; CARE
AB In this paper an analysis of problems and emotions of children who live children's homes and foster care as well as their correlates is presented. The research was carried out on 263 children who live in children's homes, 112 children living in foster families and 200 children who live in their own families. Behavioral problems were assessed by the internationally recognized questionnaire Youth Self-Report by T M. Achenbach. The data have shown that there is no statistically significant difference between children who live in foster families and those who live in biological families, but that the children who live in children's homes show more behavioral and emotional problems in comparison with the other two subgroups. In both samples of children that have been removed from their families, the female sex is significantly related with a higher level of internalized problems in behavior and feelings (withdrawal, anxiety, depression and somatic disorders). Changing different residences after the removal from the family is also significantly correlated with a higher level of internalized difficulties. The level of internalized difficulties or externalized problems is not significantly related to the index of stress before removal from the family, but it is connected with current daily stress, perceived poor social support, school failure and poor adjustment. The data acquired here are in support of the tendency of deinstitutionalization of child core within the social system.

AB Background: Pregnancy and delivery are complex processes, and isolated obstetric complications rare and often accompanied or followed by a number of others.
   Aims: To study the relationship between the overall obstetric situation (as opposed to single obstetric risk factors) and emotional and substance use disorders in young adulthood, and to analyse whether these links are mediated by temperaments in childhood.
   Study design: In a prospective birth cohort (n-3162), questionnaires were sent to mothers and teachers when the child was 7-10 years old, and to the children when they were 20-25 years old.
   Subjects: Six hundred and eighty-two cohort members with complete data sets at three ages (perinatal, childhood, and young adulthood).
   Outcome measures: Emotional problems and substance use in young adulthood.
   Main results: Substance use in young adulthood was predicted better by the overall obstetrical optimality score than emotional problems were. Links studied were stronger for men than for women.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the use of an aggregated obstetrical optimality score in analysing the associations between early risk factors and emotional problems and substance use in young adulthood.

   DIAGNOSIS; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; ONSET; MANIA; BOYS
AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) is a common disorder in school-aged children and is associated with significant impairment in social and academic functioning. Its recognition is based on congruent information from different sources, because most ADHD children and adolescents are not competely aware of impairments caused by inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Fluctuations in symptom expression may complicate the diagnosis: during clinical examination or tests sessions, ADHD symptoms may be less severe than usual or completely absent This review examines variations in ADHD symptoms due to environmental context, internal state, circadian factors, development, psychiatric comorbidity and discusses their clinical relevance. Generally, ADHD symptoms are pervasive and identified in different areas of functioning. Despite their chronicity, they show a relative context-dependency. An unfamiliar environment or situation may lessen symptoms. The same happens in dual relations or in calm settings, when the child receives attention and positive reinforcement from the adult. On the contrary, the classroom situation with its high stimulation level (noise, visual distractors, large class size) is likely to reveal or accentuate instability, impulsivity and inattention. Independently from objective symptom fluctuations, the impact of ADHD symptoms, and their consequences on self-esteem may also vary with the degree of environmental mismatch. Recent research in experimental psychology also draws attention to the motivational state of ADHD children: preference for immediate gratification and delay aversion may explain why most of them show satisfactory attentional capacities in certain activities (for instance video games or TV), while showing impairment in school work or in other effortfull tasks (4). The diagnosis of the full ADHD syndrome requires significant impact on functioning in at least two areas. Some children with <<situational>> ADHD are impaired either in school setting or exclusively at home. Manuzza et al. (14) report long-term outcome of <<situational>> versus <<pervasive>> ADHD. School-ADHD, in opposition to home-ADHD shows similarities with the full blown syndrome, as regards proportion of anti-social personality disorder, psycho-social functioning and academic/professional achievments. Moderate seasonal variations have also been identified with less ADHD symptoms in August (12). This result is likely to reflect a better fit between individual characteristics and environmental demands during school holidays rather than neurobiological changes, as there are no convincing arguments for seasonal fluctuations of serotoninergic tone in ADHD (18, 20). Another cause for variations in ADHD symptom expression maybe the co-occurrence of a mood disorder. Relationships between early-onset mania and ADHD are discussed. The appropriate definition of prepubertal mania is still in debate; its recognition is hindered by symptom overlap and high level of comorbid conditions. Chronic emotional dysregulation with irritability and frequent temper tantrums, sometimes viewed as characteristics of early-onset mania, might reflect a - possibly severe - sub-type of ADHD rather than a prodrome of bipolarity (9). A marked cyclicity of symptoms, with periodic accentuation of ADHD and mood symptoms, requires carefull monitoring and systematic analysis of comorbid conditions. Clarification of the complex interrelations between ADHD and bipolar disorder will be obtained from long-term studies.

AB The main purpose of this study was to examine the associations between attachment state of mind and adjustment to college. A related aim was to examine the moderating role of attachment state of mind in the relation between parental control and school adjustment. One-hundred two college freshmen completed the Adult Attachment Interview and a measure of parental control. They also completed a measure of college adjustment at the very beginning and at the very end of their freshman year The findings showed that preoccupation with attachment is related to poor adjustment after I year in college and to a general deterioration in adjustment and in grades during the freshman year Preoccupation with attachment also accentuates the negative relation between parental psychological control and social adjustment. Dismissing attachment tendencies were found to be unrelated to college adjustment.

AB This research studied the role of ethnic identity as a protective factor among European American (n = 77) and African American (n = 82) adolescents identified either as high risk or successful. Adolescents participated in a multiagent, multimethod assessment of depression, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, competence, and academic achievement. The levels of ethnic identity were the same across ethnic groups but were higher among successful adolescents. Bivariate correlations revealed that ethnic identity was significantly associated with all measures of adjustment in the expected directions. Predicted validities were statistically higher among African American youth than for European Americans on depression, total competence, and GPA. Similar associations were found when comparing ethnic identity to a construct of socioeconomic disadvantage. Findings suggest that ethnic identity, is central to the self-system and motivation for youth who develop in contexts that potentially undermine children's socioemotional adjustment.

AB Background: Existing evidence points to a substantial rise in psychosocial disorders affecting young people over the past 50 years (Rutter & Smith, 1995). However, there are major methodological challenges in providing conclusive answers about secular changes in disorder. Comparisons of rates of disorder at different time points are often affected by changes in diagnostic criteria, differences in assessment methods, and changes in official reporting practices. Few studies have examined this issue using the same instruments at each time point. Methods: The current study assessed the extent to which conduct, hyperactive and emotional problems have become more common over a 25-year period in three general population samples of UK adolescents. The samples used in this study were the adolescent sweeps of the National Child Development Study and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, and the 1999 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey. Comparable questionnaires were completed by parents of 15-16-year-olds at each time point (1974, 1986, and 1999). Results and conclusions: Results showed a substantial increase in adolescent conduct problems over the 25-year study period that has affected males and females, all social classes and all family types. There was also evidence for a recent rise in emotional problems, but mixed evidence in relation to rates of hyperactive behaviour. Further analyses using longitudinal data from the first two cohorts showed that long-term outcomes for adolescents with conduct problems were closely similar. This provided evidence that observed trends were unaffected by possible changes in reporting thresholds.

AB This study compared the personality attributes associated with self-report versus interview assessment of romantic attachment. Twenty-three-year-olds (N = 83) completed the Romantic Attachment Interview, the Experiences in Close Relationship Inventory, and measures of response bias, self-enhancement, and self-insight. Five psychologists evaluated the participants' personality. Although both self-report and interview assessment were related to attachment-relevant personality attributes, interview assessment was slightly more likely to explain unique variance in personality, especially regarding intrapsychic attributes. Self-enhancement was negatively related to secure attachment and positively related to dismissing attachment. The opposite pattern emerged for self-insight. A subgroup of 12 vulnerable individuals who described themselves as securely attached on self-report was judged as dismissing according to interview assessment. These individuals scored low on self-insight and high on self-enhancement and psychological vulnerability. The results are discussed with reference to the relative strengths of different measures of romantic attachment and relations among dismissing attachment, self-enhancement, and narcissism.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems based on Youth Self-Report (YSR) were investigated in an empirical sample of 371 students at the age of 13 until 18 years from common secondary and vocational schools in Rostock (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) in 2000/2001. Considering syndromes in comparison with other german and international empirical studies, internalizing and externalizing problems show high prevalence for both girls and boys. Nearly every fifth student judges themselves as within clinical range for psychiatric problems. Girls reported significant more internalizing problems (social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed). An interaction effect by age and sex for aggressive and delinquent behaviour was found with highest prevalence for boys at age 15/16. The frequency of internalizing problems and attention problems increases with adolescent's age. Low adolescent's education level, parental divorce and big size of siblings were associated with externalizing problems, whereas unemployment of the father was associated with depressive and social problems. Delinquent behaviour and attention problems are the most important predictors for negative school outcome like comparatively bad school achievement and low reading ability. The results suppose a possible increase in psychosocial problems of juvenile persons in eastern Germany one decade after German Unification, indicated the necessity of higher supply for preventive and therapeutic programs.

Thirty-one percent of the adolescents reported that they had experienced at least one negative life event during the last year. Serious illness or injury among close relatives or friends was reported as the most prevalent negative life event. Negative life events were significantly associated with emotional problems among both female and male adolescents. Moreover, support from parents, friends and teachers was directly, negatively associated with emotional problems in both sexes. Finally, results indicate that support from parents moderate the relationship between negative life events and emotional problems among adolescent girls.

AB The authors examined the association between exposure to violence and different indexes of mental health among 95 extremely poor children (age range = 8-17 years) and analyzed potential moderators and mediators. Findings indicated that 62% of youths had been exposed to at least 1 form of violence. Controlling for other explanatory factors, exposure to violence was significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) across all children, but the relation was stronger for girls compared with boys. Externalizing problem behaviors were also associated with exposure to violence, but subgroup differences were not detected. Regression analyses indicated that self-esteem and a measure of perceived chronic danger may partially mediate the link between violence exposure and mental health symptoms.

AB `Nurturing the brain' is an emerging research field integrating brain science, child care and education, which also involves child neurology. It has emerged from the recent remarkable progress in brain science and strong social demands for improvements in child care and education. This article reviews the current status of three major research themes in this field. First, developmental disorders represented by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and Asperger syndrome often introduce difficulties in child care and education, which are to be addressed by appropriate assessment and treatment of affected children based on new knowledge of the pathogenesis of these disorders. Second, recent progress in research on the critical/sensitive periods of development of brain structures and functions promises useful advice for teachers and parents regarding optimal timing and ways of teaching various subjects. Third, the development of the brain throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence is paralleled by the growth and maturation of the mind. Neuronal mechanisms underlying the theory of mind, mirror neurons, internal model, cognitive control, and cognitive emotion regulation are important themes that bridge our understandings of the brain and the mind.

AB Objective: The experience of being harassed is associated with various forms of maladjustment. This study examined the prevalence of three domains of harassment, and their associations with emotional and behavioral problems.
   Method: A total of 4,130 young people in 6th through 10th grade in 66 primary and secondary schools in Norway completed questionnaires on self-perceived harassment and emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results: The structural psychometric properties of the scales of harassment showed an acceptable fit to the data. Boys reported more harassment on all items and domains than girls across grades. Strong associations between self-perceived harassment and psychiatric impact and behavioral and emotional problems, especially peer problems and conduct disorder, were revealed.
   Discussion: The study adds to the understanding of the concept of harassment and its correlations with emotional and behavioral problems. The study underscores the importance of conducting routine screening in school as an important basis for the subsequent improvement in children's relationships. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The influence of short stature on psychological adaptation in childhood and adolescence is controversial. GH is currently used to treat children with idiopathic short stature (ISS, also known as non-GH-deficient short stature). This study represents the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of GH on the psychological adaptation of children and adolescents with ISS, treated with GH until adult height was attained.
   Sixty-eight children (53 males, 15 females), 9-16 yr old, with marked ISS (measured height or predicted adult height -2.5 SD or less) received either GH 0.074 mg/kg or placebo sc three times per week until height velocity decreased to less than 1.5 cm/yr. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and children the Self-Perception Profile (SPP) and Silhouette Apperception Technique at baseline and annually thereafter.
   Baseline behavioral/emotional adjustment (CBCL) and self-concept (SPP) scores for children with ISS were within the normative range. The two study groups exhibited similar behavioral and self-concept profiles (CBCL) during the first 2 yr of the study. However, CBCL behavior problems (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems) appeared to decline, in yr 3 and 4, in the GH-treated group relative to the placebo-treated group. Group differences in CBCL competency domains and the SPP were not observed at any point during the study.
   Short stature among children with ISS enrolled in this long-term, placebo-controlled study was not associated with problems in psychological adaptation or self-concept with the psychological instruments employed. GH treatment was associated with a trend toward improvement in problem behaviors, as measured by questionnaires ( CBCL) completed by study participants' parents. It remains to be determined whether GH treatment significantly impacts adaptation, psychosocial function, or quality of life in children with ISS.

AB This study applied a functional approach to the assessment of self-mutilative behavior (SMB) among adolescent psychiatric inpatients. On the basis of past conceptualizations of different forms of self-injurious behavior. the authors hypothesized that SMB is performed because of the automatically reinforcing (i.e., reinforced by oneself; e.g., emotion regulation) and/or socially reinforcing (i.e., reinforced by others; e.g... attention, avoidance-escape) properties associated with such behaviors. Data were collected from 108 adolescent psychiatric inpatients referred for self-injurious thoughts or behaviors. Adolescents reported engaging in SMB frequently, using multiple methods, and having an early age of onset. Moreover, the results supported the structural validity and reliability of the hypothesized functional model of SMB. Most adolescents engaged in SMB for automatic reinforcement, although a sizable portion endorsed social reinforcement functions as well. These findings have direct implications for the understanding, assessment, and treatment of SMB.

AB As positive outcomes for children and adolescents with either Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism are related to the development of social communicative competence, recognition of the developmental capacities that contribute to this achievement is essential. Although social communication skills play a central role, developmental milestones in emotional regulation should be considered of equal importance. This article will describe emotional regulatory challenges commonly faced by individuals with Asperger syndrome and individuals with high-functioning autism that hinder success in social interactions. The impact of challenges in social communication (e.g., difficulty sharing and interpreting intentions, recognition of emotional states, and using socially conventional forms of emotional expression) and differences in neurophysiology (e.g., sensory sensitivities and learning style) on emotional regulation win be reviewed.

ID SPECTRUM DISORDERS; COMMUNICATION; CHILDREN
AB To develop a comprehensive educational program for children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome and children and adolescents with high-functioning autism, goals and objectives need to be identified in those areas of development that support social communicative competence. The role of a child's social partners, however, is often neglected by relying on curricula that focus solely on prioritizing these child-specific objectives. Thus, it is important to consider that how a partner interacts with a child and how an environment is adapted with learning supports has a significant and long-term impact on that child's development. This article provides a description of the SCERTS Model, a comprehensive educational approach that includes a curriculum-based assessment designed to prioritize developmental objectives for the child as well as that child's partners. In this approach, the role of a child's partners in fostering more sophisticated language forms, the social conventions for appropriate behavior in different social situations, greater sensitivity to others' perspectives and emotional states, and the ability to plan and prepare for experiences is emphasized.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the factor structure of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist, using confirmatory factor analysis, in a group of pediatric oncology patients in Taiwan and to compare the competence and behavioral/emotional problems scores of these children with normative scores to assess competence and emotional/behavioral problems of Taiwanese children with cancer. Subjects included parents (124 mothers and 22 fathers) of 146 pediatric oncology patients who completed the measures. Factor loadings of the overall fit indices for the study subjects yielded or approached satisfactory results for all syndromes, except for aggressive behavior. The indices for both internalizing and externalizing syndromes also showed good model fit. Taiwanese children with cancer had significantly lower competence scores on the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 than did Achenbach's sample, expect Taiwanese girls with cancer, who had higher activity competence scores, but these scores were not statistically significant. Taiwanese boys with cancer had significantly higher scores on all of the emotional/behavioral problems, but had lower delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, and externalizing syndrome scores. In contrast, girls with cancer had significantly higher scores on somatic complaints and internalizing syndrome, but significantly lower aggressive behavior and externalizing syndrome scores. Taiwanese adolescents with cancer had significantly lower competence scores compared with normative scores, with the exception being that the adolescents in the current study had significantly higher school competence scores. These adolescents also had significantly fewer attention problems but tended to have more somatic complaints. These findings clearly indicate that healthcare for children with cancer should include psychological services to prevent long-term emotional/behavioral problems.

AB Attachment researchers claim that individual differences in how adults talk about their early memories reflect qualitatively distinct organizations of emotion regarding childhood experiences with caregivers. Testing this assumption, the present study examined the relationship between attachment dimensions and physiological, facial expressive, as well as self-reported emotional responses during the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Consistent with theoretical predictions, more prototypically secure adults behaviorally expressed and reported experiencing emotion consistent with the valence of the childhood events they described. Insecure adults also showed distinctive and theoretically anticipated forms of emotional response: Dismissing participants evidenced increased electrodermal activity during the interview, a sign of emotional suppression, whereas preoccupied adults showed reliable discrepancies between the valence of their inferred childhood experiences and their facial expressive as well as reported emotion during the AAI. Results substantiate a case that the AAI reflects individual differences in emotion regulation that conceptually parallel observations of attachment relationships in infancy.

Child emotion regulation skill, felt acceptance from caregiver observed quality of caregiver-child interaction, and caregiver regulation of emotion each were protective, but the pattern of protection differed across level of the child's ecology and form of adjustment. Implications for prevention are discussed.

   REPORTS; CHILDREN; PARENT; SCHOOL; STUDENTS; RACE; PREVALENCE
AB The authors examined the influence of race/ethnicity on patterns of ratings of adolescent psychopathology completed by adolescents, parents, and teachers in a sample of 600 adolescents. Robust racial/ethnic differences in behavior problems emerged with parent and teacher reports, but not with adolescent self-reports. Discrepancy scores revealed that minority parents reported fewer behavior problems than did youth. Such findings have important implications for treatment seeking,as parents are often the initiators of service use for youth. Compared to other informants, teachers reported fewer internalizing problems among minority adolescents in general, fewer externalizing problems in Asian/Pacific Islanders, and more externalizing problems for African Americans. These findings are consistent with a number of explanations, including cultural differences in adult distress thresholds, racial/ethnic bias among teachers, and cultural differences in symptom expression.

AB A total of 94 adolescents (M age = 14.2 years) participated in 20-minute hypothetical conflict discussions with either their mothers or fathers (24 daughter-mother 22 son-mother 25 daughter-father 23 son-father dyads). Audiotaped conversations were coded for speakers' conversational style (overlaps between turns, simultaneous speech, and successful interruptions) and hostile emotional expressions (i.e., disgust/ contempt). Adolescents used a conversational style that included more overlaps, simultaneous speech and successful interruptions than their parents, with the greatest differences in styles found for adolescents and their mothers. Adolescents' and parents' conversational styles and expressions of disgust were analyzed in modeling procedures in an attempt to predict self reported perceptions of adolescent-parent conflict. Results revealed that adolescents' rates of disgust were positively predicted from both the degree of difference in the adolescent's and parent's conversational styles and from the parent's rates of disgust expressions. In turn, adolescents' expressions of disgust were found to positively predict adolescents' perceptions of levels of relationship conflict with their parents.

AB Early adolescents (Grades 6-8) with multiple learning disabilities (LD; reading and math) in inclusive settings were compared to adolescents with single LD (reading or math) and typically achieving (TA) peers regarding their psychosocial functioning in two areas of adolescent well-being: emotional adjustment and school functioning. The Behavior Assessment System for Children (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1998) Self-Report of Personality for adolescents was used to determine well-being. One hundred twenty middle school students-15 boys and 15 girls in each group-were included in the current study. The results confirmed that adolescents with multiple LD (reading and math) reported poorer functioning (i.e., higher T scores) on school maladjustment, clinical maladjustment, emotional symptoms index, attitude to school, atypicality, and depression when compared to TA peers but not when compared to peers with a single LD (reading or math). All three groups differed from the TA group (but not from each other) on sense of inadequacy, with the multiple LD group reporting the highest T scores. Additional analyses indicated significant differences between girls and boys, regardless of disability status. Girls reported higher T scores on the emotional symptoms index, social stress, and depression, but boys reported greater school maladjustment and sensation seeking. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB Objectives. To investigate behavioral and emotional problems and positive adjustment of 15- to 16-year-olds who were born at extremely low gestational age (ELGA), from the perspective of parents, teachers, and teenagers.
   Methods. Prospective follow-up was conducted of birth cohorts, with classroom control subjects. All infants who were born before 29 weeks in 1983-1984 (mean gestational age: 27 weeks) to mothers who resided in 3 regions of the United Kingdom were studied. A total of 82% (179 of 218) of survivors were traced at age 15 to 16. The 150 in mainstream school were compared with age- and gender-matched classroom control subjects (n=108). Behavioral and emotional problems, delinquency, peer relations, self-esteem, and hobbies, were assessed by standardized, well-validated instruments, including the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, administered by mail to parents, teenagers, and teachers.
   Results. Parents were more likely to rate ELGA teenagers than control subjects as in the "abnormal" range for hyperactivity (8% vs 1%; difference: 7%; (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2-12), peer relationship problems (19% vs 5%; difference: 14%; 95% CI: 6-21), and emotional problems (18% vs 7%; difference: 11%; 95% CI: 3-19), but not conduct problems (10% vs 5%; difference: 5%; 95% CI: -1 to 12)). Teachers reported a similar pattern. In contrast, compared with control subjects, ELGA teenagers did not rate themselves as having more problems with peers, hyperactivity, conduct, depression, or low self-esteem. They reported more emotional problems but less delinquency, alcohol, cannabis, and other drug use.
   Conclusions. Compared with mainstream classmates, children who are born extremely early continue to have higher levels of parent- and teacher-reported emotional, attentional, and peer problems well into their teens. However, despite these problems, they do not show signs of more serious conduct disorders, delinquency, drug use, or depression.

AB Objective: To determine whether the relationship between bullying and psychosocial adjustment is consistent across countries by standard measures and methods.
   Design: Cross-sectional self-report surveys were obtained from nationally representative samples of students in 25 countries. Involvement in bullying, as bully, victim, or both bully and victim, was assessed.
   Setting: Surveys were conducted at public and private schools throughout the participating countries.
   Participants: Participants included all consenting students in sampled classrooms, for a total of 113 200 students at average ages of 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Psychosocial adjustment dimensions assessed included health problems, emotional adjustment, school adjustment, relationships with classmates, alcohol use, and weapon carrying.
   Results: Involvement in bullying varied dramatically across countries, ranging from 9% to 54% of youth. However, across all countries, involvement in bullying was associated with poorer psychosocial adjustment (P<.05). in all or nearly all countries, bullies, victims, and bully-victims reported greater health problems and poorer emotional and social adjustment. Victims and bully-victims consistently reported poorer relationships with classmates, whereas bullies and bully-victims reported greater alcohol use and weapon carrying.
   Conclusions: The association of bullying with poorer psychosocial adjustment is remarkably similar across countries. Bullying is a critical issue for the health of youth internationally.

AB Objectives: To assess the degree to which preventive child health professionals (CHPs) identify and manage psychosocial problems among preschool children in the general population and to determine the association with parent-reported behavioral and emotional problems, sociodemographic factors, and mental health history of children.
   Design: The CHPs examined the child and interviewed the parent's and child during their routine health assessments. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was completed by the parents.
   Setting: Sixteen child health care services across the Netherlands that routinely provided well-child care to nearly all preschool children.
   Patients: Of 2354 children aged 21 months to 4 years who were eligible for a routine health assessment, 2229 (94.7%) participated.
   Main Outcome Measures: Identification and management of psychosocial problems by CHPs.
   Results: In 9.4% of all children, CHPs identified psychosocial problems. Two in 5 of the CHP-identified children were referred for additional diagnosis and treatment. Identification of psychosocial problems and subsequent referral were much more likely in children with a clinical CBCL total problems score than in others (identification: 29% vs 7%; odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 5.40 [3.45-8.47]; referral: 15% vs 3%; odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 6.50 [3.69-11.46]).
   Conclusions: The CHPs frequently identify psychosocial problems in preschool children, although less than among school-aged children, but they miss many cases of parent-reported problems as measured by a clinical CBCL score. This general population study shows substantial room for improvement in the early identification of psychosocial problems.

AB Objective: We examine the Australian psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SQD), a brief screening measure of behavioural and emotional problems in children and adolescents.
   Method: Using a large community sample (n = 1359) of young Australian children (4-9 years), we assessed the internal consistency, stability, and external validity of the parent-report SDQ. Normative data and cut-offs were also produced.
   Results: Moderate to strong internal reliability was exhibited across all SDQ subscales, and support was found for the original five-factor structure of the measure. Adequate validity was evidenced in the relationship of these scales to one another, while correlations between the SDQ subscales, teacher ratings, and diagnostic interviews demonstrated sound external validity. SDQ total difficulties scores were associated with concurrent treatment status and scores over a 12-month period were stable.
   Conclusions: The current study of the SDQ with Australian children presents evidence of sound psychometric properties. Being the first study to empirically support the use of the SDQ in Australia, it is recommended that the youth and teacher-report forms of the measure receive similar attention in the future.

ID CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; EMOTIONAL-PROBLEMS; MODELS; AGE
AB Standardized rating scales are the most often used part of the multidimensional assessment of children's behavior. However, low cross-informant correlations raise concerns about the reliability and validity of the resulting scores. This study examined whether the manner in which behavioral constructs are measured differs across informants, across time, and across child gender for the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 4-18 (CBCL/4-18) and the Teacher Response Form (TRF). Measurement models using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were examined for child behavior ratings obtained, for the same child, at 54 months and first grade from mothers, fathers, and teachers. Model contracts were also evaluated to determine whether the measurement of behavioral problems was different for boys and girls. This study involved approximately 700 children from the prospective, longitudinal database of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. The general form and factor loadings of the CBCL 4-18 and TRF were invariant across mothers, fathers, and teachers and held regardless of the target child's gender. These results suggest that the low correlations between parent and teacher ratings of behavior problems appear more likely to result from differences in situation-specific behavior than from the manner in which they are measured.

AB The objective of the study was to assess behavioural and emotional problems, as well as physical capacity, in children and adolescents with congenital cardiac disease. From the database of Paediatric Heart Section, Children's Clinic, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, we identified 430 patients whose parents received questionnaires using the Child Behaviour Check-List. The response rate was 75.8 %. In addition, the parents received a questionnaire focusing on special issues with regard to physical activity. Parents of children and adolescents with congenital cardiac diseases reported significantly more behavioural problems than did a reference population and boys were scored higher compared to girls. Analysis showed a significant impact of physical capacity on the score representing total problems, as well as scores for externalising and internalising behaviour. Compared to a reference population, parents of children and adolescents with congenital cardiac disease score their children higher on most scales when rated using the Child Behaviour Check-List. The type of diagnosis did not affect the scores reflecting the total problem. The main factor of impact on behavioural problems was, as evaluated by the parents, the physical capacity of the children.

AB Purpose: To describe the symptom experience of hospitalised Chinese children and adolescents and examine the relationship of symptoms to pre-hospital factors and child behaviour.
   Methods: Data were collected at two hospital sites in Hong Kong (HK) and at five hospitals in the Chinese Mainland (CM). A total of 307 hospitalised children and adolescents (ages 2-18) and their primary caregiver (e.g., mother, father or grandparent) participated in the study. Children and adolescents completed an age-appropriate symptom diary on one evening and subsequent morning early in their hospital stay. Parents completed the diary for the children less than 6 years of age. Parents also completed an age-appropriate Chinese version of the Child Behaviour Checklist.
   Results: Over 50% of the children and adolescents reported some degree of pain, 75% of them reported evening tiredness, and 21% reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The intensity of symptoms varied by age and region and symptoms often co-occurred. Greater symptom burden was predicted by previous surgery, higher level of worst pain prior to hospitalisation, parent report of child behaviour problems, and co-occurrence of other symptoms.
   Conclusions: Hospitalised Chinese children manifest symptoms of pain, tiredness, and gastrointestinal distress that vary based on pre-hospital factors and are associated with child behaviour problems. Further research is needed to identify causes and treatments for children's symptoms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the toddler and preschool predictors of early peer social preference. Behavioral and social functioning were examined in a sample of children across the toddler and preschool years from parent and teacher observations. Kindergarten social behavior and peer social preference were assessed in the children's kindergarten classrooms using standard sociometric techniques. Results indicated that parent report of toddler externalizing behavior and teacher report of preschool problem behavior, as indexed by aggressive behavior, social skills, and emotional regulation, were predictive of peer liking in kindergarten. However, this relation was mediated by specific behaviors evidenced in the kindergarten classroom. For boys, overt aggression mediated these relations. For girls, sharing and engaging in sneaky behavior in kindergarten mediated the relation between preschool problem behaviors and peer status. These results indicate that specific behaviors displayed in the peer group account for the relation between early problem behavior and peer status. Moreover, these data point to the importance of considering gender when examining developmental trajectories and outcomes.

AB Background. Caring for any child involves considerable resources, but the demands for these resources are often increased when caring for a child with a disability. These demands have implications for the psychologic and physical health of the caregiver (CG). Although a number of recent trends in health care stress the importance of studying and promoting the health of CGs of children with disabilities, the literature in this area exhibits 2 major weaknesses, ie, most studies draw conclusions from relatively small, potentially biased, clinic-based samples and the majority of work has focused on the psychologic health of CGs, whereas little research has been undertaken to study their physical well-being. The goal of this study was to compare the physical and psychologic health of CGs of children with cerebral palsy (CP) with that of the general population of CGs.
   Methods. Data on the physical and psychologic health of 468 primary CGs of children with CP, drawn from 18 of 19 publicly funded children's rehabilitation centers in Ontario, Canada, were collected with a self-completed questionnaire and a face-to-face interview. Identical items and scales had been administered previously to nationally representative samples of the Canadian population in 2 large-scale Canadian surveys, ie, the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) and the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Subsamples of those data, restricted to adult residents of the province of Ontario who were parents, allowed a comparison of our sample of CGs of children with CP with parent samples from both the NLSCY (n = 2414) and the NPHS (n = 5549).
   Outcome Measures. Demographic variables included CG age, gender, education, income, and work-related variables. Psychologic health and support variables included social support, family functioning, frequency of contacts, distress, and emotional and cognitive problems. Physical health variables included the number and variety of chronic conditions, vision, hearing, and mobility problems, and experience of pain.
   Results. CGs of children with CP had lower incomes than did the general population of CGs ( proportion with income over $60 000: CG: 40.9%; NLSCY: 51.4%), despite the absence of any important differences in education between the 2 samples. Results showed that CGs of children with CP were less likely to report working for pay (CG: 66%; NLSCY: 81.2%), less likely to be engaged in full-time work (CG: 67.5%; NLSCY: 73.2%), and more likely to list caring for their families as their main activity (CG: 37.2%; NLSCY: 28.4%). Measures of support showed no difference in reported social support ( CG: mean score: 14.5; SD: 3.4; NLSCY: mean score: 14.3; SD: 2.7) or family functioning ( CG: mean score: 8.6; SD: 5.6; NLSCY: mean score: 9.0; SD: 4.9) between the 2 samples, although the CG sample did report a statistically greater number of support contacts (CG: mean score: 4.5; SD: 0.7; NPHS: mean score: 4.2; SD: 0.9). Measures of psychologic health showed greater reported distress ( CG: mean score: 4.7; SD: 4.4; NPHS: mean score: 2.2; SD: 2.7), chronicity of distress (CG: mean score: 5.5; SD: 1.4; NPHS: mean score: 5.2; SD: 1.1), emotional problems (CG: 25.3% indicating problems; NPHS: 13.7%), and cognitive problems ( CG: 38.8%; NPHS: 14.3%) among CGs of children with CP. They also reported a greater likelihood of a variety of physical problems, including back problems (CG: 35.5% reporting the condition; SE: 2.2%; NLSCY: 12.2%; SE: 0.7%), migraine headaches (CG: 24.2%; SE: 2.0%; NLSCY: 11.2%; SE: 0.7%), stomach/intestinal ulcers (CG: 8.4%; SE: 1.3%; NLSCY: 1.7%; SE: 0.3%), asthma (CG: 15.8%; SE: 1.7%; NLSCY: 6.3%; SE: 0.5%), arthritis/rheumatism ( CG: 17.3%; SE: 1.8%; NLSCY: 7.3%; SE: 0.5%), and experience of pain (CG: 28.8%; SE: 2.1%; NPHS: 11.0%; SE: 0.5), as well as a greater overall number of chronic physical conditions (CG: 24.1% reporting no chronic conditions; NLSCY: 55.2%).
   Conclusions. Although many families cope well despite the added challenges of caring for a child with a disability, our findings suggest that the demands of their children's disabilities can explain differences in the health status of parents and that parents of children with CP are more likely to have a variety of physical and psychologic health problems. Many of these findings are consistent with a stress process model, in which stress from caregiving can directly or indirectly affect a variety of measures of health, although some of the findings (asthma and arthritis) seem to strain this hypothesis. Alternate interpretations of these findings include the possibility that parents who are in regular contact with the health care system may have more opportunities to discuss and receive attention for their own health concerns than do comparison adults or that the greater number of health issues reported by CGs is related to the nature of our study, perhaps leading these parents to focus on their health and well-being in more depth than is usually feasible in a population survey. CGs of children with CP also had lower incomes, despite the absence of any important differences in education. The findings are consistent with the idea that the financial burden of caring for a child with a disability results in part from a reduced availability of these parents to work for pay.
   Implications for Service Providers. Physicians and other health care professionals should be aware of the important relationship between child disability and CG health. Family-centered policies and services that explicitly consider CG health are likely to benefit the wellbeing of both CGs and their families. Future work should address the extent to which the family-centeredness of services, as experienced by CGs, is associated with better health outcomes for parents and their families.

   decision-making 26 by Mexican adolescent user of illegal drugs
SO SALUD MENTAL

DT Article

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Introduction: The main study's premise was the conceptualization that drug users make decisions based on non-arbitrary reasoning. On the contrary, such decisions seem to rely on common sense based on: lay knowledge; socially shared beliefs and attitudes; and experiences and affectivities that give meaning to their actions. Drug consumption itself seems to be a social practice underlied by several decisions making: Subjects by themselves decide whether or not to consume, what kinds of drugs to use, whether or not to keep on using them, and when is the proper time to quit. One of the risks identified in the literature about drug consumption initiation is that drugs are offered by a friend, classmate or acquaintance. In the beginning, drug consumption is apparently maintained by peer pressure, and the search for treatment only begins when the problem seems to be unsolvable and difficult to handle. Nonetheless, which is the explicative common sense model that guided a group of users in rehabilitation toward their decision to begin, then continue, and finally, quit consumption? What representations and socio-cognitive processes support these decisions? This paper presents a study that revised a theoretical duality: the Social Representation (SR) and the Brief Family Therapy, under a multi-methodological approach, using associative techniques and in-depth interviews. The study of decision-making models comes from the psychotherapeutic tradition but it shows some limitations such as: ignoring the kind of problem, its evolution, experiences, historical-social background, and individual-society interactions. The Social Representation Theory is centred on the cognitive and social processes that make up the decisions of the addiction process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explain how, and based on what social representation, the model that led to the decision to begin, maintain and quit drug use is constructed in users who are in rehabilitation. Method: A three stage transversal analytical-interpretative study based on the above mentioned theoretical duality was carried out. The study population was comprised by 57 teenage drug users, being treated at Centros de Integracion Juvenil (CIJ) in Guadalajara, Mexico. Free listing and context interviews were used in the first stage; the sorting technique was used in the second stage; finally, in-depth individual interviews were used in the third stage. Anthropac 4.9 and Atlas Ti software were used for data analysis. Results: The Social Representation (SR) on which the decision-making model was constructed was "the search for a different world" opposite to their family tradition, which emerged from three problem areas: (a) 90% of the families had gone through evolutive cycles of drug consumption. The behavior pattern translates into a behavior modeled on the definition of acceptable conduct. (b) Parents expected their children "to learn from their mistakes" and that "a better world" could appear regardless of the family emotional problems and the "barrio" context. (c) Adolescents were certain "the same thing wouldn't happen to them"; they believed they could build "a better world". They believed that just thinking about it would hinder the possibility that "it would happen to them", and therefore, did not see that consuming drugs was a risk. Under the above mentioned conditions, the SR that emerged was featured by three "moments". (1) Pathway: It could be explained as due to: curiosity, invitations from friends, a sensation of loneliness or a warmthless family environment.
   On the other hand, study subjects underscored that it was also a result of their own free will which would also be instrumental for the withdrawal. The image of a friend was embodied in someone emotionally close, such as a neighbor who would satisfy the missing psycho-affective needs. When consumption became evident to the family, there were reproaches, threats and aggression. Parents would make the teenage to promise he/she would quit taking drugs; nonetheless, it was not the time to quit because youngsters did not considered a problem. They were living a "romance with drugs" and thougt they could quit any time. (2) Continuance: The peer group modeled the necessary skills to remain using drugs. Study subjects learned about different kinds of drugs and about their use patterns, effects, prices, quality, sale points, strategies to get money to maintain their habit and how to avoid the abstinence syndrome. Women reported greater problems for drug access. Continuance was the longest stage, ranging between three and six years. Also it was the most costly in terms of investment and resources, since it was the stage when subjects suffered the greatest losses. Associated conflicts, such as a more hostile family relationship, a greater drug consumption and aggressiveness were more prevalent in women. At this time in the model, the idea that they could quit drugs on will power still prevailed, therefore the strategies used were to stay away from consumer friends, go back to old non-drug user friends, return home early and listen to music. The abstinence syndrome showed that these strategies were not working and, therefore, users realized that drugs were indeed a problem that justified getting help. Nevertheless, recognizing this was a difficult step because it was posing against the conceptions and beliefs that they were still holding. (3) Withdrawal: Began when the subjects finally decided to accept the help offered by their parents to seek out professional treatment. They became aware of the associated problems in terms of four criteria that enabled to obtain cognitive redefinition of addiction as a problem: (a) they themselves became aware of: their deteriorating health, the change of their habits and interests, and the "hit rock bottom feeling"; (b) the peer group, when the subjects observed their friends poor condition and wondered if they were looking the same. They redefined true friends as those that encouraged them to quit drugs; (c) work and school. Those subjects that were still working reported that they did not keep jobs because they would be absent or arrive late. School seemed hard for those studying; and (d) the family: one of the most important elements was becoming aware of their mothers' deteriorated emotional state and the rejection by other family members. Discussion: Our findings agree with the literature by locating these three moments in the model. Furthermore we identified that one of the main reasons to decide to take drugs was that it was not perceived as a problem. This reasoning was partially nourished by: (1) the sensation of invulnerability or by a low perception of risk; (2) subject feels certain he/she can survive just as other relatives with some experience; (3) drugs are offered by an affectively close friend; and finally, (4) because they discover that drugs alleviate stress produced by a rather unstable family and by the resulting psycho-emotional and affective unease. The reasoning that accompanies the step toward continued use comes from the "honeymoon" established with drugs.
   It has been reported that as long as there are no problems associated with consumption, it is not identified as a problem. Nonetheless, we found that experimenting with other drugs seems to be an easier decision to make than using drugs for the first time. This fact is partially due to his/her experience that "nothing happens" and to the prevalence of the beliefs, that "drugs are not the problem" and "where there's a will there a way" that are anchored in the low perception of risk and the widely, accepted value of willpower. In such a stage, the peer group assumed an important role in maintaining drug use by modeling skills concerning the experimentation with other kinds of drugs. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the peer group offers a sense of belonging and unity. As above mentioned, we also found that it takes up to six years to define consumption as a problem. Nonetheless, this apparently does not depend on time but on the kind of cognitive processes undertaken. As it has been reported, we also found that when subjects decided to use health services, this coincided in time with this realization that associated problems look like irreparable. Our findings also revealed that only when drug addiction was perceived as a problem, was also the time when subjects changed the previously favorable image of addiction, and then, the necessary cognitive processes emerged leading them to seek help. Finally We consider that our findings must be extrapolated only in those instances in which the subjects have gone through the all three addiction stages.

LA English
DT Article
DE adolescents; outpatient treatment; retention; substance abuse
AB Because retention of adolescents in substance abuse treatment is critical to treatment effectiveness, factors that predict length of time in treatment were examined among youth (N = 173) admitted to five outpatient clinics. At admission, youth received a comprehensive psychosocial assessment. Relevant predictors of length of treatment were determined using Poisson regression analyses. Factors positively associated with treatment duration included use of drugs in addition to alcohol and marijuana, having less deviant peers, absence of substance-caused emotional problems, and viewing counselor's skills more positively. In contrast, pressure to enter treatment was unrelated to treatment duration. Results suggest that the counselor-client relationship and peer influences be explicitly considered in treatment.

AB Objective: To evaluate the role of food habits and nutrient intake in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) considering their association with psychosocial factors.
   Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: A rural town in Mid-Western Finland.
   Subjects: After excluding organic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, a total of 49 children with FGID and 78 control children without GI symptoms from a cohort of 422 children were studied.
   Methods: Food frequency questionnaire, GI-symptoms questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) filled in by parents together with their child, and 24-h dietary recall and anthropometric and haematological measurements.
   Results: Compared to control children, fewer children with FGID had daily family dinner (77 vs 91%, P = 0.030) and they used less often vegetables (P = 0.023), fruits (P = 0.027) and berries (P = 0.011), but more often ice cream (P = 0.018) and soft drinks (P = 0.027) and had a higher sucrose intake (9 vs 7E%, P = 0.032) and lower lactose intake (27 vs 36 g, P = 0.001). Reported food-related symptoms were more common among FGID group (69 vs 11%), as well as restricted milk use (31 vs 0%). Children with FGID had higher total problem scores in CBCL (P = 0.002), and the behavioural/emotional problems associated with occurrence of FGID (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.07-1.076) as did the sugar intake (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.004-1.215).
   Conclusions: This population-based study suggests that school-aged children with FGIDs have less-organized food habits and higher milk avoidance, and they display internalizing psychological characteristics.

AB This research was conducted at a summer camp for siblings of children with cancer. The camp is designed to address emotional problems, provide peer interaction and validation, and bolster siblings' self-esteem. Standardized measures assessing posttraumatic stress, anxiety, quality of life, and self-esteem were administered to 77 siblings (ages 6-17) prior to attending camp and again 3 months after camp. From pre- to post-camp, the siblings reported statistically significant decreases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress and anxiety, and statistically significant improvements in quality of life and self-esteem. These preliminary findings are encouraging and suggest the value of camp as a psychological intervention and provide a model for other pediatric cancer facilities designing intervention programs for siblings.

   COMPETENCE; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; EARLY ADULTHOOD; FOLLOW-UP
AB Consistent with existing theory, the quality of parent-child interactions during early childhood affects children's social relationships and behavioral adjustment during middle childhood and adolescence. Harsh parenting and a propensity toward emotional overarousal interact very early in life to affect risk for later conduct problems. Less empirical work has evaluated the emergence of early childhood coercive parent-child reciprocities. The proposed early childhood coercion model describes the processes by which coercive parent-child reciprocities emerge. Specifically, the interaction between parenting and infants' propensities toward reactivity influences the development of emotion regulation in children and disciplinary styles in parents. Highly reactive children are expected to experience more difficulty learning to regulate emotions and to evoke harsher parenting. Through a process of mutual reinforcement, harsh parenting, negative emotional reactivity, and poor emotion regulation become coercive parent-child reciprocities during early childhood. The emergence of coercive parent-child interactions further diminishes children's emotional regulatory capacities and affects the formation of peer relationships during kindergarten.

The second goal of this study was to compare boys -girls problem scales data and CBCL-YSR differences. The instruments were administered to school adolescents aged between 12-18 comprising a non-referred sample (n = 611) drawn from the whole country. Youths, compared to their parents, rated higher scores in all scales in both sexes (p < 0.001). According to parents' reports boys had higher scores in more scales (five out of eleven). According to adoleseents' self-reports girls had higher scores in more scales (seven out of eleven). Consistent with other studies, Croatian sample confirmed a larger number of serious behavioral and emotional problems reported by adolescents. Adolescents were confirmed as the most reliable informants on their problems.

AB Four years of longitudinal data from 373 families participating in a randomized intervention-control clinical trial were used to examine whether intervention effects on adolescent alcohol and tobacco use trajectories were moderated by family risk, as defined by parental social emotional maladjustment. Consistent with earlier outcome evaluations based on analyses of covariance, analyses confirmed that both the Preparing for the Drug Free Years program and the Iowa Strengthening Families Program favorably influenced alcohol use index trajectories across the time frame of the study; only the latter program, however, evidenced positive effects on a tobacco use index. Concerning the primary research question, analyses provided no support for family risk moderation of any intervention effect. Findings indicate the feasibility of developing universal preventive interventions that offer comparable benefits to all families.

AB Evidence exists that there is low agreement between multiple informants reporting on children's and adolescents' behavior problems. Few studies, however, focus on agreement between informants in specific age groups. This study examined correspondence and disagreement between mother, father, and teacher reports of problem behavior by analyzing CBCL and TRF data of 2 nonclinical samples of 5- to 6-year-old preschool children (N = 424). Findings indicated that interrater agreement was low to moderate. This was shown by the intercorrelations, the explained variance in regression analyses and the little overlap in the number of children rated as behaviorally disturbed by all 3 informants. Agreement between mother and father reports was highest, whereas agreement between mother and teacher reports was lowest. Disagreement between informants was highest for internalizing problems. Potential explanations for the lack of agreement are discussed. Guidelines are formulated to refine assessment and optimize clinical decision-making processes.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate the gender-specific prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in children and adolescents in out-of-home childcare, compared with patients in child and adolescent psychiatric institutions. The total population of clients in residential childcare institutions in Oslo, Norway, was investigated by the use of standardized questionnaires (Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report) and compared to all same-aged patients residing in child and adolescent psychiatric institutions in the same area at the same time. Boys in residential childcare had emotional and behavioural problem levels comparable to boys in child and adolescent psychiatric institutions, as measured by the questionnaires. Girls in residential childcare did not reach problem levels as high as those found in girls in psychiatric institutions, but problem levels were still well above those found in the general population. It was concluded that institutionalized childcare clients had a high prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems, as measured by Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report.

AB This study was carried out to describe strategies used to cope with stress and to explore the association between coping strategies and behavioral/emotional problems in a community sample of adolescents from Mainland China. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire incorporating the Chinese Trait Coping Style Questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Youth Self-Report of Child Behavior Checklist, and a number of demographic questions. Results indicated that Chinese adolescents often used multiple coping strategies when faced with stress. Principal factor analysis followed by oblique rotation revealed two dimensions of coping strategies in Chinese adolescents: active coping and avoidant coping. A series of logistic regression analyses showed that avoidant coping was significantly associated with increased risk for internalizing and externalizing problems, but active coping was associated with reduced risk, after adjustment for child's age and sex and father's occupation. These findings provide evidence of the association between coping and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Relations among authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles, children's effortful control and dispositional anger/frustration, and children's social functioning were examined for 425 first and second graders (7-10 years old) in Beijing, China. Parents reported on parenting styles; parents and teachers rated children's effortful control, anger/frustration, externalizing problems, and socially appropriate behaviors; and peers rated aggression and leadership/sociability. High effortful control and low dispositional anger/frustration uniquely predicted Chinese children's high social functioning, and the relation of anger/frustration to social functioning was moderated by effortful control. Authoritarian parenting was associated with children's low effortful control and high dispositional anger/frustration. which (especially effortful control) mediated the negative relation between authoritarian parenting and children's social functioning. Effortful control weakly mediated the positive relation of authoritative parenting to social functioning.

AB The association between attachment representations and adolescents' coping with 3 developmental tasks of emerging adulthood-leaving home, advancing in the capacity for mature intimacy. and developing individuation-was examined. Israeli male adolescents (N = 88) were administered the Adult Attachment Interview during their high-school senior year. A year later, they and their friends reported on the adolescents' adjustment to mandatory military Service. Three years later, participants and their parents reported on the adolescents' capacity for intimacy using an in-depth interview and on their individuation. An autonomous state of mind was associated with better coping with basic training and with a higher capacity for mature intimacy but was not associated with markers of individuation. The results highlight the importance of attachment representations in shaping an individual's developmental trajectory.

AB This study investigated whether parent-adolescent disagreement regarding adolescents' behavioral and emotional problems predicted adverse outcome. A Dutch sample of 15- to 18-year-olds was prospectively followed across a 4-year interval. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; T. M. Achenbach, 1997) and Youth Self-Report (YSR; T. M. Achenbach, 1991b) were administered at initial assessment, and the following signs of poor outcome were assessed 4 years later: police/judicial contacts, expulsion from school/job, suicidal ideation, unwanted pregnancy, suicide attempts. deliberate self-harm, referral to mental health services, report of having a behavioral or emotional problem, and feeling the need for professional help without actually receiving help. Twenty CBCL syndrome scores, 23 YSR syndrome scores, and 16 discrepancy scores were significant predictors of poor outcome. It was concluded that to determine the prognosis of psychopathology in adolescents, discrepancies between informants may be important.

AB This study investigated the relation of friendship and emotional adjustment in adolescents. Both quantitative (popularity, mutual friendships, and number of friends) and qualitative dimensions (perceived positive friendship quality and conflict) of friendship were used. Participants were 618, mostly European American, 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders. Structural equation modeling showed that positive friendship quality was the only friendship variable that predicted adjustment. An examination of gender effects indicated that this relation held only for boys. The quantitative aspects of friendship had a small, indirect effect oil adjustment through their effects on positive quality. Conflict had a negative effect on positive quality and this effect was stronger for girls than for boys. The role of adolescents' perception in adjustment was highlighted and suggestions for future research were made. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Attachment theory proposes that experiences with the primary caregivers are an important basis for the development of close social relationships outside the parent-child relationship. This study examined the association between representations of attachment, as assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), representations of friendship and peer relations, as assessed with an interview in a sample of 43 adolescents. Secure attachment representations were significantly related to interview-based assessments of close friendships, friendship concept, integration in a peer group, and emotion regulation within close friendships. Attachment experiences reported during the AAI, their integration, and their coherency were related to friendship quality and friendship concept. Results show the close associations between attachment representations and friendship relationships during adolescence. The associations between peer relations and attachment representations differed depending on whether an interview approach or a questionnaire approach was used. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Data from the 1999 National Survey of America's Families (N = 35,938) were used to examine the relationship between family structure and child well-being. I extended prior research by including children in two-biological-parent cohabiting families, as well as cohabiting stepfamilies, in an investigation of the roles of economic and parental resources on behavioral and emotional problems and school engagement. Children living in two-biological-parent cohabiting families experience worse outcomes, on average, than those residing with two biological married parents, although among children ages 6-11, economic and parental resources attenuate these differences. Among adolescents ages 12-17, parental cohabitation is negatively associated with well-being, regardless of the levels of these resources. Child well-being does not significantly - differ among those in cohabiting versus married stepfamilies, two-biological-parent cohabiting families versus cohabiting stepfamilies, or either type of cohabiting family versus single-mother families.

   Objectives: To analyze the frequency of behavioral and emotional problems and comorbidity of kindergarten children in Braunschweig as rated by their parents.
   Method: The analysis is part of the Braunschweiger Kindergartenstudie. In a sample of N = 809 children aged three to six the parents rated their children using a modified version of the Child Behavior Checklist/CBCL 4-18.
   Results: The prevalence rates range from 0.5% to 5.0%. The most frequent behavioral problems in kindergarten children were aggressive behavior and attention problems, followed by social problems. The study also provides bidirectional comorbidity rates.
   Conclusion: Finally the prevalence rates and the implications of the findings for prevention of behavioral problems in children are discussed.

AB Self-reported behavioural/emotional problems were studied in 2647 15-18-year-old high school students by Youth Self-Report (YSR), Symptom Checklist (SCL-12) and a Conduct Problem scale. The response rate was 85%. The respondents were from three ethnic groups in northern Norway: indigenous Sami,Kvens (descendants of Finnish-speaking immigrants from northern Finland and Sweden) and Norwegians. Females' mean scores were higher than males' scores for Total Problems [47.2 (SD 19.3) vs. 40.9 (SD 19.4)], Internalising Problems, the Internalising syndrome scales and the Attention Problems scale. Males' mean scores were higher than females' scores for Delinquent Behaviour. There were few differences between the ethnic groups, but Sami had higher scores than Norwegians for the Withdrawn and Social Problems syndromes. Parental status (whether parents were living together) was weakly associated with Total Problems, Internalising and Externalising Problems, while age, socioeconomic status and urban/rural location were not associated with the problem scales. Results for Anxiety-depression (SCL-12) and Conduct Problems were compared with a national representative adolescent sample (n = 4567), showing slight differences between the samples in Anxiety-depression (with north Norwegian adolescents having lower scores) and no significant differences in Conduct Problems.

AB This study reports on the application of the Norwegian self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-S). The application of the SDQ-S was not motivated by a wish to reveal the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, but rather to set the stage for routine screening as part of schools' efforts to inform themselves about the life of adolescents at school. The survey included 4167 young people aged 11 to 16 years, attending 66 primary and secondary schools in Northern Norway. The respondents comprised 80.2% of the total population in these grades in the target area. Structural analysis of the instrument, including confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and intra- and cross-scale correlations revealed somewhat variable psychometric properties. Model modification suggested several ways of improving the structural psychometric properties of the SDQ-S. Norwegian cut-off points were similar to those found in other Scandinavian studies. About one third of the subjects reported at least minor perceived difficulties, while about 5% reported definite or severe difficulties. These difficulties were strongly associated with all symptom scales. Girls reported a significantly higher level of emotional problems and better prosocial functioning. Boys reported significantly higher scores on the externalising scales and on peer problems. The SDQ-S may be judged as an efficient and economical screening instrument for preventive research on large community samples. However, efforts should be made to improve its psychometric structure.

AB This article examines the relation among gender, social-emotional adjustment, and deviant behavior among serious juvenile offenders. A sample of]05 adolescent offenders completed questionnaires assessing social-emotional characteristics and self-reported involvement in deviant behaviors. Results indicate significant associations between distress and restraint in predicting deviance, a finding that was invariant across gender Analysis of four distinct social-emotional profiles found that membership in the reactive group was associated with the greatest amount of deviant behavior. Results also indicate that not only do serious offending girls internalize more than serious offending boys, they appear equally likely to externalize. However, although boys exhibit less distress than girls, those boys who report high rates of deviance may exhibit internalizing and externalizing problems similar to girls. The use of social-emotional measures in general, and distinct profiles in particular may aid in targeting specific programming and treatment in an effort to provide offenders with more effective interventions.

AB Examined the association of anger experience and two types of normative beliefs with physical aggression and nonaggressive antisocial behavior in 361 juvenile offenders and 206 high school students in Russia. All participants were male and ranged in age from 14 to 18 years. Higher frequency of aggressive acts was significantly associated with higher levels of anger and stronger beliefs that physical aggression is an appropriate course of action in conflicts. After statistically controlling for nonaggressive antisocial behavior, the relationship between physical aggression and antisocial beliefs was not significant. Similarly, with physical aggression controlled, nonaggressive antisocial behavior was uniquely associated with approval of deviancy, but not with anger or beliefs legitimizing aggression. Juvenile offenders reported higher levels of anger experience and higher frequency of aggression and antisocial behavior compared to high school students. There were no differences in normative beliefs between these two groups. This specificity of association of social-cognitive and emotion-regulation processes to aggressive and nonaggressive forms of antisocial behavior may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral therapy for conduct disorder and antisocial behavior.

AB This study examined the relationship between adolescent emotional adjustment and the family environment (i.e., family status, family process, and parental resources). This was done by way of multilevel analyses, with a sample of 2,636 parent-child couples of both intact and divorced families. The results indicated that adolescent emotional adjustment was clearly based on the family as well as on the individual. We found support for the hypothesis that growing up both in postdivorce families and in intact families with a low marital quality related negatively to adolescent emotional adjustment. Our hypothesis that parental resources, in the form of parental support, parent-adolescent relationship, and parental psychological health, partly mediate the negative association between low marital quality and divorce on one hand and youngsters' adjustment on the other hand was also confirmed. Growing up in postdivorce families was especially detrimental for the emotional adjustment of girls.

AB Background: Few data are available on the longitudinal psychological functioning of patients after pediatric heart transplantation. The objective of this study was to determine whether pre-transplant psychological functioning, post-transplant medical severity, and family functioning relate to the psychological functioning of pediatric patients after heart transplantation.
   Methods: The study included 23 patients who underwent heart transplantation between ages 3 and 20 years, survived at least 1 year after transplantation, and had been assessed previously after transplantation between 1993 and 1995. This study reports a second post-transplant assessment between 1999 and 2000. We assessed psychological functioning using the Children's Global Assessment Scale before and after heart transplantation. We assessed medical severity using the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and biopsies and using the, Side Effect Severity Scale. We used the Global Assessment of Family Relational Functioning Scale to rate family functioning.
   Results: The majority of patients (15/23) were alive at the second follow-up. They had survived a median of 0 (6.1-12.9) years after transplantation. Similar to their first follow-up assessments, 73% demonstrated good psychological functioning after heart transplantation. Although we found no correlation between medical severity and post-transplant psychological functioning, we did find a significant correlation between family functioning during the first 2 years of transplantation and post-transplant emotional adjustment.
   Conclusions: The majority of children and adolescents have the capacity for healthy psychological functioning after heart transplantation. Nevertheless, ongoing. psychological assessment and intervention is necessary for patients and their families who face pediatric heart transplantation because >25% probably will have emotional adjustment difficulties.

AB This article is a literature review relevant for clinical practice with autism spectrum disorders in childhood and adolescence. The primary purpose is to describe current psychological theories on cognitive processes that mediate autistic behavior. The secondary purpose is to give a summary of other clinically relevant aspects of autism spectrum disorders; e.g. regarding prevalence and aetiology. The symptoms of autism spectrum disorders are manifold and divided into three categories: Social deficits, communicative dysfunctions, and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviors. Different psychological theories have been developed in order to understand the cognitive and emotional processes in these autistic behaviors. Four psychological theories on the cognitive deficits associated with autism are discussed: Theory of Mind, Weak Central Coherence, Executive Functioning, and Script. Theory of Mind represents the ability to understand beliefs and desires of others. Weak Central Coherence is the term for a cognitive style characterized by an imbalance between local and global processing. Impairments in Executive Functioning are related to repetitive behavior and reduced mentalizing ability. The Script theory concerns the deficient ability of children with autism to generate cognitive models of social events. During adolescence, continuing social and emotional problems have been reported. A comprehensive psychological assessment is an essential part of the diagnostic process. Brain function associated with reduced mentalizing activity is hypothesized to involve weak connections between components in a complex network of cortical regions. A comprehensive psychological assessment is an essential part of the diagnostic process. Treatment is primarily based on psychological and educational interventions.

   EARLY ADOLESCENCE; 3-YEAR-OLD TWINS; CONDUCT DISORDER
AB Previous studies have emphasized the importance of rater issues in studying the etiology of variation in internalizing and externalizing problems in children. Earlier results indicate only moderate agreement between parents, and assume that parents assess a specific aspect of their child's behavior. In comparable samples of younger children, additive genetic effects are the main factor explaining individual differences in both internalizing and externalizing behavior. It is unknown whether this pattern of rater influences and variance decomposition will be consistent in older children. Child Behavior Checklists (Achenbach, 1991), completed by both parents, were collected in a sample of 2956 Dutch 10-year-old twin pairs. The etiology of individual differences in internalizing and externalizing syndromes was examined using a model that corrected for possible rater bias, rater-specific effects and unreliability. The best fitting model suggested that disagreement between the parents is not merely the result of unreliability and/or rater bias, but each parent also provides specific information from his/her own perspective on the child's behavior. Significant influences of additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental factors were found for internalizing and externalizing syndromes.

AB Background Siblings of children with cancer are at risk for reduced emotional support. The role of emotional social support in the psychological adjustment of siblings of paediatric cancer patients was examined, in the context of age and gender.
   Methods The sample consisted of two groups of siblings of children being treated for cancer: siblings referred for behaviour problems (n = 47) and a comparison group of non-referred siblings (n = 25). Forty-two were female, and 30 were male. The mean age was 10.31 years (SD = 2.71). Siblings completed measures of depression, anxiety, behaviour, and emotional social support. One parent of each sibling completed measures of sibling's behaviour and anxiety.
   Results Siblings who reported more social support endorsed significantly fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fewer behaviour problems, and their parents reported less anxiety and fewer behaviour problems than siblings who reported lower social support. Parents of referred siblings reported significantly more behaviour problems than parents of non-referred siblings. Referred adolescent females reported significantly higher depression scores and were perceived as more anxious than referred adolescent males and non-referred adolescent females. Non-referred younger siblings with high social support were perceived by their parents as having the fewest behaviour problems.
   Conclusions High level of social support appears to play a protective role in psychological adjustment of siblings of paediatric cancer patients, with age and gender as modifying factors. Although not all siblings develop behaviour or emotional problems, it is critical to identify those who do in order to intervene accordingly.

AB Cole, Martin, and Dennis (this issue) considered many important conceptual and methodological issues in their discussion of emotion regulation. Although it may be necessary to develop an integrated definition of the construct of emotion regulation, the definition provided in the Cole et al. article is too encompassing. It is important to differentiate emotion regulation from the effects of emotions on others and to differentiate among (a) regulation that stems from individuals external to the child versus behavior that is accomplished by the child, (b) behavior that is goal oriented versus unintentional, and Q regulation that is voluntary versus behavior that is less voluntarily controlled. An alternate definition of emotion-related self-regulation is provided.

AB Foster family applicants form the pool front which caregivers are selected for 75% of the 568 000 children in foster care. We know little about these applicants along dimensions thought to influence the behavioral and emotional adjustment of foster children. This limits our understanding of how best to recruit, assess, train, and support these applicants. This study examined the psychosocial functioning of 161 family foster care applicants in terms of parenting, family functioning, marital quality, psychological problems, and social support. It also examined demographic characteristics. The majority of men and women had one or more problems in psychosocial functioning, but most only had one or two problems. However, approximately 17% of women and 24% of men had three or more problems. Considerable diversity existed in demographic characteristics. Implications of these results for the recruitment, assessment, training, and support of foster family applicants are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Functional impairment is a key feature of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) of childhood. Aim: To compare impairment, illness attitudes and coping mechanisms in childhood CFS and in other paediatric disorders. Method: Participants were 28 children and adolescents with CFS, 30 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 27 with emotional disorders (ED). The measures used were interviews with children and parents, with detailed enquiry on impairment, including the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI), Illness Attitudes Scales (IAS), and Kidcope to measure coping styles in relation to common problems, illness and disability. Results: Children with CFS reported significantly more illness impairment, especially in school attendance, than those with JIA and ED. They had higher 'worry about illness' scores on the IAS. On the Kidcope they named school issues (work, expectations, attendance) as illness- or disability-related problems more than the other two groups. Fewer CFS participants reported using problem solving as a strategy to cope with illness and disability than with other problems in their lives. More in the CFS than in the JIA group used emotional regulation to cope with illness and disability. Fewer in the CFS than in the ED groups used social withdrawal to cope with illness and self-criticism for disability, but more used resignation to cope with disability. Conclusion: Severe illness-related impairment, particularly through school non-attendance, and high levels of illness-related school concerns appear specific to CFS. CFS may also have characteristically high levels of generalised illness worry and particular styles of coping with illness and disability.

AB This article reviews research linking a number of temperamental vulnerabilities to the development of severe conduct problems in children. Also reviewed are 2 areas of research that focus on important developmental processes that could mediate the relation between temperament and conduct problems. These processes are the development of emotional regulatory abilities and the development of the affective components of conscience. Both of these processes have been associated with certain temperamental vulnerabilities, and they can both place a child at risk for the development of conduct problems. Importantly, these 2 processes may designate children who develop conduct problems through distinct causal pathways and, as a result, could help to explain some of the subtypes of antisocial youth reported in past research.

AB Presented is a conceptual framework linking the construct of temperament with environmental factors that covary with the onset and escalation of substance use. We propose that transactions between temperament characteristics of the child in family and peer contexts influence the development of self-control ability, a mediating factor for onset and possible transition to abuse in later adolescence. Risk-promoting dimensions may influence the emergence of self-control by amplifying relationship processes that detract from competence development. Emergence of good self-control can serve as a resilience factor and is linked with health-promoting cognitions. We also suggest that temperament and self-control moderate links between parenting, peer associations, and substance use. Implications of the transactional model for clinical intervention and research are discussed.

AB Based on a sample of 1,218 students in the 10th and 11th grades, 14 variables measuring behavioral and emotional problems were modeled as four factors via confirmatory factor analysis. The factors were labeled Polydrug Use, Delinquency, Negative Affect, and Academic Orientation. A similar four-factor structure was supported I year later, and a cross-lagged autoregressive structural equation model indicated high stability but also some significant cross-lagged predictions. For instance, higher levels of Delinquency at Wave I predicted higher levels of Wave 2 Polydrug Use and Negative Affect and lower levels of Academic Orientation. Significant predictors common to the four factors included stressful life events and family social support. Specific predictive relations were indicated for particular temperament attributes and specific problem factors (e.g., high Activity Level predicted Delinquency; Behavioral Inflexibility predicted Negative Affect), and for peer substance use variables and specific problem factors (e.g., Peer Drug Use predicted Polydrug Use). The findings are discussed with regard to the need to use research designs and statistical models that facilitate the evaluation of the generality and specificity of influences on behavioral and emotional problems during adolescence.
