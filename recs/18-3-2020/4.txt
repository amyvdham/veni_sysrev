TI Assessing the marks of change: how psychotherapy alters the brain

AB Background: There is increasing evidence that psychotherapy can alter the function of the brain of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, it is not known whether psychotherapy can also modify the brain structure of patients with BPD. Methods: We used structural MRI data of female patients with BPD before and after participation in 12 weeks of residential dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) and compared them to data from female patients with BPD who received treatment as usual (TAU). We applied voxel-based morphometry to study voxel-wise changes in grey matter volume over time. Results: We included 31 patients in the DBT group and 17 in the TAU group. Patients receiving DBT showed an increase of grey matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus together with an alteration of grey matter volume in the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus compared with patients receiving TAU. Furthermore, therapy response correlated with increase of grey matter volume in the angular gyrus. Limitations: Only women were investigated, and groups differed in size, medication (controlled for) and intensity of the treatment condition. Conclusion: We found that DBT increased grey matter volume of brain regions that are critically implicated in emotion regulation and higher-order functions, such as mentalizing. The role of the angular gyrus for treatment response may reside in its cross-modal integrative function. These findings enhance our understanding of psychotherapy mechanisms of change and may foster the development of neurobiologically informed therapeutic interventions.

AB Emerging developmental perspectives suggest that adverse rearing environments promote neurocognitive adaptations that heighten impulsivity and increase vulnerability to risky behavior. Although studies document links between harsh rearing environments and impulsive behavior on substance use, the developmental hypothesis that impulsivity acts as mechanism linking adverse rearing environments to downstream substance use remains to be investigated. The present study investigated the role of impulsivity in linking child abuse and neglect with adult substance use using data from (a) a longitudinal sample of youth (Study 1, N = 9,421) and (b) a cross-sectional sample of adults (Study 2, N = 1,011). In Study 1, the links between child abuse and neglect and young adult smoking and marijuana use were mediated by increases in adolescent impulsivity. In Study 2, indirect links between child abuse and neglect and substance use were evidenced via delayed reward discounting and impulsivity traits. Among impulsivity subcomponents, robust indirect effects connecting childhood experiences to cigarette use emerged for negative urgency. Negative urgency, positive urgency, and sensation seeking mediated the effect of child abuse and neglect on cannabis and alcohol use. Results suggest that child abuse and neglect increases risk for substance use in part, due to effects on impulsivity. Individuals with adverse childhood experiences may benefit from substance use preventive intervention programs that target impulsive behaviors.

AB The Dysregulation Profile (DP) is a broad indicator of concurrent affective, behavioral, and cognitive dysregulation, often measured with the anxious/depressed, aggressive behavior, and attention problems syndrome scales of the Child Behavior Checklist. Despite an expanding body of research on the DP, knowledge of the normative developmental course of the DP from early childhood to adolescence is lacking. Furthermore, although we know that the DP longitudinally predicts personality pathology, no research yet has examined whether next to the DP in early childhood, the rate of change of the DP across development predicts personality pathology. Therefore, using cohort-sequential latent growth modeling in a population-based sample (N = 668), we examined the normative developmental course of mother-reported DP from ages 4 to 17 years and its associations with a wide range of adolescent-reported personality pathology dimensions 3 years later. The results showed that the DP follows a nonlinear developmental course with a peak in early adolescence. The initial level of the DP at age 4 and, to a lesser extent, the rate of change in the DP predicted a range of personality pathology dimensions in late adolescence. The findings suggest that the DP is a broad developmental precursor of personality pathology in late adolescence.

AB We examined associations between specific self-regulatory mechanisms and externalizing behavior patterns from ages 2 to 15 (N = 443). The relation between multiple self-regulatory indicators across multiple domains (i.e., physiological, attentional, emotional, and behavioral) at age 2 and at age 5 and group membership in four distinct externalizing trajectories was examined. By examining each of these self-regulatory processes in combination with one another, and therefore accounting for their shared variance, we aimed to better understand which specific self-regulatory skills were associated most strongly with externalizing behavioral patterns. Findings suggest that behavioral inhibitory control and emotion regulation are particularly important in distinguishing between children who show normative declines in externalizing behaviors across early childhood and those who demonstrate high levels through adolescence.

AB The objective of the current study was to apply the novel technique of time-varying effect modeling to examine age-varying associations between specific coping strategies and depressive symptoms across adolescence and emerging adulthood (ages 14-24). The participants were drawn from a community sample and followed across 4 years of high school and once 5 years postgraduation (N = 1,251, 53% female, 58% non-Hispanic White). Coping and depressive symptom questionnaires were administered across all data collection time points. Time-varying effect modeling used all available data (N = 5,651 measurement occasions) and adjusted for gender. Venting emotions and denial were associated with more depressive symptoms at a similar magnitude across adolescence and emerging adulthood. A positive association between problem solving oriented strategies (planning, active coping) and depressive symptoms was not observed until age 17.5, after which the magnitude of the association strengthened. More frequent instrumental and emotional support seeking were linked to fewer depressive symptoms between ages 18.8 and 23.6. More frequent use of humor was associated with greater depressive symptoms from ages 14.0 to 14.6, but with fewer depressive symptoms from ages 16.8 to 18.8. The findings illuminate when and how associations between specific coping strategies and depressive symptoms may emerge and change across developmental age, generating both theoretical and clinical implications.

AB Difficulties in emotion regulation are commonly reported among individuals with alcohol and drug addictions and contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Alterations in neural processing of negative affective stimuli have further been demonstrated among individuals with addictions. However, it is unclear whether these alterations are a general feature of addictions or are a result of prolonged exposure to drugs of abuse. To test the hypothesis of altered negative affect processing independent of drug effects, this study assessed neural function among drug-naive youth with a behavioral addiction-Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Fifty-six young adults (28 with IGD, 28 matched controls) participated in fMRI scanning during performance of a weal-validated emotion regulation task. Between-group differences In neural activity during task performance were assessed using a whole-brain, mixed-effects ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons at currently recommended thresholds (voxel-level p <0.001, pFWE <0.05). Compared to controls, youth with IGD exhibited significantly blunted neural responses within distributed subcortical and cortical regions including the striatum, insula, lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate in response to negative affective cues, as well as during emotion regulation. Independent component analysis (ICA) further identified between-group differences in engagement of a fronto-cingulo-parietal network, involving decreased engagement in IGD youth relative to controls. Study findings are largely consistent with those from prior neuroimaging studies in substance-use disorders, thus raising the possibility that neural processing of negative affect may be blunted across drug and behavioral addictions independent of acute or chronic drug effects.

AB Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at elevated risk for experiencing unipolar depressive symptoms and disorders. The current study describes the development of a behaviorally oriented depression preventive intervention tailored for adolescents with ADHD targeting variables empirically shown to mediate ADHD and depression (i.e., reward responsivity, emotion regulation, and family support). Eight adolescents with a history of ADHD and currently elevated depressive symptoms and their parents participated in an open trial of the Behaviorally Enhancing Adolescents' Mood (BEAM) program. Adolescents and their parents reported high satisfaction with BEAM. Staff reported BEAM was easy to implement with high adherence. Following BEAM, there were significant reductions in parent-report of adolescents' depressive symptoms and emotion regulation at posttreatment and the 6-week follow-up and adolescent-report of reward responsivity at posttreatment. Case vignettes are also provided to illustrate implementation of the BEAM program. In spite of the small sample, lack of a control group, and some discrepancies across informants, results overall support the feasibility and acceptability of the BEAM program, and suggest it has promise in reducing depressive symptoms in adolescents with ADHD.

AB This article presents research aimed to investigate the effect of perceived social support on an individual's resilience, with the assumption that it is, at least partially, indirect and that it is achieved through cognitive emotion regulation strategies. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used with a sample group of young adults, comprising 319 respondents from a student population of both genders. The results indicated that the perceived support of family, friends, and a significant other is a significant predictive factor for resilience-the more present these factors are, the greater the resilience. The relationship between the perceived support of friends and resilience is partially direct, and partially indirect, whereby both planning and positive reappraisal have the role of mediators. These results lead to the conclusion that the perceived support of friends is a significant protective factor for mental health, partially because of the fact that it makes an individual more prepared to see a certain stressful situation as an opportunity for personal growth and to actively confront it.

AB Theory and research suggest that parents' reactions to children's emotions play a critical role in teaching children effective emotion regulation (ER) skills, but no studies have directly examined the role that parent emotion socialization plays in the development of ER in children with ADHD. Gaining insight into the causes of impaired ER, particularly in youth with ADHD who are known to have poor ER, has important theoretical and translational significance. The present study is the first to longitudinally examine whether emotion socialization predicts later physiological and adult-reported measures of ER in children with and without ADHD. It also sought to determine if these relations are moderated by ADHD symptoms. Participants were 61 children (31 girls, 30 boys; M = 10.67 years, SD = 1.28) with and without clinically significant ADHD symptoms. At Time 1, parent reports of emotion socialization and parent- and teacher-report of child ADHD symptoms were collected. At Time 2, child ER measures were collected based on parent- and teacher-report and physiological reactivity during an impossible puzzle and a social rejection task. Physiological measures included respiratory sinus arrhythmia and skin conductance level (SCL). Supportive parenting practices were associated with better parent-rated emotion regulation skills for all children and greater SCL reactivity for children with high ADHD symptoms. Non-supportive parenting reactions were associated with greater adult-rated emotional lability for children with high ADHD symptoms. Results highlight the importance of considering multiple aspects of ER, including physiological manifestations. Findings suggest that parents' use of adaptive emotion socialization practices may serve as a protective factor for children's ER development and may be particularly critical for youth with ADHD. Our findings support the use of interventions addressing parent emotion socialization to help foster better ER in children.

AB Although decades of research have documented that children whose parents have a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are at a higher risk of developing depression themselves, not all of these children go on to develop depression themselves, thus highlighting the need to understand potential moderators of risk. The current study examined whether child emotion regulation, specifically, the use of cognitive reappraisal and suppression, moderated the link between parent and child depression. We recruited 458 parents and their children between the ages of 7-11 from the community. The majority of children were Caucasian (74.2%) and approximately half were girls (46.1%). Among children with a parent history of MDD, those who reported using cognitive reappraisal more frequently were less likely to have a history of depressive diagnoses themselves and had higher current levels of positive affect. Although children's use of suppression was not associated with their levels of depressive symptoms among children with a parent history of MDD, higher levels of suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms among children with no parent history of MDD. These findings suggest that, among children with a history of parent depression, children's use of cognitive reappraisal may influence their own risk for developing depression and highlights the potential utility of early interventions that focus on improving the use of emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal among children of depressed parents.

AB This study assessed the initial feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an intervention aimed at reducing dating violence and sexual risk behavior in a sample of adolescent girls (ages 14-17) with prior exposure to physical dating violence (DV). One hundred and nine girls were randomly assigned to Date SMART (Skills to Manage Aggression in Relationships for Teens) or a Knowledge-only (KO) comparison group. Both intervention arms consisted of six, weekly 2-h sessions and one "booster" session 6 weeks later. Based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, the Date SMART intervention was designed to target common underlying skills deficits linked to both DV and sexual risk behavior in adolescent females: depression, self-regulation deficits, and interpersonal skills deficits. Assessments were administered at four time points (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months). The Date SMART group was effective as reducing sexual DV involvement across the 9-month follow-up period. Both groups evidenced clinically meaningful reductions in physical, emotional, and digital DV involvement, total time in dating relationships, as well as reductions in depression. Findings indicate that delivering a DV and sexual risk prevention intervention to DV-affected adolescent girls is feasible and well-received. Furthermore, a skills-based approach that addresses the co-occurrence of DV and sexual risk behavior may be particularly useful for promoting reductions of sexual DV among high-risk adolescent girls. A future, large-scale trial with an inactive comparison condition is needed to evaluate the efficacy of Date SMART further.

AB Parenting interventions are an effective strategy to reduce children's conduct problems. For some families, that is, not all families benefit equally. Individual trials tend to be underpowered and often lack variability to differentiate between families how benefit less or more. Integrating individual family level data across trials, we aimed to provide more conclusive results about often presumed key family (parental education and ethnic background) and child characteristics (problem severity, ADHD symptoms and emotional problems) as putative moderators of parenting intervention effects. We included data from 786 families (452 intervention; 334 control) from all four trials on the Incredible Years parenting intervention in The Netherlands (three randomized; one matched control). Children ranged between 2 and 10 years (M = 5.79; SD = 1.66). Of the families, 31% had a lower educational level and 29% had an ethnic minority background. Using multilevel regression, we tested whether each of the putative moderators affected intervention effects. Incredible Years reduced children's conduct problems (d = - .34). There were no differential effects by families' educational or ethnic background, or by children's level of ADHD symptoms. Children with more severe conduct problems and those with more emotional problems benefited more. Post hoc sensitivity analyses showed that for the two trials with longer-term data, moderation effects disappeared at 4 or 12 months follow-up. Often assumed moderators have some, but limited abilities to explain who benefits from parenting interventions. This suggests the need for studying theoretically more precise moderators in prevention research, other than relatively static family characteristics alone.

AB Cross-informant ratings of are considered gold standard for child behavioral assessment. To date, little work has examined informant ratings of adaptive functioning for youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a large, diverse sample of youth with ASD, this study evaluated parent-teacher concordance of ratings of adaptive functioning and ASD-specific symptomatology across time. The impact of child clinical characteristics on concordance was also examined. Participants included 246 children, their caregivers and teachers. Parent-teacher concordance was variable but generally consistent across time. Concordance was significantly impacted by autism severity and child cognitive abilities. Findings inform the broader concordance literature and support the need to consider child clinical factors when assessing child functioning in samples of children with ASD.

AB There may be significant differences in coping styles across ethnicities. Previous research has suggested disparities in the number of individuals who utilize repressive adaptive coping style among cultural groups. Repressive adaptive style is a coping mechanism in which individuals report low distress levels while they actually experience high levels of stress. Developing an enhanced understanding of the prevalence of the utilization of repressive adaptive style in different ethnic groups is important for informing intervention techniques to better account for the cultural influences on mental health. The present study investigated the utilization of repressive adaptive style across American Indian (n = 31), African American (n = 53), and European American (n = 48) children in the Midwest. The age range of the children was 10 to 13 years and 50.8% were male. Dependent measures included the Children's Social Desirability Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. Results indicated significant differences in reports of anxiety between ethnic groups. Additionally, it was discovered that African American and European American children utilized repressive adaptive style more than American Indian children, albeit not significantly. Because of the high rates of suicide and emotional distress believed to be experienced by American Indian children this result is interesting. Continued research investigating protective factors, such as high levels of cultural identity and connectedness, is warranted.

AB Background: Despite the high persistence rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) throughout the lifespan, there is a considerable gap in knowledge regarding effective treatment strategies for adolescents with ADHD. This group in particular often shows substantial psychosocial impairment, low compliance and insufficient response to psychopharmacological interventions. Effective and feasible treatments should further consider the developmental shift in ADHD symptoms, comorbidity and psychosocial adversity as well as family dysfunction. Thus, individualised interventions for adolescent ADHD should comprise a multimodal treatment strategy. The randomised controlled ESCAadol study addresses the needs of this patient group and compares the outcome of short-term cognitive behavioural therapy with parent-based telephone-assisted self-help.
   Methods/design: In step 1, 160 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD will undergo a treatment as usual (TAU) observation phase of 1 month. In step 2, those still severely affected are randomised to the intervention group with an Individualised Modular Treatment Programme (IMTP) or a telephone-assisted self-help programme for parents (TASH) as an active control condition. The IMTP was specifically designed for the needs of adolescent ADHD. It comprises 10 sessions of individual cognitive behavioural therapy with the adolescents and/or the parents, for which participants choose three out of 10 available focus modules (e.g. organisational skills and planning, emotion regulation, problem solving and stress management, dysfunctional family communication). TASH combines a bibliotherapeutic component with 10 counselling sessions for the parents via telephone. Primary outcome is the change in ADHD symptoms in a clinician-rated diagnostic interview. Outcomes are assessed at inclusion into the study, after the TAU phase, after the intervention phase and after a further 12-week follow-up period. The primary statistical analysis will be by intention-to-treat, using linear regression models. Additionally, we will analyse psychometric and biological predictors and moderators of treatment response.
   Discussion: ESCAadol compares two short-term non-pharmacological interventions as cost-efficient and feasible treatment options for adolescent ADHD, addressing the specific needs and obstacles to treatment success in this group. We aim to contribute to personalised medicine for adolescent ADHD intended to be implemented in routine clinical care.

AB Although emotion regulatory processes and affective experiences have been explored among extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1000 g) survivors in childhood, little is known about these processes among ELBW survivors in adulthood. Furthermore, still less is known about whether ELBW survivors with neurosensory impairments (NSI) differ in emotion regulatory processes than ELBW survivors without NSI. Participants comprised 100 ELBW survivors (80 without NSI and 20 with NSI) and 89 normal birth weight (NBW) controls matched on age, familial socioeconomic status, and sex in childhood who were prospectively followed into adulthood. At age 30-35 years, participants completed self-report measures, including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Affective Styles Questionnaire. ELBW survivors reported significantly less positive affect than NBW participants. As well, ELBW survivors with NSI reported a higher tolerance of negative emotions and more concealment of emotions from others compared to ELBW individuals without NSI. These findings of differential emotion regulatory processes and affective experiences in ELBW and NBW may underlie increased rates of psychopathology observed among some ELBW adult survivors.

AB Mindfulness has been demonstrated to have positive effects on children's emotional functioning, and adaptive parenting practices are associated with fewer emotional problems. However, the association between mindful parenting and adolescent emotional problems has not been studied much. In the current study, the indirect path from mindful parenting to adolescent emotional problems was examined, with maternal warmth and adolescent dispositional mindfulness as potential mediators. A sample of 168 mother-child dyads participated in this study. A serial indirect effects model showed mother's mindful parenting could decrease adolescent emotional problems through adolescent's perceived maternal warmth and their dispositional mindfulness. Findings of this study imply that intervention in mindful parenting may have benefits for adolescents' emotional problems through enhancing maternal warmth and children's trait mindfulness.

TI Rapunzel syndrome: an infrequent cause of severe iron deficiency anemia
   and abdominal pain presenting to the pediatric emergency department
SO BMC PEDIATRICS

   Trichobezoar; Trichophagia; Trichotillomania; Case report
ID GASTRIC TRICHOBEZOAR; TRICHOTILLOMANIA; BEZOARS; MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and abdominal pain are commonly seen in a pediatric emergency department (8 and 18% incidence respectively in our center). They are manifestations of a wide variety of diseases ranging from benign to immediately life-threatening. Trichobezoar is an under-diagnosed entity that has to be considered in children and adolescents, expecially female, suffering from trichotillomania (compulsion to pull hair) and trichophagy (compulsion to swallow hair). When undiagnosed, gastric bezoars may cause gastric ulceration, perforation, haemorrhage and obstruction.
   Case presentation: To underline the importance of including this pathology in the differential diagnosis of IDA and abdominal pain, we present the case of a 14 year-old girl with a huge trichobezoar which completely filled the stomach and extended into the small bowel. Since trichobezoar has an extension to the small bowel, it is classified as Rapunzel syndrome. As the bezoar couldn't be removed by endoscopy, the girl underwent surgical intervention. The patient passed through a gradual re-feeding, with iron and vitamins supplementation, and through a psychiatric counselling.
   Conclusion: The Rapunzel syndrome is a rare entity that may be complicated by life-threatening events. A prompt diagnosis and an appropriate therapy can reduce comorbidities. Gradual re-feeding with supplementation of micronutrients allows adequate catch-up weight with normalization of haematochemical nutritional parameters. Since many of these patients suffer from psychiatric pathology such as PICA with emotional problems and mental retardation, psychological/psychiatric counselling plays an important role in order to prevent bezoar recurrence.

AB Violent acts on university campuses are becoming more frequent. Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant chi(2) difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (rs 0.92-1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.

AB Intrapersonal emotion regulation refers to individuals' ability to effectively manage and respond to their own emotional experience. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) is one of the main self-reporting tools assessing intrapersonal emotion regulation in middle age children and adolescents. This instrument measures the frequency of use of two types of emotion regulation strategies, the cognitive reappraisal and the expressive suppression. The ERQ-CA only focused on the frequency of use of these strategies, thus a parallel set of items measuring the efficacy of use of the cognitive reappraisal and of the expressive suppression has been recently proposed in adults. As no self-reporting tool assessing emotion regulation in middle-age children has yet been validated in a French sample, this study aimed to validate the French version of the ERQ-CA and the parallel set of items exploring the efficacy of use of the two emotion regulation strategies in children and adolescents. A power analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation recommended a sample size of 140 participants. Therefore, a total of 140 children and adolescents (66 girls, mean age = 12.30 years; SD = 2.59 years; range = 8-16 years) were included in this study. Confirmatory Factorial Analyses confirmed the soundness of the two-factor solution for the ERQ-CA and the parallel set of items (RMSEA <.058; SRMR <.063; CFI >.93). Given the low numbers of items in the ERQ-CA, internal consistency was good (alpha >.70). This study confirmed that the ERQ-CA is an appropriate instrument to assess the frequency of use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in children and adolescents. In addition, this study demonstrated the validity of the parallel set of items to evaluate the efficacy of use of these two strategies. The combination of these two instruments should thus contribute to increase our understanding of the development of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in children and adolescents. Further studies should be conducted to establish robust norms that can be useful in clinical practice.

AB ObjectiveThe Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was developed for clinicians and researchers as a brief screening instrument for behavioural and emotional problems in children. Administered in its traditional pen-and-paper format, the SDQ has demonstrated sound psychometric properties. The SDQ is increasingly being administered online, despite there being little evaluation of the psychometric properties and norms of the instrument in this new administrative context, and none in an Australian (or English-speaking) sample. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to explore the psychometric properties and present normative data for the online administration of the parent-report version of the SDQ in an Australian sample.
   MethodsParticipants were parents (n=1,070) of Australian primary school-aged children (5 to 12 years) who completed the SDQ online via a web-based software program.
   ResultsResults demonstrate sound psychometric properties for the SDQ in its online administrative format that are comparable to previous Australian studies utilising the traditional pen-and-paper format of the SDQ. Moreover, we provide normative data on the SDQ subscales, as well as the impact supplement when administered online.
   ConclusionsTogether, the results support the use of the SDQ online, and provide emerging evidence that the psychometric properties and the norms for the parent-report SDQ in an English-speaking sample are similar regardless of online versus pen-and-paper administration.

AB Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional risk factor involving maladaptive responding under conditions of uncertainty. Recent data indicate that IU is likely elevated in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is positively correlated with anxiety. This study examined whether IU may be associated with ASD independent of anxiety. Relationships between anxiety, ASD, and IU were examined in 57 children with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability and 32 control participants, ages 7-16 years. Hierarchal linear regressions were run to examine whether ASD variables, including emotion dysregulation, were predictive of IU when controlling for anxiety. Severity of social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were each related to IU when controlling for the effects of anxiety. When these variables were entered into the regression model together, emotion dysregulation was the only significant predictor of IU. These findings suggest that IU is directly related to features of ASD possibly due to shared genetic, neurological, or psychological underpinnings. Autism Res2018, 11: 636-644.

   Lay SummaryYouth with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability experience high levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), which is related to anxiety. This study found that IU may also have a relationship with certain aspects of ASD, particularly emotion dysregulation.

AB This study aimed to assess whether groups of aggressive children differed on psychopathic traits, and neuropsychological and neurobiological measures of prefrontal functioning consistent with the objectives of their aggression-reactive or proactive. Including 110 typically developing children (9-11 years), a latent class analysis identified a low aggression group, a high reactive aggression group, and a mixed (high reactive and proactive) aggression group. Results show high callous-unemotional traits and low resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia increased the likelihood of children being in the mixed aggression group, when compared to the reactive and low aggression groups. However, deficits in planning and inhibitory control increased the likelihood of children being in the reactive aggression group, when compared to the mixed and low aggression groups. Executive functioning deficits did not differentiate the mixed group from the low aggression group. These findings highlight psychobiological and executive functioning differences that may explain heterogeneity in childhood aggression.

AB Recent interest has emerged in understanding the neural mechanisms by which deficits in emotion regulation (ER) early in development may relate to later depression. Corticolimbic alterations reported in emotion dysregulation and depression may be one possible link. We examined the relationships between emotion dysregulation in school age, corticolimbic resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in preadolescence, and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Participants were 143 children from a longitudinal preschool onset depression study who completed the Children Sadness Management Scale (CSMS; measuring ER), Child Depression Inventory (CDI-C; measuring depressive symptoms), and two resting-state MRI scans. Rs-FC between four primary regions of interest (ROIs; bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC] and amygdala) and six target ROIs thought to contribute to ER were examined. Findings showed that ER in school age did not predict depressive symptoms in adolescence, but did predict preadolescent increases in dlPFC-insula and dlPFC-ventromedial PFC rs-FC across diagnosis, as well as increased dlPFC-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) rs-FC in children with a history of depression. Of these profiles, only dlPFC-dACC rs-FC in preadolescence predicted depressive symptoms in adolescence. However, dlPFC-dACC connectivity did not mediate the relationship between ER in school age and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Despite the absence of a direct relationship between ER and depressive symptoms and no significant rs-FC mediation, the rs-FC profiles predicted by ER are consistent with the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation is associated with abnormalities in top-down control functions. The extent to which these relationships might confer greater risk for later depression, however, remains unclear.

AB Cyberbullying research has uncovered several contextual and personal risk factors for cybervictimization, but their interaction has not received much attention. However, the combined influence of several individual and situational factors and the interplay between them may have a different influence on the risk of cybervictimization than each factor separately. Therefore, this longitudinal moderated mediation study, conducted among a large sample of early adolescents, examined how the events adolescents experience in daily life influence their risk of being victimized online via the emotions they experience, and whether this process is moderated by differences in adolescents' habitual tendencies to regulate their emotions (affective styles). The results indicated that negative events were directly and indirectly, via experiencing negative emotions, related to later cybervictimization. Furthermore, the association between negative events and emotions was moderated by concealing and tolerating affective styles: Adolescents who habitually concealed or tolerated their emotions were more likely to experience negative emotions associated with negative events, especially when they experienced few negative events. These findings illustrate the importance of taking person-environment-interactions into account when studying cyberbullying and support the implementation of prevention and intervention programs that assist students in developing adaptive emotion regulation and coping skills.

AB Objective: We aimed to provide an overview of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Longitudinal Studies of ADHD. Methods: We evaluated and followed samples of boys and girls with and without ADHD ascertained from psychiatric and pediatric sources and their families. Results: These studies documented that ADHD in both sexes is associated with high levels of persistence into adulthood, high levels of familiality with ADHD and other psychiatric disorders, a wide range of comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, learning disabilities, executive function deficits, emotional dysregulation, and autistic traits as well as functional impairments. The MGH studies suggested that stimulant treatment decreased risks of developing comorbid psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and functional outcomes. The MGH studies documented the neural basis of persistence of ADHD using neuroimaging. Conclusion: The MGH studies provided various insights on symptoms, course, functions, comorbidities, and neuroscience of ADHD.

AB Background: We have known for some time that being bullied was associated with children's and adolescents' adjustment difficulties and well-being. In recent years, we have come to recognise that the impact of childhood bullying victimisation on the development of mental health problems is more complex. This paper aims to review the evidence for an independent contribution of childhood bullying victimisation to the development of poor outcomes throughout the life span, including mental, physical and socioeconomic outcomes, and discuss the implications for policy and practice. Findings: Existing research indicates that (a) being bullied in childhood is associated with distress and symptoms of mental health problems. This large body of evidence supports actions aimed at reducing the occurrence of bullying behaviours; (b) the consequences of childhood bullying victimisation can persist up to midlife and, in addition to mental health, can impact physical and socioeconomic outcomes. These new findings indicate that interventions should also focus on supporting victims of bullying and helping them build resilience; (c) research has identified some factors that predispose children to be targeted by bullying behaviours. These studies suggest that public health interventions could aim at preventing children from becoming the target of bullying behaviours from an early age. Conclusions: It is a truism to emphasise that further work is needed to understand why and how young people's aspirations are often cut short by this all too common adverse social experience. In parallel, we must develop effective strategies to tackle this form of abuse and its consequences for the victims. Addressing bullying in childhood could not only reduce children's and adolescents' mental health symptoms but also prevent psychiatric and socioeconomic difficulties up to adulthood and reduce considerable costs for society.

AB Objective: Emotion regulation (ER) includes a set of cognitive and attentional processes used to change or maintain emotional state. A small but growing body of research suggests that maladaptive ER might be a risk factor for the development of chronic pain. This review aims to summarize existing literature on the association between ER and chronic pain, and to determine whether the construct of ER may further enhance our understanding of the risk and protective factors that may contribute to the onset and maintenance of chronic pain.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the search terms "chronic pain" and "emotion regulation." Studies that measured both constructs across all age groups were included.
   Results: We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Nine studies were completed within the last five years, suggesting that the evaluation of ER as it relates to pain is a new line of research. Studies that measured "response-focused" ER found associations between maladaptive ER and pain. Studies that measured "antecedent focused" ER strategies were less likely to show a direct association with pain.
   Conclusion: Maladaptive response-focused ER may be an important risk factor in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, as it is associated with pain and psychological comorbidities. Adding ER to chronic pain investigations may help to further explain individual differences in the risk and protective mechanisms that are known to influence chronic pain. Importantly, this line of research has potential to directly inform future interventions for patients with chronic pain.

AB The CaR-FA-X model (Williams et al., 2007), or capture and rumination (CaR), functional avoidance (FA), and impaired executive control (X), is a model of overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM). Two mechanisms of the model, rumination and executive control, were examined in isolation and in interaction in order to investigate OGM over time. Across two time points, six months apart, a total of 149 adolescents (13-16 years) completed the minimal-instruction autobiographical memory test, a measure of executive control with both emotional and nonemotional stimuli, and measures of brooding rumination and reflective pondering. The results showed that executive control for emotional information was negatively associated with OGM, but only when reflective pondering levels were high. Therefore, in the context of higher levels of reflective pondering, greater switch costs (i.e., lower executive control) when processing emotional information predicted a decrease in OGM over time.

AB Self-efficacy beliefs in emotion regulation were shown to foster well-being and psychosocial adaptation over time. In this study, we investigated their relationship with daily affect intensity among 199 adolescents aged 15-19. Participants completed the Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy Scale measuring perceived capability to manage the experience and expression of negative emotions (SE-NE) and positive emotions (SE-PO). Through Experience Sampling Method, for 1 week they also repeatedly rated their positive affect (happiness and contentment) and negative affect (anger, anxiety, sadness). Multilevel regression models revealed an additive intensifying predictive effect of SE-PO and SE-NE on happiness and contentment, and a single direct negative effect of SE-NE on sadness. Models also highlighted an interactive effect of SE-PO and SE-NE on all negative affect variables, such that only at low SE-PO levels did high SE-NE predict lower negative affect. Findings support the relation between adolescents' regulatory emotional self-efficacy beliefs and their daily affect intensity, bringing forward suggestions for intervention.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a current public health problem and among the main causes of mortality in adolescents and young adults. The main goal of this study was to analyse suicidal ideation in a representative sample of Spanish adolescents. Specifically, the prevalence rates of suicide ideation, the psychometric properties of the Paykel Suicide Scale (PSS) scores, and the socio-emotional adjustment of adolescents at risk for suicide were analysed.
   Material and methods: The sample consisted of 1,664 participants (M = 16.12 years, SD = 1.36, range 14-19 years), selected by stratified sampling by clusters. The instruments used were the PSS, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Personal Wellbeing Index-School Children, and the Oviedo Infrequency Scale.
   Results: The results showed that 4.1% of the sample indicated that they had tried to commit suicide in the previous year. Statistically significant differences were found according to gender but not according to age in the PSS mean scores. The analysis of the internal structure of the PSS showed that the one-dimensional model presented excellent goodness of fit indexes. This model showed measurement invariance across gender. The reliability of the scores, estimated with ordinal alpha, was 0.93. Participants who reported suicide ideation showed poorer mental health status and lower life satisfaction compared to the non-suicide ideation group.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is present during adolescence and is associated with poor subjective well-being and increased emotional and behavioural problems. PSS seems to show adequate psychometric behaviour to assess suicidal ideation in adolescents.

AB Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology was used to examine the emotional context of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Forty-seven adolescents and young adults used a novel smartphone app to monitor their emotional experiences, NSSI thoughts, and NSSI behaviors for 2weeks. Momentary changes in both negative and positive emotions predicted greater intensity of NSSI thoughts at the subsequent assessment, while only increases in negative emotion predicted NSSI behaviors. Immediately following NSSI behaviors participants reported reduced high-arousal negative emotions and increased low-arousal positive emotions, suggesting that NSSI may be an efficient and effective method of regulating emotion. Findings highlight the importance of addressing emotion regulation in NSSI interventions.

AB Early adulthood stage refers to a time of life that is neither childhood nor adulthood but rather somewhere in between. A young man in his early adulthood stage may feel stressed due to various instances in his/her transitional phase of life into adulthood. Life today is becoming increasingly complex, tension-ridden and a great source of stress. To successfully manage stress in everyday lives, individuals must learn to use various techniques of coping.
   In the present study, through a qualitative inquiry the investigators tried to explore in-depth about the psychosocial catalysts of stress experience of the youth population. That is, through the present study investigators tried to identify the factors which accelerate and decelerate stress of youth in early adulthood stage. The sample consisted of 150 males and females, age ranging from 20-40 years, from various districts of Kerala State, India. Data was collected using semi-structured interview technique, and analysis was done using content analysis technique.
   Five major psychosocial catalysts which increase the stress level of the participants were identified. This includes stress due to situational factors, personal factors, social Factors, Emotional factors and Health Factors. Four main factors evolved as reducing the stress of participants. They include cognitive factors, personal factors, social factors and other factors. Results of the study indicated that catalysts might be utilized in stress management techniques.

AB This article provides a quantitative and conceptual review of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed young people, and informs future directions in the field. Despite long-standing interest in the influence of emotion regulation difficulties on different internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders in childhood, several questions remain unresolved with respect to children and adolescents with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Meta-analytic data from adult victims suggest that emotion regulation problems are associated with PTSD, but this has never been studied in children and young people. We therefore provide a conceptual review of features related to the phenomenology, assessment, severity and treatment of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed children and young people. We combine this with a meta-analysis of published literature. We searched studies in Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase databases based on pre-selected criteria. Eight hundred and eighty-six papers were identified and 41 were included. We found that children and adolescents with a diagnosis of PTSD reported more emotion regulation difficulties than those who did not develop PTSD, and that the overall association between the two symptom dimensions was moderately strong. We identify a number of research priorities: the development of instruments to assess emotion regulation difficulties in children, the design of studies that describe its prevalence in young epidemiological traumatized samples, its predictive role in the onset, severity and persistence of post-traumatic symptoms, and its relevance as a moderator, outcome or treatment target for young survivors.

AB Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are associated with increased emotional problems which, in turn, exacerbate functional impairment. However, irritability, which relates both to internalizing and externalizing problems, has not been specifically examined in these youths. Irritability may be common and adversely impact functioning in pediatric FAPD, particularly for males who are more likely to experience such symptoms. The current study examined the relationship between irritability and psychosocial and pain-related impairment in youth with FAPD. Data were gathered as part of a larger study examining a psychological treatment for youth with FAPD and were compared to previously published data on irritability in healthy controls and in youth with severe emotional dysregulation. For the current study, participants (ages 9-14) with FAPD and caregivers completed measures of child irritability, pain-related and psychosocial functioning, and parent functioning. Pearson correlations revealed significant positive associations between irritability and anxiety, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and caregiver distress. Results also indicated that parents reported significantly greater irritability in males, but males and females reported similar rates of irritability. Gender moderated the relationship between child-report of irritability and anxiety only. Future research may include tailoring of behavioral intervention approaches for pediatric FAPD to specifically target symptoms of irritability.

AB This paper describes a case study of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy applied to the problems in a mother's interaction with her family. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is implemented using metaphors and exercises in seven clinical sessions with the mother. Psychological flexibility, experiential avoidance, behavior control, acceptance of private events and coherence of valued actions were assessed. The Valued Living Questionnaire was also used. The results show a decrease in control and avoidance behavior. Both mother and son's acceptance and valued actions increased at the end of the treatment and were maintained at follow-up. The treatment established a flexible behavioral repertoire not only by the mother, who received direct intervention, but was also in her son's behavior. The effects of her treatment are reflected in her son, suggesting two-way psychological flexibility between mother and son.

AB Background: The co-occurrence of disordered eating and alcohol use and misuse has frequently been highlighted in literature.
   Method: The first aim of the present study was to examine the association of drunkorexia with various disordered eating behaviors and alcohol consumption in a sample of male and female adolescents. The second goal was to investigate the motivations underlying drunkorexia and the third goal was to examine the relationship between drunkorexia and different dimensions of emotion regulation. One thousand adolescents (608 females and 392 males; range 16-21) completed a survey of self-report measures.
   Results: Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that fasting and engaging in binge drinking and getting drunk were significant predictors of drunkorexia in both males and females; furthermore, females were found to engage in drunkorexia mainly for enhancement motives. Conversely, drunkorexia in males was significantly predicted by difficulties regulating emotions.
   Conclusion: This research suggests that disordered eating and alcohol use similarly contribute to drunkorexia in male and female adolescents, even though highlights important gender differences.

AB Emotion differentiation is the ability to identify and label emotional experiences into discrete categories. The present study examined the influence of emotion regulation difficulties, emotion differentiation, and emotional state-specifically sad versus positive mood-on caloric intake in a laboratory setting. Undergraduate participants completed a series of questionnaires, including measures of emotion regulation difficulties and emotion differentiation, and then underwent a randomly assigned sad or positive mood induction. Afterwards, they participated in a taste test. Food was counted before and after the taste test to determine total caloric intake. Results showed that negative emotion differentiation was significantly inversely associated with overall caloric intake, such that low negative emotion differentiators ate more regardless of mood induction group. Positive emotion differentiation was not associated with caloric intake. Additional analysis found that negative emotion differentiation mediated the relation between emotion regulation difficulties and caloric intake. An alternative model found that emotion regulation difficulties did not mediate the relation between negative emotion differentiation and caloric intake. Our results suggest that reducing caloric intake among individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may involve incorporating strategies to specifically target the ability to differentiate between emotions.

AB Negative affect and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies are associated with eating-disorder (ED) psychopathology. Depressive rumination is a maladaptive cognitive style associated with the onset, maintenance, and severity of ED psychopathology among both clinical and nonclinical samples. However, although anger is also strongly associated with ED behaviors, the associations between angry rumination and ED psychopathology, as well as mechanisms of the relationships between rumination and ED psychopathology, remain largely unknown. The current study sought to examine the unique influences of trait depressive and angry rumination on ED psychopathology and whether trait negative urgency (i.e., responding rashly to negative affect) mediated these relationships. Study 1 sampled undergraduate students (N= 119) cross-sectionally and longitudinally (five months), and Study 2 sampled patients with eating disorders (N= 85). All participants completed questionnaires assessing angry rumination, depressive rumination, ED psychopathology, and negative urgency. Angry rumination had consistent indirect effects on ED psychopathology via negative urgency among both clinical and nonclinical samples. However, there was mixed support for the influence of depressive rumination: whereas depressive rumination showed total and indirect effects on ED psychopathology in Study 1 cross-sectional analyses, no total or indirect effects emerged in Study 1 longitudinal analyses or in Study 2. Associations between depressive rumination and ED psychopathology may reflect the strong overlap between angry and depressive rumination. Interventions targeting angry rumination and negative urgency may enhance prevention and treatment of disordered eating across eating disorder diagnosis and severity.

AB Objective: The Your Own Greatness Affirmed (YOGA) for Youth program delivers yoga to urban inner-city schools with the goal of providing practical benefits that support underserved children at high risk of behavioral and emotional problems. A 10-week YOGA for Youth program delivered 1 to 2 times per week was implemented in 3 schools in urban neighborhoods to examine the effect of the program on student stress, affect, and resilience. Methods: Thirty children were administered the Perceived Stress Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Resilience Scale before and after the yoga program. After the program, informal qualitative interviews were conducted with school teachers, yoga teachers, and students to determine the overall impact of the yoga program. Results: The quantitative results of this study indicated that the yoga program significantly improved students stress (p < 0.05), positive affect (p < 0.05), and resilience (p < 0.001). The qualitative results indicated that students, school teachers, and yoga teachers all found the program to be beneficial for students' well-being. Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggest that the YOGA for Youth program may provide students in low-income urban schools with behavioral skills that will protect against risk factors associated with the development of behavioral and emotional problems.

   HOOKUPS
AB Purpose: Although previous studies have elucidated associations between motivations for drinking and sex as they relate to risky health outcomes among female college students, the utility of cross-domain motives(i.e., alcohol motives predicting sex-related outcomes and vice versa) in the prediction of specific alcohol- and sex related behaviors has yet to be examined. The current study examined relations between drinking and sex motives with multiple risky alcohol- and sex-related outcomes (i.e., alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, alcohol consumption prior to sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners [vaginal, oral, anal], and emergency contraception use).
   Procedures: Multiple structural equation models were used to examine univariate and multivariate associations among drinking and sex motives and specific outcomes in a sample of female undergraduates with lifetime histories of alcohol use and sexual activity (N = 436; 77% White, 21% Hispanic).
   Results: Findings indicated differential associations between motives and specific outcomes across univariate versus multivariate analyses. Multivariate models indicated greater endorsement of enhancement and less endorsement of intimacy sex motives were significantly associated with heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems, whereas alcohol motives were less reliably linked to sex-related outcomes. When considered simultaneously, sex motives accounted for more variance in some alcohol outcomes relative to certain drinking motives.
   Conclusions: Cross-domain motives may be useful in predicting risky outcomes among female college students. Research implications include the importance of examining motive-behavior relations in univariate and multivariate contexts. Clinical implications include cross-domain motive assessment and use of emotion regulation strategies to reduce emotionally-motivated maladaptive alcohol- and sex-related behaviors.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death and a complex clinical outcome. Here, we summarize the current state of research pertaining to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth. We review their definitions/measurement and phenomenology, epidemiology, potential etiological mechanisms, and psychological treatment and prevention efforts. Results: We identify key patterns and gaps in knowledge that should guide future work. Regarding epidemiology, the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth varies across countries and sociodemographic populations. Despite this, studies are rarely conducted cross-nationally and do not uniformly account for high-risk populations. Regarding etiology, the majority of risk factors have been identified within the realm of environmental and psychological factors (notably negative affect-related processes), and most frequently using self-report measures. Little research has spanned across additional units of analyses including behavior, physiology, molecules, cells, and genes. Finally, there has been growing evidence in support of select psychotherapeutic treatment and prevention strategies, and preliminary evidence for technology-based interventions. Conclusions: There is much work to be done to better understand suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth. We strongly encourage future research to: (1) continue improving the conceptualization and operationalization of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; (2) improve etiological understanding by focusing on individual (preferably malleable) mechanisms; (3) improve etiological understanding also by integrating findings across multiple units of analyses and developing short-term prediction models; (4) demonstrate greater developmental sensitivity overall; and (5) account for diverse high-risk populations via sampling and reporting of sample characteristics. These serve as initial steps to improve the scientific approach, knowledge base, and ultimately prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth.

AB This study examined (a) the potential mediating roles of effortful control and classroom engagement in the association between harsh parenting and adolescent academic achievement, and (b) the potential moderating role of gender. Sixth through eighth graders in rural China (n = 815, mean age = 12.55 years) reported on harsh parenting, effortful control, and classroom engagement. Parents also reported on each other's harsh parenting. Academic achievement was assessed by students' test scores and teacher-rated academic performance. Results of structural equation modeling revealed gender differences in patterns of association among the model variables. Harsh parenting was negatively and directly associated with academic achievement for both boys and girls. It was also negatively and indirectly associated with academic achievement via effortful control and classroom engagement sequentially, forming a common indirect "path" for boys and girls. The indirect negative effect of harsh parenting on boys' academic achievement was mainly realized through the mediator of effortful control, whereas this same indirect effect for girls was mainly realized through the mediator of classroom engagement. Jointly, effortful control and classroom engagement precipitates more indirect effects for boys than for girls in the association between harsh parenting and academic achievement. The discussion analyzes the potential "paths" from harsh parenting to adolescent academic achievement, as well as gender differences in these "paths." The current study has implications for teachers and parents eager to improve students' classroom engagement and academic achievement.

AB Objective Concerns over behavioral and emotional problems caused by excessive internet usage have been developed. This study intended to develop and a standardize questionnaire that can efficiently identify at-risk internet users through their internet usage habits.
   Methods Participants (n = 158) were recruited at six I-will-centers located in Seoul, South Korea. From the initial 36 questionnaire item pool, 28 preliminary items were selected through expert evaluation and panel discussions. The construct validity, internal consistency, and concurrent validity were examined. We also conducted Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis to assess diagnostic ability of the Internet Overuse Screening-Questionnaire (IOS-Q).
   Results The exploratory factor analysis yielded a five factor structure. Four factors with 17 items remained after items that had unclear factor loading were removed. The Cronbach's alpha for the IOS-Q total score was 0.91, and test-retest reliability was 0.72. The correlation between Young's internet addiction scale and K-scale supported concurrent validity. ROC analysis showed that the IOS-Q has superior diagnostic ability with the Area Under the Curve of 0.87. At the cut-off point of 25.5, the sensitivity was 0.93 and specificity was 0.86.
   Conclusions Overall, this study supports the use of IOS-Q for internet addiction research and for screening high-risk individuals.

AB The purpose of the current study was to investigate the dynamic process of disclosure within the adolescent-mother relationship by examining how maternal personal distress and validation of adolescent negative affect would be related to adolescent disclosure of a distressing experience for the first time. A community sample of 66 mothers and their adolescent children (M = 14.31 years, 58% female) participated. The adolescents disclosed an emotionally distressing experience to their mothers for the first time. Mothers' validating behaviors and personal distress in response to their adolescents' expressions of negative emotion were predictive of adolescent disclosure. Adolescents made less detailed or substantive disclosures to their mothers when adolescents perceived their mothers as less validating of their negative emotions and when mothers were more likely to become distressed themselves. Neither adolescent-perceived maternal invalidation nor observed maternal validating or invalidating behaviors were related to adolescent disclosure. Maternal personal distress was further indirectly associated with less substantive disclosures through less maternal validation of negative emotion. These findings provide the foundation for future research evaluating clinical interventions targeted at increasing mothers' emotion regulation skills and validation of children's negative emotions. Such interventions may provide an effective way to promote better mother-adolescent communication. especially in regard to distressing experiences.

AB A dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) group has been conducted for a number of years at a public outpatient clinic for adolescents suffering with emotional regulation difficulties and their families. A detailed account of the rationale, design, and content of both the adolescent and parent groups are provided. Data from these groups adds to the limited evidence regarding the efficacy of such groups. A retrospective analysis of changes in the adolescent participants' emotional dysregulation, depression, anxiety and stress, following their participation in the group (N = 12) was conducted. Several substantial improvements were noted across the measures of psychopathology, following the completion of the group. These findings support the teaching of DBT skills to adolescents and their families, with some modifications being appropriate for their application to this population. Future avenues for research stemming from the group program are also discussed.

AB Interoception describes the mapping of the body's internal landscape and has been connected to greater intensity of emotional experience. The goal of the current study was to explore the relationship between interoception and emotion face recognition in healthy adolescents. The heartbeat perception task was used to assess interoceptive accuracy(IAC) and participants were asked to recognize different facial expressions. EEG activity was recorded, providing data for the P100, the N170 and the P300 ERP components. Results indicated high sensitivity to negative affect, as well as low accuracy in the recognition of fear and sadness among adolescents high in IAC, reflected by amplitude modulations in the N170 and the P300. The interpretation of these results focus on the intensity experienced in negative facial emotions, modified by IAC, as well as on emotional valence and arousal. These findings emphasize the dynamic integration of body and mind for shaping emotion recognition in adolescence.

AB The Post Conflict Explanations (PCE) scale is a compilation of behaviors commonly seen in parent-child postconflict communications. Following exploratory factor analysis, the PCE emerged as a four-dimension scale with adequate subscale internal consistency and intercorrelations: Dismissive (=0.86), Emotion Dysregulation (=0.85), Constructive (=0.97), and Blaming (=0.77). The PCE and its subscales were further validated through moderate-to-strong associations with established scales of family conflict, emotional security, and adjustment outcomes. The identification of these postconflict explanations represents a step forward in distinguishing constructive and destructive conflict behaviors.

AB The present study examines whether early adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation mediate the relation between parents' self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation and early adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants were 534 early adolescents (T1: M age = 10.89, SD = .70; 50% female), their mothers (n = 534), and their fathers (n = 431). Families were drawn from Colombia, Italy, and the USA. Follow-up data were obtained two (T2) and three (T3) years later. At T1 and T3, parents' self-efficacy beliefs were self reported and internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed via mothers', fathers', and early adolescents' reports. At T2, early adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs were self-reported Within the overall sample, mothers with higher self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation had children with similar beliefs. Early adolescents' low self-efficacy beliefs were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Compared with other ethnic groups, African American adolescents are exposed to higher levels of family and community violence, which contribute to poorer academic achievement. This study examines whether emotion regulation moderates the effects of exposure to family and community violence on academic achievement among low-income African American adolescents. Eighty African American adolescents (X age 12.89 years, 50% male) reported on their exposure to violence. Emotion regulation was obtained from parent reports and academic achievement was assessed with grades in core academic subjects at baseline and 2 years later. Results revealed that witnessing home violence predicted poorer achievement over time, as did exposure to community violence for youth with poor emotion regulation. Thus, well-developed emotion regulation skills may protect African American adolescents from the negative effects of witnessing community violence on academic achievement.

AB The goals of the present study were to (a) develop and validate a new self-report measure of social avoidance for use among early adolescents in mainland China and (b) explore the links between subtypes of social withdrawal (i. e., shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance) and indices of socio-emotional difficulties in this cultural context. Participants were 663 early adolescents (350 boys, 313 girls) attending elementary schools (X age = 10.25 years) and middle schools (X age = 12.53 years) in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Measures of social withdrawal subtypes and adjustment were collected using multi-source assessments, including self-reports, peer nominations, and teacher ratings. The results provided evidence in support of the reliability and validity of the new scale of self-reported social avoidance. Shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance were also all uniquely associated with emotion dysregulation and self-reported internalizing problems. However, only social avoidance was uniquely associated with teacher-rated emotion symptoms and peer problems (as rated by both peers and teachers). Results are discussed in terms of the reasons why social avoidance may have particularly negative implications for early adolescents in China.

AB The Building Resilience Intervention (BRI), a program developed in the wake of terrorism and war in Israel, provides teachers with resilience-building skills that enable them to support students suffering from post-traumatic distress. Teachers in the Bedouin city of Rahat were evaluated both before and after the BRI workshop intervention for post-traumatic distress levels, functional impairment, flexibility, emotional regulation, general resilience measures and workshop impact. Results showed significant increases among teachers in areas such as positive refocusing and reappraisal, and increased willingness to discuss traumatic material with their students. Incorporating resilience training in teacher education is discussed.

AB Background: Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychopathologies in childhood. Two underlying contributors to child anxiety disorders (ADs) are negative emotional hyper-reactivity and deficits in reappraisal, a cognitive strategy of emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation develops in the context of parent-child interaction, the aim of this study was to fill a research gap regarding the association between maternal negative emotional reactivity (NER) and reappraisal and child anxiety by examining (a) whether mothers of children with ADs display abnormalities in emotional reactivity and reappraisal compared to mothers of children without ADs; (b) whether maternal NER and reappraisal are associated with child anxiety; and (c) whether maternal reactivity and reappraisal significantly explain the variance in the level of child anxiety beyond the level of maternal anxiety.
   Method: Forty-nine mothers and their AD children (aged 10-17) were assessed at admission to an anxiety disorder clinic and were compared to a control group of 42 mothers and their non-anxious (NA) children. Child and maternal anxiety were assessed, as well as maternal NER and reappraisal.
   Results: Mothers of AD children showed a higher NER as well as reappraisal deficits compared to the control group. Self-rated child anxiety was associated with maternal deficits in reappraisal. The variance in child anxiety was significantly explained by the level of maternal anxiety as well as maternal reappraisal deficits.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that maternal NER and reappraisal play an important role in child anxiety and should be considered in prevention and intervention of childhood ADs.

AB Recurring pain in children and adolescents can have a negative impact on health and well-being. This study investigates recurring headache, abdominal pain, and back pain in children and adolescents in Thuringia. Data is based on a representative sub-sample from the federal state module Thuringia (2010-2012, naEuro<overline>= 4096, 3-17 years), carried out in KiGGS wave 1 (first follow-up interview of the "German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents"). The 3aEuromonth prevalence of recurrent headache, abdominal pain, and back pain is reported according to socio-demographic factors and is compared with the prevalence for the whole of Germany. In addition, possible associated factors of recurring headache, abdominal pain, and back pain in the previous 3 months are analyzed. Results for Thuringia show that 3aEuro to 10-year-old children were most frequently affected by recurrent abdominal pain (girls: 24.1%; boys: 16.7%), while 11- to 17-year-old adolescents were most frequently affected by recurrent headaches (girls: 36.8%; boys: 20.6%). There were isolated socio-economic differences in the 3aEuromonth prevalences of recurrent headache and back pain to the detriment of the low status group. Compared to peers in the whole of Germany, girls and boys in Thuringia did not report headache, abdominal pain, and back pain in the previous 3 months more frequently. The investigated associated factors-fair to very poor self-rated health, emotional problems such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, chronic diseases and other health complaints, migraine, use of a general medical practice, as well as practices for orthopedics and neurology, and in-patient treatment at a hospital-were positively related to the 3aEuromonth prevalence of recurrent headache, abdominal pain, and back pain. Overall, the results confirm that recurring pain is a common phenomenon in childhood and adolescents and, therefore, underline the public health relevance of pain in this young age group.

AB A dyadic microanalysis approach was used to examine emotion coregulation processes in mother-child interactions in relation to children's maladaptive behaviors. Seventy-two mother-child dyads (46 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); 26 neurotypical children) were previously videotaped in a semi-structured play procedure at home and mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Mother-child interactions were reliably coded in 5-second intervals and analyzed using Space State Grid software. Regression analyses supported moderation, whereby greater dyadic flexibility and more mutual-positive engagements were significantly associated with lower levels of maladaptive outcomes for children with ASD. Results have implications for initiating positive interactions and promoting effective parenting that help improve behavior in young children with ASD.

AB Family functioning significantly impacts family processes. When children enter adolescence the need to develop and maintain a high level of family functioning becomes even more crucial. This study examined whether parents' individual characteristics contributed to family cohesion/adaptability in families with adolescents. Moreover, the mediating roles that parent-adolescent relationships played in these associations were also examined. Participants were 169 father-mother couples in families with at least one adolescent child in Mainland China. Fathers and mothers reported on difficulties in emotion regulation, perceptions of parent-adolescent closeness and conflict, and family cohesion and adaptability. Results revealed that both paternal and maternal emotion dysregulation were indirectly related to their own and their partner's perceptions of family cohesion through their own closeness or conflict with the adolescent child. A parent's emotion dysregulation could be directly and indirectly related to his/her own perception of family adaptability through his/her own closeness with the adolescent, while another parent's emotion dysregulation could be indirectly associated with his/her partner's report of family adaptability through his/her own conflict with the adolescent. These findings suggested that family functioning during adolescence might be impacted by family factors at the individual parental and parent-adolescent dyadic levels. Additionally, this study indicated fathers and mothers might contribute to the family processes in a similar way.

AB This study investigated the extent to which gender differences in coping, school and family environments could account for variation in psychopathology among school-age children. Participants were 665 middle school students. Results showed no gender differences for PTSD. Females scored higher on emotional problems and prosocial behavior whereas males scored higher on conduct problems. ADHD was higher among children with LD, whereas emotional and conduct problems were higher in females with LD. Emotional and conduct problems increased more by age in females. Gender differences were found in various patterns of predictor-outcome relations. While emotion-focused coping was associated with emotional and peer problems in both genders, it was associated with conduct problems in females only. Problem-focused coping was positively associated with prosocial behaviors in females whereas it was negatively associated with peer problems in males. In addition, family environment was negatively associated with emotional problems and PTSD symptomatology in females, whereas school environment was negatively associated with emotional problems in males. Clinical and research implications were discussed.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation are a core feature of anxiety disorders (ADs) in children and adults. Interventions with a specific focus on emotion regulation are gaining empirical support. Yet, no studies to date have compared the relative efficacy of such interventions to existing evidence-based treatments. Such comparisons are necessary to determine whether emotion-focused treatments might be more effective for youth exhibiting broad emotion-regulation difficulties at pretreatment. This study examined an emotion-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (ECBT) protocol in comparison to traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a sample of children with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis. Moderation analyses examined whether children with higher levels of emotion dysregulation at pretreatment would show greater levels of improvement in ECBT than CBT. Ninety-two youth ages 7 to 12 years (58% male) with a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia were included. Participants were randomly assigned to ECBT or CBT. Results showed that youth in both conditions demonstrated similar improvements in emotion regulation and that pretreatment levels of emotion dysregulation did not moderate treatment outcomes. Additional analyses showed that ECBT and CBT were similarly effective on diagnostic, severity, and improvement measures. Future work is needed to further explore the ways that emotion regulation is related to treatment outcome for anxious youth.

AB Aggressive and oppositional behavior is not only one of the most common disorders in childhood and adolescence but it also has a very unfavorable prognosis. As a rule, many comorbid disorders can be observed (i.e., ADHD, depression, substance abuse disorder). There are abundant findings from longitudinal studies that verify different development paths. Treatment methods for this disorder, which is difficult to influence, concentrate on different behavioral therapy approaches.

AB Aggressive and antisocial behavior in adolescents who experienced violence and abuse can develop in isolation from or comorbid to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This transgenerational cycle of violence can have long-term consequences for the adolescents, for society, and for the health-care system. Therefore, it is important to implement effective evidence-based interventions. The aim of this study is to give an overview of interventions designed to break the cycle of violence and to reduce adolescents' aggressive and antisocial behavior following violence and abuse. We considered interventions focusing on comorbid aggressive behavior and PTSD as well as interventions aiming at reducing aggressive behavior in abused adolescents independently from PTSD. The therapeutic approach and the efficacy of four interventions that were evaluated in randomized controlled trials are presented: trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy, Forensic Offender Rehabilitation Narrative Exposure Therapy, the Youth Relationships Project, and the Life Story Intervention. The effect of trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy on aggressive behavior was tested in four studies with two of them reporting significant reduction of externalizing symptoms in comparison with a wait list control group. Evaluating the Forensic Offender Rehabilitation Narrative Exposure Therapy in a study of former street children showed a significant reduction in the involvement of everyday violence but not of appetitive aggression. The third program - the Youth Relationships Project - could be effectively applied to reduce incidents of physical and emotional abuse in the partnerships of youth with a history of maltreatment. The last program was the Life Story Intervention, which is a mental health intervention for foster care children from methamphetamine-involved families. Adolescents taking part in the Life Story Intervention showed a modest decrease in externalizing symptoms, while in the wait list control group, externalizing symptoms increased over time. The results indicate that manualized interventions can significantly reduce aggressive behavior in adolescents with potentially traumatic experiences in randomized controlled trials. Given that the programs were based on very heterogeneous components as well as that the evaluation studies included heterogeneous samples and different approaches to operationalize aggression, the efficacy of the programs could not be compared. However, this overview gives important insights regarding settings, relevant components, and implementation difficulties of therapeutic approaches in clinical practice. The components that were applied in more than two effective interventions were psychoeducation as well as sensitizing toward violence and its consequences and completing a trauma narration that helps with embedding traumatic experiences in autobiographic memory. It could, therefore, be assumed that coping with trauma is often necessary in order to reduce aggressive and antisocial behavior. Interventions that focus on reducing aggressive and antisocial behavior as a primary goal and not as a secondary goal (besides coping with trauma) are still needed.

AB Anger control indicates the ability to manage the experience and expression of anger in a way that minimizes the negative impact to oneself and others. A lack of anger control characterizes in particular children with reactive-aggressive behavior and strongly impairs children's psychological well-being and social relationships. Aggressive behavior is often considered to be moderated by or the result of angry feelings. Treatment programs for children with aggressive behavior, however, focus on the development of social competence as an alternative behavior to aggression. This overview reports insights into the techniques of anger control using three German behavioral treatment approaches for children with aggressive behavior. The treatment programs focus on children between 6 and 12 years of age and are mainly carried out in group settings: (a) training with aggressive children, (b) Baghira training for children with oppositional and aggressive behavior, and (c) behavioral therapeutic intensive training for reduction of aggression. These treatment programs focus on the development of social competence in children with conduct disorders. All three treatment programs included self-verbalization and positive self-instructions as methods for anger control. Self-verbalizations and self-instructions are methods that children can use to guide angry behavior and angry feelings by directing their thoughts. Children learn how to use self-instructions in role play exercises of anger-triggering situations. The development of adaptive anger control strategies is a feature of all programs: Children are trained to develop several socially acceptable anger control strategies in order to replace aggressive behavior. Additionally, in all programs, concomitant parent training is conducted. In order to improve children's anger control, parents learn how to adapt the "time-out" technique for their children. The differentiated efficacy of anger control techniques cannot be isolated since interventions for anger control are implemented in comprehensive treatment programs. Nevertheless, results of evaluation studies of the three treatment programs indicate a reduction in particular of aggressive-oppositional behavior through promoting social competence. Future dissemination studies should measure the isolated effect of anger control. Anger control skills that increase the time span between anger and aggression (e.g., self-instructions) are crucial to prevent aggressive behavior. Additionally, the development of anger control strategies is essential for children to learn different alternatives to cope with anger. Moreover, the development of anger awareness is necessary in treatment programs of aggressive behavior in children.

AB Although temperament has been linked to psychopathological outcomes in non-clinical children, little is known about the association between temperament and psychopathological outcomes in children on the autism spectrum whose psychopathological outcomes are highly variable. The current study examined the impact of temperament and autistic traits on emotional and conduct problems during school age in a large-scale sample of non clinical children with the use of quantitative scales. Cross-sectional data comprising parent reports of recalled temperament, current emotional and conduct problems, and current autistic traits for Japanese children aged 6-15 years (N = 24,232) that were collected with a postal questionnaire were analyzed. The results showed that emotional and conduct problems in school age were associated with both autistic traits and toddlerhood temperament. Specific temperament-psychopathology associations between higher negative affectivity and more emotional problems, higher effortful control and fewer conduct problems, and higher surgency and more conduct problems were shared among children with different levels of autistic traits. This study showed that although temperament in toddlerhood differed by the degree of autistic traits, both temperament and autistic traits could predict emotional and conduct problems in school-age children, and that the temperament-psychopathology associations are in most respects universal regardless of the degree of autistic traits.

AB Background: Emotion (dys) regulation as well as the interventions for improving these difficulties are receiving a growing attention in the literature. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review about the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in both substance and behavioral addictions (BAs).
   Method: A literature search was conducted using Cochrane, PubMed, and Web of Science. Fifty-four randomized controlled trials published in English since 2009 to April 2017 were included into a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Mindfulness-based interventions were applied in a wide range of addictions, including substance use disorders (from smoking to alcohol, among others) and BAs (namely, gambling disorder). These treatments were successful for reducing dependence, craving, and other addiction-related symptoms by also improving mood state and emotion dysregulation. The most commonly used MBI approaches were as follows: Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention, Mindfulness Training for Smokers, or Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement, and the most frequent control group in the included studies was Treatment as Usual (TAU). The most effective approach was the combination of MBIs with TAU or other active treatments. However, there is a lack of studies showing the maintenance of the effect over time. Therefore, studies with longer follow-ups are needed.
   Conclusion: The revised literature shows support for the effectiveness of the MBIs. Future research should focus on longer follow-up assessments as well as on adolescence and young population, as they are a vulnerable population for developing problems associated with alcohol, drugs, or other addictions.

AB The use of social networking sites (SNSs) is rapidly increasing as billions of individuals use SNS platforms regularly to communicate with other users, follow the news, and play browser games. Given the widespread use of SNS platforms, investigating the potential predictors of addictive SNS use beyond Facebook use has become paramount given that most studies so far focused on Facebook addiction. In this study, a total of 511 English-speaking SNS users (58.1% young adults aged 20-35 years; 64.6% female) were recruited online and asked to complete a battery of standardized psychometric tools assessing participants' sociodemographic characteristics, SNS preferences and patterns of use, SNS addiction, preference for online social interaction, maladaptive cognitions, fear of missing out (FoMo), dysfunctional emotion regulation, and general psychiatric distress. Overall, about 4.9% (n=25) of all participants could be classed as having a high SNS addiction risk profile. Moreover, the results further indicated that FoMo (=0.38), maladaptive cognitions (=0.25), and psychiatric distress (=0.12) significantly predicted SNS addiction (i.e., p<0.0001) and accounted for about 61% of the total variance in SNS addiction, with FoMo providing the strongest predictive contribution over and above the effects of sociodemographic variables and patterns of SNS use. The implications of the present findings were discussed in light of extant literature on behavioral addictions and Facebook addiction and further considerations were provided regarding the potential clinical implications for cognitive-based psychological treatment approaches to SNS addiction.

AB Background: Anger and aggression belong to the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Although an early and specific treatment of BPD is highly relevant to prevent chronification, still little is known about anger and aggression and their neural underpinnings in adolescents with BPD.
   Method: Twenty female adolescents with BPD (age 15-17 years) and 20 female healthy adolescents (age 15-17 years) took part in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A script-driven imagery paradigm was used to induce rejection-based feelings of anger, which was followed by descriptions of self-directed and other-directed aggressive reactions. To investigate the specificity of the neural activation patterns for adolescent patients, results were compared with data from 34 female adults with BPD (age 18-50 years) and 32 female healthy adults (age 18-50 years).
   Results: Adolescents with BPD showed increased activations in the left posterior insula and left dorsal striatum as well as in the left inferior frontal cortex and parts of the mentalizing network during the rejection-based anger induction and the imagination of aggressive reactions compared to healthy adolescents. For the other-directed aggression phase, a significant diagnosis by age interaction confirmed that these results were specific for adolescents.
   Discussion: The results of this very first fMRI study on anger and aggression in adolescents with BPD suggest an enhanced emotional reactivity to and higher effort in controlling anger and aggression evoked by social rejection at an early developmental stage of the disorder. Since emotion dysregulation is a known mediator for aggression in BPD, the results point to the need of appropriate early interventions for adolescents with BPD.

AB The literature examining primary headache, including migraine, in adolescents, has pointed out the key role played by a wide range of psychiatric disorders in reducing the patients' quality of life. Moreover, pioneering studies showed that preexisting personality characteristics, specific emotion regulation styles and psychological-psychiatric difficulties are likely to increase the risk of the onset, maintenance, and outcome of headache. Still personality issues in migraine have been poorly studied, in particular in children and adolescents. This study aims, therefore, to investigate the specific characteristics of personality, and in particular emotion regulation and coping strategies, in adolescent with migraine, comparing them with age-matched patients with idiopathic epilepsy and healthy adolescents. 52 adolescents (age: 11-17) were assessed using a multi-method test battery, which included a self-report questionnaire (the youth self-report), a proxy-report (child behavior checklist) along with a projective personality test, the Rorschach Test, administered and scored according to the Exner comprehensive system. The results showed specific personality characteristics in adolescents with migraine, revealing a marked difficulty in modulating and regulating affections through thoughts and reflections, resorting instead to impulsive acts and maladaptive coping strategies, thus revealing a vague and immature perception of reality. Differently from adolescents belonging to the general population, but similarly to patients with epilepsy, adolescents with migraine perceive a high situational stress, probably related to the condition of suffering from chronic disease. They have, therefore, a lower self-consideration and self-esteem along with a poorer insight regarding themselves as well as the relations with others. In line with previous findings, these preliminary results suggest the need for further research on ample samples, using also standardized projective test in order to better understand the pathogenesis of psychological difficulties in patients with migraine. As a clinical implication, the results seem to indicate that providing a psychological integrated approach can play a pivotal role in the assessment and treatment of adolescent with migraine, in order to improve the outcome and the quality of life of the young patients.

AB Introduction: Comprehensive understanding of the association between depression and neuropsychological functioning over the course of adolescence requires developmentally sensitive assessment through longitudinal data. The aim of current study is to examine the concurrent and subsequent effects of depressive symptoms on the initial level and evolution of four neuropsychological functioning domains (i.e., spatial working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibitory control).
   Method: Depressive symptoms and neuropsychological functioning were assessed over the course of four years in a sample of 3826 Canadian adolescents. A series of multilevel models estimated the between-person, within-person, and lagged within-person effects of depressive symptoms on each domain of neuropsychological functioning. Results: Findings suggest that current year and past year depressive symptoms were associated with poorer performance in delayed recall memory and perceptual reasoning tasks. Likewise, past year depressive symptoms were associated with poorer spatial working memory performance. These detrimental effects were stronger in early adolescence.
   Limitations: The current study examined the presence of sub-clinical depressive symptoms but not clinical depression. Moreover, although depressive symptoms and neuropsychological functions were assessed using widely used, valid, and reliable computer-based instruments, the results may not match the accuracy of clinician-based assessments.
   Conclusions: Our results underline the necessity of early intervention for young adolescents to decrease the harms associated with depression. The effect of early-onset depression on the underlying neural substrates of neuropsychological functioning merits further investigation.

AB Background: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphisms play an essential role in dopamine availability in the brain. However, there has been no study investigating whether a functional four-SNP (rs6269rs4633- rs4818-rs4680) haplotype is associated with affective symptoms over the life course.
   Methods: We tested this using 2093 members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (MRC NSHD), who had been followed up since birth in 1946, and had data for COMT genotypes, adolescent emotional problems (age 13-15) and at least one measure of adult affective symptoms at ages 36, 43, 53, or 60-64 years. First, differences in the levels of affective symptoms by the functional haplotype using SNPs rs6269, rs4818, and rs4680 were tested in a structural equation model framework. Second, interactions between affective symptoms by COMT haplotype were tested under an additive model. Finally, a quadratic regressor (haplotype(2)) was used in a curvilinear model, to test for a possible inverted-U trend in affective symptoms according to COMT-related dopamine availability.
   Results: Women had a significant interaction between COMT haplotypes and adolescent emotional problem on affective symptoms at age 53. Post hoc analysis showed a significant positive association between adolescent emotional problems and affective symptoms at age 53 years in the middle dopamine availability group (valA/valB or met/met; beta = .11, p = .007). For men, no significant interactions were observed.
   Conclusions: Combination of the COMT functional haplotype model and inverted-U model may shed light on the effect of dopaminergic regulation on the trajectory of affective symptoms over the life course.

AB The purpose of this clinical update is to provide an overview of the fear of needles and needle phobia in children and adolescents including characteristics and diagnosis, prevalence and epidemiology, etiological factors, and treatment options. Needle-related fear and needle phobia present as significant needle-related distress and avoidance behavior. The etiology is biopsychosocial. These challenging conditions are more common in children and adolescents than in adults. The nurse-patient relationship enables the provision of suitable preparation before injection procedures. Nurses can use exposure-based interventions and incorporate coping strategies and teaching of parents and children. Nurses play a pivotal role in noticing the need for further treatment. Procedural needle-related distress is a complex phenomenon representing a continuum ranging from needle fear to more severe needle phobia. For patients with needle fear management and training methods used by nurses can possibly prevent a progression of the condition into needle phobia. In cases of needle phobia, a correct diagnosis made by a psychiatrist is necessary and enables referral to a psychotherapist with experience in treating children and adolescents with needle phobia.

AB Although bi-directional relationships between high body mass index (BMI) and affective symptoms have been found, no study has investigated the relationships across the life course. There has also been little exploration of whether the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with affective symptoms and/or modifies the relationship between BMI and affective symptoms. In the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), 4556 participants had at least one measure of BMI and affective symptoms between ages 11 and 60-64 years. A structural equation modelling framework was used with the BMI trajectory fitted as latent variables representing BMI at 11, and adolescent (11-20 years), early adulthood (20-36 years) and midlife (36-53 years) change in BMI. Higher levels of adolescent emotional problems were associated with greater increases in adult BMI and greater increases in early adulthood BMI were associated with higher subsequent levels of affective symptoms in women. The rs9939609 risk variant (A allele) from 2469 participants with DNA genotyping at age 53 years showed mostly protective effect modification of these relationship. Increases in adolescent and early adulthood BMI were generally not associated with, or were associated with lower levels, of affective symptoms in the FTO risk homozygote (AA) group, but positive associations were seen in the TT group. These results suggest bi-directional relationships between higher BMI and affective symptoms across the life course in women, and that the relationship could be ameliorated by rs9939609 risk variant.

AB Objective: Core alexithymic features, such as the difficulty in identifying and describing feelings, are associated with poor attachment styles and emotional trauma, which influence the capacity to regulate affect. Additionally, emotional regulation has been found to be the most commonly identified function associated with non-suicidal self-injury behavior (NSSI) in adolescents as they attempt to modulate strong emotions. However, few studies have examined the link between difficulty in identifying and describing feelings (core components of alexithymia), NSSI behaviors, quality of attachment, life stressors and suicidal ideation in healthy early adolescents. Consequently, this study aims to investigate these constructs and the relationship among them in a large non-clinical sample of adolescents.
   Methods: Seven hundred and nine middle school students (50.4% males), aged 10-15 years (M = 12.6; SD = 1.06) were involved in this study. In order to investigate the variables considered in the study, the following measures were administered: the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory exploring non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors; the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children examining difficulty in identifying and describing feelings; the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment assessing the quality of parental and peer attachment; the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised outlining stressful/traumatic events and the Children's Depression Inventory evaluating suicidal ideation.
   Results: We found significantly positive relationships among difficulty in identifying and describing feelings, NSSI behaviors, stressful events, and suicidal ideation. Data indicated a significant negative association of difficulty in identifying and describing feelings with quality of attachment to parents and peers. Further findings highlighted that difficulty in identifying and describing feelings significantly mediated the effect of quality of attachment (parent and peer) on NSSI and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The ability to identify and describing feelings is important to managing emotional expression and understanding the feelings of others, both crucial in attaining successful interpersonal relationships. Our data revealed that, while controlling for stressful life events, low levels of attachment may increase adolescents' difficulty in identifying and describing their own feelings, which in turn may increase the risk of both NSSI and suicidal ideation.

AB Although recent studies revealed impaired self-regulation (dysregulation) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neural correlates of dysregulation and its impacts on autistic neuroanatomy remain unclear. Voxel-based morphometry was applied on structural MRI images in 81 ASD and 61 typically developing (TD) boys aged 7-17 years. Dysregulation was defined by the sum of T-scores of Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales in the Child Behavior Checklist > 180. There were 53 and 28 boys in the ASD+ Dysregulation and ASD-Dysregulation groups, respectively. First, we compared regional gray matter (GM) volume for ASD and TD. Second, we investigated regional GM volumetric differences among the ASD + Dysregulation, ASD-Dysregulation and TD groups. Lastly, shared and distinct neurostructural correlates of dysregulation were investigated in the ASD and TD groups. The ASD-TD difference on neuroanatomy no longer existed after controlling the dysregulation severity. ASD + Dysregulation had larger regional GM volumes in the right fusiform gyrus, and smaller GM volumes in the anterior prefrontal cortex than ASD-Dysregulation and TD, respectively. ASD + Dysregulation had smaller GM volumes in the left lateral occipital/superior parietal cortex than TD boys. No GM difference was identified between ASD-Dysregulation and TD. ASD and TD had a shared association between GM volumes in the orbitofrontal cortex and dysregulation levels. Our findings suggest that atypical neuroanatomy associated with ASD might partially reflect a disproportionate level of impaired self-regulation. Categorical and dimensional considerations of dysregulation should be implemented in future ASD studies.

AB The passage of landmark federal legislation in 1975 guaranteed students with disabilities (SWDs) a free appropriate public education. Over time, reauthorization of this legislation has highlighted the importance of educating SWDs in the general education environment where appropriate, and significant interaction with general education peers who are not receiving special education services (GENs) has followed. The largest U.S. school district-New York City (NYC), the setting of our study-mirrors this national trend toward more inclusive environments. Despite the trend, a critical question remains: Does inclusion in fact feel inclusive? This study provides a district-wide descriptive analysis of feelings of inclusion among SWDs compared to their GEN peers. We rely on detailed, longitudinal administrative and student survey data on approximately 249,000 NYC middle school students attending schools that educate both SWDs and GENs (which we call traditional schools in contrast with schools that educate only SWDs). Our results suggest that while gaps between SWDs overall and GENs are quite small, there is some heterogeneity. Specifically, students with an emotional disturbance (ED) and other health impairments (OH) feel modestly less included with peers but more with adults. There are, however, almost no differences in feelings of inclusion between students assigned exclusive and inclusive services, even for those in the ED and OH groups. In fact, for students with low incidence (LI) disabilities, feelings of inclusion are slightly better when assigned exclusive services.

AB An important element of understanding the genotype-phenotype link in psychiatric disorders lies in identifying the psychological mechanisms through which genetic variation impacts mental health. Here we examined whether emotional inertia, the tendency for a person's emotions to carry over from 1 moment to the next and a prospective predictor of the development of depression, is associated with a known genetic risk factor for emotional dysregulation, a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Two hundred thirty-six adolescents recorded their positive and negative emotions in daily life 9 times a day for 6 consecutive days using smartphones, completed a depression questionnaire, and were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. Carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR were characterized by higher inertia for negative emotions, even after controlling for depressive symptoms. These findings suggest a possible psychological pathway how the serotonin transporter gene contributes to risk for depression.

AB Anxiety and depressive symptoms have adverse effects on children's development. The present study investigates the associations of socioeconomic factors as well as maternal emotional health with children's emotional health status. The data were collected between 2011 and 2015 in the LIFE Child study, a population-based cohort study in Leipzig, Germany. The emotional health status of 1093 children (2.5-11.9 years old) was investigated using the subscale 'emotional problems' of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Associations of maternal emotional health, family status, and socioeconomic status (SES) with the emotional health status of children were estimated via regression analyses. 21.13% of the participating children were assigned to the 'risk' group for emotional problems. The results furthermore revealed that children of mothers reporting more depressive symptoms, children living in single-parent families, and children of families with lower SES scored higher in the emotional problems scale. When considering the different indicators of SES (parental education, occupational status, and monthly net income) separately, only income showed significant associations with children's emotional health status. The prevalence of emotional problems in children in Leipzig, a city in East Germany, appears to be higher than the previously reported German average. Maternal depressive symptoms, single-parent families, lower SES, and especially lower income can be seen as risk factors for children's emotional health.

AB The orphan nuclear receptor Tlx (Nr2e1) is a key regulator of both embryonic and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Several different mouse models have been developed which target Tlx in vivo including spontaneous deletion models (from birth) and targeted and conditional knockouts. Although some conflicting findings have been reported, for the most part studies have demonstrated that Tlx is important in regulating processes that underlie neurogenesis, spatial learning, anxiety-like behaviour and interestingly, aggression. More recent data have demonstrated that disrupting Tlx during early life induces hyperactivity and that Tlx plays a role in emotional regulation. Moreover, there are sex- and age-related differences in some behaviours in Tlx knockout mice during adolescence and adulthood. Here, we discuss the role of Tlx in motor-, cognitive-, aggressive- and anxiety-related behaviours during adolescence and adulthood. We examine current evidence which provides insight into Tlx during neurodevelopment, and offer our thoughts on the function of Tlx in brain and behaviour. We further hypothesize that Tlx is a key target in understanding the emergence of neurobiological disorders during adolescence and early adulthood.

AB The goal of the current investigation was to test emotion dysregulation as a mechanism explaining the longitudinal association between peer rejection and depressive symptoms across 1 school year in middle childhood and to determine whether this process differed based on gender and grade. Youth in Grades 3 through 6 (N = 131; 71 girls) and their primary school teachers (n = 8) were recruited from a Midwestern elementary school. Youth reported on their emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms at two time points (T1 and T2), approximately 6 months apart. Teachers completed ratings of peer rejection at T1. Peer rejection at T1 predicted youth-report of depressive symptoms at T2, even after controlling for depression at T1. Moderated mediation suggested that change in emotion dysregulation mediated the relation of peer rejection to depressive symptoms over time, but only for older boys. Results underscore the importance of considering gender-specific processes within interpersonal risk models of depression, and provide support for peer rejection as a critical social process shaping emotion regulation in middle childhood.

AB Assessments of child psychopathology are often derived from parental and teacher reports, yet there is substantial disagreement. This study utilized data from 7 European countries to examine parent-teacher agreement and possible explanatory factors for parent-teacher disagreement such as child and family characteristics, parenting dimensions, and maternal distress were explored. Parent-teacher agreement of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were assessed using a cross-sectional survey of 4,894 school aged children 6-11 from the School Children Mental Health Europe Project. Parent-teacher agreement was low to moderate (Pearson correlation ranging from .24 (Prosocial) to .48 (Hyperactivity) for the 5 subscales across 7 countries); kappa coefficient ranged from .01 (Turkey) to .44 (Italy) for internalizing problems and .19(Romania) to .44(Italy) for externalizing problems. Child's gender and age, mother's employment status, single parent home, number of children in household, and selected parenting dimension were found to be explanatory of informant disagreement. This study not only serves to advance our understanding of parent-teacher agreement of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 7 European countries but provides a novel approach to examining the factors that contribute to informant disagreement.

AB This paper discusses the conceptualization, development, validation, and application of the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) - a population-based child self-report tool that assesses children's social-emotional development and well-being in the context of their home, school, and neighborhood. The MDI is administered at a population-level to 4th and 7th grade students within participating public school districts across British Columbia, Canada. Children respond to items in five domains: (1) social-emotional development, (2) connectedness to peers and adults, (3) school experiences, (4) physical health and well-being, and (5) constructive use of after-school time. Results are aggregated for schools and communities and reported back in comprehensive reports and community maps to inform planning and decision making at local and regional levels. Shared testimonials exemplify how MDI results have been used by educators, community organizers, and city planners as a catalyst for promoting children's social and emotional competence and facilitating collaboration between schools and communities.

AB Background: Evaluation of broad-spectrum micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) treatment for childhood ADHD has been limited to open-label studies that highlight beneficial effects across many aspects of psychological functioning. Method: This is the first fully blinded randomized controlled trial of medication-free children (n=93) with ADHD (7-12years) assigned to either micronutrients (n=47) or placebo (n=46) in a 1:1 ratio, for 10weeks. All children received standardized ADHD assessments. Data were collected from clinicians, parents, participants and teachers across a range of measures assessing ADHD symptoms, general functioning and impairment, mood, aggression and emotional regulation. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant between-group differences favouring micronutrient treatment on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (ES=0.46), with 47% of those on micronutrients identified as 'much' to 'very much' improved versus 28% on placebo. No group differences were identified on clinician, parent and teacher ratings of overall ADHD symptoms (ES ranged 0.03-0.17). However, according to clinicians, 32% of those on micronutrients versus 9% of those on placebo showed a clinically meaningful improvement on inattentive (OR=4.9; 95% CI: 1.5-16.3), but no group differences on improvement in hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (OR=1.0; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5). Based on clinician, parent and teacher report, those on micronutrients showed greater improvements in emotional regulation, aggression and general functioning compared to placebo (ES ranged 0.35-0.66). There were two dropouts per group, no group differences in adverse events and no serious adverse events identified. Blinding was successful with guessing no better than chance. Conclusions: Micronutrients improved overall function, reduced impairment and improved inattention, emotional regulation and aggression, but not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, in this sample of children with ADHD. Although direct benefit for core ADHD symptoms was modest, with mixed findings across raters, the low rate of adverse effects and the benefits reported across multiple areas of functioning indicate micronutrients may be a favourable option for some children, particularly those with both ADHD and emotional dysregulation.

AB The smartphone has many attractive attributes and characteristics that could make it highly addictive, particularly in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of young adolescents in risk of smartphone addiction and the psychological factors associated with smartphone addiction. Four hundred ninety middle school students completed a self-questionnaire measuring levels of smartphone addiction, behavioral and emotional problems, self-esteem, anxiety, and adolescent-parent communication. One hundred twenty-eight (26.61%) adolescents were in high risk of smartphone addiction. This latter group showed significantly more severe levels of behavioral and emotional problems, lower self-esteem, and poorer quality of communication with their parents. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the severity of smartphone addiction is significantly associated with aggressive behavior ( = .593, t = 3.825) and self-esteem ( = -.305, t = -2.258). Further exploratory and confirmatory studies should consider different sites, demographics, technological mobile devices, platforms, and applications.

AB This article explores the ways poly-victimized youth (those experiencing multiple different types of victimization over the course of 1 year) use technology to interact with peers. Particular attention is given to the peer harassment victimization and perpetration experiences of poly-victimized youth compared with less victimized and non-victimized youthboth overall and through technology. Data were collected as part of the Technology Harassment Victimization (THV) study; a national survey of 791 youth, ages 10 to 20 across the United States. Study results document the heightened risks that poly-victimized youth experience when interacting with peers. Low and high poly-victimized youth were both at significantly greater risk of being dual victims and perpetrators of peer harassment when compared with non-victimized youth even after taking into account other potentially explanatory factors. This was not found to be the case for less victimized youth. This was true for high poly-victims and technology-involved harassment risk as well. There were indications that poly-victimized youth were interacting with peers in more intense and risky ways in general using new technology. The increase in attention to poly-victimization in recent years has importantly identified the detrimental role that experiencing different forms of victimization have on youth. This study not only adds to that literature but suggests that there is an opportunity to interrupt additional victimization by understanding how poly-victimized youth interact with peers before and during adolescence. Although preliminary, the differences in technology use by poly-victimized youth versus others suggest that more information is needed to understand how they are relating to peers in both positive and risky ways in this environment.

AB A recent dramatic rise in girls' arrests has increased our need to examine whether our models of youth justice system involvement need to be differentiated by gender. Polyvictimization, in particular, has been implicated as a powerful predictor of youth problem behavior. However, recent research suggests that polyvictimization is associated with youth involvement in the justice system in ways that differ for girls at the levels of the independent variables (i.e., the sources of risk), the dependent variables (i.e., youth outcomes), and the mediators of these associations (i.e., the purported mechanisms that account for these relations). The present critique describes growth points in the current research with the goal of suggesting promising directions for future investigations. In particular, gaps are noted regarding our understanding of the specific forms of polyvictimization that affect traumatized girls' development, especially given the highly disproportionate prevalence of sexual abuse among justice-involved girls. In addition, increased attention is needed to gender differences in the timing of victimization and the onset of risky behavior, as well as the nature of trauma-linked youth offenses and recidivism, which research also suggests may differ for boys and girls. Furthermore, a new body of research on psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk. Finally, the importance acknowledging the intersection of polyvictimization, gender, and race is noted. The article ends with a discussion of the ways in which understanding gender differences and similarities can inform gender-responsive approaches to prevention and intervention efforts.

AB This paper presents five studies describing the creation and validation of a Mindfulness scale that is developmentally appropriate for children 11 and older and also suitable for use with adults. The Adolescent and Adult Mindfulness Scale (AAMS) scale measures key components of mindfulness: (1) focus on the present moment, represented by paying attention to surroundings, thoughts, feelings and emotions, (2) being non-reactive, (3) being non-judgmental, and (4) self-accepting. Study 1 describes the original scale creation: item selection, initial validation and item reduction using exploratory factor analysis and initial validation using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). This study also investigates the correlation of the AAMS with a previously validated mindfulness scale for children. Studies 2 and 3 validate the scale finalized in Study 1, on an early and mid-adolescent samples. Study 4 validates the scale on an adult sample. Study 5 evaluates scale sensitivity to change in mindfulness due to mindfulness training and examines its relationships with emotion regulation and self-compassion scales.
   CFA demonstrated a good fit of the factor structure with both adolescents and adults. The AAMS is the only scale available that is validated on such a wide range of ages from early teens to adults.

AB Understanding the contextual determinants of bullying behavior is pivotal for effective interventions. This paper describes the prevalence of bullying, its socio-demographic correlates and factors influencing its relationship with psychiatric disorders among a population-based sample of adolescents from Beirut recruited through a two stage cluster sampling design. Recruited participants (n = 510) and their parents completed a battery of questionnaires and interviews including the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) and the Peer Relations Questionnaire (PRQ). We found that around 30% of the adolescent participants were involved in bullying. Younger age, lower family income, lower parental education, receiving private tutoring, having an anxiety disorder and having a disruptive behavior disorder were correlated with being bullied by peers while lower family income, repeating a school-grade, and having a disruptive behavior disorder were associated with bullying others. Several factors including gender, age group, family income, and attending private versus public schools moderated the relationship between bullying behavior and having psychiatric disorders. Our findings thus highlight the complexity of the association between psychiatric disorders and bullying in settings like Lebanon.

AB Introduction: Children and adolescents' ability to effectively identify and understand emotions is an important aspect of development that has been linked to a variety of beneficial outcomes (e.g., better mental health, social skills and academic performance; Sprung, Miinch, Harris, Ebesutani, & Hofmann, 2015). According to the binary model of distress (David, Montgomery, Macavei, & Bovbjerg, 2005), stemming from the Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy/Coaching (REBT/ REBC; Ellis, 1962) theory, there are functional and dysfunctional emotions, the latter ones being maladaptive. The REThink platform aims at using online gaming for coaching emotion regulation in children and adolescents based on these principles. Objective: We conducted a pilot study to investigate if the Feeling Better mini video game, part of the REThink therapeutic online platform as a resource activity, can be a useful tool in coaching the distinction between functional and dysfunctional emotions in children and adolescents in the therapeutic video game environment. Method: The online game was delivered to a sample of 22 children and adolescents, aged between 10 to16 years. Emotion understanding was indexed by the amount of acquired points for correctly collecting functional emotions. Results: The Feeling Better game was found to be a useful tool in improving in-game emotional understanding, children and adolescents indicating a significant increase in their ability to correctly identify and collect functional emotions after three trials of playing. Conclusions: Using therapeutic video games may be a useful tool for coaching emotion regulation skills in children and adolescents. Finally, satisfaction with and advantages for the use of online video games in coaching emotional skills are discussed.

AB In recent years, the influence of emotion-related factors on disordered eating behaviors have received a great deal of attention. Depression and difficulties in emotion regulation are important factors in development and maintaining of disordered eating behaviors. However, the mechanisms linking negative affect to disordered eating are not yet fully understood. It has been suggested that difficulties in regulating negative emotions may play a role in this relation. Therefore, our hypothesis was that difficulties in emotion regulation mediate the relationship between different disordered eating behaviors and depression. The sample consisted of 269 healthy women (mean age=23.87, SD=6.98) who filled in online measures assessing these variables. Results revealed that depression and difficulties in emotion regulation predict overall and specific disordered eating patterns (restrained, emotional and uncontrolled eating). Moreover, the relationships of depression with disordered eating overall or with specific restrained, emotional and uncontrolled eating respectively is mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation. Our data support the need for studies testing the efficacy of emotion regulation skills training in eating disorders.

AB Objective: The Invalidating Childhood Environment Scale (ICES) was developed in order to assess the childhood experiences of invalidation retrospectively. As there is no tool to assess the invalidating environment for Turkish samples, the current study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the scale and to adapt it to the Turkish language.
   Method: The English scale was first translated into Turkish and then a back translation was made into the original language. Three hundred and three university students participated in the study. Along with the ICES, Short Form of the EMBU (Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran [My Memories of Upbringing]) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were also administered.
   Results: According to the results of confirmatory factor analysis, it was seen that the values obtained were acceptable for both forms. It was found that the ICES mother form has positive and low associations with EMBU mother overprotection, EMBU mother rejection, and RSES. The ICES mother form was found to be highly and negatively associated with the EMBU mother warmth subscale. The same correlations as for the mother form were found in the ICES father form. According to the results of the current study, Cronbach's alpha coefficients of ICES for mother and father forms were found to be 0.84 and 0.87, respectively.
   Conclusion: The findings of the current study show that the Turkish version of the ICES has acceptable levels of reliability and validity.

AB Introduction: Maternal depression has been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental, emotional and behavioural disorders in offspring. We aimed to describe the proportion of psychological problems among children of mothers with depression in Sri Lanka and to describe the association with the characteristics of the mothers' illness.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents between 4-16 years whose mother has a diagnosis of depression and currently in remission. Specifically designed instruments were used to extract socio-demographic details and data on mother's illness. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to detect psychological problems in children.
   Results: 14% of the children scored abnormally high in hyperactivity, 13% in conduct problems, 12% in emotional problems, 9% in peer problems. Hyperactivity, internalizing problems, and total difficulties were significantly higher in where mothers' had a history of a moderate depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder. Children whose mothers had no attempts of self-harm scored significantly higher in both emotional problems and internalizing problems. Children whose mothers have comorbid illness scored significantly higher in hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, externalizing problems, internalizing problems and total difficulties.
   Conclusions: Screening for psychological problems in children and developing a holistic management plan which include steps to ensure the well-being of the children is important in managing mothers with depression.

AB In previous literature, social support has been reported to have a significant, positive relationship with life satisfaction. However, few studies have examined this relationship among Korean youths and how their psychological functioning is associated with both social support and life satisfaction. This study investigated the associations between different sources of social support (i.e., family, peer, and teacher), psychological factors (i.e., self-efficacy and emotional regulation), and life satisfaction, in a sample of 1133 Korean adolescents. The possibility of sex differences in these relationships was also investigated. Results indicated that only family support had a direct relationship with life satisfaction for male adolescents; however, all three types of social support were found to have a significant, indirect relationship with life satisfaction for male adolescents through both psychological factors. In contrast, all three types of social support had a direct relationship with life satisfaction of female adolescents. Additionally, self-efficacy had a mediating effect on the relationship between the social support from family and teachers and life satisfaction of female adolescents. The results and implications of the study are discussed.

AB ObjectiveTo get an impression of the quality of life (QOL) and sexual well-being in the Fontan population, and to generate hypotheses for future research.
   MethodsFor this cross-sectional pilot study, questionnaires regarding health-related QOL, sexual function and fertility/pregnancy were completed by 21 patients with a Fontan circulation >16 years old, followed at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in 8 patients.
   ResultsFontan patients scored significantly lower on general health than their healthy peers (t(19)=-3.0, P=.008), whereas their scores on other QOL domains and sexual well-being were comparable to normal values. During childhood, most patients experienced physical limitations and the feeling of being an outsider, and frequently faced bullying. Regarding sexual well-being, large interindividual differences were noted. Four interviewed patients (25-30 years) reported a good sexual well-being, whereas the other interviewed patients (33-47 years) reported erectile dysfunction, low self-esteem and avoidance of sexual intercourse. Both the QOL domains mental health and role restrictions due to emotional problems were associated with female avoidance (P=.083, respectively, P=.089) and dyspareunia (P=ns respectively P=.094). In males, role restrictions due to physical problems and health change were related to sexual dissatisfaction (P=.056) respectively nonsensuality (P=.025).
   ConclusionsOverall, Fontan patients have a relatively preserved quality of life and sexual wellbeing but face more social isolation and bullying during childhood/adolescence than their healthy peers. Sexual problems were mainly associated with physical limitations in males and with psychosocial limitations in females. Finally, sexual dysfunction was more common in older Fontan patients, and future research has to clarify whether progressive attrition of the Fontan circulation affects the patients' QOL and sexual well-being.

AB Fifty-seven percent of children with poor language skills are affected by socio-emotional problems. Despite the importance of language skills to interpersonal functioning and school performance, relatively little is known about how they affect self-esteem in adolescence. Data on youth at high risk for language problems (e.g. those born extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 grams)) are even more scarce. This prospective study examined associations between language skills at age 8 and self-esteem during adolescence (12-16 years) in individuals born at ELBW (N = 138) or normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 grams) (N = 111). Participants' language skills were assessed using the Verbal Scale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and the Token Test at age 8. In adolescence, participants completed the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. Birth weight status was found to moderate associations between childhood language and adolescent global self-esteem (Token Test (p = .006), Verbal Intelligence Quotient (p = .033)) such that better language skills were associated with higher self-esteem in adolescent ELBW survivors, but not in NBW participants. Language skills may play a protective role in the development and maintenance of self-esteem in ELBW youth and could be an important target for optimizing their functioning, particularly before transitioning to the critical adolescent period.

AB The present study examines whether characteristics of parents predict the stability of a child's best friendships across the primary school years. Participants included 1,523 Finnish children (766 boys) who reported involvement in a total of 1,326 reciprocated friendship dyads in the 1st grade (M = 7.16 years old). At the onset of the study, mothers and fathers completed questionnaires describing their own parenting (i.e., behavioral control, psychological control, and affection toward the child) and depressive symptoms. Child scores for peer status (i.e., acceptance and rejection) were derived from 1st grade peer nomination data. Discrete-time survival analyses predicted the occurrence and timing of friendship dissolution, across 1st to 6th grades, for friendships that began in 1st grade. Parent depression and parent psychological control uniquely predicted subsequent child friendship dissolution, above and beyond the contribution of peer status variables.

AB Although child maltreatment places youth at substantial risk for difficulties with emotion regulation and aggression, not all maltreated youth show these adverse effects, raising important questions about characteristics that discriminate those who do versus do not evidence long-term negative outcomes. The present investigation examined whether implicit beliefs about emotion moderated the association between maltreatment and aggression. Maltreated (n = 59) and community-matched (n = 66) youth were asked regarding their beliefs about emotion and aggressive behaviors. Beliefs about emotion were more strongly associated with aggression among maltreated youth, particularly physically abused youth. Maltreated youth who believed they had poor ability to control emotion reported significantly higher levels of aggression than comparison youth. However, maltreated youth who believed they had high ability to control emotion did not differ significantly in aggression from that of comparison youth. Findings offer unique insight into a factor that may increase or buffer maltreated youth's risk for aggression and thus highlight potential directions for interventions to reduce aggressive tendencies.

AB There is a need to delineate best practices for referring, assessing, and retaining students suspected of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and maladaptive grief (MG) in school-based treatment. Evidence-based risk-screening procedures should accurately include students who are appropriate for group treatment and exclude students who do not require treatment or who are better served by other forms of intervention and support. We described and evaluated the sequence of steps used to screen 7th-and 8th-grade students (N = 89) referred by school staff as candidates for an open trial of group-based Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCTA; Saltzman et al., in press). We used t tests to compare included versus excluded students on PTS symptom and MG reaction scores (University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index; Grief Screening Scale) during the group screen, individual interview, and treatment-implementation phases. Logistic regressions tested the incremental utility of including measures of both trauma exposure and related emotional and conduct problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) in the screening battery. Results suggest that the group screen helped to detect mental health needs and that the individual interview further identified students with PTS and emotional problems. Conduct problems and trauma exposure predicted attrition among students who qualified for treatment. MG incrementally predicted students who advanced from the group screening to the individual interview, and trauma exposure incrementally predicted attrition from treatment. Findings yield implications for improving research and practice, including procedures for enhancing school-based referral, screening, assessment, and selection procedures.

   METAANALYSIS
AB A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents.

AB This article presents practical tools for evidence-based assessment of students' behavioral/emotional/social difficulties and strengths in culturally sensitive ways. The assessment instruments obtain teacher, parent, and student ratings, plus observations in classrooms and other group settings, in interviews, and in testing sessions. To document differences in students' functioning in school and other contexts, plus differences between teacher, parent, and student perspectives, users can display cross-informant comparisons of ratings of specific difficulties items. Users can also display cross-informant comparisons between bar graphs of scores on empirically derived syndromes, DSM-oriented scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Scale scores are standardized according to norms for students' gender and age, type of informant (teacher, parent, student), and multicultural norms. Multicultural norms are based on teacher, parent, and student ratings of population samples of students in many societies. The ratings were used to construct gender-, age-, and informant-specific norms for societies having relatively low difficulties scores, medium scores, or high scores. The assessment instruments can be used to identify students who need help and to tailor interventions to students' needs. The same instruments can be used to measure changes by comparing pre-versus post-intervention scores. Brief instruments assess progress over short periods.

AB In this study, we examined whether peer appearance-related victimization was associated with adolescents' increasing body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) symptoms over 12 months. Also, given emotion regulation and mindfulness have been associated with less body dissatisfaction, we expected that they would protect against the negative impact of peer victimization on BDD symptoms. Participants were 367 Australian adolescents (M-age = 13 years). In multiple regressions, two aspects of emotion regulation, strategies and clarity, and two components of mindfulness, acting with awareness and being non-judgmental, were uniquely associated with fewer BDD symptoms at T2 relative to T1. There was evidence that one mindfulness component, observing, was a risk factor for more BDD symptoms. Further, acting with awareness and observing moderated the prospective relationship between victimization and BDD symptoms; low acting with awareness and high observing were risks for symptoms regardless of victimization, whereas high acting with awareness and low observing appeared protective of BDD symptoms, but only for adolescents who reported lower victimization.

AB Objective: Coping flexibility is strongly associated with individuals' well-being when coping with trauma. However an instrument to measure emotional flexibility, a specific type of coping flexibility, is yet to be developed. The present study reported the development and validation of a Self-Administered Inventory on emotional flexibility. The study also explored the relationship between emotional flexibility and psychological well-being in adolescents who had experienced the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China. Method: A sample of 327 adolescents from Beijing was recruited for item development and preliminary validation. Another sample of 941 middle school students from areas affected by the Sichuan earthquake was recruited for further validation and examination of its relationship with psychological well-being. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to examine the construct validity of the scale. The criterion validity of the measure was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: The Emotional Flexibility Scale comprises 10 items covering 3 dimensions, namely tuning of positive emotions, emotion communication, and tuning of negative emotions. Emotional flexibility was positively correlated with cognitive flexibility and psychological well-being. Conclusions: The Emotional Flexibility Scale provides a brief, reliable, and valid measure of emotion regulation ability of adolescents faced with disasters.

AB Although abnormalities in emotional response have long been considered a core feature of the chronic phase of schizophrenia, few investigations have examined emotional response in individuals at ultrahigh-risk (UHR) for psychosis. We investigated whether neuroleptic-free UHR (n = 29) and healthy control (n = 32) participants differed in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation on a laboratory-based task that required reporting levels of positive and negative affect to pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral stimuli. Results indicated that the UHR group evidenced reduced emotional reactivity, including decreased positive emotion to pleasant stimuli and decreased negative emotion to unpleasant stimuli. Furthermore, within the UHR group, attenuated positive emotion to pleasant stimuli was associated with greater severity of depression and anxiety. There were no group differences in self-reported emotion regulation effectiveness to unpleasant or pleasant stimuli. Findings suggest that UHR youth display a profile of emotional experience abnormalities that differs from the chronic phase of illness, which can be characterized as reduced positive emotion reactivity to pleasant stimuli (i.e., anhedonia) that may be driven by mood and anxiety symptoms.

AB Objective: It has been nearly 15 years since Kazdin and Nock published methodological and research recommendations for understanding mechanisms of change in child and adolescent therapy. Their arguments and enthusiasm for research on mechanisms of behavior change (MOBCs) resonated across disciplines and disorders, as it shined a light on the crucial importance of understanding how and for whom treatments instigate behavior change and how therapeutic mechanisms might be extended to "situations and settings of everyday life." Initial efforts focused on how psychotherapy works and linear models, yet the use of theory to guide the study of mechanisms, and laboratory experiments to manipulate them, is broadly applicable. Method: This article considers dynamic physiological processes that support behavior change. Specifically, it examines the utility of psychophysiological methods to measure and promote behavior change. Moreover, it em-beds the baroreflex mechanism, a well-defined heart-brain feedback loop, within the theories and strategies of MOBC research. Results and Conclusions: Individuals' subjective and expressive experience of change does not always align with their physiological reactivity. Thus, behavior change may be best understood when concurrently assessed across multiple biobehavioral levels. Further, behavior is initiated in the moment, often before conscious deliberation, suggesting that multilevel behavior change research may benefit from real-time methodological designs. Last, substance use trajectories vary widely, suggesting that different MOBCs are more or less active in individuals depending on their personal constituency and the functional need that their substance use serves; thus, methods that are amenable to personalized modeling approaches are important.

AB Objective: Early adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to the development of both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. In our prior work, we found that ACEs predicted reductions in the volume of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a brain region important for impulse control and emotion regulation. Here we tested the hypothesis that ACES might influence child behavioral outcomes through an impact on IFG functional connectivity, which may influence impulsive or risk-taking behavior.
   Method: We examined the effects of prospectively assessed ACEs on IFG connectivity in childhood, and their relationship to the trajectory of subsequent psychopathology from late school age and early adolescence, using data from an 11-year longitudinal study of children starting in preschool that included 3 waves of resting state functional connectivity across childhood and early adolescence.
   Results: ACEs predicted functional connectivity of both left and right IFG. Multi-level modeling of symptoms across 3 waves of assessments indicated that more ACEs predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, altered IFG connectivity specifically predicted greater externalizing symptoms over time in middle childhood and early adolescence, as compared to internalizing symptoms. Longitudinal modeling indicating that the relationships between externalizing and functional connectivity were maintained across 3 waves of functional connectivity assessment.
   Conclusion: These findings underscore the relationship of ACEs to later psychopathology, and suggest that connectivity of the IFG, a region known to play an important role in impulse control and emotion regulation, may play a key role in the risk trajectory of ACEs to externalizing problems. However, further work is needed to understand whether these relationships reflect a direct effect of ACEs or whether ACEs are a marker for other environmental or genetic factors that may also influence brain development and behavior.

AB Sleep disturbances are likely to be associated with emotional and behavioural problems.
   This study evaluated sleep disturbances in preschool children with bilateral cerebral palsy (CP) and assessed their associations with behavioural and emotional problems.
   The study was performed in St. Petersburg in 2016, and comprised 20 children with diagnosed bilateral CP aged 5 years (10 boys, 10 girls) who attended a special educational centre. The control group was made up of 80 clinically healthy, typically developing children, who were matched as closely as possible to the cases in terms of age, gender and geographical distribution. Mothers were requested to fill in the Child Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) aimed at measuring certain sleep problems in children. Teachers were approached with the Achenbach Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for ages 1.5-5 years (C-TRF) aimed at finding major emotional and behavioural disturbances.
   Children with CP had significantly higher scores (more problems) on reported sleep onset delay, sleep duration and daytime sleepiness. They also scored higher on all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented behaviour problem scales. Both the diagnosis of CP and sleep disturbances were significant predictors of certain behavioural deviations, including anxiety, pervasive developmental and oppositional defiant problems. Based on the data mining procedure, an explanatory model that brought together the found associations was constructed.
   Sleep disturbances in children with CP may be associated with behavioural problems.

AB This study examined whether iron deficiency (ID) in infancy contributes to problem behaviors in adolescence through its influence on poor regulatory abilities in childhood. Chilean infants (N=1,116) were studied whenthere was no national program for iron fortification (1991-1996), resulting in high rates of ID (28%) and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA, 17%). Infants (54% male) were studied at childhood (M-age=10years) and adolescence (M-age=14years). IDA in infancy was related to excessive alcohol use and risky sexual behavior in adolescence through its effect on poor emotion regulation in childhood. Attentional control deficits at age 10 were also related to both infant IDA and heightened risk taking in adolescence. Findings elucidate how poor childhood regulatory abilities associated with infant IDA compromise adjustment in adolescence.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a range of health outcomes and risk behaviors. In 2011-2012, the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) included questions about adverse family experiences (AFEs). AFE survey questions are similar to ACE questions, except there are no questions about emotional/physical/sexual trauma, and questions are asked of parents rather than children. Although the relationship between ACEs and work/school absenteeism has been studied, the relationships between AFEs of school-aged children, school performance, and buffering behaviors have not been explored in depth.
   We examined AFEs and measures of resilience and school engagement among 1330 Vermont children (6-17 years) included in the NSCH, using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses.
   The most prevalent AFEs were divorce/separation of parents; family income hardship; substance use problems; and mental illness, suicidality, or severe depression. Adjusting for sex, age, special health care needs, poverty level, and maternal physical/mental-emotional health status, children who had three or more AFEs had lower odds of completing all required homework [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-6.3] and higher odds of failing to exhibit resilience (AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.8), compared to children having no AFEs.
   Children with three or more AFEs had difficulty engaging in school and completing homework, though poor outcomes were buffered when children showed resilience. Parents, school-based mental health professionals, and teachers could help identify children who may be less resilient and have difficulties completing homework assignments. Preventive approaches to children's emotional problems (e.g., promoting family health, using family-based approaches to treat emotional/behavioral problems) could be applied in schools and communities to foster resilience and improve school engagement of children.

AB Objective: Rejection sensitivity (RS) is defined as the disposition to anxiously expect rejection, to perceive it as likely, and to overreact to it. Former studies showed heightened RS in clinically depressed adults and identified it as a predictor for symptoms of depression in adolescents. However, to date there are no studies examining RS as a disposition in adolescents with clinical depression. Method: In the present study, we compared differences in RS and behavioral intentions in depressive and healthy adolescents after a rejection situation. We included n = 28 adolescents with depression and n = 32 healthy control participants between the ages of 12-17 and applied a German version of the Children's Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire "CRSQ". Results: It was found that, compared to controls, depressive adolescents show higher RS, are more anxious about rejection, and rate the likelihood of being rejected higher. Furthermore, adolescents with depression more often indicated to resign to rejection and blame themselves for it than their healthy counterparts. Conclusions: Our results are in concordance with the clinical picture and with cognitive theories of the disorder. In future studies, it would be important to examine whether corresponding interventions can have a positive impact on the course of the disease.

AB Emotion regulation abilities are very important for psychological and social wellbeing during the whole course of life. By contrast, emotion dysregulation is a significant risk factor for several psychological disorders. According to developmental research, an optimal parenting style, described as warmth and affectionate, promotes the development of an adequate emotion regulation in children and adolescents. However, little research has examined the relationship between parenting style and emotion regulation in adulthood. In the present study, we tested the relationship between perceived experiences with parents, in terms of parental care and parental overprotection, during childhood, and emotion regulation abilities in a sample of adults. One hundred participants completed the Parental Bonding Instruments, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that perceived parental care was more related to emotion regulation abilities than perceived parental overprotection. In particular, perceived paternal care was strictly linked to several difficulties in emotion regulation. By contrast, perceived maternal care was negatively associated with the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and a specific emotion dysregulation dimension, that is lack of emotional awareness. In summary, perceived parental care seemed to have a key role to protect individuals from emotion dysregulation. These results demonstrate that parenting styles still exert their influence on emotion regulation abilities also in adulthood. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB The relationship and interaction between a parent and child is of an ever-changing nature. In the first years of the child, parents are more supportive of the child's development and guide the changes that take place. When adolescence ends and child becomes an adult, parent-child relationship takes on a different pattern in which the relation is more egalitarian. Despite this changing nature, research findings demonstrate that children who continue to receive emotional support from their parents, feel attached to them and care about their contributions and support. Thus, it becomes important to evaluate how certain parental properties affect psychological health within this changing relationship structure. From this point of view, this study examines the mediator role of emotion regulation skills, interpersonal relationship styles, and perceived social support on the relationship between parental emotional availability and general psychological health of individuals aged 16-25 who still live with their parents. It has been found that difficulty in emotion regulation, interpersonal relationship style, and social support has complete mediation effect on the relationship between both maternal and paternal emotional availability and psychological health.

AB Empathy involves understanding and "feeling with" others' emotions, and is an essential capacity underlying sensitive care in humans and other species. Evidence suggests that the roots of empathy appear early in ontogeny, and that individual differences in empathy bear meaningfully on children's social behavior and relationships throughout development. Here we draw upon attachment theory to provide a conceptual model of how attachment may contribute to individual differences in empathic development, with a focus on mediating mechanisms and moderators at multiple levels of analysis. We then review the research on attachment-related differences in empathy from infancy through adolescence. Given the theoretical predictions, empirical findings are surprisingly mixed and appear to depend on contextual, methodological, and developmental factors. We discuss potential explanations for the equivocal findings and highlight key areas for further investigation, including the need for longitudinal designs and multimethod assessment that captures the multiple dimensions of empathy in childhood.

AB Objective: Interest in protective factors for adversity has burgeoned, but the set of examined protective factors remains limited and most studies have focused on a single or narrow set of adversities. Using the resilience portfolio model as a conceptual framework, this study seeks to identify promising protective factors for individuals exposed to violence and other adversities. We include strengths drawn from the positive psychology literature in addition to established protective factors. We also explore the utility of the concept of poly-strengths, or the number of different types of protective factors an individual has. Method: Participants were 2,565 adolescents and adults from a rural, low-income community in southern Appalachia (64% female). Three kinds of adversity were assessed (victimization, stressful life events, financial strain) along with 23 protective factors representing 3 broader domains that are the focus of the resilience portfolio model: self-regulation, interpersonal strengths, and meaning-making. Results: The combination of strengths and adversities accounted for 42% of the variance in trauma symptoms, 50% of the variance in posttraumatic growth, and 58% of the variance in subjective well-being. Strengths associated with thriving included purpose, optimism, religious involvement, emotional regulation, emotional awareness, psychological endurance, compassion, generativity, and community support. Poly-strengths was uniquely associated with well-being after controlling for other protective factors. Conclusions: Expanding the range of studied protective factors and considering poly-strengths hold considerable promise to better understand resilience. A more strengths-based approach to prevention and intervention could improve outcomes in individuals who have experienced adversity.

AB The use of electronic communication technologies has become a core method for adolescent communication. While there are many benefits to such technologies, cyberbullying has emerged as a potential harm. This study examines the association between cyberbullying and adolescent mental health problems and the extent to which this association differs by sex and mental health problem type. A clustered sample of 31,148 students in grades 6-12 (Female = 51.9%; 56.5% Caucasian, 10.2% South Asian) completed an anonymous survey asking their frequency of exposure to traditional forms of bullying, cyberbullying, and experiences of mental health problems over the past 6 months. Multilevel structural equation modelling was used to examine the associations. Controlling for age and traditional forms of bullying, cyberbullying was a significant predictor of adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. Cyberbullying was more strongly associated with emotional problems for females and with behavioral problems for males. This evidence identifies unique adverse effects associated with cyberbullying on both emotional and behavioural problems and sex differences in the strength of these associations.

AB Adolescents' close friendships are an important and unique learning context in which adolescents can practice and hone their emotion regulation skills within an egalitarian, supportive relationship structure that provides important feedback on the effectiveness of the regulation strategies. This longitudinal study examined whether adolescents' involvement in supportive reciprocal friendships influenced the way in which they regulated angry feelings arising in these friendships. A sample of 299 German adolescents began a 30-month, 3-wave longitudinal study in grade 7 (151 boys, M age = 12.6 years; 100% White). They completed a social network inventory (LueNIC), a peer-nomination measure, and the questionnaire on Strategies of Anger Regulation for Adolescents (SAR-A) in every wave. Cross-lagged-panel modeling indicated a pattern of socialization effects even when controlling for previous friendship involvement, previous anger regulation, peer acceptance, gender, classroom membership, and possible friendship selection influences. Adolescents with more reciprocal friends at Time 1 (T1) reported using aggressive strategies of anger regulation (i.e., verbal and relational aggression, fantasies of revenge) and ignoring the friend less often at Time 2 (T2). Similar results were obtained between T2 and Time 3 (T3). There was a marginally significant effect for one of three non-aggressive strategies such that a higher involvement in friendships at T2 explained more reappraisal of the anger-eliciting event at T3 but significant effects did not emerge for the strategies of redirection of attention and explanation and reconciliation. The results are discussed within a socialization of emotion framework with implications for social skills training modules.

AB We examined whether cognitive control moderates the effects of emotion on adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptomatology in a longitudinal study of 138 adolescents. Self-reported positive affect (PA) and negative affect and behavioral and neural indicators of cognitive control, indexed by performance and prefrontal hemodynamic response during a cognitive interference task, were collected at Time 1. Self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were collected at Time 1 and Time 2 (1year later). Results indicated that higher PA predicted decreases in externalizing symptomatology, but only for adolescents with poor neural cognitive control. No moderation effects were found for behavioral cognitive control. Findings imply the beneficial effects of PA on the development of externalizing problems among adolescents with poor prefrontal functioning.

AB Research suggests that altered emotion processing may be one important pathway linking social risk factors and depressive symptoms. We examined the extent to which neural response to negatively valenced social information might help to account for the relationship between social risk and depressive symptoms in youth. Forty-nine youth were scanned while identifying the emotional valence of words that connoted social status. They also completed questionnaires assessing self-reported social risk factors and depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis revealed that reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in response to negative social status words explained the positive association between social risk and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that social risk factors present during adolescence may contribute to depressive symptoms by influencing the neural substrates of emotion processing.

AB Shared psychological processes between individuals occur most between a mother and her child because the mother-child bond is one of the closest forms of human attachment, in which a mother and her child are essentially wired to connect. We recruited mother-child pairs (N-dyad=19; adolescent: M-age=13.74, 11 males; mothers: M-age=44.26), who each completed an fMRI scan. We examined dyadic neural representational similarity as adolescents completed a stress task and mothers observed their child's performance during the same task. On average, mothers and their children did not show similar neural patterns during stress. However, neural similarity varied depending on family connectedness, such that only dyads reporting high family connectedness showed similar neural profiles. Importantly, increased neural similarity was associated with reduced stress in youth, suggesting that shared neural profiles in mother-child dyads enhance adolescents' psychological well-being.

AB This study examined whether the link between higher maternal sensitive guidance of emotional dialogues and fewer adolescent behavior problems is mediated by adolescents' more coherent representations of their mothers. The study also explored the consistency of this model across families from varied cultural backgrounds. Participants were 143 Jewish-Israeli mother-adolescent dyads from three cultural groups: immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, immigrants from Western countries, and native-born Israelis. Maternal sensitive guidance was observed during mother-adolescent dialogues about emotional experiences. Adolescents' representations were assessed via their narratives regarding their mother and their relationship. Examiners reported adolescents' behavior problems. Results indicated that across cultural groups adolescents' more coherent representations partially mediated the association between higher maternal sensitive guidance and fewer adolescent behavior problems.

AB Although community violence is an established risk factor for youth aggression, less research has examined its relation with internalizing psychopathology. This study examined associations of community violence exposure with internalizing symptoms, and state and trait emotion dysregulation as mechanisms underlying these associations, in 287 adolescents aged 16-17 (45.6% male; 40.8% White). Community violence exposure was associated with internalizing symptoms, negative affect during peer evaluation, trait emotional reactivity, and infrequent problem solving. Multiple emotion dysregulation indices were also associated with internalizing symptoms. In simultaneous multiple mediator models, indirect effects of community violence on internalizing problems were significantly explained by state and trait emotion dysregulation. Findings implicate emotion dysregulation as one mechanism linking community violence exposure to adolescent internalizing symptoms.

AB The essential role of affect and emotion in human behavior, motivation, cognition, and interpersonal interaction is emphasized in various efforts to understand how children develop. However, various theoretical traditions have focused on different features. In this article we focus on the views in attachment theory and the affect consciousness (AC) model/related affect integration perspectives. The attachment theory and the AC perspective/related affect integration perspectives are widely recognized approaches that explicitly focus on the role of affect, cognition, and behavior in the context of others as the main areas in both children's developmental processes and psychotherapeutic processes. However, these traditions represent both overlapping and contrasting views. On this background we discuss the following questions: 1. How does attachment theory describe the view on affect/emotion, motivation, cognition, and interpersonal interaction, and how do the AC perspective/related affect integration perspectives describe the view on the same subjects? What central theoretical similarities and differences do we find when we compare AC and attachment theory? 2. What role does AC play in attachment, and what role does attachment play in AC? 3. Can the AC perspective/related affect integration perspectives expand and provide nuance to our understanding of the role of affect and emotion in attachment theory, including an understanding of typical and nontypical emotional learning processes? We identified six central AC aspects that can expand our understanding of the function and role of affect and emotion in attachment theory. This understanding is considered central to both practice and research.

AB Background: This study quantifies the dynamics of maternal mood focusing on unpredictability, and to assess if greater unpredictability of prenatal maternal mood predicts child temperament and internalizing symptoms through early adolescence.
   Methods: The association between prenatal mood predictability and child internalizing symptoms were assessed in two longitudinal cohorts (N's = 227 and 180). Maternal mood was assessed repeatedly during pregnancy as early as 15 weeks' gestation. Predictability of maternal mood was calculated by applying Shannon's entropy to the distribution of responses on mood questionnaires. Maternal reports of child negative affectivity (a predictor of later internalizing) were collected at 6, 12, 24 months and 7 years of age. Child self-reports of anxiety symptoms were collected at 10 years and reports of depression symptoms at 13 years.
   Results: Fetal exposure to more elevated maternal mood entropy predicted higher levels of child negative affectivity at 12 months (r =.36; p< 01), 24 months (r =.31; p< 01) and 7 years (r =.32; p< 01) of age. In addition, children exposed to higher prenatal maternal mood entropy, reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms at 10 years (r =.24; p< 01) and elevated depressive symptoms at 13 years (r =.29; p<. 01). These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal pre and postnatal mood valence (e. g. depression levels) and for other relevant demographic characteristics.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide strong support for the notion that patterns of maternal mood influence the developing brain. More specifically, they suggest that prenatal maternal mood predictability may be a critical predictor of developmental mental health trajectories and should be considered when assessing early life influences on lifespan mental health.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the association between changes in ADHD symptoms, executive functions (EFs), and depression symptoms in girls and boys with ADHD over a 2-year period. Method: Thirty-six girls and 39 boys with ADHD, 18 typically developing (TD) girls and 29 TD boys (ages 9-16) were included. Assessments of EFs, ADHD symptoms, and self- and parent-report of depression symptoms were carried out. Results: For girls, a reduction of inattention symptoms was associated with a decline in parent-rated depression symptoms. A reduction in hyperactivity/impulsivity was associated with a reduction in self-rated depression symptoms in boys, and an increase in girls. A reduction in inattention symptoms was associated with a modest increase in self-rated depression symptoms in both boys and girls. Conclusion: Gathering information from both the parents and the child with ADHD is important in determining how gender may be influencing symptom profiles.

AB Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurologic condition associated with a wide variety of developmental deficits that have an important impact on children and adolescents. Objective: This article aims to document the psychosocial features of NF1 and to report the interventions described to address the needs of pediatric patients with NF1. Methods: A literature review was conducted concerning the social life, mental health, and quality of life (QOL) of children and adolescents with NF1 as well as the psychosocial interventions addressed to this population. Results: Compared to unaffected children and adolescents of the general population, pediatric patients with NF1 have an increased risk of having social difficulties, mental health disorders, behavioral and emotional problems, as well as diminished QOL. Only 3 articles describe interventions within the NF1 population to address these difficulties. Conclusion: There is a need to develop and assess psychosocial interventions for patients with NF1.

AB This study explored the longitudinal relations among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement in Chinese primary school students. Participants were N=945 fourth-grade students (485 boys, 460 girls; M-age=10.16years, SD=2months) attending elementary schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Three waves of data on peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement were collected from peer nominations, self-reports, and school records, respectively. The results indicated that peer victimization had both direct and indirect effects on later depression and academic achievement. Depression also had both direct and indirect negative effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later peer victimization. Finally, academic achievement had both direct and indirect negative effects on later peer victimization and depression. The findings show that there are cross-cultural similarities and differences in the various transactions that exist among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement.
   Statement of contribution
   What is already known on this subject?
   Peer victimization directly and indirectly relates to depression and academic achievement. Depression directly and indirectly relates to academic achievement. Academic achievement directly and indirectly relates to depression.
   What the present study adds?
   A developmental cascade approach was used to assess the interrelations among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement. Academic achievement mediates the relation between peer victimization and depression. Depression is related to peer victimization through academic achievement. Academic achievement directly and indirectly relates to peer victimization. Academic achievement is related to depression through peer victimization.

AB INTRODUCTIONParents have found the transition to adulthood for their sons or daughters with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) particularly challenging. The literature has not examined how parents work together and with others in face of this transition nor has it highlighted parental goals in this process. This study used a perspective based on joint, goal-direct action to describe the projects that Canadian parents engaged in together and with others relative to this transition.
   MethodsUsing the qualitative action-project method, joint projects between parents and with others were identified from their conversations and followed for 6months.
   FindingsThree groups of projects were described: equipping the young adult for adult life, connecting for personal support and managing day-to-day while planning for the future.
   ConclusionsParents act together and with others relative to the transition to adulthood of their young adult children with IDD. These projects are complex and differ in goals, steps, resources and emotional regulation and motivation.

AB ObjectivesLow positive emotionality (PE) represents a temperamental vulnerability to depression in youth. Until now, little research has examined the mechanisms linking PE to depressive symptoms. Starting from integrated cognitive-affective models of depression, we aimed to study adaptive emotion regulation (ER) as a key underlying mechanism in the temperament-depression relationship.
   MethodsThis study investigated whether adaptive ER strategies mediate the association between PE and depressive symptoms in a large community-based sample of youth, using a cross-sectional design. Participants were 1,655 youth (54% girls; 7-16years, M=11.41, SD=1.88) who filled out a set of questionnaires assessing temperament, adaptive ER strategies, and depressive symptoms.
   ResultsResults revealed that low PE was significantly related to higher depressive symptoms among youth and that a lack of total adaptive ER abilities mediated this relationship. More specifically, the infrequent use of problem-solving appeared to be of significant importance. Problems in positive refocusing and a deficient use of forgetting mediated the relationships between low PE and high negative emotionality (NE) in predicting depressive symptoms. Reappraisal and distraction were not significant mediators.
   ConclusionResults highlight the need to account for temperamental PE and adaptive ER strategies when studying youth depression. The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding on the differential role of temperamental risk factors for developing depressive symptoms at an early stage and advocate for greater attention to adaptive ER strategies.

AB Numerous data demonstrate that distracting emotional stimuli cause behavioral slowing (i.e. emotional conflict) and that behavior dynamically adapts to such distractors. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms that mediate these behavioral findings are poorly understood. Several theoretical models have been developed that attempt to explain these phenomena, but these models have not been directly tested on human behavior nor compared. A potential tool to overcome this limitation is Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM), which is a computational approach to modeling indirectly observed systems. Here, we administered an emotional Stroop task to a sample of healthy adolescent girls (N = 24) during fMRI and used HMM to implement theoretical behavioral models. We then compared the model fits and tested for neural representations of the hidden states of the most supported model. We found that a modified variant of the model posited by Mathews et al. (1998) was most concordant with observed behavior and that brain activity was related to the model-based hidden states. Particularly, while the valences of the stimuli themselves were encoded primarily in the ventral visual cortex, the model-based detection of threatening targets was associated with increased activity in the bilateral anterior insula, while task effort (i.e. adaptation) was associated with reduction in the activity of these areas. These findings suggest that emotional target detection and adaptation are accomplished partly through increases and decreases, respectively, in the perceived immediate relevance of threatening cues and also demonstrate the efficacy of using HMM to apply theoretical models to human behavior.

AB The present study investigated the role of afternoon cortisol in social-emotional competence and peer acceptance in early adolescence. To date, research on basal cortisol activity and social development in childhood and adolescence has predominately focused on understanding maladjustment and dysfunction in development. The degree to which basal cortisol is also involved in positive adjustment and social functioning remains largely unexplored. A total of 154 early adolescents (46% female; Mean age = 11.26; SD = .65) from diverse ethnic backgrounds provided self-reports of perspective taking, peer reports of acceptance by classmates, peer reports of prosocial behaviors, and saliva samples to assess basal cortisol. As expected and in alignment with previous research, afternoon cortisol, perspective taking, prosocial behaviors, and peer acceptance were all positively correlated. Path analyses followed by bootstrapping analyses revealed that the direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to higher levels of prosocial behavior was fully mediated by perspective taking skills. The direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to peer acceptance was fully mediated by perspective taking skills and prosocial behavior. The findings are discussed within the broader context of previous research on cortisol and social adjustment in childhood and early adolescence. The practical relevance of the findings is considered.

AB Background: According to literature data, psychopathology is associated with both quality of life (QoL) and suicidal risk in adolescents, but the literature does not fully support a direct association between psychopathology and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible mediational role of QoL in the relationship between psychopathology and level of suicidal risk in a clinical sample of adolescents.
   Method: The authors examined a clinical population of 134 adolescents, aged 13-18 years. Suicidal risk-having any current suicidal ideations and/or previous suicide attempt-was assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. QoL was evaluated by the adolescent self-rated versions of "Das Intervertar zur Erfassung der Lebensqualitat Kindern und Jugendlichen" (ILK: Measure of Quality of Life for Children and Adolescents) and psychopathology was measured by adolescent self-rated versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A mediational model, in which QoL mediated the relationship between psychopathology and suicidal risk controlling for gender and age, was tested by means of regression analyses.
   Results: Gender and age were both associated with suicidal risk. Self-reported QoL significantly mediated the relationships between emotional problems (= 1.846; 95% BCa CI: 0.731-2.577), as well as peer problems (= 0.883; 95% BCa CI: 0.055-1.561) and suicidal risk: more emotional and peer problems were associated with lower QoL, which in turn was related to higher level of suicidal risk.
   Conclusion: Based on this study, which aims to make further steps in suicidal prevention, our findings suggest that clinicians should routinely screen the QoL of their patients, especially in adolescents with emotional and peer problems. Furthermore, it is important to focus intervention and treatment efforts on improving the QoL of adolescents with emotional and peer problems.

AB Although several investigations-on primarily adult samples-demonstrate a potential role of emotion dysregulation in the etiology and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), investigations into the mechanisms that may underlie these associations in general and among adolescents in particular are lacking. The present study examined associations among emotional clarity (i.e., the extent to which individuals are confused about the specific emotions they are experiencing), (Gratz, Journal of Psychopathology Behavioral Assessment 26(1):41-54, 2004) anxiety sensitivity, and DSM-IV PTSD symptom cluster severity (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. It was hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity would underlie association between emotional clarity and PTSD symptoms. Participants (N = 50; 52.0% female; M (age) = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51; 44% White) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, anxiety sensitivity, and PTSD. Lower emotional clarity was significantly associated with greater total PTSD symptoms, as well as re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal symptoms. Additionally, there were indirect effects for lack of emotional clarity via anxiety sensitivity in relation to total PTSD symptoms [B = 0.17, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.04, 0.35)], re-experiencing symptoms [B = 0.15, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.03, 0.36)], avoidance symptoms [B = 0.12, SE = 0.07, BC 95% CI (0.02, 0.29)], and hyperarousal symptoms [B = 0.17, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.04, 0.36)]. Reversed models were violated, supporting the direction of hypothesized effects. Difficulties recognizing and accurately understanding emotions may increase risk for PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed youth. Furthermore, anxiety sensitivity may be a promising intervention target among youth at risk for PTSD, especially among those demonstrating poorer emotional clarity.

AB Introduction: Psychiatric and behavioral problems are frequent comorbidities of epilepsy, although their clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates remain uncertain. In this study, we have assessed the frequency of psychopathological problems in a cohort of children with epilepsy, and established their main clinical and EEG-associated features.
   Methods: One hundred fifty-nine young patients with epilepsy were recruited and assessed through the Child Behavior Checklist for preschool-aged children (CBCL 1 1/2-5) or for school-aged children (CBCL 6-18). Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) results were then correlated to the main clinical and EEG data.
   Results: We found emotional and behavioral problems in about half of the children in our sample. Internalizing, social, and attention problems were more common than externalizing features. Moderate intellectual disability, a nonidiopathic etiology of epilepsy, a poor control of seizures, and antiepileptic polytherapies, as well as an early age at seizure-onset and a longer duration of the disorder, were all associated with specific behavioral and emotional problems. A temporal site of interictal EEG abnormalities also enhanced the risk for psychiatric comorbidities, especially in the externalizing domain.
   Conclusions: Several clinical and EEG features are associated with an increased risk for emotional and behavioral comorbidities in children with epilepsy. Their identification may foster an early diagnosis and appropriate care, limiting the worsening of psychiatric symptoms and their impact on quality of life and health status. A better understanding of the underlying clinical and molecular mechanisms is needed to further improve prevention and treatment interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: We studied children and adolescents with epilepsy (CAWE) and their families to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life (QoL), and their correlations with epilepsy characteristics.
   Material and methods: The study included 326 (52.5% females) 8 to 18 years old CAWE. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the "Self-administered psychiatric scales for children and adolescents" (SAFA), and family's QoL with the parents' report "Impact of Epilepsy on QoL" (IEQoL).
   Results: The CAWE exhibiting abnormal (T >= 70) scores were 8.0% in the anxiety scale, 9.2% in the depression scale, and 4.6% in both scales. Social anxiety was the predominant anxiety symptom, while irritable mood and desperation were the most frequent symptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms were associated with parents' complaint of higher worries about the child's condition and future and lower well-being of the family.
   Severity and duration of the epilepsy and polypharmacy were independent from abnormal scores of anxiety and depression, but were associated with parents' worries about the child's condition and family's well-being.
   Conclusions: Anxiety and depression in CAWE are independent from the characteristics of the disease but are correlated to the lower well-being of the family. A search of these emotional problems is recommended for better care of the patients and their families. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE Although multiple cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that sleep problems and behavioral difficulties are associated in children, the directionality of this association and whether sleep problems are differentially associated with different types of childhood behavioral difficulties are unclear. Understanding these associations will inform the focus and timing of interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether longitudinal and reciprocal associations exist between child sleep problems and externalizing, internalizing, or both behavioral difficulties.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study using nationally representative data from the first 5 waves (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012) of the kindergarten cohort (4983 children aged 4-5 years in 2004) collected for the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Associations were evaluated using cross-lagged structural equation model analyses performed from May 25, 2016, to September 20, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child sleep problems and internalizing and externalizing behavioral difficulties. Sleep problems were defined using parent-reported child sleep problem severity and specific difficulties (ie, difficulty getting to sleep at night, not happy sleeping alone, waking during the night, and restless sleep) on 4 or more nights of the week. Child behavioral difficulties were defined using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for externalizing difficulties (conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention subscales) and internalizing difficulties (emotional problems subscale).
   RESULTS The 4983 children enrolled in 2004 had a mean (SD) age of 4.7 (0.2) years and comprised a similar percentage of boys (2536 [50.9%]) and girls. In 2012, 3956 children (79.4%) aged 12 to 13 years were retained. Significant bidirectional associations were detected between sleep problems and externalizing difficulties during the elementary school transition period, with greater sleep problems associated with later externalizing behavior and vice versa (cross-lagged path coefficient, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.08] to 0.09 [95% CI, 0.06-0.13]). Although sleep was a significant driver of later internalizing difficulties (coefficient, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.07-0.14] to 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12-0.19]), the reverse association was not significant. In the final model that included all 3 constructs, the associations were attenuated but remained significant over time.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that future studies should investigate whether implementing sleep problem intervention decreases the occurrence of both externalizing and internalizing difficulties. Interventions targeting externalizing, but not internalizing, difficultiesmay benefit childhood sleep.

AB Suicidal ideation (SI) is a common presenting problem for psychiatric hospitalizations in adolescents and often persists following discharge. This study examines whether distinct trajectories of SI could be delineated following hospitalization and the risk factors most strongly related to these trajectories. Adolescents (N = 104; 76 females; 28 males) were followed for 6 months after discharge from inpatient or partial hospitalization. Semi-parametric group modeling identified SI trajectory group membership. In all, 33.7% of adolescents fell in a Subclinical SI group, 43.3% in a Declining SI group, and 23.1% in a Chronic SI group. Multinomial logistic regression was utilized to examine baseline predictors of group membership. Emotion dysregulation differentiated Chronic SI from Declining SI. In multivariate analyses, adolescents endorsing greater non-acceptance of emotional responses (OR =1.18) and more limited access to emotion regulation strategies (OR =1.12) were more likely to belong to the Chronic SI than Declining SI trajectory. Those in the Chronic SI group also had the greatest number of suicide attempts and hospitalizations in the 6 months post-discharge. These results suggest that clinicians should closely monitor and address emotion dysregulation when assessing suicide risk. Greater dysregulation may require more intensive services in order to have an effect on chronic SI.

AB Background: A broad variety of different functions can underlie acts of Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Whilst research so far has identified many of the commonly reported functions, no reliable estimates of prevalence currently exist for these different NSSI functions. Understanding the prevalence of NSSI functions represents a key to better understanding the phenomenology of NSSI and addressing the differing needs of the NSSI population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of NSSI functions in community and clinical samples.
   Method: A literature search of electronic databases PsycINFO, Medline, and Web of Science from date of inception to March 2017 was undertaken. A pre-specified framework for categorising different functions of NSSI was used to collate data from across studies. A random-effects meta-analysis of prevalence was then undertaken on these data.
   Results: Intrapersonal functions (66-81%), and especially those concerning emotion regulation were most commonly reported by individuals who engage in NSSI (63-78%). Interpersonal functions (e.g., expressing distress) were less common (33-56%).
   Limitations: The review was limited to English-language articles. Reviewed articles were inconsistent in their measurement of NSSI. Inconsistency within pooled prevalence estimates was high when moderators were not accounted for.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that intrapersonal functions of NSSI are most common and are present for the majority of participants. This finding supports dominant emotion-regulation models of NSSI, and the use of interventions that work to improve emotion-regulation ability. However, interpersonal functions remain endorsed by a substantial portion of participants.

AB Background: This study aimed to determine whether there were sensitive periods when a first exposure to trauma was most associated with emotion dysregulation symptoms in adulthood.
   Methods: Adult participants came from a public urban hospital in Atlanta, GA (n = 1944). Lifetime trauma exposure was assessed using the Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI). Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between the developmental timing of first trauma exposure, classified as early childhood (ages 0-5), middle childhood (ages 6-10), adolescence (ages 11-18), and adulthood (ages 19+), on adult emotion dysregulation symptoms, measured using the abbreviated Emotion Dysregulation Scale.
   Results: Participants exposed to trauma at any age had higher emotion dysregulation scores than their unexposed peers. However, participants first exposed to child maltreatment or interpersonal violence during middle childhood had higher emotion dysregulation scores relative to those first exposed during other developmental stages; these developmental timing differences were detected even after controlling for socio-demographic factors, exposure to other trauma, and frequency of exposure to trauma. Further, after controlling for current psychiatric symptoms, the effect of other interpersonal trauma exposure in middle childhood was diminished and first exposure to other interpersonal violence in early childhood was associated with significantly lower emotion dysregulation symptoms.
   Limitations: Limitations of this study include the use of retrospective reports and absence of complete information about trauma severity or duration.
   Conclusion: These findings should be replicated in other population-based samples with prospective designs to confirm the importance of developmental timing of trauma on later emotion dysregulation.

AB The amygdala is a medial temporal lobe structure implicated in social and emotional regulation. In typical development (TD), the amygdala continues to increase volumetrically throughout childhood and into adulthood, while other brain structures are stable or decreasing in volume. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the amygdala undergoes rapid early growth, making it volumetrically larger in children with ASD compared to TD children. Here we explore: (a) if dendritic arborization in the amygdala follows the pattern of protracted growth in TD and early overgrowth in ASD and (b), if spine density in the amygdala in ASD cases differs from TD from youth to adulthood. The amygdala from 32 postmortem human brains (7-46 years of age) were stained using a Golgi-Kopsch impregnation. Ten principal neurons per case were selected in the lateral nucleus and traced using Neurolucida software in their entirety. We found that both ASD and TD individuals show a similar pattern of increasing dendritic length with age well into adulthood. However, spine density is (a) greater in young ASD cases compared to age-matched TD controls (<18 years old) and (b) decreases in the amygdala as people with ASD age into adulthood, a phenomenon not found in TD. Therefore, by adulthood, there is no observable difference in spine density in the amygdala between ASD and TD age-matched adults (18 years old). Our findings highlight the unique growth trajectory of the amygdala and suggest that spine density may contribute to aberrant development and function of the amygdala in children with ASD.

AB Presence and absence of both psychological distress and well-being are important in predicting life outcomes among youths. Recently, scholars have been paying increased attention to the role of positive mental health (PMH) in predicting psycho-social well-being among young people. The present study aims to test a model designed to assess the unique contribution of personality traits and metacognitions to four domains of PMH (belief-in-self, belief-in-others, emotional competence, and engaged living) among young adults. A total of 795 Italian college students participated in the study. Path analysis revealed that different personality traits were contributors to different PMH domains, and that four of the five metacognitions domains (negative beliefs about thoughts, cognitive confidence, need to control thoughts, and cognitive self-consciousness) differently predicted the four PMH domains. In conclusion it would appear that a combination of personality traits and metacognitions are differently involved in PMH domains. These should be taken into account when developing preventive programmes to promote PMH among young adults.

AB Objective: Longitudinal neuroimaging during adolescence/young adulthood, when bipolar disorder (BD) commonly emerges, can help elucidate the neurodevelopmental pathophysiology of BD. Adults with BD have shown reduced structural integrity in the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a white matter (WM) tract providing major connections between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC), important in emotion regulation. In this longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study of adolescents/young adults, we hypothesized differences in age- and time-related changes in UF integrity in BD compared to healthy controls (HC).
   Method: Two DTI scans were obtained in 27 adolescents/young adults with BD and 37 HC adolescents/young adults, on average approximately 2.5 years apart. Interactions between diagnosis with age and with time for UF fractional anisotropy (FA) were assessed. Exploratory analyses were performed including euthymic-only participants with BD, and for potential influences of demographic and clinical factors. Whole-brain analyses were performed to explore for interactions in other regions.
   Results: There were significant interactions between diagnosis with age and with time for UF FA (p < .05). Healthy control adolescents/young adults showed significant UF FA increases with age and over time (p < .05), whereas no significant changes with age or over time were observed in the adolescents/young adults with BD. Significant interactions with age and time were also observed in analyses including euthymic-only participants with BD (p < .05).
   Conclusion: These findings provide neuroimaging evidence supporting differences in UF WM structural development during adolescence/young adulthood, suggesting that differences in the development of an amygdala vPFC system subserving emotion regulation may be a trait feature of BD neurodevelopment.

AB Low resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and to a lesser extent excessive RSA reactivity to emotion evocation, are observed in many psychiatric disorders characterized by emotion dysregulation, including syndromes spanning the internalizing and externalizing spectra, and other conditions such as nonsuicidal self-injury. Nevertheless, some inconsistencies exist. For example, null outcomes in studies of RSA-emotion dysregulation relations are sometimes observed among younger participants. Such findings may derive from use of age inappropriate frequency bands in calculating RSA. We combine data from five published samples (N = 559) spanning ages 4 to 17 years, and reanalyze RSA data using age-appropriate respiratory frequencies. Misspecifying respiratory frequencies results in overestimates of resting RSA and underestimates of RSA reactivity, particularly among young children. Underestimates of developmental shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity from preschool to adolescence were also observed. Although correlational analyses revealed weak negative associations between resting RSA and aggression, those with clinical levels of externalizing exhibited lower resting RSA than their peers. No associations between RSA reactivity and externalizing were observed. Results confirm that age-corrected frequency bands should be used when estimating RSA, and that literature-wide overestimates of resting RSA, underestimates of RSA reactivity, and underestimates of developmental shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity may exist.

AB Background and ObjectiveCommunity-based mealtime management is an intensive, focused, and time-limited intervention for young people with an eating disorder which aims to support refeeding at home and thus prevent hospital admission. Little is known about clinicians' experiences of delivering this intervention. We aimed to explore mental health clinicians' perspectives on community mealtime management with children and adolescents diagnosed with an eating disorder.
   MethodsA qualitative design was used. Semistructured interviews were conducted with six mental health clinicians with experience of delivering or referral for the intervention. Interview recordings were transcribed and subjected to a thematic analysis.
   ResultsAnalysis resulted in identification of three themes: (a) technical aspects of mealtime management, (b) emotional aspects of mealtime management, and (c) a mixed zone of uncertainty around the use of dietary supplements. Overall, participants believed mealtime management to be a valuable intervention.
   ConclusionsFindings highlight the perceived need for more formal training for clinicians undertaking mealtime management, and the positive impact this could potentially have on their practice. Clinicians' emotion regulation during intervention delivery was perceived to be important. There was a perceived need for greater adherence to protocols but an acceptance that flexibility was also required.

AB Parents' emotional functioning represents a central mechanism in the caregiving environment's influence on adolescent affective brain function. However, a paucity of research has examined links between parental emotional arousal and regulation and adolescents' affective brain function. Thus, the present study examined associations between parents' self-rated negative emotion, parent emotion regulation difficulties, and adolescent brain responsivity to negative and positive emotional stimuli. Participants included 64 12-14 year-old adolescents (31 females) and their female primary caregivers. Adolescents viewed negative, positive, and neutral emotional stimuli during an fMRI scanning session. Region of interest analyses showed that higher parent negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater ACC and vmPFC response to both negatively- and positively-valenced emotional stimuli; whereas, parent negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli only. Furthermore, parent emotion regulation moderated the association between parent negative emotion and adolescents' brain response to negative emotional stimuli, such that parents with high negative emotion and high emotion regulation difficulties had adolescents with the greatest affective brain response. Findings highlight the importance of considering both parent emotional arousal and regulation in understanding the family affective environment and its relation to adolescent emotion-related brain development.

AB Load sharing is the process through which the emotional burdens associated with challenging situations are distributed among members within close relationships. One indicator of load sharing is efficient emotion regulation, and load sharing is related to high physical and relationship closeness between partners. The purpose of the current study was to examine load sharing in mother-daughter dyads across different emotion contexts during adolescence. We examined load sharing via mothers' and daughters' electrodermal activity, which indicates sympathetic nervous system arousal. Sixty-six adolescent girls (M-age = 15.15 years) and their mothers participated in two 4-min discussions, about negative and positive emotional experiences. Mothers and daughters self-reported relationship closeness, and physical closeness was experimentally manipulated by randomly assigning mothers to either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the discussions. Evidence of load sharing was observed for both mothers and daughters in terms of lower arousal levels and greater arousal transmission (i.e., picking up on partners' arousal) at greater physical and relationship closeness, although the specific pattern of results differed for mothers and daughters and across emotion contexts. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that load sharing is an important interpersonal dynamic in mother-daughter dyads during adolescence.

AB Prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) treatment in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is effective in reducing virilization in affected girls, but potential long-term adverse effects are largely unknown. In this report we intended to explore potential side effects of DEX therapy to enhance the adequacy of future risk benefit analyses of DEX treatment. We investigated the long-term effects of first trimester prenatal DEX treatment on behavioral problems and temperament in children and adolescents aged 7-17 years. The study included 34 children and adolescents, without CAH, who had been exposed to DEX during the first trimester and 67 untreated controls. Standardized parent-completed questionnaires were used to evaluate adaptive functioning and behavioral/emotional problems (CBCL), social anxiety (SPAI-C-P), and temperament (EAS) in the child. Self-reports were used to assess the children's perception of social anxiety (SASC-R). No statistically significant differences were found between DEX-treated and control children and adolescents, suggesting that, in general, healthy children treated with DEX during early fetal life are well adjusted.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and the presence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviors as well as restricted interests. These features have an impact on the oral health of these individuals: high risk of dental caries, poorer periodontal status, and bruxism are often described. Children with ASD often provide limited collaboration with medical procedures, particularly those considered invasive such as dental care. Children with ASD are prone to agitation, self-injury, and emotional dysregulation; they can also present hypersensitivity to sensory input. These features make it difficult for professionals to examine and treat children with ASD; they interfere with dental care and constitute a barrier to it. Most of them are treated under general anesthesia or sedation. Therefore, children with ASD present a challenge for the dental community. Adapted and specific strategies are required to allow individuals with ASD to go beyond the barriers of dental care. Different tools and techniques of evidence-based practice can be considered: visual pedagogy, behavioral approaches, and numeric devices can be used. Pediatricians have a key role in the oral care of children with autism. The aim of this article is to present the oral health associated with ASD, to set out the possible ways to improve oral health, to enable the practitioner to detect problems, to raise awareness, and to help patients and their families in their care pathway.

AB This study aimed at identifying specific clusters of maladaptive emotional-behavioral symptoms in adolescent victims of motorbike collisions considering their scores on alexithymia and impulsivity in addition to examining the prevalence of clinical binge eating behaviors (respectively through the Youth Self-Report (YSR), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), and Binge Eating Scale (BES)). Emotional-behavioral profiles, difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, impulsivity, and binge eating behaviors have been assessed in 159 adolescents addressing emergency departments following motorbike collisions. Our results showed a cluster of adolescents with clinical binge eating behaviors, high rates of motorbike accidents, and high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems, alexithymia, and impulsivity (23.3% of the sample); a second cluster of adolescents with clinical binge eating behaviors, a moderate number of collisions, and moderate levels of emotional and behavioral problems on the above four dimensions (25.8% of the sample); and a third cluster of youth without clinical binge eating behaviors, with a moderate number of accidents, and with low scores on the four dimensions (50.9% of the sample). Adolescents of Cluster 1 showed a higher likelihood to be involved in motorbike collisions than the youth in Clusters 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001). We suggest that adolescents' motor collisions could be associated with their difficulties in emotion regulation and with their impaired psychological profiles, which could also underpin their disordered eating. The identification of specific clusters of psychopathological symptoms among this population could be useful for the construction of prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing motor collision recidivism and alleviating co-occurring psychopathologies.

AB BackgroundThe Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is widely used to measure emotional and behavioural problems in typically developing young people, although there is some evidence that it may also be suitable for children with intellectual disability (ID). The Developmental Behaviour Checklist - Parent version (DBC-P) is a measure of emotional and behavioural problems that was specifically designed for children and adolescents with an ID. The DBC-P cut-off has high agreement with clinical diagnosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between DBC-P and SDQ scores in a sample of children with ID.
   MethodParents of 83 young people with ID aged 4-17years completed the parent versions of the SDQ and the DBC-P. We evaluated the concurrent validity of the SDQ and DBC-P total scores, and the agreement between the DBC-P cut-off and the SDQ cut-offs for borderline' and abnormal' behaviour.
   ResultsThe SDQ total difficulties score correlated well with the DBC-P total behaviour problem score. Agreement between the SDQ borderline cut-off and the DBC-P cut-off for abnormality was high (83%), but was lower for the SDQ abnormal cut-off (75%). Positive agreement between the DBC-P and the SDQ borderline cut-off was also high, with the SDQ borderline cut-off identifying 86% of those who met the DBC-P criterion. Negative agreement was weaker, with the SDQ borderline cut-off identifying only 79% of the participants who did not meet the DBC-P cut-off.
   ConclusionThe SDQ borderline cut-off has some validity as a measure of overall levels of behavioural and emotional problems in young people with ID, and may be useful in epidemiological studies that include participants with and without ID. However, where it is important to focus on behavioural profiles in children with ID, a specialised ID instrument with established psychometric properties, such as the DBC-P, may provide more reliable and valid information.

AB Inadequate sleep and problematic drinking are prevalent among high school students and are significant public health issues. Inadequate sleep may contribute to alcohol use through impairments in emotion regulation or cognitive functioning, whereas alcohol use may lead to inadequate sleep through the biological effects of alcohol or social influences. However, the directionality of the associations between sleep and drinking variables remains unclear as most prior studies were cross-sectional. This study utilizes longitudinal data from the NEXT Generation Health Study to examine bidirectional associations between alcohol use and sleep adequacy in a nationally representative sample across 3 years of high school. Students reported usual bedtimes and waketimes for scheduled-and free-days, alcohol use, and heavy episodic drinking. Estimates of sleep duration, chronotype, and social jetlag were calculated. Cross-lagged autoregressive models revealed evidence of alcohol use predicting subsequent sleep duration and timing, and sleep timing predicting subsequent alcohol use. Specifically, previous-wave alcohol use predicted shorter free-day sleep duration and later chronotype at 11th and 12th grade, and more social jetlag at 12th grade; similar results were obtained for heavy episodic drinking. Eleventh grade social jetlag predicted subsequent year current alcohol use; eleventh grade chronotype and social jetlag predicted subsequent year heavy episodic drinking. Bidirectional findings suggest that alcohol use and sleep may reflect mutually reinforcing life style choices. Understanding these bidirectional associations could inform risk prevention interventions. Given the implications of poor sleep for adolescents, further research on possible social influences on the alcohol-sleep relations is merited.

AB Extant research consistently links youth externalizing problems and later maladaptive outcomes, and these behaviors are particularly detrimental given their relative stability across development. Although an array of risk and protective factors for externalizing problems have been identified, few studies have examined factors reflecting the multiple social-ecological levels that influence child development and used them to predict longitudinal trajectories of externalizing problems. The current study examined externalizing behavior trajectories in a sample of 1,094 at-risk youth (539 boys, 555 girls) from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect multisite longitudinal study of child maltreatment. Normed Child Behavior Checklist externalizing scores were used to estimate group trajectories via growth-based trajectory modeling at ages 10, 12, 14, and 16 using the SAS PROC TRAJ procedure. Model fit was assessed using the Bayes information criterion and the Akaike information criterion statistics. Analyses revealed optimal fit for five distinct behavioral trajectories: low stable, mid-increasing, mid-decreasing, medium high, and high stable. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed that a combination of risk and protective factors at individual, family, school, and neighborhood levels contribute to distinct trajectories of externalizing problems over time. Predictors of low and decreasing trajectories can inform interventions aimed at addressing externalizing problems among high-risk adolescents.

AB The Delaware Social-Emotional Competency Scale (DSECS-S) was developed to provide schools with a brief, inexpensive, and psychometrically sound self-report scale to assess students' social-emotional competencies. Confirmatory factor analyses, conducted on a sample of 32,414 students from 126 public elementary, middle, and high schools in Delaware, showed that a second-order model consisting of four specific factors and one general factor (social-emotional competence) best represented the data. Those four factors are represented in the four subscales of the DSECS-S: Responsible Decision Making, Relationship Skills, Self-Management, and Social Awareness. The scale's factor structure was shown to be consistent across grade levels (i.e., elementary, middle, and high school), racial-ethnic groups (i.e., White, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and Multi-racial), and gender. As evidence of the scale's criterion-related validity, the total social-emotional competency score correlated significantly and positively with students' self-reported cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and total engagement. At the school level, social-emotional competence correlated positively with school-level academic achievement and negatively with suspensions/expulsions.

AB Emotion dysregulation is considered to be transdiagnostic in nature, given its association with a variety of problem behaviors. Of concern, emotion dysregulation also may be associated with key components of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS), namely suicidal desire and acquired capability for suicide (ACS; heightened fearlessness toward death and pain tolerance). ITS suggests that experiencing suicidal desire in conjunction with ACS leads to greater risk for suicide attempts. The present 4-wave longitudinal study tested bidirectional associations among emotion dysregulation, NSSI, ACS, and suicidal desire. Emotion dysregulation was associated with both desire and capability for suicide over time. Specifically, emotion dysregulation was associated with (1) higher levels of suicidal desire, (2) higher levels of NSSI, which in turn predicted higher ACS, and (3) lower ACS, suggesting that individuals with emotion dysregulation may find thoughts of death and pain more aversive. Thus, there are two separate paths for how emotion regulation leads to ACS, one path in which emotion dysregulation indirectly leads to ACS through NSSI, and one path in which emotion dysregulation protects against the development of ACS (note that higher levels of ACS alone are not sufficient to lead to a suicide attempt - suicidal desire also is required).

AB Background: Understanding factors influencing mental health of sexually abused teenagers is essential to orient treatment with this vulnerable population. The purpose of this study was to explore alexithymia as a mediator of the relationship between child sexual abuse and psychological distress using a representative sample of teenagers, while considering gender as a potential moderator.
   Methods: Teenagers participating in the Quebec Youths' Romantic Relationships Survey completed measures evaluating a history of child sexual abuse and alexithymia at baseline while psychological distress was evaluated 6 months later.
   Results: A moderated mediated model revealed a partial mediation effect of alexithymia in the relationship between child sexual abuse and psychological distress. Gender acted as a moderator as the conditional indirect effects of child sexual abuse on mental health via alexithymia were stronger for boys.
   Conclusion: Findings underscore the relevance of assessing and targeting sexually abused victims' capacity to identify and communicate emotions to promote well-being.

AB Childhood maltreatment negatively impacts the development of maternal and peer relationships and may put adolescents at risk for depression. The present study examined gender differences in maternal relationship quality and peer social acceptance as mediators of the association between childhood maltreatment and adolescent depressive symptoms in 342 (151 female, 191 male) maltreated (n = 198) and nonmaltreated (n = 144) youth in the USA. An observer report Q-Scale measure of depressive symptoms was developed and received preliminary support. Social acceptance was a significant mediator for both genders. The significant association between maltreatment and maternal relationship quality was unique to females, and the association between maternal relationship quality and depressive symptoms was significantly stronger for females. Lower maternal relationship quality marginally significantly mediated the association between maltreatment and depressive symptoms for females only. Results have implications for the prevention and intervention of depression in adolescents with a history of childhood maltreatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Working adolescents are at a greater risk of mental disorders than are non-working adolescents. The present study was aimed at determining the magnitude and determinants of emotional and behavioral problems in working adolescents.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 343 adolescents attending two vocational training centers in the province of Balikesir between January 2016 and March 2016. The data were collected with the Personal Information Form, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In the analysis, descriptive statistics, the t-test, Mann Whitney U test and one way ANOVA were used.
   RESULTS: In the study of the adolescents, 16.9% were determined to have abnormal emotional and behavioral problems. Of the participating adolescents, girls, those with physical illnesses, living in fragmented families, perceiving their economic status as good, having fathers with primary school education and/or having mothers with high school or higher education had significantly higher emotional and behavioral problem scores (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: In this study, approximately one-fifth working Turkish adolescents had abnormal mental status. Based on the aforementioned results, it can be suggested to develop intervention programs for the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of emotional and behavioral problems in working adolescents.

The etiological factors that contribute to substance use disorders are complex and the formulation must amalgamate and synthesize all the different factors including the predisposing, perpetuating, precipitating and protective factors in order to plan management. Interventions must stem from this comprehensive formulation and must be child-focused, multidisciplinary, multisystemic, with strong family participation and community involvement. The treating team must actively collaborate with the young person and help him/her understand the rationale for treatment in order for them to engage in it. Assessment and treatment of comorbidities are an important part of intervention package. Skill training for problem solving, emotional regulation, social skills, and communication are an essential part of the treatment for substance use disorders in adolescents. Relapse prevention strategies, including how to seek help when there is a lapse must be part and parcel of the interventions delivered to the young person. Substance use disorder interventions must be part of a larger plan that addresses other areas of concern in the young person's life. While there are few studies, and so a relatively weak and preliminary evidence base for pharmacotherapeutic interventions, early evidence shows that their combination with psychosocial interventions may have a synergistic effect on substance use reduction. Substance use disorders affect the entire family and the community at large and thus must be treated holistically, but by individualising the treatment to suit the needs of that particular child and family.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a frequent phenomenon in adolescents, however there is a lack of studies on the prevalence of NSSI in adolescents placed in youth welfare and juvenile justice group homes. The goal of the present study is to investigate the prevalence rates of NSSI and mental disorders in adolescents living in the youth welfare system, as well as how occasional and repetitive NSSI differ with respect to mental disorders, suicidality, and gender. The sample consisted of 397 adolescents aged 12 to19 years (mean age = 15.98, SD = 1.77, 65.7% male) placed in youth welfare and juvenile justice group homes. NSSI, suicidality, and mental disorders were assessed using the Kiddie-Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL). Lifetime prevalence rates of occasional and repetitive NSSI were 21.9% and 18.4%, respectively and 85.6% of the sample endorsed a lifetime mental disorder. Occasional and repetitive NSSI were significantly associated with depressive, conduct, and substance use disorders (d = 0.50-0.67) among both genders. Prevalence rates of repetitive NSSI in youth welfare and juvenile justice institutions are higher than in the general population and males who engage in NSSI are at particularly high risk of suicidality. Due to the high prevalence of NSSI and its related problems, NSSI should be routinely assessed in this vulnerable population and staff should be trained in recognizing and handling NSSI as well as supporting adolescents in improving their emotion regulation skills.

AB Dampening and enhancing responses to positive affect have been linked to depressive symptoms. The main aim of the present study was to examine such responses in an interpersonal peer context and to examine their relation with depressive symptoms. A community sample of 665 seventh-graders (52.0% girls, Mage = 12.7 years) took part in the study. Using a newly developed questionnaire, the Co-Dampening and Co-Enhancing Questionnaire (CoDEQ), a two-factor model distinguishing co-dampening and co-enhancing was validated. Relations with general depressive symptoms, anhedonic symptoms, and friendship quality were investigated. The direction of relations was examined over a 1-year interval using cross-lagged analyses. Cross-sectional results revealed that higher levels of co-dampening and lower levels of co-enhancing were associated with more depressive and anhedonic symptoms, while controlling for co-rumination levels. For anhedonic symptoms, this pattern also held over and above intrapersonal dampening and enhancing. Friendship quality was related to higher concurrent levels of co-enhancing and lower levels of co-dampening. The longitudinal results pointed towards a scar model, in that both depressive and anhedonic symptoms predicted relative increases in co-dampening over time; however, this did not hold in a model in which dampening and enhancing were included as control variables.

AB Background A long-term trend of increasing mental health problems among adolescents in many Western countries indicates a great need to investigate if and how societal changes have contributed to the reported increase. Using seven waves of repeated cross-sectional data collected between 1988 and 2008 in Sweden, the current study examined if economic factors at the societal level (municipality unemployment rate) and at the individual level (worry about family finances), and their interaction could explain a secular trend in mental health problems.
   Methods Participants were 17533 students of age 15-16years (49.3% girls), from 14 municipalities in a county of Sweden. Data on adolescents' mental health (psychosomatic problems) and worry about family finances were obtained using a self-report questionnaire. A series of multilevel regression analyses were conducted in order to explain the trends in adolescents' mental health.
   Results The results indicated that the individual-level predictor (worry about family finances) significantly explained the increasing rates of adolescents' psychosomatic problems. This was particularly the case during the mid-1990s, which was characterised by a severe recession in Sweden with high unemployment rates. For example, after accounting for adolescents' worry, a significant increase in psychosomatic symptoms between 1988 and 1998 among girls (b=0.112, P<0.05) disappeared (b=0.018, P>0.05) and a non-significant decrease between 1988 and 1995 among boys (b=-0.017, P>0.05) became significant (b=-0.142, P<0.05). Neither municipality unemployment rate nor its interaction with adolescents' worry explained psychosomatic problems.
   Conclusions The findings demonstrate the effects of adolescents' worry about family finances on a secular trend in mental health problems during an economically bleak period of time. The study highlights the need for repeated measurements including a large number of time points over a long time period in order to analyse time-specific putative explanatory factors for trends in adolescent mental health problems.

AB BACKGROUND: Research on the neural correlates associated with risk for suicidal ideation (SI) has been limited, particularly in one increasingly at-risk group-adolescents. Previous research with adolescents indicates that poor emotion regulation skills are linked with SI, but these studies have not previously examined neural activation in service of emotion regulation between those with and without SI histories.
   METHODS: Here we examine whether SI is associated with neural responses during an emotion regulation functional magnetic resonance imaging task in a group of adolescents (N = 49) 13 to 20 years of age (mean = 16.95).
   RESULTS: While there were no differences between youths with and without SI in self-reported emotional responses to negative pictures, youths with SI activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex more than youths without SI on trials in which they attempted to regulate their emotional responses compared with trials in which they passively viewed negative pictures. In contrast, during passive viewing of negative stimuli, youths with SI activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and cerebellum less than same-age control subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings were robust to control subjects for depression and adversity exposure and are consistent with the idea that youths with SI have disrupted emotion regulation, potentially related to differences in recruitment of top-down control regions. In contrast, youths without SI activated regions implicated in emotion regulation even when not directed to effortfully control their emotional response. This is the first study to examine neural function during emotion regulation as a potential neural correlate of risk for SI in adolescents.

AB BackgroundPrevious evidence indicates that mental health problems are becoming more common for adolescents. Less is known about whether these trends have continued and there has been no study to date which has specifically focused on early adolescents over a sufficiently long period. This study examines changes in parent- and teacher-reported mental health problems among 10- and 11-year-olds in 1999, 2004 and 2012 in Great Britain.
   MethodParent and teacher ratings of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were used to compare the prevalence of conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, emotional problems, peer problems and total difficulties among 10- and 11-year-olds in three nationally representative British samples assessed in 1999 (n=1904), 2004 (n=1348) and 2012 (n=11,397).
   ResultsTeacher reports showed improving trends for boys' and girls' mental health from 1999 to 2012, particularly for externalizing behaviours (i.e. conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention). Parent reports, on the other hand, identified only one area of sustained improvement between 1999 and 2012, namely hyperactivity/inattention among boys. Although parent reports of girls' mental health indicate improving trends from 1999 to 2004, they also suggest worsening mental health from 2004.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that perceptions of emotional and behavioural problems vary by the gender of the adolescent, the context in which they are observed or by whom they are reported.

AB Background Severe mood dysregulation is common in childhood and can be highly impairing. The Dysregulation Profile (DP) can be considered as a broader phenotype of emotional dysregulation, including affect, cognition and behaviour. Since mood dysregulation may persist, but differently in boys and girls, the gender associated course needs to be considered longitudinally to gain a better insight in order to support the children more adequately. This study is focusing on gender associated subgroup trajectories of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Dysregulation Profile (SDQ-DP) in middle childhood (9-13 years of age) and includes the potential impact of clinical and psychosocial characteristics.
   Method The data set was available from the BELLA study on mental health and well-being in children and adolescents, which is the mental health module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). A representative epidemiological sample of 564 children living in Germany was examined at three assessment points over 2 years (data collection 2003-2006). The SDQ-DP of children aged 9-13 years was evaluated using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA).
   Results For both genders three trajectories with low (girls 67.0% and boys 59.5%), moderate (girls 28.0% and boys 31.7%) and high SDQ-DP (girls 5.0% and boys 8.8%) scores were detected. The courses of low and moderate subgroups were stable, while in the high SDQ-DP subgroup boys showed a decreasing and girls an increasing trend in symptom severity on a descriptive level. The results of the multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed a significant influence of mainly externalising but also internalising problems both increasing the risk of moderate and high SDQ-DP in both genders. Good quality of life was a protective factor for the SDQ-DP course in all subgroups.
   Conclusion In addition to the known clinical and scientific value of the SDQ-DP, three distinguishable trajectories of SDQ-DP in boys and girls could be found. High externalising problems at the beginning of the trajectory were associated with an undesirable course of SDQ-DP. These findings might be helpful for better psychoeducation, counselling and monitoring in clinical cases and public health.

AB ObjectiveTemperament has associations with later physical health outcomes, yet there is a dearth of research exploring the connection between temperament and mechanisms that have known associations with these health outcomes. Recent research has delineated a connection between personality and inflammation during adulthood, but this association has not yet been studied in adolescent samples.
   DesignWe investigated whether stable adolescent temperament (averaged over two years), specifically effortful control and negative emotionality, provided a more robust prediction of inflammation as measured by salivary C-reactive protein (sCRP), than depressive symptoms.
   MethodsTemperament and depressive symptoms were measured in a sample of sixty-three adolescents (37 males) when they were approximately 12years old (mean age=12.30, SD=0.69) and again when they were approximately 14years old (mean age=14.84, SD=0.49). Levels of sCRP were determined approximately 7months later (mean=6.77, SD=2.99) when participants were approximately 15years old (mean age=15.49, SD=0.49).
   ResultsRegression analyses revealed that effortful control (EC) was significantly associated with lower sCRP levels, while higher negative emotionality (NE) was significantly associated with higher sCRP levels. Furthermore, these associations were larger than those for depressive symptoms and were differentially impacted by the addition of covariates. Implications for the role of stable risk and protective factors in inflammatory processes are discussed.
   ConclusionsThese findings are the first to show associations between adolescent temperament and inflammation. Furthermore, these findings extend previous personality research to temperamental research in a younger sample of adolescents.

AB Best friend expected emotion socialization responses were examined as a potential explanation for the link between social anxiety and youths' friendship quality and dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER). A community sample of 202 young adolescents (X-age = 12.66; 52.5% girls, 75.7% White) within 101 same-sex, reciprocated best friend dyads completed measures of social anxiety, friendship quality, dysfunctional ER, and how they expected their friend to respond to their negative emotions. Social anxiety was related to lower expectations of support (i.e., reward, override) responses from friends, and for boys, to greater expectations of unsupportive (i.e., neglect, aggression) responses from friends. Lower expected support responses mediated the relation between social anxiety and socioemotional functioning for girls. For boys, greater expectations of unsupportive responses mediated the relation between social anxiety and socioemotional functioning. Findings indicate that social anxiety may disrupt emotion socialization processes within adolescent friendships with implications for youth socioemotional functioning.

AB Girls with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at high risk of a range of social-emotional difficulties, including peer rejection, suicide attempts, and borderline personality disorder (BPD), which are associated with serious, long-term impairment and have not emerged as clearly in samples of boys with ADHD. BPD is a particularly concerning long-term outcome of ADHD in girls, given the high risk for suicidality and long-lasting relationship difficulties. Very little research has focused on treatment for the interpersonal impairments of girls with ADHD, or on addressing risk for developing BPD. This case study describes the use of behavioral parent training (BPT) with adjunctive social skills training (SST) to address the social-emotional difficulties of a 9-year-old girl, Violet, who was diagnosed with ADHD Combined Presentation and was being treated with medication for anxiety. Violet presented with many social difficulties, including low self-esteem, emotional dysregulation, and unstable relationships, which were conceptualized as borderline personality features (BPF). Treatment was associated with improvements in parent functioning, including reductions in caregiver strain and inconsistent discipline, as well as improvements in child functioning, including reductions in ADHD symptoms, a range of impairments, and BPF. This case study illustrates the benefit of a brief psychosocial intervention in reducing multiple indices of interpersonal impairment, including BPF, for a girl with ADHD.

AB Adolescence is a critical period for the emergence of a balanced personality in adults. Extraversion, neuroticism, and affective self-efficacy beliefs in emotion regulation showed to be good predictors of psychological well-being in adolescents. We analyzed the association between affective self-efficacy beliefs, personality traits, and psychological well-being of 179 Italian adolescents. We also analyzed the connection between adolescents' filial self-efficacy beliefs and psychological well-being and possible moderating effects of self-efficacy beliefs on personality traits. Results show that extraversion, neuroticism, and self-efficacy beliefs in emotion regulation are correlated with psychological well-being, while filial self-efficacy does not. Self-efficacy beliefs do not show significant moderating effects on personality traits, even if self-efficacy beliefs in expressing positive emotions reduce negative characteristics of individuals with high level of psychoticism.

AB Background: 25-35% of adolescents in random samples drawn from German schools have been found to have manifested at least one episode of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). The prevalence in samples from child and adolescent psychiatric clinics is approximately 50%. NSSI can arise as a symptom in the setting of various types of mental illness.
   Methods: This review is based on a selective literature search carried out in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases, with special consideration of regional study samples.
   Results: NSSI is usually resorted to as a dysfunctional coping strategy for emotional regulation. The main risk factors for NSSI include bullying, accompanying mental illnesses, and a history of abuse and neglect in childhood. Neurobiological studies have shown abnormal stress processing in persons with NSSI and an elevated pain threshold in persons with repetitive NSSI. Psychotherapeutic interventions of various kinds lessen the frequency of NSSI; to date, no particular type of psychotherapy has been found to be clearly superior to the others. Randomized controlled trials have revealed small to moderate effects from dialectic-behavioral therapy and mentalization-based therapy in adolescent patients. No psychoactive drug has yet been found to possess specific efficacy against NSSI in adolescents.
   Conclusion: The first ever German-language clinical guidelines for the treatment of NSSI have now been issued. Psychotherapy is the treatment of first choice. More research is needed so that subgroups with different disease courses can be more clearly defined.

AB Primary headache is a frequent and disabling disorder, common among children and adolescents, and it is a painful syndrome often accompanied by functional impairment and associated with emotional and behavior problems. The aim of this study was to investigate parenting stress and emotional/behavioral problems in adolescents affected by primary headache compared with healthy adolescents. The study population consisted of 35 adolescents and a control group of 23 healthy subjects. The assessment included the administration of clinical standardized scales such as Parent Stress Index-Short Form, Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Headache group and control group did not differ in terms of parenting stress (p = 0.29). On the contrary, headache group showed more internalizing problems (p = 0.023), affective problems (p = 0.01), anxious (p = 0.001), and somatic complaints (p < 0.001) compared with control group. In addition, we found a significant correlation between PSI domains and specific CBCL subscales in the headache group. The findings emphasize the need for expanded intervention in the clinical treatment of pediatric headache, a treatment that may also include the family members. Further research is needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Exposure to peer victimization is relatively common. However, little is known about its developmental course and its effect on impairment associated with mental illnesses. We aimed to identify groups of children following differential trajectories of peer victimization from ages 6 to 13 years and to examine predictive associations of these trajectories with mental health in adolescence.
   METHODS: Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, a prospective cohort of 2120 children born in 1997/98 who were followed until age 15 years. We included 1363 participants with self-reported victimization from ages 6 to 13 years and data available on their mental health status at 15 years.
   RESULTS: We identified 3 trajectories of peer victimization. The 2 prevailing groups were participants with little or moderate exposure to victimization (441/1685 [26.2%] and 1000/1685 [59.3%], respectively); the third group (244 [14.5%]) had been chronically exposed to the most severe and long-lasting levels of victimization. The most severely victimized individuals had greater odds of reporting debilitating depressive or dysthymic symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-5.17), debilitating generalized anxiety problems (OR 3.27, CI 1.64-6.51) and suicidality (OR 3.46, CI 1.53-7.81) at 15 years than those exposed to the lowest levels of victimization, after adjustment for sex, childhood mental health, family hardship and victimization perpetration. The association with suicidality remained significant after controlling for concurrent symptoms of depression or dysthymia and generalized anxiety problems.
   INTERPRETATION: Adolescents who were most severely victimized by peers had an increased risk of experiencing severe symptoms consistent with mental health problems. Given that peer victimization trajectories are established early on, interventions to reduce the risk of being victimized should start before enrolment in the formal school system.

AB Despite significant theoretical advancement in the area of child neuropsychology, limited attention has been paid to the developmental features of adolescence. The present study intends to address this issue in relation to executive function (EF). EF refers to the psychological processes that underlie goal-directed behavior; recent studies separate cool EF (psychological process involves pure logic and critical analysis) and hot EF (psychological process driven by emotion). Although neurological findings suggest that adolescence is a sensitive period for EF development, data on comparing the developmental progression in hot or cool EFs is highly missing. Moreover, while evidence has confirmed the relationships between EF and day-to-day functioning, whether and how hot and cool EFs contribute to core developmental outcomes in adolescence is still remained unknown. The current study aims to enhance our understanding of the development and impacts of hot and cool EFs in adolescence. A total of 136 typically developing adolescents from age 12 to 17 completed four cool EF tasks including Backward digit span, Contingency naming test, Stockings of Cambridge, and Stroop Color and Word test, and one hot task on Cambridge gambling task. Data on academic performance and psychological adjustment was also collected. Results showed that cool and hot EF exhibited different patterns of age-related growth in adolescence. Specifically, cool EF ascended with age while hot EF showed a bell-shaped development. Moreover, there were correlations among cool EF measures but no association between cool and hot EFs. Further, cool EF was a better predictor of academic performance, while hot EF uniquely related to emotional problems. The results provide evidence for the association among cool EF tests and the differentiation of hot and cool EFs. The bell-shaped development of hot EF might suggest a period of heightened risk-taking propensity in middle adolescence. Given the plastic nature of EF, especially over adolescence, the current findings may have practical implications for future EF identification and training.

AB Background: Youth with chronic physical health problems often experience social and emotional problems. We investigate the relationship between participation in the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada community-based mentoring programs (BBBS) and youth social and mood outcomes by youth health status.
   Methods: Youth newly enrolled in BBBS were classified by health status (one or more chronic physical health problems without activity limitation, n = 191; one or more chronic physical health problems with activity limitation, n = 94; no chronic health problem or activity limitation, n = 536) and mentoring status (yes/no) at 18 month follow-up. Youth outcomes measured at follow-up were social anxiety, depressed mood, and peer self-esteem.
   Results: Youth with chronic health problems and activity limitation were more likely to live with two biological parents, use mental health or social services, and have parents who reported difficulties with depressed mood, social anxiety, family functioning and neighbourhood problems. At 18 month follow-up, mentored youth in this health status group experienced fewer symptoms of social anxiety and higher peer self-esteem compared to non-mentored youth. Mentored youth with chronic health problems without activity limitation andmentored youth with no health problems or limitations did not show significant improvements in social anxiety and peer self-esteem. Regardless of their health status, mentored youth reported fewer symptoms of depressed mood than non-mentored youth.
   Conclusions: Youth with chronic health problems, particularly those with activity limitation as well, demonstrate a capacity to experience social and mood benefits associated with mentoring.

AB The prevalence of childhood overweight is a major social and public health issue, and primary assessment should focus on early and middle childhood, because weight gain in these phases constitutes a strong predictor of subsequent negative outcomes. Studies on community samples have shown that growth curves may follow linear or non-linear trajectories from early to middle childhood, and can differ based on sex. Overweight children may exhibit a combination of physiological and psychosocial issues, and several studies have demonstrated an association between overweight and internalizing/externalizing behavior. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of longitudinal studies on depressive and aggressive symptoms in children with high BMI. This study adopted a growth curve modeling over three phases to: (1) describe BMI trajectories in two groups of children aged 2-8 (overweight and normal weight) from a community sample; (2) describe the developmental trajectories of children's aggressive and depressive symptoms from 2 to 8 years of age. Results indicate higher BMI in 2-year-old girls, with males catching up with them by age 8. While overweight females' BMIs were consistently high, males' increased at 5 and 8 years. The mean scores for aggressive symptoms at T1 (2 years of age) were the same in all subjects, but a significant deviation occurred from T1 to T2 in both samples, in divergent directions. With regards to children's depressive symptoms, the two groups had different starting points, with normal weight children scoring lower than overweight youths. Overweight females showed lower depressive scores than overweight males at T1, but they surpassed boys before T2, and showed more maladaptive symptoms at T3. This study solicits professionals working in pediatric settings to consider overweight children's psychopathological risk, and to be aware that even when children's BMI does not increase from 2 to 8 years, their psychopathological symptoms may grow in intensity.

AB There is limited understanding of the relation between insomnia and aspects of eating among college students though available data suggest salient clinical relationships. The present study explored a potential transdiagnostic mechanism in the relation between insomnia symptoms and eating expectancies. Participants were a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 1589 college students (80.4% females; Mage = 22.2 years, SD = 5.27) from an urban university. Primary analysis included three regression-based models of eating expectancies. Insomnia symptoms served as the predictor, and emotion dysregulation served as the indirect (mediator) variable in all models. Results indicated that insomnia symptoms yielded a significant indirect effect through emotion dysregulation on expectancies of eating to help manage negative affect, alleviate boredom, and lead to feeling out of control. Students experiencing insomnia symptoms may be at higher risk for experiencing dysregulated emotions and consequently maladaptive eating expectancies compared to good sleepers.

AB As children grow older, parents feel more comfortable sharing information about relational issues. This study explored associations between parents' inappropriate disclosures, young adults' rumination, and difficulties regulating emotions in still married families. It was guided by the theory of communication privacy management. Participants included 371 young adults who completed an online questionnaire. Results indicated an association between parents' inappropriate disclosures and young adults' rumination as well as between rumination and difficulties regulating emotions. Rumination functioned as a full indirect effect, explaining the relationship between parental disclosures and young adults' general difficulties regulating emotions. Results emphasize the perils of inappropriate parental disclosures to young adult children and highlight reasons that young adults may have emotion regulation difficulties.

AB The present study is a bibliometric analysis of publications on interventions based on third generation therapies in children and adolescents during the years 2011-2016. For this, a descriptive study was carried out in which 60 scientific articles from diverse databases were analyzed, such as Proquest, Redalyc, Sage, ScienceDirect and Springer Science, Dialnet, Ebsco Host. It was evidenced that between the years 2012 and 2014 there was an increase in the publications of third generation therapies in Ibero-America and Europe. The International Journal of Behavioral Consultation & Therapy presents the largest number of publications in this field. In relation to the author who presents the most publications, reference is made to Swart, J as the principal. The theoretical review and the quasi-experimental study were the most reported methodology and Mindfulness the most used therapy. As for the country with the largest number of investigations in this area is the United States. This study allows us to conclude that third generation therapies have begun to gain strength in several behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. However, it is necessary to expand the research in this field since in most articles the degree of efficacy is not quantified.

AB High levels of violent crime plague Honduras, limiting economic, social, and human development. Numerous programs in the country seek to prevent violence and gang membership among youth. Fewer programs address young adults, and fewer still have a method to target those most at risk of violence involvement - either as perpetrators or as victims. This paper focuses on a method to identify and tailor prevention programs to the young adult population at elevated risk. The development and validation of the Violence-Involved Persons Risk Assessment (VIP-RA) tool is described. In Honduras, the authors validate psychometric and social risk assessment tools that have been empirically evaluated in the United States and Europe. Using criteria established to cover domains and risk factors identified in the literature, eight tools were selected for validation. VIP-RA is now a component of a workforce development program in Honduras that targets a population of primarily young-adult males between the ages of 16-30 living in high crime municipalities. VIP-RA was informed by the process to develop the Youth Services Eligibility Tool (YSET) in Los Angeles and the process to adapt the YSET for use in Honduras.

AB In adolescent and adult age the need for affection and belongingness is achieved mostly through the romantic relationship (Fletcher, 2002). Although aspects of romantic relations are well explored, negative sides like manipulative behaviour, are scientifically unattended. Personal characteristics, like emotional intelligence and attachment can be theoretically linked to aspects of manipulative behaviour. Thus, the aim of this research was to examine these relations. Research was conducted on a sample of 53 romantic heterosexual couples, a total of 106 participants (average age for women 26 years, for men 28 years). We used a modified version of Tactics of manipulation (Buss, 1992), Emotional Competence Questionnaire (Taksie, 2002), a modified version of Emotional manipulation scale (Austin et al., 2007) and Modified Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory (Kamenov i Jelic, 2003). The results show that attachment anxiety is positively correlated to indirect tactics for humouring. Partners who are more diverse in emotional intelligence and attachment anxiety are also more diverse in mutual tendency to use indirect tactics for humouring, in comparison to partners who are more alike in emotional intelligence and anxiety. The difference in self-reports about tactics of manipulation and partner's ratings weren't found, neither in couples who are more alike in emotional intelligence nor in couples who are less alike in emotional intelligence.

AB We present the results of the research of the link between emotion regulation and self-injurious behavior. The sample consisted of 706 respondents aged 14-35 (467 female). Methods: Emotion Dysregulation Questionnaire (Polskaya, Razvaliaeva, 2017), Reasons for Self-Injury Scale (Polskaya, 2017), Coping Behavior Strategies Questionnaire (Vasserman et al., 2008), Psychological Mindedness Scale (Novikova, Kornilova, 2014), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Osin, 2012). Results: we found out that self-injury is more frequent in females, self-injury risk is most severe at 14-21 years. Significant relationships were yielded for self-injurious behavior, emotion dysregulation, hindered awareness and access to emotions, and coping strategies confrontation, avoidance, self-control, and responsibility. Regression analysis showed that avoidance as a strategy of emotion dysregulation mediates the influence of negative affect on self-injurious behavior; another form of emotion dysregulation - rumination - predicts the increase of negative and the decrease of positive affect. Conclusions: emotion dysregulation underlies the cycle of negative affect aggravation that leads to self-injury. Adolescence and youth are the most dangerous ages when self-injury is used for negative affect regulation.

AB The goal of this study was to examine how individual differences in physiological arousal and reactivity moderated the relation between peer victimization and reactive and proactive aggression. Participants were 58 adolescents (61.2% boys; 54.9% African American) in the age range of 12-15. Participants self-reported peer victimization, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression. Cortisol and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were measured from participants before and during an online game in which they were socially rejected by unfamiliar peers. Results indicated that the relation between peer victimization with reactive aggression was significant and positive at low levels of resting RSA and when RSA withdrawal after rejection was high. The association between peer victimization with reactive and proactive aggression was also significant and positive at high levels of anticipatory cortisol. Findings provide further insight into the moderating role that physiological processes may have in understanding individual differences to peer adversity.

The instruments used were the spanish versions of the Educational Motivation Scale (EMB-S), the Traid Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) and the academic performance was quantified through the average grade of the students. The results showed stronger relationships between intrinsic school motivations and emotional intelligence than extrinsic motivations and amotivation. Likewise, emotional regulation, intrinsic motivation and demotivation predicted students' school performance. The influence of school motivation, emotional intelligence and academic performance in the personal and academic development of the students.

AB Family is an exclusive institution for the development of healthy or unhealthy emotion management skills of its members. The present study aimed to compare emotion regulation strategies used by the adolescents from nuclear and joint family systems. For this cross-sectional study 400 adolescents, 12-18 years of age were involved through purposive sampling. The scale used for the present study was Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and a demographic data sheet. For result analysis, SPSS version 21 was used to apply t-test. There were 200 (50%) males and 200 (50%) females with a mean age of 15 +/- 2.16 years. The family structure descriptive analysis revealed that 181 (45.3%) were from joint family structure, 193 (48.3%) from nuclear family structure, and 26 (6.5%) from extended family structure. T-test indicated that the Mean values of cognitive reappraisal for joint and nuclear family structures were 29.30 +/- 7.44 and 29.57 +/- 6.28, respectively, and the difference was insignificant. The mean values for expressive suppression for the two family structures were 15.82 +/- 6.41 and 17.61 +/- 6.31, respectively, with significant difference between the means (p < 0.01). In nuclear families, the adolescents use expressive suppression. The more the family members, the more attention will be paid to the development of children as in the joint family system. The joint families, having the traditional values can cater the emotional needs better than the nuclear families.

A sample of 898 adolescents (43% males, mean age 15.2) was evaluated. Participants responded to the questionnaire, the victimization and aggression scales of the Olweus questionnaire, and measures emotional problems (depression and anxiety). An exploratory factorial analysis, as confirmatory, indicated a subscale of being cyberaggressor and two subscales of Cybervictimization; Cronbach's alphas were suitable for such subscales. Convergent validity of the Cyberaggressor subscale was observed with the Olweus aggressor scale and the two Cybervictimization subscales with the Olweus victimization scale. The convergent validity of the instrument was also observed with the scores of depression and anxiety, as convergent validity of the instrument on depression and anxiety with a structural equation model.

AB Background: This paper discussed a case study of a 15-year-old girl who had had a hemorrhagic stroke, caused by arteriovenous malformation. A brain arteriovenous malformation is a defect in the vascular system, a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins in the brain. The patient attended regularly neuropsychological rehabilitation and several various therapeutic methods were applied.
   Material/Methods: A neuropsychological diagnosis was performed before and after therapy. The first assessment showed some cognitive disturbances: difficulties in the organization of memorized material, difficulties in maintaining attention and deficits in abstract thinking. Furthermore there were observed emotional problems: depression and high perfectionism. The patient participated in individual therapy lasting one year. The program was directed toward cognitive and emotional difficulties.
   Results: As a result, there was observed an improvement in consequent cognitive functions: organization of memorized material, working memory, abstract thinking and verbal fluency. The emotional state was stable.
   Conclusions: It is important that the therapy should be holistic and includes all aspects of the patient's functioning, which may have an influence on the final result of rehabilitation. One of the most important aims of the therapy psychologist was an acceptance of the disease. The cognitive tasks can also include psychological and therapeutic exercises.

AB Background
   The reading skills of 16% of children fall below the mean range for their age, and 5% of children have significant and severe reading problems. Phonics training is one of the most common reading treatments used with poor readers, particularly children.
   Objectives
   To measure the effect of phonics training and explore the impact of various factors, such as training duration and training group size, that might moderate the effect of phonics training on literacy-related skills in English-speaking poor readers.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 other databases, and three trials registers up to May 2018. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies that used randomisation, quasi-randomisation, or minimisation to allocate participants to a phonics intervention group (phonics training only or phonics training plus one other literacy-related skill) or a control group (no training or non-literacy training). Participants were English-speaking poor readers with word reading one standard deviation below the appropriate level for their age (children, adolescents, and adults) or one grade or year below the appropriate level (children only), for no known reason. Participants had no known comorbid developmental disorder, or physical, neurological, or emotional problem.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
   Main results
   We included 14 studies with 923 participants in this review. Studies took place in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. Six of the 14 included studies were funded by government agencies and one was funded by a university grant. The rest were funded by charitable foundations or trusts. Each study compared phonics training alone, or in conjunction with one other reading-related skill, to either no training (i.e. treatment as usual) or alterative training (e.g. maths). Participants were English-speaking children or adolescents, of low and middle socioeconomic status, whose reading was one year, one grade, or one standard deviation below the level expected for their age or grade for no known reason. Phonics training varied between studies in intensity (up to four hours per week), duration (up to seven months), training group size (individual and small groups), and delivery (human and computer). We measured the effect of phonics training on seven primary outcomes (mixed/regular word reading accuracy, non-word reading accuracy, irregular word reading accuracy, mixed/regular word reading fluency, non-word reading fluency, reading comprehension, and spelling). We judged all studies to be at low risk of bias for most risk criteria, and used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.
   There was low-quality evidence that phonics training may have improved poor readers' accuracy for reading real and novel words that follow the letter-sound rules (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.90; 11 studies, 701 participants), and their accuracy for reading words that did not follow these rules (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07; 10 studies, 682 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that phonics training probably improved English-speaking poor readers' fluency for reading words that followed the letter-sounds rules (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72; 4 studies, 224 participants), and non-word reading fluency (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.68; 3 studies, 188 participants), as well as their accuracy for reading words that did not follow these rules (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.39; 4 studies, 294 participants). In addition, there was low-quality evidence that phonics training may have improved poor readers' spelling (SMD 0.47, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.01; 3 studies, 158 participants), but only slightly improve their reading comprehension (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.62; 5 studies, 343 participants).
   Authors' conclusions
   Phonics training appears to be effective for improving literacy-related skills, particularly reading fluency of words and non-words, and accuracy of reading irregular words. More studies are needed to improve the precision of outcomes, including word and non-word reading accuracy, reading comprehension, spelling, letter-sound knowledge, and phonological output. More data are also needed to determine if phonics training in English-speaking poor readers is moderated by factors such as training type, intensity, duration, group size, or administrator.

AB Children's skill levels in language, mathematics, literacy, self-regulation, and social-emotional adjustment at kindergarten entry are believed to play an important role in determining school success through their long-term association with academic and social skills in primary and secondary education. Hence, children's school readiness is a national priority. To date, there is some evidence that specific individual school readiness skills relate to specific outcomes, but much of that research has not addressed concerns regarding generalization due to the high levels of correlations among the school readiness skills. The interrelationships among school readiness domains and patterns of skill acquisition - during the first three years of primary education in which basic skills are the focus and in the later years of primary or secondary education when higher-order skills are the focus - have not been explored adequately. Using the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development dataset (n = 1364), this research conducted growth curve analyses to examine a comprehensive set of readiness indicators in kindergarten and identify which domains were stronger predictors of academic and social trajectories through grade 3 and from grades 3 to 5. Results highlight the importance of examining multiple school readiness domains simultaneously rather than separately, and moving beyond outcomes (skill levels) at a particular grade to consider which kindergarten skills predict gains over time (skill acquisition) both within- and across-domains. Empirical and methodological implications are considered for educational research, policy, and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to establish a mediation model in light of current approaches for understanding trait anger and anger expression. Accordingly, the mediating role of early maladaptive schemas in the relationship between attachment and trait anger and anger expression was tested by considering gender and attachment figure differences. Four hundred and forty-four university students with ages ranging from 17 to 28 participated in the study. Participants filled out Parental and Peer Attachment Scale Short Form, Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form 3, Trait Anger and Anger Expression Scales and a demographic data form. The mediating role of early maladaptive schemas in the relationship between attachment (mother and father) and anger (trait anger, anger in, anger out and anger control) was found to be significant for both male and female participants. Separate mediation analyses for both genders and different attachment figures have also drawn attention to the noticeable differences in results. Consequently, these analyses revealed that different schemas were found to be effective in the expression of anger and trait anger in men and women, and attachment figures of mother and father influenced these schema scores differently. Results of the study were discussed in terms of anger being explained through attachment and schemas, and contributions and implications of the study were presented.

AB Objective: This study aims to explore family characteristics, parental attitudes and family adjustment of patients diagnosed with trichotillomania in comparison with healthy controls.
   Method: Twenty-four children aged 4-12 years admitted to two different child and adolescent mental health services due to hair pulling and 54 age, and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study. In addition to sociodemographic data, severity of illness was determined by Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity Index (CGI-SI). Parenting characteristics and family adjustment were assessed by Parenting and Family Adjustment Scale (PAFAS) and Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES-TR).
   Results: Mean (+/- SD) CGI-SI score in trichotillomania cases was 4.00 +/- 1.02 (mean +/- SD). Cases significantly differed from controls regarding family structure and the quality of parental relationship (p=0.025; and p=0.018, respectively). PAFAS scores of coercive parenting, parent-child relationship, parental emotional adjustment and parental team work were significantly different from controls (p=0.001, p=0.000, p=0.000, and p=0.009 respectively). Similary, emotional and behavioral maladjustment scores and parental self-efficacy scores of CAPES-TR were significantly worse in cases with trikotillomania (p=0.001, p=0.000, and p=0.000, respectively). CGI-SI scores were positively correlated with PAFAS scores of coercive parenting, parent child relationship, parental emotional adjustment and parental teamwork (p=0.003, p=0.000, p=0.000, p=0.008; respectively). While CGI-SI scores were correlated with behavioral and emotional maladjustment scores parental self-efficacy scores of CAPES-TR were correlated with CGI-SI scores (p=0.000, p=0.001, p=0.000, respectively).
   Conclusion: Considering family characteristics, parental attitudes and family adjustment in pediatric cases with trichotillomania may contribute to relationship based and behavioral interventions used for the treatment of these cases.

AB There is growing evidence linking emotion dysregulation to anxiety. However, few studies have examined this relationship longitudinally or developmentally. Additionally, no studies have specifically examined the predictive relevance of the emotion regulation skills taught in mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapies. We explore whether specific emotion regulation processes differentially predict specific anxiety symptoms over time among children and adolescents. Methods: Initial emotion non-awareness, nonacceptance, and difficulties with goal-directed behavior were assessed in a community sample (n=312, age range=8-16, mean age=11.68, 59% female, 69% Caucasian). Social anxiety, separation anxiety, and physical anxiety symptoms were assessed every 3months for 3years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the concurrent and longitudinal effects of emotion dysregulation assessed at baseline or 18months on anxiety. Results: After controlling for depression, age, and gender, all three processes concurrently predicted physical and social anxiety, and all but nonacceptance predicted separation anxiety. Only difficulties with goal-directed behavior, however, predicted longitudinal change in separation anxiety over time with covariates. Additionally, emotion non-awareness and difficulties with goal-directed behavior predicted subsequent changes in social anxiety. Conclusions: Emotion dysregulation may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of anxiety symptoms among youth. It may be beneficial to target reductions in maladaptive strategies in prevention or intervention work.

AB Individual differences in emotion regulation are central to social, academic, occupational, and psychological development, and emotion dysregulation (ED) in childhood is a risk factor for numerous developmental outcomes. The present study aimed to (a) describe the developmental trajectory of ED across early childhood (3-6 years) and (b) examine its sensitivity to youth serotonin transporter genotype, positive and negative parenting behaviors, and their interaction. Participants were 99 families in the Collaborative Family Study, a longitudinal study of children with or without developmental delays. Child ED and early parenting were coded from parent-child interactions.
   To examine serotonin transporter genotype as a moderator between parenting and child emotion dysregulation (ED), children with the homozygous short (SS) genotype were compared to children with the homozygous long (LL) or heterozygous (SL) genotype. We used latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) to model yearly change in ED from child age 3 to 6 years. LGCM revealed that ED decreased overall across early childhood. In addition, we observed separate Genotype x Positive and Genotype x Negative parenting behavior interactions in predictions of ED growth curves. Children with the SL/LL genotype had ED trajectories that were minimally related to positive and negative parenting behavior, whereas ED decreased more precipitously among children with the SS genotype when exposed to low negative parenting or high positive parenting. These findings provide evidence for Gene x Environment interactions (GxEs) in the development of ED in a manner that is conceptually consistent with vantage sensitivity, and they improve inferences afforded by prospective designs.

AB Temperamental approach is associated with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Negative family affective expression, or problematic communication about emotions, is also associated with youth's risk for symptoms. However, it is unclear whether negative family affective expression differentially predicts symptoms based on (a) youth's temperamental approach and (b) informants' perceptions of negative family affective expression. To address these issues, we explored whether mother-, father-, and youth-reported negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth temperamental approach and symptoms. Participants were 775 youths (71% male, 76% Caucasian) assessed at ages 10-12 (Time 1) and 12-14 (Time 2). Mothers, fathers, and youths reported on negative family affective expression and youths reported on temperamental approach at Time 1. Teachers reported on youth symptoms at Times 1 and 2. Youth- and father-reported, but not mother-reported, negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth approach and symptoms. When youths reported higher negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. In contrast, when fathers reported lower negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. Assessments and interventions for youth symptoms should include not only temperamental features, but also multiple informants' perspectives of family affective expression. Such efforts could promote greater family communication, address problematic family dynamics, and potentially attenuate risk for youth symptoms.

AB We present the results of modification and approbation of the Problematic Facebook (Social Networks) Use Scale on the Russian sample. The scale assesses various aspects of social networks use including preferring online communication among other types, using social networks to regulate emotions, constant thinking about social networks and frequent compulsive social network visits and their negative consequences. The study involved 900 people who filled out electronic forms posted in the leading Russian social networks - Facebook, Vkontakte, Instagram. The mean age was 28.6 +/- 7.5. It is shown that the Russian version of Problematic Social Networks Use Scale has good internal consistency. It consists of five factors and has good reliability and validity scores. Significant differences in cognitive emotion regulation strategies, positive and negative affect and personal anxiety in the low- and high-use groups confirm the external validity of the scale.

AB This study investigated the influence of cognitive and emotional regulation capacities on psychological stress symptoms in primary school students. Psychological stress symptoms may be influenced directly by regulation capacities or indirectly mediated via school performance. In all, 177 third-graders were monitored for psychological symptoms of stress, executive functions, emotional control, and grades in mathematics and German until the midterm of Grade 5. Results showed that individual psychological stress symptoms varied heterogeneously: however, psychological stress symptoms or their change over time were neither directly nor indirectly influenced by executive functions. Emotional control only had a small impact on psychological stress symptoms.

AB Increasing numbers of adolescents are seeking treatment at gender identity services in Western countries. An increasingly accepted treatment model that includes puberty suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs starting during the early stages of puberty, cross-sex hormonal treatment starting at similar to 16 years of age and possibly surgical treatments in legal adulthood, is often indicated for adolescents with childhood gender dysphoria (GD) that intensifies during puberty. However, virtually nothing is known regarding adolescent-onset GD, its progression and factors that influence the completion of the developmental tasks of adolescence among young people with GD and/or transgender identity. Consolidation of identity development is a central developmental goal of adolescence, but we still do not know enough about how gender identity and gender variance actually evolve. Treatment-seeking adolescents with GD present with considerable psychiatric comorbidity. There is little research on how GD and/or transgender identity are associated with completion of developmental tasks of adolescence.

AB Aim: The aim of this work is to analyze the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence, negative affect, satisfaction with life, and resilience on suicide risk in youth.
   Method: 144 college students of first year of Psychology with a mean age of 17.94 years (SD=.269) responded to a questionnaire containing demographic data and scales of perceived emotional intelligence; suicide risk, depression; anxiety; and life satisfaction.
   Results: 17 students (11.8%) had suicide risk and 8 (5.6%) had previously attempted suicide. A high risk of suicide was associated with lower levels of clarity and emotion regulation, resilience and life satisfaction, and high levels of anxiety and depression. Suicide risk significantly and positively correlated with negative affect (depression, anxiety) and negatively with the clarity and emotional regulation and life satisfaction. The regression analysis indicated that suicide risk was predicted by emotion regulation (17.2%), depression (14.9%) and life satisfaction (4%) accounting for 36.1% of its variance.
   Conclusions: It is necessary to design psychological interventions aimed at preventing or reducing suicidal ideation and suicide risk based on the results obtained, particularly regarding emotional intelligence (C) 2017 Sociedad Espanola para el Estudio de la Ansiedad y el Estres - SEAS.

AB Background: Borderline intelligence function (BIF) and specific learning disorder (SLD) are common diagnoses in children who are brought up for learning problems and school failure. Objective: The aim of our study was to determine whether there were distinctive aspects of cognitive testing routinely used in evaluating SLD and BIF and investigate emotion regulation skills and minor neurologic symptoms. Method: Sixty children (30 SLD and 30 BIF) who are currently attending primary school are selected for study. Visual Aural Digit Span Test - Form B, Gessel Figure Drawing Test, Bender Gestalt Visual Motor Perception Test, WISC-R, Emotion Regulation Scale (ERS) and Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) was administered. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between groups in cognitive tests. The emotional regulation ability measured by the emotional regulation subscale was better in the SLD group than the BIF group (p = 0.014). In the NES, sensory integration (p = 0.008), motor coordination (p = 0.047) and other (p < 0.001) subscales showed higher scores in the BIF group. Discussion: It has been shown that cognitive tests don't have distinguishing features in the evaluation of SLD and BIF. Emotion regulation subscale score of ERS and sensory integration, motor coordination, and total scores of NES can be used in both discrimination of groups.

AB We report the first Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis examination of self-harm and experience of clinical services in young people in the public care system. Qualitative interviews with 24 looked-after young people were completed. Prevalent themes were 1) Changes in care placement, 2) Feelings of anger, 3) Not wanting/feeling able to talk, 4) Developing coping techniques, 5) Clinical services: A relational mixed bag (subthemes: feeling (i) patronized, not listened to, (ii) nothing being done, (iii) comfortable/able to talk). Placement change and anger were highly salient to self-harm in this group and experiences of clinical services depended on individual relationships with clinicians. Implications include increasing compassion in therapeutic relationships, recognizing and managing emotional dysregulation, and increasing support during placement changes.

AB Guided by bio-ecological theory, this study aimed to: (1) identify heterogeneity in the developmental patterns of emotion regulation for maltreated preschool-aged children; (2) examine the role of gender, language, placement instability, cognitive stimulation, and emotional support on patterns of stability and change of emotion regulation over time; and (3) elucidate the role of emotion regulation/dysregulation patterns on later academic achievement. This study utilized data from the first cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Results using LCA and LTA models indicated stability and change in emotionally regulated vs. emotionally dysregulated latent classes across 4, 5, and 6 Vz years of age. Placement instability significantly increased the likelihood of being classified as emotionally dysregulated at wave 1. Moreover, children classified as emotionally dysregulated by age 6 1/2 scored significantly lower than children who were classified as emotionally regulated on measures of reading and math achievement by age 10. Based on these findings, placement stability at first contact with CPS should be promoted in order to prevent cascading negative effects on emotion regulation. Additionally, children who are more emotionally dysregulated by the time they transition to formal schooling should receive increased socioemotional and socioemotional learning supports.

AB Children who enter foster care are at unique risk for developing substance abuse due to experiencing early life stressors. A large body of research has revealed robust effects of various stressors on later substance use, implicating the role of early neurobiological changes that create chronic internalizing problems. However, less literature has investigated externalizing behavior as a mechanism underlying this relationship. Moreover, few studies have examined these mechanisms through a model of cumulative risk. The present study examined whether the prospective association between cumulative pre-adoptive risk (e.g., maltreatment, age at placement, foster placement instability, ever having lived with birth parent) and adolescent/young-adult substance use was mediated by childhood internalizing and externalizing problems in youth adopted from foster care. Participants included 82 adoptees, most with histories of prenatal substance exposure (72%). We tested parent-rated internalizing and externalizing problems across 5 years in childhood as simultaneous mediators of cumulative risk and level of substance use 11-15 years later. Bootstrapping mediation procedures, controlling for age, prenatal substance exposure, adolescent/young adult mental health symptomatology, and youth participation in follow-up, revealed a significant indirect effect of cumulative risk on substance use through childhood internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems. These results underline the importance of mitigating early risk for children in the child welfare system and call for targeting childhood emotion dysregulation to reduce likelihood of substance abuse among previously high-risk adoptees. Nevertheless, low rates of substance use overall in the present sample underscore the positive impact of adoptive placement on mitigating risk for substance abuse among foster youth.

AB Abnormal patterns of sympathetic-and parasympathetic-linked cardiac activity and reactivity are observed among externalizing children and mark deficiencies in central nervous system regulation of behavior and emotion. Although changes in these biomarkers have been observed following treatment, mechanisms remain unexplored. We used MEMORE-a new approach to analyzing intervening variable effects-to evaluate improvements in parenting as mediators of changes in sympathetic nervous system (SNS)- and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)-linked cardiac activity and reactivity among 99 preschoolers with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder who were treated using an empirically supported intervention. Decreases in negative parenting (criticism, negative commands, physical intrusions) were associated with increases in resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and pre-ejection period (PEP) reactivity to incentives from pre- to postintervention. Increases in positive parenting were not associated with changes in autonomic function. These findings suggest socially induced plasticity in peripheral biomarkers of behavior and emotion regulation and underscore the importance of reducing aversive interactions between parents and children when treating externalizing behavior.

AB Adopting a temporally distant perspective on stressors reduces distress in adults. Here we investigate whether the extent to which individuals project themselves into the future influences distancing efficacy. We also examined modulating effects of age across adolescence and reactive aggression: factors associated with reduced future-thinking and poor emotion regulation. Participants (N=83, aged 12-22) read scenarios and rated negative affect when adopting a distant-future perspective, near-future perspective, or when reacting naturally. Self-report data revealed significant downregulation of negative affect during the distant-future condition, with a similar though non-significant skin conductance pattern. Importantly, participants who projected further ahead showed the greatest distress reductions. While temporal distancing efficacy did not vary with age, participants reporting greater reactive aggression showed reduced distancing efficacy, and projected themselves less far into the future. Findings demonstrate the importance of temporal extent in effective temporal distancing; shedding light on a potential mechanism for poor emotional control associated with reactive aggression.

AB Recent research suggests that impaired emotion regulation (ER) may play an important role in the development of youth psychopathology. However, little research has explored the effects of ER strategies on affect in early adolescents. In Study 1 (n = 76), we examined if early adolescents are able to use distraction and whether the effects of this strategy are similar to talking to one's mother. In Study 2 (n = 184), we compared the effects of distraction, cognitive reappraisal, acceptance, and rumination. In both studies, participants received instructions on how to regulate their emotions after a standardised negative mood induction. In general, the results indicated that distraction, but also cognitive reappraisal and acceptance, had promising short-term effects on positive and negative affect in early adolescents. These findings suggest that targeting adaptive ER skills, such as distraction, acceptance, and cognitive reappraisal, may be an important strategy to prevent or treat psychological problems in early adolescents.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which cognitive emotion regulation strategies were common or transdiagnostic correlates of symptoms of depression and anxiety and/or specific correlates distinguishing one problem category from the other. The sample comprised 582 13- to 16-year-old secondary school students. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured by the SCL-90, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were measured by the CERQ, in a cross-sectional design. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. Before controlling for comorbidity, the same cognitive emotion regulation strategies that were related to symptoms of depression were also related to symptoms of anxiety. However, after controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms, rumination, self-blame (only girls), positive reappraisal, and positive refocusing (the latter two inversely) were uniquely (and significantly) associated with depression symptoms; and after controlling for comorbid depression symptoms, catastrophising and other-blame were uniquely related to anxiety symptoms. The results supported the cognitive content-specificity model, in which anxiety is supposed to be uniquely characterised by thoughts concerning the overestimation of threats and harm, and depression is supposed to be uniquely characterised by negative evaluations of self, and of past and future events.

AB Previous research mainly with monolingual children shows a positive relationship between English skills and emotion regulation. No study to date has examined if or how learning of grammatical morphemes might be associated with emotion regulation among bilingual preschoolers. This study examined how Mandarin-English bilingual preschoolers performed on three grammatical morphemes of plurals, past tense, present tense and whether the performance on the three morphemes was associated with emotion regulation. An elicitation task was used to assess proficiency in the three morphemes, and the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC) and the Disappointing Gift task were used to assess emotion regulation. The results indicate that Mandarin-English bilingual preschoolers had difficulties with all the three morphemes but they had a higher proficiency level on plurals than on past and present tense. Their proficiency in past and present tense was positively correlated with emotion regulation as measured by the ERC.

AB People with eating disorders have elevated interoceptive deficits and risk for self-injurious behaviors (SIBs). Across two eating disorder samples, the relationship between interoceptive deficits (IDs) and SIBs was tested. Study 1 (n = 100) found that suicide attempters and those engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) had greater IDs than those with no self-injury history. Lack of access to emotion regulation strategies accounted for the link between IDs and SIBs. In Study 2 (n = 92) multiple suicide attempters had greater IDs than single attempters and those engaging in NSSI; however, the latter two groups did not differ from one another. Interoceptive deficits may differentiate those who engage in severe SIBs from those who do not, and thus be a useful determinant of suicide risk severity among patients with eating disorders. Lack of access to emotion regulation strategies appears to be one pathway linking interoceptive deficits and self-injury.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine distress tolerance as a moderator of the relationship between emotional clarity and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed adolescents in acute psychiatric care at high risk of suicidal behavior. It was hypothesized that distress tolerance would emerge as a significant moderator, such that the association between emotional clarity and DSH would be significant among youth with high, but not low, distress tolerance.
   Method: Participants (N = 50; 52.0% female; M = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51; 44% White) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, DSH, history of suicide attempts, as well as a behavioral measure of distress tolerance.
   Results: Controlling for history of suicide attempts, results revealed a significant interaction between distress tolerance and emotional clarity in relation to DSH. Specifically, emotional clarity difficulties were related to DSH at high, but not low, levels of distress tolerance.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that DSH among trauma-exposed youth with high rates of past suicide attempts is most likely when low emotion clarity is coupled with a high tolerance for emotional distress. Given that DSH significantly increases risk for suicide among youth with psychiatric needs, assessment of emotional clarity and distress tolerance deficits is apt to be warranted to facilitate identification of these youth for targeted intervention.

AB Introduction Vestibular symptoms and damage to the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve is reported in individuals with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). However, the real life handicap caused by these vestibular problems in individuals with ANSD is not studied.
   Objective The present study attempted to evaluate the dizziness-related handicap in adolescents and adults with ANSD.
   Method The dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) was administered to 40 adolescents and adults diagnosed with ANSD. The study also attempted to determine if there is any gender effect on DHI scores and its correlation to the reported onset of hearing loss.
   Results The results of the study showed that adolescents and adults with ANSD had a moderate degree of dizziness-related handicap. The dizziness affected their quality of life, causing emotional problems. There was no gender effect, and the level of the handicap was greater in the cases in which the onset of the hearing loss was reported soon after the diagnosis of ANSD. There could be a vestibular compensation that could have resulted in a reduction in symptoms in individuals in whom the onset of the hearing loss was reported later on.
   Conclusion Thus, a detailed assessment of vestibular problems and their impact on quality of life is essential in adolescents and adults with ANSD. Appropriate management strategies should be considered to resolve their vestibular problems and improve their quality of life.

AB Background: We examined the relationship between general ability of mentalization, the specific aspect of affective mentalizing of self and others, emotion regulation strategies, and eating disorder (ED) symptoms.
   Method: Twenty-five female adolescent and young adult inpatients with EDs, and 22 healthy subjects, were administered a semi-structured interview - the Reflective Function (RF) scale, self-rating scales assessing alexithymia, emotion regulation, depression and ED symptomatology, and a neurocognitive measure assessing Theory of Mind.
   Results: Participants with EDs presented lower levels of RF regarding the self and higher levels of alexithymia, using more emotional suppression and less cognitive reappraisal than controls. Elevated levels of general RF and self RF and attenuated alexithymia, along with elevated cognitive reappraisal and attenuated emotional suppression, were correlated with attenuated ED symptoms. Comorbidity with depressive symptoms predicted greater ED symptomatology.
   Conclusions: High mentalization may serve as a coping mechanism to attenuate ED symptoms.

AB Burgeoning interest in early childhood irritability has recently turned toward neuroimaging techniques to better understand normal versus abnormal irritability using dimensional methods. Current accounts largely assume a linear relationship between poor frustration management, an expression of irritability, and its underlying neural circuitry. However, the relationship between these constructs may not be linear (i.e., operate differently at varying points across the irritability spectrum), with implications for how early atypical irritability is identified and treated. Our goal was to examine how the association between frustration-related lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) activation and irritability differs across the dimensional spectrum of irritability by testing for non-linear associations. Children (N = 92; ages 3-7) ranging from virtually no irritability to the upper end of the clinical range completed a frustration induction task while we recorded LPFC hemoglobin levels using fNIRS. Children self-rated their emotions during the task and parents rated their child's level of irritability. Whereas a linear model showed no relationship between frustration-related LPFC activation and irritability, a quadratic model revealed frustration-related LPFC activation increased as parent-reported irritability scores increased within the normative range of irritability but decreased with increasing irritability in the severe range, with an apex at the 91st percentile. Complementarily, we found children's self-ratings of emotion during frustration related to concurrent LPFC activation as an inverted U function, such that children who reported mild distress had greater activation than peers reporting no or high distress. Results suggest children with relatively higher irritability who are unimpaired may possess well-developed LPFC support, a mechanism that drops out in the severe end of the irritability dimension. Findings suggest novel avenues for understanding the heterogeneity of early irritability and its clinical sequelae.

AB Drawing from resilience theory, we explored the strategies that Mexican immigrant youth used to cope with stressors from being undocumented. On the basis of semi-structured interviews with 30 high school students who emigrated from Mexico to the United States, we identified several stressors from being undocumented, including having limited opportunities, fear of deportation, and exposure to negative reminders of their undocumented status. To manage such stressors, students utilized individual coping strategies (e.g. diversion, reframing, normalizing). In addition, the families of undocumented youth employed various coping strategies to help buffer their children against stressors from being undocumented (e.g. protecting the family unit, positive future, emotional support, limited communication). From our findings, we developed a preliminary model that describes the stress and coping of the undocumented youth in this study, which can extend past theorizing on resilience and thriving, as well as inform the design of community-based programs and policies for undocumented youth and their family.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate aspects of emotion dysregulation (ED) that characterize young adolescents with ADHD, examine the effects of subtype and comorbidity, and determine the extent to which ED is related to aggression and rule-breaking and social impairment. Method: We examined which aspects of ED are most relevant to ADHD in 180 young adolescents (75% boys), as well as whether ED differs across ADHD subtypes or comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) status. We also examined the association between ED and aggression, rule-breaking, and social impairment. Results: Young adolescent females and males with ADHD exhibited various manifestations of ED, including behavioral dyscontrol in the presence of strong emotions and inflexibility/slow return to emotional baseline. ED did not differ as a function of ADHD subtype or comorbid ODD. Three aspects of ED, namely, low threshold for emotional excitability/impatience, behavioral dyscontrol in the face of strong emotions, and inflexibility/slow return to baseline, predicted three of six measured indices of parent- and self-reported social impairment, above and beyond comorbid ODD. Conclusions: ED is associated with ADHD among young adolescents, does not differ based on ADHD subtype or ODD status, and is associated with social impairment.

AB This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination, experiential avoidance, dissociation and depressive symptoms in the association between daily peer hassles and non-suicidal self-injury among adolescents. Additionally, this study explored gender differences in these associations and tested whether the proposed model was invariant across genders. The sample consisted of 776 adolescents, of them 369 are males (47.6%) and 407 are females (52.4%), aged between 12 and 18 years old from middle and high schools in Portugal. Participants completed self-report questionnaires to assess daily peer hassles, rumination in its severe component (i.e., brooding), experiential avoidance, dissociation, depressive symptoms and non-suicidal self-injury. Path analysis showed that daily peer hassles indirectly impact on non-suicidal self-injury through increased levels of brooding, experiential avoidance, dissociation, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated significant gender differences in mean scores and path analysis. Male adolescents were more likely to engage in brooding and experiential avoidance in response to external distress (particularly, daily peer hassles), whereas female adolescents were more likely to engage in non-suicidal self-injury in response to internal distress (particularly, depressive symptoms). These findings suggest relevant preventive and intervention actions to address emotion dysregulation in adolescence, by teaching them acceptance and mindfulness skills as a way of coping with stressful experiences and internal distress.

AB This study compared individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a supportive child-centered therapy (CCT) for child anxiety disorders on rates of treatment response and recovery at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, as well as on real-world measures of emotional functioning. Youth (N = 133; ages 9-14) with anxiety disorders (generalized, separation, and/or social anxiety) were randomized using a 2:1 ratio to CBT (n = 90) or CCT (n = 43), which served as an active comparison. Treatment response and recovery at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up were assessed by Independent Evaluators, and youth completed ecological momentary assessment of daily emotions throughout treatment. The majority of youth in both CBT and CCT were classified as treatment responders (71.1% for CBT, 55.8% for CCT), but youth treated with CBT were significantly more likely to fully recover, no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for any of the targeted anxiety disorders and no longer showing residual symptoms (66.7% for CBT vs. 46.5% for CCT). Youth treated with CBT also reported significantly lower negative emotions associated with recent negative events experienced in daily life during the latter stages of treatment relative to youth treated with CCT. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of youth treated with CBT compared to CCT were in recovery at 1-year follow-up (82.2% for CBT vs. 65.1% for CCT). These findings indicate potential benefits of CBT above and beyond supportive therapy on the breadth, generalizability, and durability of treatment-related gains.

AB Background: The Secret Agent Society (SAS) Program, an intervention to enhance social-emotional skills, was provided by schools for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The program was assessed to determine if it improved social skills at school and home, and whether improvements were maintained.
   Methods: Eighty-four students participated. Key outcomes were parent and teacher ratings of emotion regulation, social skills, and direct child social problem-solving measures. The standard school curriculum served as the control condition. Phase 1 was a two-group waitlist-control comparison of SAS versus the standard curriculum. Phase 2 was a follow up of all participants before and after the intervention and at 12-months post-intervention.
   Results: Parent and child measures improved after the intervention but not in the waitlist condition. Improvements in parent, child, and teacher measures were apparent at 12 months.
   Conclusions: The SAS Program warrants further research as a potential program for schools that serve children with ASD.

AB Objective: This report summarizes the first study (to the best of our knowledge) of the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and physical activity (PA) levels in a sample of generally healthy adults. Methods: An online snowball sample of 110 generally healthy adults took part in this study and filled out measures of EI, PA, and background variables. Results: Analysis of structural equating modeling supported a path of positive association between EI and PA ranging from .20 to .28, controlling for background variables associated with PA. Of these, only education showed significant associations with PA. Conclusions: EI may play a role in individuals' PA patterns. Potential underlying mechanisms and directions for future research are suggested.

AB Sleep problems in youth reliably forecast the development of anxiety and mood disorders, presumably due to increased emotional difficulties. However, precise emotional mechanisms have yet to be delineated. The current study investigated how sleep problems in adolescence are associated with different emotion regulation strategies, and how sleep and psychiatric risk may be indirectly associated via poor emotion regulation. This study utilized data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative sample from the United States (N = 10,148; age range 13-18 years). A diagnostic interview determined if adolescents qualified for a mood or anxiety disorder within the past year. Participants provided reports of their sleep, emotion regulation, and current life stress. Adolescents who reported greater sleep problems were more likely to qualify for a mood or anxiety disorder and generally reported poorer emotion regulation strategy use, even when accounting for demographic characteristics and current stress. Specifically, adolescents with greater sleep problems reported less problem solving, and greater avoidance, suppression, rumination, and acceptance. Sleep problems were indirectly associated with anxiety disorders through greater suppression and rumination, and indirectly associated with mood disorders through greater rumination and lower problem solving. Although cross-sectional, this study extends current research by suggesting that certain emotion regulation strategies may be more difficult for youth struggling with sleep problems, and provides initial evidence that poor emotion regulation may be one factor contributing to sleep-based psychiatric risk. These findings can inform more efficacious intervention efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cross-sectional studies of bullying mask variability in categories of and persistence of bullying victimization. Longitudinal, individual-level data offers a greater insight into schoolchildren's psychosomatic maladjustment as a consequence of bullying. Swedish schoolchildren (n = 3,349), with unique identifiers, in 44 schools (4th-9th grade), answered a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Longitudinal trends for nonvictims (88%), ceased victims (4.7%), new victims (5.7%), and continuing victims (1.6%) revealed that new victims had the largest decrease in well-being; continuing victims had a smaller though not significant decrease; while ceased victims showed a small, (nonsignificant) increase in well-being over the measurement period. It was also discovered that children not bullied at baseline but bullied subsequently, differed, at baseline, from their never-bullied peers through lower levels of overall well-being. It is argued that this finding has implications for prevention strategies.

AB Bullying is a process of direct (i.e., youth who bully and are victimized) and indirect (i.e., bystanders) social exchanges. Though researchers often examine social and emotional correlates of bullying role behaviors, it is important to also consider the underlying cognitive processes associated with different bullying roles such as socially oriented cognitive processes associated with executive functions. The goal of the current study was to examine executive functions associated with types of bullying role behavior (aggression, victimization, defending, assisting, and outsider behavior) and differences between boys and girls within a sample of 689 third-to eighth-grade students (51% male, 49% female). Victimization was significantly and negatively associated with each executive function. Defending was positively associated with emotion regulation for upper elementary school students, but not for middle school students. Outsider behavior was significantly and negatively associated with self-monitoring, flexibility, and initiation.

AB The present study investigated differences between adolescents with a depressive disorder and control subjects in their adaptive und maladaptive regulation of negative emotions. We assessed emotion regulation strategies using the German self-report questionnaire FEEL-KJ in a sample of adolescents with depression (n = 57) and controls (n = 57). We found that adolescents with depression reported using less adaptive strategies and more maladaptive strategies for dealing with the negative emotions anxiety, sadness and anger than control subjects. Our findings indicate that adolescents with depression showed difficulties with regard to different negative emotions that should be considered in intervention.

AB Emotions, affections, optimism and satisfaction are relevant aspects of future teachers. The objectives of the study are to know the intelligence, affectivity, dispositional optimism-pessimism scores of the test subjects; to analyse whether there is a relationship among the variables under consideration; and to verify the existence of significant differences between them according to the social and demographic variables considered (gender, age and academic qualification). The study consists of 324 students of the degrees in Primary Education and in Early Childhood Education of the University of Jaen (Spain). The survey instruments used have been the TMMS-24, PANASN, SWLS and LOT-R. The results show significant differences (p<.05) based on gender favouring men in emotional regulation and pessimism and favouring women in negative affectivity and life satisfaction. There are considerable disparities among some age groups in the variables contemplated. Finally, important differences can be found in emotional regulation and understanding favouring the students of Primary Education and in negative affections in favour of Early Childhood Education students.

AB Reactive aggression refers to aggressive behaviour evoked by threat, provocation or frustration. While not all adolescents display reactive aggressive behaviour, these behaviours peak during adolescence. This review discusses whether typical patterns of adolescent brain development, particularly in circuitry of relevance to reactive aggression and which underpin emotional reactivity, regulation and social behaviour, may render some adolescents vulnerable to exhibiting reactive aggression. As highlighted by theories of aggression developed in adults, individual differences play a key role in determining the likelihood of aggressive behaviour. We therefore also consider factors such as hyper-responsivity to threat, poor emotion regulation and high levels of irritability, which characterise adolescents exhibiting clinical levels of reactive aggression. It is likely that normative development of the relevant neural circuitry interacts with individual and social risk factors to increase vulnerability to externalising conditions in a minority of adolescents.

AB Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) is one of the major emotional problems affecting music professionals and music students; it can only be addressed on a professional basis if a more profound knowledge of determining factors is acquired. This study examines one of these factors, scarcely investigated until now: the age at which an individual began music training. The relation of age of onset with MPA is examined here in two separate samples of music students/pupils in Spain: one of 437 advanced music students (mean age = 22.64 years) and another one consisting of 209 pupils enrolled in music schools (mean age = 12.09 years). The first sample was tested with the Spanish version of the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Index (KMPAI), and the second sample was tested with the Performance Anxiety Questionnaire (PAQ) elaborated by Cox and Kenardy (1993). These two independent samples, tested with different evaluation tools, yield results that indicate a significant relation between the age of musical training onset and the individual's currently perceived level of MPA. Those students/pupils who started at the age of 7 or younger report lower levels of MPA. The article concludes with a discussion of these results' potential implications on a theoretical and practical level.

AB Background. The aim of this study was to explore and characterize the nature of the inter-relationship between cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms.
   Method: One hundred and twenty-one adolescents and adults with ASD aged 14-79 years (M-age = 32.18; SDage = 15.71) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire -9, and Autism Spectrum Quotient-Short (AQ-Short). Individuals were recruited into two nation-wide studies. Participants self-reported a clinical diagnosis of ASD and had an AQ-Short score above the suggested cut-off of 65. Correlation and regression analyses, independent -samples t -tests, Kruskal-Wallis, and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted.
   Results: Higher depression levels were related to high suppression and low reappraisal use. Both suppression and reappraisal predicted variance in symptoms of depression over and above ASD traits. Individuals who self -reported high suppression and low reappraisal use expressed higher depressive symptoms than individuals who reported high use of both suppression and reappraisal.
   Conclusions: This is the first study in ASD that aimed to characterize the interactions between adaptive (reappraisal) and maladaptive (suppression) strategy use. Our results demonstrate that reappraisal may serve as a protective factor for mental health in individuals who habitually use maladaptive strategies such as suppression.

AB Background: Children with a developmental disability are three to four times more likely than their typically developing peers of developing significant emotional and behavioural problems. There is strong evidence to suggest that individual biological and psychological factors interact with family functioning to precipitate and perpetuate these problems.
   Aims: This study examined the psychometric properties of a brief measure, the Parent and Family Adjustment Scales (PAFAS) for use with parents of children with a developmental disability.
   Methods: A sample of 914 parents of children (M = 6.27 years) with a developmental disability participated in the study. Disabilities included Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability
   Results: A confirmatory factor analysis supported a 16-item, four factor model of PAFAS Parenting, and an 11-item, three factor model of PAFAS Family Adjustment. The Parenting Scale measures parental consistency, coercive practices, use of encouragement and the quality of parent-child relationship. The Family Adjustment Scale measures parental emotional adjustment and partner and family support in parenting.
   Conclusions: The current study indicated that the PAFAS demonstrates promise as a brief measure of multiple domains of family functioning important for families who have a child with a developmental disability.

AB Objective: To identify child behaviors and types of impairment that increase the likelihood of maternal recognition of emotional/behavioral problems (EBP) in children and adolescents.
   Methods: Maternal-reported data were obtained from two subsamples of 11-to-16-year-olds derived from cross-sectional studies conducted in two Brazilian municipalities: Itaborai, state of Rio de Janeiro (n=480), and Embu, state of Sao Paulo (n=217). The Itaborai study involved a representative sample of 6-to-16-year-olds (n=1,248; response rate = 86.0%) selected from the Family Health Program registry, which covered 85.5% of the municipal population. The Embu study was based on a probabilistic sample of clusters of eligible households (women aged 15-49 years, child < 18 years), with one mother-child pair selected randomly per household (n=813; response rate = 82.4%). The outcome variable was mother's opinion of whether her child had EBP. Potential correlates included types of child behaviors (hyperactivity/conduct/emotional problems as isolated or combined conditions) and impairment, assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); child's age and gender; maternal education and anxiety/depression (assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire [SRQ]).
   Results: Multivariate regression models identified the following correlates of maternal perception of child EBP: comorbidity (co-occurring hyperactivity/conduct/emotional problems), emotional problems alone, and interference of problems with classroom learning and friendships.
   Conclusion: Comorbidity of different problem types, emotional problems alone, and interference with classroom learning and friendships increase the likelihood of maternal recognition of EBP in children.

AB Misuse of digital leisure produce several cognitive and emotional problems in children of school age. In this sense, the use of violent video games can generate disorders on prosocial behavior in younger sectors of population, being linked to aggressive behaviors of different type. This descriptive and cross-sectional study, which was carry out on a sample of 519 student (M = 11.77 +/- 1.19) of Primary Education from the province of Granada, aims to determine the relationship between violent behaviour at school, kind of victimization and problematic use of video games and its type. The main instruments employed were the Scale of Aggressive Behaviour at School (Little, Henrich, Jones, & Hawley, 2003), the School Victimization Scale (Mynard & Joseph, 2000), and the Questionnaire of Experiences related to Video games (Chamarro et al., 2014). Results show that children, who suffer potential and severe problems related to video games, had higher scores in direct and relational aggressiveness, and physical and verbal victimization. In addition, playing action and role video games, which are related to violent contents, was associated with higher levels of direct aggression and relational victimization. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between problematic use of video games and all types of aggression and victimization. In conclusion, it is shown that the use of display devices is greatly related to levels of aggressiveness and victimization in school, revealing the importance of using properly these devices and promoting prosocial behaviours from different statements in order to alleviate this problem.

AB The concept of emotion regulation (ER) refers to the ability to perceive, assimilate, understand, and regulate emotions. Although ER is an eminently adaptive process, efforts to modify emotional states can be ineffective and even counterproductive and be part of the vulnerability and the symptoms of various mental disorders. Many research has pointed to adolescence as the most important developmental period for the acquisition of this skill. Given its importance, it is essential to have good assessment tools. The aim of this study was to determinate the psychometric properties of the "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire" (ERQ-CA) in Spanish adolescents. For this, 399 participants (178 boys and 221 girls) with a mean age of 15.27 completed the questionnaires ERQ-CA and "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale" (DERS). Subsequently, the exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency and convergent validity analysis was performed. The results revealed that the factorial analysis showed a two-factor structure, the internal consistency for the subscales was not acceptable compared to values obtained in validations with adults and as for the convergent validity, correlation between the two instruments was small. The ERQ-CA shows low levels of reliability in adolescent population. For this reason, more research is needed to confirm the use of the questionnaire in this population.

AB Loneliness is prevalent in adolescents. Although it can be a normative experience, children and adolescents who experience loneliness are often at risk for anxiety, depression, and suicide. Research efforts have been made to identify the neurobiological basis of such distressful feelings in our social brain. In adolescents, the social brain is still undergoing significant development, which may contribute to their increased and differential sensitivity to the social environment. Many behavioral studies have shown the significance of attachment security and social skills in adolescents' interactions with the social world. In this review, we propose a developmental social neuroscience model that extends from the social neuroscience model of loneliness. In particular, we argue that the social brain and social skills are both important for the development of adolescents' perceived loneliness and that adolescents' familial attachment sets the baseline for neurobiological development. By reviewing the related behavioral and neuroimaging literature, we propose a developmental social neuroscience model to explain the heightened perception of loneliness in adolescents using social skills and attachment style as neurobiological moderators. We encourage future researchers to investigate adolescents' perceived social connectedness from the developmental neuroscience perspective.

AB The association between suicide risk and exposure to violence in the home, street, school, television in adolescents of Santa Marta (Colombia) was analyzed. A sample of 210 adolescents aged 12-19 years (M = 14.6 SD = 1.38) was evaluated. The subjects responded to the Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale and the Violence Exposure Scale. We found a bivariate association with exposure to violence in the home. In an adjusted logistic regression model the support of parents / siblings / friends (OR = 0.213 CI 95% = 0.70-0649) is a protective factor for suicidal risk, while female gender (OR = 5.397 95% CI = 2.541-11.460), exposure to violence in the home (OR = 2.344, 95% CI = 1.161-4.298) and difficulties in entering education (OR = 3.257, 95% CI = 1013-10.467) are risk factors. It is concluded that adolescent women, victims of domestic violence and with problems to access basic education are more likely to present suicidal risk.

AB This paper aims to identify different profiles of emotional regulation, and to see if they differ in academic stress coping strategies. The participants were 487 physiotherapy students (74% female) from different universities, aged between 18 and 40 years. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Cuestionario de Estres Academico (CEA) were applied. A total of three emotional regulation profiles were obtained in the cluster analysis. The first one is composed of students with low emotional regulation, a second group with mixed results was obtained and a third cluster shows students with high emotional regulation. Statistically significant differences in all the coping strategies were found between the profiles of low and high emotional regulation.

AB Objectives: In this study we aimed to evaluate emotion recognition and emotion regulation skills of children with exogenous obesity between the ages of 11 and 18 years and compare them with healthy controls.Methods: The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children was used for psychiatric evaluations. Emotion recognition skills were evaluated using Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The Difficulties in Emotions Regulation Scale was used for evaluating skills of emotion regulation.Results: Children with obesity had lower scores on Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, and experienced greater difficulty in emotional regulation skills.Conclusions: Improved understanding of emotional recognition and emotion regulation in young people with obesity may improve their social adaptation and help in the treatment of their disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate both emotional recognition and emotion regulation functions in obese children and obese adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age.

AB Objective: Dysfunctional and functional emotion regulation strategies in adolescence have so far been examined separately, but not in interaction. Our aim is to analyze a possible compensation of dysfunctional regulation strategies through functional strategies in depressive symptoms. Method: The Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire (REQ) was used to examine the ability of emotion regulation in 247 adolescents between 12 to 17 years (M = 14.41, SD = 1.39). To measure depressive symptoms, Allgemeine Depressionsskala (ADS) was established. Results: Results speak for a compensation of internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies with internal-functional emotion regulation strategies in girls. In boys, functional emotion regulation strategies strengthen the relationship between internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms. Other strategies do not interact with each another. Conclusions: Results indicate a compensative effect in girls, while in boys functional emotion regulation seems to have an amplifying effect on depressive symptoms. Results suggest that boys use functional strategies in a dysfunctional way, while girls are able to use them appropriately. An exploration of the understanding of functional emotion regulation may enable approaches to treatment.

AB Objectives: The present investigation studied the differences in emotional experiences among alcohol-dependent patients in inpatient psychotherapy, taking into account their traumatic experiences and relationship-specific attachment styles.
   Methods: Three standardized instruments were used on this clinical sample of 70 patients in inpatient psychotherapy: (1) Scales for Experiencing Emotions (SEE), (2) Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), (3) Relationship-Specific Attachment Scales for Adults (RASA).
   Results: The results showed that traumatic experiences in childhood and adolescence as well as relationship-specific attachment styles were indeed associated with deficits in emotional experience and regulation. Especially emotional abuse was associated with deficits in emotional experience. An insecure attachment style was associated with a lower level of acceptance of emotions, a lower level of self-control, and dysfunctional emotion regulation. In particular, the attachment style to the mother seems to be important.
   Discussion: These results suggest that a distinction of alcohol-addicted patients, with respect to attachment styles and traumatic experiences in childhood and adolescent, seems to be important in order to define specific interventions to improve the ability to regulate emotions.

AB Background: A growing body o f research suggests that the children of parents with chronic pain are at risk for internalizing symptoms. The mechanisms of such associations have not been as thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adolescents' social competence mediates the association between parental chronic pain and offspring internalizing symptoms as well as whether these associations are moderated by adolescent gender.
   Methods: The current study was based on cross-sectional data from the Nord-Tremdelag Health Study (HUNT 3), a Norwegian population-based health survey conducted in 2006-2008. The present sample comprised adolescents who had both parents participating (n=9,681). Structural equation modeling was used for the data analysis.
   Results: Our results indicated that the association between concurrent maternal and paternal chronic pain and offspring's symptoms of anxiety and depression was partly mediated by low social competence for girls (b(SE)=0.060 [0.030], P=0.043) but not for boys (b(SE)=-0.059 [0.040], P=0.146). This suggests that these associations are moderated by offspring gender.
   Conclusion: The study extends the existing literature on the possible pathways between parental chronic pain and internalizing symptoms in the offspring. Identifying protective factors in the pathways between parental chronic pain and mental distress in children could guide measures that promote the wellbeing of the child and family of chronic pain sufferers.

AB Our brain during distinct developmental phases may show differential responses to perceived psychological stress, yet existing research specifically examining neurodevelopmental changes in stress processing is scarce. To fill in this research gap, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined the relationship between perceived stress and resting-state neural connectivity patterns among 67 healthy volunteers belonging to three age groups (adolescents, young adults and adults), who were supposed to be at separate neurodevelopmental phases and exhibit different affect regulatory processes in the brain. While the groups showed no significant difference in self-reported general perceived stress levels, the functional connectivity between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was positively and negatively correlated with perceived stress in adolescents and young adults respectively, while no significant correlations were observed in adults. Furthermore, among adolescents, the causal functional interaction between amygdala and vmPFC exhibited bottom-up connectivity, and that between amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited top-down connectivity, both of which changed to bilateral directions, i.e. both bottom-up and top-down connections, in both young adults and adults, supporting the notion that the amygdala and prefrontal cortical circuitries undergo functional reorganizations during brain development. These novel findings have important clinical implications in treating stress-related affective disorders in young individuals.

AB SYNOPSISObjective. This multi-method study examined parental depressive symptoms and levels of harsh/intrusive and warm/responsive parenting as correlates of secondary control coping (acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, distraction) in children of parents with a history of depression. Design. The sample included 165 parents with a history of major depressive disorder and their 9- to 15-year-old children. Parents provided self-reports of their current depressive symptoms; videorecordings of parent-child interactions were coded to determine parenting behaviors; and children reported their use of secondary control coping strategies. Results. Harsh/intrusive parenting related to less, and warm/responsive parenting related to greater, use of secondary control coping strategies in children. Parents' current depressive symptoms were only conditionally related to children's use of secondary control coping strategies, such that depressive symptoms moderated the relation between warm/responsive parenting behaviors and child secondary control coping. When parental depressive symptoms were low or average, warm/responsive parenting was positively related to children's secondary control coping. When parental depressive symptoms were high, warm/responsive parenting was not associated with children's secondary control coping. Conclusions. The association between positive parenting behaviors and children's coping is contingent on current levels of parents' depressive symptoms. Efforts to enhance children's coping skills should target both parental depressive symptoms and parenting skills.

AB Objective: It is well-known that refugee children are under risk of psychiatric problems as a consequence of adverse events experienced in the pre and post-migration period. It is estimated that, as the leading country hosting refugees, approximately 1.4 million refugee children are living in Turkey. This study aimed to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems seen among Yazidi children and adolescents who settle in a refugee camp in Turkey. Methods: The researcher contacted the volunteers of the transient education center situated in the camp and reached children attending the center as well as their families. The emotional and behavioral problems were investigated using Arabic form of Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: Our sample consisted of 33 female and 20 male children and adolescents. The mean age was 12.3 +/- 1.5 years. The mean residency time in camp was 11.3 +/- 2.1 months. The mean number of siblings was 3.9 +/- 1.8. 60.4% of fathers and 67.9% of mothers were primary school graduate or less educated. Majority of the children (88.7%) reported that they lost a relative or could not get any information about at least one of them, 58.0% stated they heard the sound of gunshot or explosion, while 39.6% reported they saw the body of a dead or injured person. SDQ scores were higher than threshold for emotional problem in 26.4%, peer problems in 22.6%, hyperactivity problems in 18.8% and conduct problem in 15.0% of children. Total difficulty scores of 15 (28.3%) children were also higher than cut-off value. Conclusion: Results of the study showed that refugee children and adolescents had exposed to many traumatic events and emotional and behavioral problems might be seen in a significant proportion of this group. It is highly recommended to provide psychosocial support in the help and care programs targeting child and adolescent refugees.

AB Objective: To evaluate the relationships between alexithymic personality traits and meta-cognitive problems, and psychological and behavioral problems associated with alexithymia in adolescents. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 570 high school students (58% female, n=331; 42% male, n=239) in five high schools in Istanbul. Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Meta-Cognition Questionnaire for Children and Adolescent (MCQ-C) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were used. The parents were asked to complete Sociodemographic Questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 24 program and statistical significance level was set at p<0.05 and p<0.001. Results: There was no significant difference in terms of age between the alexithymia group (58% female, n=63; 42% male, n=46) and the comparison group (58% female, n=268; 42% male, n=193). Also, there was no significant relationship between gender and alexithymia. Negative meta-worry, superstition beliefs, punishment and responsibility beliefs and total meta-cognitive problem scores of the alexithymia group were significantly higher than comparison group. SDQ total problem scores, attention deficit and hyperactivity scores, peer problems, conduct and emotional problem scores were significantly higher; pro-social behavior scores were significantly lower in the alexithymia group compared to the comparison group. Total TAS-20 scores were positively correlated with total MCQ-C scores and total SDQ scores, significantly. Additionally, total scores of the MCQ-C and SDQ significantly predict the alexithymia. Conclusion: Meta-cognition abilities have functions in checking and regulating the emotions as well as regulating the cognitive processes. It should be kept in mind that the core feature of the individuals with alexithymia is the lack of identifying and expressing emotions, therefore it may be suggested that meta-cognitive problems increase the risk of alexithymia. In addition, the results indicated that alexithymia is frequently associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity, emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. These results indicate that focusing on meta-cognitive errors may increase the effectiveness of treatment of the adolescents with alexithymia. Additionally, mental and behavioral problems accompanying the alexithymia should not be overlooked.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) in children newly diagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: A total of 51 children with new ADHD diagnosis who were not received any treatment formed the study group and 51 age and sex-matched healthy children were enrolled as the control group. 24-hour heart rate (HR) recordings were performed with rhythm Hotter monitoring and HRV parameters indicating autonomous nervous system (ANS) functions were evaluated. Children in ADHD group were further divided into two groups as 'severe' and 'mild' ADHD according to Clinical Global lmpressions-ADHD-Severity scale. Results: HRV parameters were comparable between ADHD and control groups. Whereas, percentage of consecutive NN intervals over 50 msn (pNN50) and minimum Spectral Power per hour (minSPH) values were lower; while, maximum 1-hour heart rate Hotter (maxHRH) and mean heart rate (HR) values were higher in severe ADHD group than those of control group. Conclusion: These results support that as the severity of ADHD increases, ANS dysfunction becomes more overt. Further large scale, multi-centered, randomized-controlled clinical trials are needed to clarify possible role of ANS dysfunction in ADHD etiopathogenesis.

AB Young adult cancer survivors (YACS) are a vulnerable population that reports high anxiety, social isolation, and feelings of inadequacy after cancer treatment completion. Mindful self-compassion (MSC) provides strategies for coping with suffering. We explored how MSC practices addressed the psychosocial needs of a nationally recruited YACS sample (N=20, all female, age M=27.00, various cancer types) that participated in an 8-week MSC video-chat intervention. Descriptive qualitative analysis of the intervention recordings revealed three YACS' psychosocial needs: peer isolation, body concerns, and health-related anxiety. MSC practices addressed these in a number of ways including: self-reliance for emotional support, common humanity within the YACS community, gratitude, self-kindness, and acceptance. Meanwhile, the body scan practice initially triggered distress for some; implications are discussed.

AB Informed by the minority-stress hypothesis and intersectionality theory, this study examines differences in dispositional self-compassion across diverse youth subject to varying levels of structural and interpersonal discrimination. A secondary analysis of survey data from two suburban high schools in a Midwestern state (n=1872) found significant differences in rates of exposures to stigma processes in accordance to rates of marginalization as estimated by sexual and/or gender status and racial category (minority vs majority), with a large effect. Sexual and/or gender minority students of color (SGmin) reported the highest rates of stigma experiences including exposure to economic hardship, having an incarcerated parent, not trusting the police, assignment of an IEP and exclusionary discipline. However, white SGmin students reported the highest rates of mental health concerns. Sexual gender majority (SGmaj) students of color reported the highest rates of self-compassion while white SGmin students reported the lowest and the negative relation between bullying and self-compassion was stronger for white SGmin students than for SGmin students of color, suggesting that the latter may have developed ways of coping with multiple stigmatized identities that reflect kindness to the self. As scholars seek to understand the role of self-compassion in resilience processes, we suggest emphasizing the strengths of marginalized youth as well as protecting them from the ill effects of bullying.

AB Objective: A case study describing the association between vagal tone and social-emotional adaptation in two distressed adolescent-parent (A-P) pairs during a Positive Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Programme (P-CBTP).Methods: Two A-P pairs completed a P-CBTP with pre- and post-intervention biosocial-emotional assessments; weekly training sessions over 7 weeks to develop individual strengths, new adaptive cognitions, positive discipline skills, optimism and knowledge on age-appropriate developmental expressions; augmented by moderate physical activity. Resting vagal tone and vagal reactivity were assessed by time-domain measures of vagal activity (RMSSD).Results: Social-emotional adjustment improved in all A-P pairs. Resting vagal tone increased over the intervention period, from low-to-low-normal towards average-for-normal in three subjects. The fourth individual had excessive pre-intervention resting vagal tone that declined in the direction of normal over the intervention period. Vagal reactivity in response to orthostatic stress remained the same pre- to post-intervention.Conclusions: Changes in resting vagal tone demonstrated improvements in psychological functioning in all four subjects over the period of intervention. Results supported the view of the association between vagal tone and mental health not being an absolute positive relationship, but that low, as well as excessive, vagal tone may be maladaptive. Indications are that the same may apply to vagal reactivity to psychological stress. More studies need to examine the association between resting vagal tone and emotion regulation in A-P relationships during P-CBTP, keeping in mind that a linear relationship cannot summarily be expected in population studies.

AB This article examines cultural, individual, and familial risk and protective factors associated with depressive symptoms in Pacific youth living in New Zealand. At ages 11 (n = 950) and 14 (n = 931), Pacific youth participated in multidisciplinary interviews that included the Children's Depression Inventory. Across time points, factors significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms were involvement in bullying and gang activities. Positive parenting was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms, and Tongan youth were significantly less likely to report depressive symptoms than Samoan youth. Time-varying factors were gender, problem behaviour syndromes, and maternal education. Gaining more knowledge about modifiable risk and protective factors that contribute to depression in Pacific youth is an important tool to support new approaches that promote adaptive psychological adjustment during adolescence.

AB Background: Increasing numbers of adolescents and college students are presenting with complaints of symptoms suggestive of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Harrison, Edwards & Parker, 2007). These individuals have often not been previously evaluated for ADHD during childhood, which can complicate assessment. This is further compounded by the lack of a consistent pattern on neuropsychological testing as well as the lack of rating scales with adequate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to ADHD (Harrison et al., 2007). The differential for symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity is broad and includes ADHD, non-ADHD psychiatric disorders that mirror ADHD and malingering of ADHD symptoms for secondary gain. The purpose of this paper is to explore these diagnostic categories and discuss diagnostic challenges for ADHD in this age group.
   Methods: A review of the literature was conducted utilizing MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches. Keywords included ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity, adolescent, college, university, assessment, diagnosis, diversion, malinger and feign. A total of 46 papers primarily targeting adolescents and college student populations are included in this review.
   Results: 46 articles were published in peer-reviewed journals describing ADHD symptoms in adolescents and college students. The articles were all published in or after 1991. All participants had either symptoms of ADHD or a diagnosis of ADHD with diagnostic assessments ranging from clinical interviews, neuropsychological assessment and use of rating scales.
   Discussion and Conclusions: Initial diagnosis of ADHD in adolescent and young adult populations is challenging. Childhood histories can be useful in identifying ADHD in older adolescents and college students, including history of executive functioning deficits, social skill deficits, increased emotional problems, early development concerns, behavioral problems, and family history of ADHD. It is important to evaluate carefully for comorbidities and other causes of ADHD symptoms, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, sleep disorders, medical disorders, and substance abuse etiologies. If non-ADHD psychiatric disorders are present, it may be worthwhile to treat these disorders first. Finally, there are increasing concerns for malingering of ADHD symptoms for secondary gain, particularly to obtain stimulant medications for academic and recreational purposes. Unfortunately, ADHD symptoms can be feigned on self-report instruments, clinical interviews, and objective testing. Clinicians should utilize a combination of strategies to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis, including clinical interviews that emphasize early childhood history and current academic performance, as well as objective and validity tests that are able to discriminate between ADHD and malingered symptoms. Prescribers should also establish routine clinic practices to reduce diversion such as requiring regular appointments, conducting periodic urine drug screens, using prescription monitoring services, and delaying initial stimulant prescriptions until an ADHD diagnosis is thoroughly established.

AB This meta-analysis evaluated the psychometric properties of the Security Scale (SS; k=57 studies), a measure specifically designed to assess attachment in middle childhood, using several criteria: stability over time, associations with other attachment measures, relations with caregiver sensitivity, and associations with theoretically driven outcomes. The SS demonstrated moderate stability and meaningful associations with other attachment measures and caregiver sensitivity. Furthermore, the SS showed significant associations with developmental correlates of attachment: school adaptation, emotional and peer social competence, self-esteem, and behavioral problem. Some effect sizes varied as a function of socioeconomic status (SES; peer social competence and maladjustment) and publication status (emotional competence, peer social competence, and self-esteem). The association between the SS and our constructs of interest were, for the most part, independent of geographical location and child gender or age. Overall, findings suggest that the SS is a robust measure of attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems can lead to severe restrictions in the functioning of children and to an impaired development. The types of support for children vary greatly between care providers. The aim of this study is to apply the Taxonomy of Care for Youth (TOCFY) and to make an inventory of the core elements and program elements of the various types of support for children with behavioral and emotional problems that were offered overall and per main types of providers in a delineated region. We assessed the types of support to children (N=621) by applying TOCFY. The study showed that by using Tocfy we could make an inventory of the various types of support offered. Individual child support' and family support' were provided most often, and therefore, most interventions were aimed at the child or at the child and his/her parents/caretakers. Support was mostly provided without judicial interference and within an ambulatory/outpatient or home-based setting. TOCFY could be helpful by mapping of information on the support offered to children across various types of care providers. More information on the core and program elements of these types of support may help to optimize care for children and their families.

AB Objective: Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a public health problem with negative effects on the mental health and development of children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to identify the psychiatric outcomes of child sexual abuse and the trauma-related behavioural and emotional problems in adolescents.
   Methods: Retrospective archive study included patient who were referred to child psychiatry clinic dates between 1 December 2010 and 31 December 2013. 136 CSA victims and non-CSA clincal referred group had reached. Diagnostic evaluation of the CSA victims was applied with the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR by child and adolescent psychiatrists and behavioral and emotional problems were were assessed by self-reports.
   Results: CSA victims are 86.0% were female and %30.1 expereinced multiple sexual abuse events. %72.1 of CSA victims has psychiatric diagnosis on Axis 1. Compared to age-matched controls Internalizing problems (p<0.001), Anxiety/depression (p<0.001), Withdrawn (p<0.001), and Rule breaking behaviour (p=0.002) scores are higher in the CSA group.
   Conclusions: Specific problems following a traumatic event may be important in respect of treatment and a formulation to understand the psychopathology. There is a need for longitudinal childhood studies to investigate the mediators of the psychopathology and to understand the emotional and behavioural problems of CSA victims.

AB Background: The concept of emotion regulation (ER) is of great importance to the field of clinical psychology and psychotherapy. However, there are only few validated instruments available to measure ER in children and adolescents. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the parent short version of the Questionnaire to Asses Children's and Adolescents' Emotion Regulation Strategies (FEEL-KJ) has enough psychometric quality to fill this gap at least in part. Additionally, to examine indicators for the validity of the instrument and its dependency on sociodemographic parameters. With increasing age, an increase in the use of ER strategies was expected. Also, positive correlations of maladaptive ER and negative correlations of adaptive ER with symptoms of psychological disorders were assumed. Method: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ and additional parent report questionnaires were used in a sample of 1,638 children aged 2-10 years (reports of both parents: n = 958 children, mothers report only: n = 605, fathers report only: n = 75). Results: Results for mothers and fathers were mostly congruent. Internal consistency values of the parent short version of the FEEL-KJ were in the range of good to very good. With increasing age, adaptive and maladaptive ER-strategies were used more frequently and correlations of ER strategies with internalizing and externalizing psychopathological symptoms were notable. Only few significant differences dependent on the sex of the child and other sociodemographic variables were found. Conclusion: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ seems to be appropriate to extend the existing assessment of ER in science and practice. However, a multimethod validation study is still necessary to further investigate the instrument's validity. Norms: The generated norms (T values and percentile ranks) are available at https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-201803050916 (Greuel, Briegel, & Heinrichs, 2018) or can be requested from the authors directly.(2)

AB Background: An understudied, yet important area of youth development research is the examination of how place affects critical psychosocial processes such as identity formation, problem solving, emotional regulation, and in particular with adolescents, belongingness, autonomy, social competency, and behavioral health. A growing spatially informed literature indicates that youth interact with meaningful places as environmental strategies, shaping developmental trajectories related to behavioral health. Objectives: The objective is to investigate the relationship between place preference and health behavior among adolescents, with a focus on substance use behavior, specifically, cannabis use. We theorize that cannabis use is associated with place preference for urban, city types of places, and that this particular place preference interacts with close peer network behaviors. Methods: To understand the role of preferred locations, close peer relations, and mental health on cannabis use, 248 adolescents (ages 13 to 14) were studied longitudinally. Logistic regression models tested the moderating effects of peer network health (sum of close friends risk and protective behaviors) on selecting city locations (urban stress/neighborhoods) as preferred places, and subsequent cannabis use. Results: Results indicated that peer network health moderated the effects of choosing city locations as favorite, increasing the odds of cannabis use more than eight-fold at 24 months. Conclusions: Favorite places located in city environments appear to interact with peer risk behaviors influencing the cannabis use of young urban adolescents, even after controlling for the influence of baseline cannabis use, neighborhood disorder the home neighborhood, age, gender, and mental health effects.

AB Coping style plays an important role in children's wellbeing. This paper describes the patterns of associations between children's self-reported coping styles and symptoms of anxiety in order to determine whether particular dimensions are associated with better adjustment. Participants were 2566 children (1268 girls, 1298 boys) aged 7-11 years attending 15 schools in the South East of England. Results showed that aspects of coping were differentially associated with children's self-reported anxiety. Patterns of association also varied by age and gender. Dimensions of coping were shown to form distinct adaptive and maladaptive coping styles which were also differentially associated with anxiety. Analysis of these styles indicated that it is the absence of maladaptive coping strategies, rather than the presence of adaptive strategies, that is significant in emotional wellbeing. These findings suggest that interventions designed to reduce or extinguish maladaptive coping styles may be of particular benefit in facilitating emotional wellbeing.

AB In this research paper, we have studied the intermediary role of difficulties in emotion regulation in the relation between parents' emotional availability and reactive-proactive aggression in adolescents. The study has been carried out with 776 high school students (423 girls, 353 boys). Their age ranges from 14 to 19, and the age average is 16.38 (Ss=1.13). The data, in this study, have been collected by using "Reactive - Proactive Aggression Scale", "Parents' Emotional Availability Scale" and "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale". The collected data was analysed through correlation analysis while regression analysis was used for the mediator effect and bootstrap analysis for the significance of indirect effect test. The findings of the study suggest that the reactive-proactive aggression has a positively meaningful relation with difficulties in emotion regulation, but it has a negatively meaningful relation with parents' emotional availability. According to the results of correlation and regression-based bootstrapping method, it has been determined that the difficulties in emotion regulation have a partial mediating role in the relation between parents' emotional availability and reactive-proactive aggression. We believe that the data collected during this study can be valuable sources for further studies and used for reducing the incidence of aggressive behaviours of adolescents particularly at schools.

AB In clinical attachment research the established and economic Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) has been increasingly used in the past few years to assess the attachment representations in adults and recent studies demonstrated sufficient validity for assessing attachment representations in adolescents. Apart from coding attachment classifications, the AAP provides useful and clinically valid information concerning attachment related defences, aspects of capacity to act and synchrony in relationships and emotion regulation strategies with respect to attachment related traumatic experiences. These valuable aspects with respect to individual resources led to the conceptualization to implement the AAP in the therapeutic setting as a feedback tool. In this pilot case we report on an adolescent patient in an inpatient setting. The therapist received an individualized feedback on the patients' AAP to focus on specific attachment related themes used as a short intervention respective an add-on treatment. This paper presents the first results of this new approach by demonstrating the potential therapeutic effects and process of therapy.

AB This study examines joint influences of parental socialization and socialization via mass media on children's expression of emotions. The effect of parental approval of their child's expression of emotions, on the child's approval of TV characters expressing the emotion, and the influence of both on the child's expression of emotions within the past seven days is tested for the emotions fear, sadness, anger, and happiness with a representative survey of children (N = 1458) aged 6-19 in Germany. Moderating age and gender effects were also considered. Consistent across the four emotions, results showed that socialization of emotions via mass media is driven by internalized parental socialization but has a comparably strong effect of its own on the child's expression of emotion that adds to the variance explained, especially with regard to anger and happiness. Implications for the conceptualization of parental emotion socialization and emotional socialization via media are discussed.

AB Social sharing of emotions is a frequently used emotion regulation strategy. This study adds to the emotion regulation literature and the affordances of technologies perspective by providing a better understanding of with whom adolescents share emotions on-and offline, how they do this and why they use certain modes. In-depth interviews with 22 Flemish adolescents (aged 14-18) show that these youngsters share almost all experienced emotions, often with multiple recipients and using multiple communication modes. Although they mostly prefer sharing emotions face-to-face, they also share by texting, calling, or posting something on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. Our respondents generally make a more or less conscious decision about what and how to share. The valence, type, and intensity of the emotion, the affordances of the mode, social norms, and impression management concerns influence this decision.

ID YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES; EXPERIENCES
AB Summer camps are an effective setting for youth to develop skills essential for academics and the workplace yet are often not recognized as such. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate learning outcomes from camp most applicable to academics and workplace readiness. As a secondary aim, the researchers sought to identify the mechanisms at camp that support this learning. Youths' primary learning outcomes include relationship skills, teamwork, how to live with peers, self-confidence, organization, responsibility, independence, perseverance, career orientation, and emotion regulation. In general, mechanisms that supported participants' learning of outcomes included experiential learning, camp as separate time and space, camp schedules, the role of counselors, communal living, safe and supportive environments, and diversity of people. The implications for camp staff include furthering their programming efforts by placing an emphasis on the mechanisms that elicit academic and workplace readiness. With intentional effort, summer camp can be an important setting for youth to learn valuable skills that are beneficial for them to succeed in academics and work.

AB The problem of self-injurious behavior from the point of view of the risk factors and prevention in adolescents is considered. Strategies of self-injurious behavior and characteristics of emotional dysregulation in those who self-injure are described. Finding help from peers/online friends and high stigmatizing/self-stigmatizing among self-injuring adolescents should be taken into account in treatment and prevention programs. Methods of preventing of self-injurious behavior are summarized. The following groups of methods are distinguished by purpose: informing about the problem, developing of adaptive self-regulation strategies and psychological and social support. The following prerequisites for developing school-based prevention programs of self-injurious behavior are defined: choosing a target group of adolescents (population, risk group, adolescents in stress-inducing situations), identifying the level of intervention (individual or group work with adolescents, their parents, teachers etc.), assessing the cultural specificity of the group. Programs should be based on current psychological knowledge about the development of self-injurious behavior and implicate the measuring of their efficacy.

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; RISK-FACTORS
AB Due to the increasing rhythm and tempo of the contemporary life the feeling of stress and pressure increases as well. Especially one feels it in teen years and youth. To be able to somehow master and contain the inner changes and the pressures from the outside the resulting in feeling of inner pressure and intolerableness of the world the teenagers and youths may resort to smoking, drugs, aggressive and autoaggressive behavior. One can distinguish between suicidal, self-destructive (suicidal equivalents), self-harming types of behavior. Harming oneself may be seen as a method of dealing with negative emotions. The study of the characteristics of emotional regulation and mastering strategies among the teenagers and young people of non-clinical sample included 248 persons (128 young men and 120 young women). The average age 19,4 years. The methods used were as follows. To define the level of behavior with deliberate self-harming we used the Russian version of questionnaire The Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). The Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used to control the presence or absence of suicidal tendencies. And The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded (PANAS-X) was applied to identify separate parameters of emotional states. While the choice of the concrete mastering strategies was assessed with the help of the COPE method. The research showed significant differences in the parameters of negative emotional characteristics between the autoaggressors and the persons who never performed any autoaggressive actions. Moreover the "recent autoaggressors" showed a much higher level of the expressed negative emotions than the "old ones". It was confirmed that autoaggressors use a singular model of evasion where the key aspects of self-harming behavior would be the hightened level of negative emotions. It was found that autoaggressors choose non-adaptive coping strategies more often than the participants of the normative test-group.

AB Objective: Little is known about psychopathological features associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pediatric populations. This study examined sleep duration, insomnia, and psychopathological profile associated with RLS in a large community sample of adolescents.
   Methods: Participants included 11,831 adolescents from 3 counties of Shandong, China. Mean age of the participants was 15.0 (SD = 1.5) years, and 51% were boys. In November and December 2015, participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess sleep duration, sleep problems, behavioral/emotional problems, and hopelessness. RLS was assessed by the 2003 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnosis and Epidemiology Workshop criteria.
   Results: Of the sample, 9.5% met the 2003 NIH workshop criteria for RLS, and 2.2% had RLS at least 3 times per week. Compared with adolescents without RLS, adolescents with RLS < 3 times per week and those with RLS >= 3 times per week demonstrated significantly higher rates of insomnia symptoms (13.8%, 20.0%, and 36.4%, respectively;chi(2) = 117.84, P < .0001), internalizing (9.1%, 18.5%, and 34.1%;chi(2) = 238.84, P < .001) and externalizing (9.8%, 17.4%, and 34.1%;chi(2) = 193.87, P < .001) problems, and hopelessness (13.0%, 16.9%, and 27.8%;chi(2) = 54.10, P < .001). After adjusting for demographics and internalizing and externalizing problems, RLS = 3 times per week was associated with a doubled risk of insomnia (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.53-2.75). After adjusting for demographics, sleep duration, and insomnia, RLS = 3 times per week was associated with a more than doubled risk of internalizing (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.94-3.62) and externalizing problems (OR = 2.75; 95% CI, 2.02-3.74).
   Conclusions: RLS is associated with increased risk of insomnia, hopelessness, and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Our findings suggest that clinicians need to assess RLS in adolescents with sleep and mental health problems.

AB Mental disorders are a global health problem, however, in La Rioja, few empirical studies have been carried out that try to analyze emotional and behavioral problems in The child and adolescent population. The main goal was to analyze the mental health state of Riojan Youth from 4 to 14 years old, as well as their relationship with physical health and healthy lifestyle habits. The sample was 101 participants (M = 9.44, SD = 3.12, 57 men, 44 women). It was extracted from the National Health Survey of Spain 2011/12. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire parent's version and KIDSCREEN-10 were used to evaluate mental health and quality of life, respectively. Questions about healthy habits (food, physical activity, sleep) and previous mental disorders were also used. The results indicated that 5% of the sample presented higher scores (at risk for mental health problems), and 8.9% obtained borderline scores. The SDQ emotional problems subscale was negatively associated with the KIDSCREEN-10 scores. Participants considered "at risk" did not report a worse quality of life or a higher prevalence of previous mental disorders compared to the "no risk" group. No relationship was found between the higher risk of mental health problems and eating habits (except for the consumption of fast food), physical activity or rest. These findings allow us to have a current vision on the state of mental health of Riojan youth in order to allocate resources and implementing programs to promotion emotional wellbeing.

They provided informed consent to be contacted post discharge regarding their perceptions of their school reintegration experience. About ten weeks after discharge youth were surveyed via telephone (n=40) or online (n=22) surveys. Results: Of the 121 youth who agreed to be contacted after discharge, 62 youth completed the post-discharge survey. Almost half (n=29) of the youth reported that they had considerable difficulty with school reintegration. Youth reported managing social situations, academic pressures and emotions as substantial problems. Youth who reported a negative transition experience had significantly worse scores on self-reported Total and emotion subscale of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, and concern about the impact of emotions on school re-entry, and significantly less psychiatrist-reported improvement than youth who reported a neutral or positive transition experience. There were no differences between the two groups on school-related variables. Youth with prior admission reported greater difficulties with peers and significantly worse clinical factors than youth without prior admissions. Conclusions: High emotional difficulty scores and concern about the impact of emotions on reintegration prior to discharge distinguished youths with negative school reintegration experiences. These patients may benefit from greater assistance with managing their emotional problems, and coping and social skills training before and during school

AB This study analyzes the relationship between the level of emotional competence and well-being experienced in specific contexts as well as satisfaction with life in adolescents. Three hypotheses were tested: a) If emotional competence of adolescents is related to their life satisfaction; b) If there is a relationship between life satisfaction and satisfaction in various specific domains (with studies, with oneself, coping resources and the use of leisure time). c) Finally, if the relationship between satisfaction in specific contexts and satisfaction with life is moderated by emotional competence. The Emotional Adolescent Development questionnaire (CDE-SEC; Perez-Escoda, Alvarez & Bisquerra, 2008), the Life Satisfaction questionnaire (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985) adapted to Spanish by Atienza, Pons, Balaguer and Garcia-Merita (2000) and an ad-hoc questionnaire to measure domain-specific satisfactions were used. The study sample is 485 students of Secondary Education of Catalonia and Bilbao. We performed a regression analysis by which an explanatory model of emotional competence and life satisfaction among young people is obtained. The results largely confirm the three hypotheses although with some nuances.

AB Short Stature (TB) is one of the main diagnoses in Pediatric Endocrinology. TB is considered to be TB when a child is 2 Typical deviations below the mean of the reference population in the same age and sex; this is equivalent to a size below the 3rd percentile. Being undersized can have a negative impact on the adolescent and his or her family. In adolescence there are two particularly relevant aspects: bodily satisfaction and the relationship with parents. Satisfaction with our body image conditions our social functioning and interaction with others, so that TB can lead to emotional problems, behavioural problems and difficulties with peers. It is also important to analyze the relationship between these problems and the attachment relationship established with parents, and to observe that family factors predict the emotional and behavioral problems of pediatric patients. The participants were 121 pediatric patients diagnosed with TB in the Pediatric Endocrinology Unit of Valencia hospital centres and 121 primary caregivers. After signing the informed consent form, questionnaires were passed at a single time. The variables analyzed were emotional and behavioral disorders in the patients (Quality and Difficulties Questionnaire) and in the caregivers their stress (Pediatric Inventory for Parents), and adult attachment (Adult Attachment Questionnaire). The results indicate that stress and attachment account for 12.4% of the variance in behavioral and emotional problems of patients. Our data highlights the need to take care of the family environment and the caregiver's characteristics in order to facilitate the emotional adjustment of their children.

AB Previous theoretical research has indicated that hope, cognitive reappraisal, and acceptance may contribute to posttraumatic growth (PTG). However, the combined effects of these factors on PTG have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, the current study examined the mediating roles of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance in the relationship between hope and PTG among Chinese adolescents following the Ya'an earthquake. The sample included 397 adolescent survivors, who completed self-report measures 2.5 years after the earthquake. The mediating effects were assessed by constructing a multiple indirect effects model. The findings indicated that traumatic exposure only have predictive value for PTG, but not other variables. Moreover, when we controlled for gender, age, and traumatic exposure, hope had a direct and positive effect on PTG. We found an indirect and positive effect of hope on PTG via cognitive reappraisal and acceptance, as well as via an indirect path from cognitive reappraisal to acceptance. These findings suggest that utilising the mediating roles of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance in the relationship between hope and PTG is crucial in developing methods for fostering PTG.

AB Academic and social coping dispositions are measured by the German Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (SVF-KJ), using nine subtests and 36 items. In its current 2016 edition, the age range was extended to 8-16 years. Furthermore, four items were modified slightly and current norms were gathered, Standardized measures and psychometric properties were revealed among n = 1,087 pupils. Item assignment to subscales, which has been shown by previous exploratory factor analyses, was confirmed by confirmatory factor analyses. Analyses of correlations provided reasonable discriminant associations with the construct of emotion regulation. Finally, internal construct validity was approved by a subsample of n = 374 German children and adolescents, showing gender and age differences, which is in agreement with prior research. In sum, the results suggest a valid assessment of children's and adolescents' coping dispositions provided by the SVF-KJ.

AB Theoretical models and recent advances in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) have increasingly focused on the role of alterations in the processing and regulation of emotions. To date, however, our understanding of these changes is still limited and reports of emotional dysregulation in AN have been based largely on self-report data, and there is a relative lack of objective experimental evidence or neurobiological data.
   The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the hemodynamic correlates of passive viewing and voluntary downregulation of negative emotions by means of the reappraisal strategy detachment in AN patients. Detachment is regarded as adaptive regulation strategy associated with a reduction in emotion-related amygdala activity and increased recruitment of prefrontal brain regions associated with cognitive control processes. Emotion regulation efficacy was assessed via behavioral arousal ratings and fMRI activation elicited by an established experimental paradigm including negative images. Participants were instructed to either simply view emotional pictures or detach themselves from feelings triggered by the stimuli.
   The sample consisted of 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and a pairwise age-matched healthy control group. Behavioral and neuroimaging data analyses indicated a reduction of arousal and amygdala activity during the regulation condition for both patients and controls. However, compared with controls, individuals with AN showed increased activation in the amygdala as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during the passive viewing of aversive compared with neutral pictures.
   These results extend previous findings indicative of altered processing of salient emotional stimuli in AN, but do not point to a general deficit in the voluntary regulation of negative emotions. Increased dlPFC activation in AN during passive viewing of negative stimuli is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder may be characterized by excessive self-control. Taken together, the data seem to suggest that reappraisal via detachment may be an effective strategy to reduce negative arousal for individuals with AN.

AB One of the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is emotion dysregulation, which comprises emotion sensitivity, heightened and labile negative affect, deficient appropriate regulation strategies, and a surplus of maladaptive regulation strategies. Although earlier studies provided some evidence for threat hypersensitivity in terms of a negatively biased perception of other people ("negativity bias") and deficits in the recognition of full-blown anger, i.e., higher error rates and slower reaction times, researchers have only recently started studying effects of interindividual differences (e.g., sex, impulsivity, aggressiveness) and stimulus complexity as well as associations with early adversity, developmental aspects, or the specificity for BPD. Recent data also suggest a deficit in the detection of positive emotions, which needs to be addressed in more detail since it may prevent the patients from recognizing safety signals and from making positive interpersonal experiences. Neurobiologically, threat hypersensitivity has been related to increased and prolonged amygdala responses, while deficient emotion regulation was associated with reduced prefrontal inhibition of the amygdala. First results suggest that these neural alterations may be modulated by psychotherapeutic treatment focusing on emotion regulation. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This research evaluated the impact of Give us a break! (GUAB!) - a programme for children and young people who have experienced bereavement or negative change including the impact of divorce/separation; experiences around ill health and circumstances leading to individuals being 'looked after'. A repeated measures design was utilised to measure the pre-post difference in the factors which contribute to young people's resilience following intervention. Additionally, as the programme is based on a model of Solution Focused Brief Therapy - which aims to develop a positive orientation towards the future - optimistic thinking was closely evaluated. Young people completed the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (Prince-Embury, 2006) and, to increase the rigour of data collection, parents/carers and teachers completed the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (LeBuffe, Shapiro & Naglieri, 2009). The findings provide evidence that the programme positively impacted on young people in terms of their Sense of Relatedness to others, Sense of Mastery, Social and Emotional Competence and Optimistic Thinking. Furthermore, these findings were not contingent upon the type of loss experienced (bereaved/non-bereaved). Some methodological limitations are highlighted and directions for future research considered.

AB The promotion of social-emotional competence and implementation of social-emotional learning programs have increased substantially in schools; however, little is known about teachers' perceptions of such programs. This qualitative study explored early childhood (3 to 8 years old) teachers' perceptions of classroom-based social-emotional learning programs for young, urban-dwelling children. A focus of the study included learning what teachers believe were the critical components and challenges of such programs. Five themes emerged from the content analysis: responsibility, curricula/program design, contextual relevance, support, and barriers. The findings from this study are discussed with regard to educational policy implications about social-emotional learning curricula and programs, especially those implemented in urban schools.

AB South African grandparents provide considerable support to their grandchildren. However, little is known about whether grandparental involvement contributes to children's well-being. This paper synthesises the findings of our research on the relationship between grandparental involvement and the emotional and behavioural health of South African adolescents. In the first phase of the research, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 adolescents. Thematic analysis indicated that grandparents served as caregivers or surrogate parents, teachers and sources of motivation and emotional support. In the second phase, we piloted a structured questionnaire informed by the qualitative evidence with 204 students in Grades 8 and 9 (mean age = 13.69 years) at a public high school. In phase 3, the survey instrument was administered to a larger sample of 671 adolescents. Multiple regression models indicated that greater grandparental involvement was associated with more adolescent prosocial behaviour, regardless of family structure and the level of parental involvement. In addition, maternal grandfather involvement was associated with fewer adolescent emotional problems. Maternal grandmother involvement predicted fewer adolescent internalising problems only when grandmothers and adolescents co-resided in three-generation households. The findings suggest that grandparental involvement is a potential resource for promoting social and emotional competence in adolescents.

AB Little research has focused on young adult children's emotion management during parental divorce disclosures. However, understanding the ways in which divorce disclosures impact young adults is paramount in promoting healthy family communication. A greater comprehension of these impacts can help families process through difficult conversations and understand disclosures' influence on individuals' mental and emotional health. Guided by the divorce disclosure model (Afifi, Schrodt, & McManus, 2009b), the current study included 419 young adult (i.e, aged 18-30) participants who completed an online questionnaire, including a newly developed communicative emotion management measure. Through structural equation modeling, results indicated that cognitive reappraisal and feeling caught mediate the relationship between divorce disclosures and emotion regulation strategies and that this association is contingent upon young adults' mental health. Implications are discussed, and suggestions for family research and practitioner guidance are offered.

AB Background: Although research supports associations between anxiety and emotional reactivity in adults (Cisler, J.M., Olatunji, B.O., Feldner, M.T., & Forsyth, J.P.(2010). Emotion regulation and the anxiety disorders: an integrative review. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 32(1), 68-82.), few studies have examined emotional reactivity in anxious youth (e.g., Carthy etal., 2010; Tan, P.Z., Forbes, E.E., Dahl, R.E., Ryan, N.D., Siegle, G.J., Ladouceur, C.D., & Silk, J.S.(2012). Emotional reactivity and regulation in anxious and nonanxious youth: a cell-phone ecological momentary assessment study. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 53(2), 197-206.). Methods: Using daily diary methodology, this study examined both negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) reactivity to daily events in youth diagnosed with anxiety (N=68; 60% female; 78% non-Hispanic White; M age=11.18 years, SD=3.17). We also examined whether parent-reported emotion regulation would predict emotional reactivity. Results: Participants reported more NA on days they experienced more negative parent and teacher events and less PA on days that they experienced more negative peer events. Additionally, better emotion regulation was associated with less NA reactivity to negative teacher events and to both negative and positive academic events. Conclusions: Interpersonal events have a salient effect on daily affect for anxious youth. Youth anxiety therapists should target emotion regulation associated with negative events involving adults and address barriers to developing and maintaining positive peer relationships.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of relationship with parents, emotion regulation, and callous-unemotional traits with Internet addiction in a community sample of adolescents. Self-report measures of relationship with parents (both mothers and fathers), emotion regulation (in its two dimensions: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), callous-unemotional traits (in its three dimensions: callousness, uncaring, and unemotional), and Internet addiction were completed by 743 adolescents aged 10 to 21 years. Results showed that a low perceived maternal availability, high cognitive reappraisal, and high callousness appeared to be predictors of Internet addiction. The implications of these findings are then discussed.

AB Purpose: Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may suffer from emotional dysregulation (ED), although this symptom is not listed among the diagnostic criteria. Methylphenidate (MPH) is useful in reducing emotional symptoms in ADHD. The aim of the present study was to determine both psychosocial risk factors and presence of ED in adolescents with ADHD before and after MPH treatment.
   Participants and methods: Eighty-two patients aged 12-18 years with ADHD were included as participants. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), sociodemographic form, and the Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury were administered. Results were compared before and after 6 months MPH treatment.
   Results: A significant improvement was detected on DERS for impulsivity (15.9 +/- 6.8 initial vs 14.2 +/- 6.5 final test, p<0.01) and total score (88.4 +/- 23.3 initial vs 82.4 +/- 2.7 final test, p<0.05) across all patients taking MPH regardless of subtype and sex. Despite treatment, a significant difference remained for impulsivity, strategies, and total score in patients with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) compared with those without ODD, but no difference was detected for conduct disorder comorbidity. In patients who self-harm, scores for goals, impulsivity, strategies, clarity, and total score were higher before treatment: furthermore, impulsivity and total score remained high after treatment. In maltreated patients, goals, impulsivity, strategies, and total scores were significantly higher before treatment; however, their symptoms were ameliorated after treatment with MPH.
   Conclusion: Individuals with severe ED may "self-medicate" by smoking and/or self-harming. MPH led to significant improvements in ED possibly owing, in part, to a decrease in impulsivity, so that individuals felt more able to supervise their emotions and engage in goal-directed behaviors. ED should be considered particularly in patients with additional psychosocial factors and ODD comorbidity, and included in the treatment plan.

AB Background: The ability to regulate the response to sensory stimuli has been associated with successful behavioral patterns necessary for daily activities. However, it is not known whether a child's ethnicity and environment can influence autonomic regulatory mechanisms.
   Objective: This study aims to explore the role of ethnicity and environment in the regulation of responses to sensory stimuli in children.
   Methods: In this study, we intend to recruit 128 children from different ethnic groups or environment contexts as follows: (1) 32 typically developing Chinese children living in Hong Kong; (2) 32 typically developing Filipino children living in Hong Kong; (3) 32 typically developing Filipino children who are living in urban areas; and (4) 32 typically developing Filipino children who are living in rural areas in Philippines. Autonomic activity (heart rate variability [HRV] and electrodermal activity [EDA]) will be measured and recorded using Polar H2 heart rate monitor and eSense GSR skin response sensor. Autonomic activity (HRV-low frequency, HRV-high frequency, and EDA) at different conditions between pairwise groupings will be tested using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). All significant levels will be set at P <=.05.
   Results: We present the research protocol of this study, as well as a short discussion of the preliminary findings from our pilot data, with consequent power and sample size analysis that informs the appropriate sample needed to test our hypothesis.
   Conclusions: This study will increase the understanding on the role of individual differences related to a child's ethnicity and environment in the regulation of response to sensory stimuli. The findings of this research may further shed light on the evaluation and treatment planning for children across and within cultures.

AB Despite the narrowing gap between male and female use of aggressive behavior, much of the extant aggression research has centered on males. Various internal, or psychological factors, including attachment, emotion regulation, and impulsivity, are typically examined independently from external, or social, factors, such as the quality of the family environment and exposure to community violence. Additionally, the studies rarely distinguish among forms and functions of aggression. The current study was the first to simultaneously examine these factors and their relationships to the distinct functions of aggression in a low-income urban community sample of adolescent females. Participants (N = 214) were recruited from grades 8 through 12 at a diverse all-girls public school in a city in the northeastern United States. Results indicated that greater attachment security and emotion regulation reduced the impact of a more negative family environment upon the use of reactive and proactive aggression. The results also demonstrated that impulsivity and the family environment mediated the relationships between exposure to community violence and the presence of reactive aggression. With higher levels of impulsivity, an increased use of reactive aggression was demonstrated. Lastly, in the context of greater exposure to community violence, a positive family environment decreased the use of reactive aggression. Overall, the results from this study suggested the role of these internal and external factors in the development of aggressive behavior in female adolescents. Further empirical experimental investigation may shed light on the most optimal interventions to prevent the development of aggression.

AB The aim of this study is to determine the predictors of perceived competence in adolescents. There were two different study groups in the research. In the first study group, a total of 336 high school students, 194 (57.7%) female and 142 (42.3%) male, were studied on the adaptation study of the Short Form of Inventory Parent Attachment. In the second study group, in order to determine the predictors of perceived competence, with a total of 411 high school students, 233 women (56.7%) and 178 (43.3%) male students were studied on. The data were collected through Perceived Competence Scale, Scale for School Engagement and Short Form of Inventory Parent Attachment and Demographic Information Form. In this descriptive study, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of academic competence and social competence. According to the analysis results, internal engagement, program engagement, communication with mother, teacher engagement and trust to father significantly predict academic competence. However, internal engagement, trust to father, communication with the mother and administration engagement significantly predicted social competence. The findings of the study were discussed in the light of relevant literature and suggestions were presented.

AB This paper offers reflections about the relationship between child maltreatment, attachment disturbance and psychopathology in Bowlby's attachment theory perspective. Child maltreatment is a complex and frequent phenomenon that has pretty clear implications on the developmental outcomes of its juvenile victims. The areas most affected by the experience of maltreatments suffered during childhood are to refer especially to self-development and to the ability to structure healthy and stable relationships. This is the reason that justifies the choice to make the phenomenon to be figured out in the Bowlby's perspective, who has always underlined in his works the importance of the role of attachment relationships structured during the first few months of life in order to define the psychological and relational development of the subject. In this regard, we discuss a single case to underline the effects that maltreatment has on children psychological structure in the short and long term, trying to comprehend the subject symptomatology presented in view of the attachment theory perspective.

In this study, people between 18 and 25years attending substance misuse services in the south of Ireland (N=13) were interviewed in a semi-structured style between June 2012 and April 2013. Content analysis was performed. The main motivations for benzodiazepine misuse were to self-regulate negative emotions and to induce dissociation from their environment. Interviewees also described the consequences of benzodiazepine misuse, such as disengagement from family relationships and other protective environments such as school and sports clubs. The consequences of chronic misuse were discussed, such as the compulsion to take more benzodiazepines despite experiencing severe side-effects. The incidence of paradoxical aggression on benzodiazepines is also explored. Education about benzodiazepines and their risks to young people, families, and the public may reduce benzodiazepine misuse. Future research on the role of trauma and mental health in young people's substance misuse is needed.

AB Youth with a callous interpersonal style, consistent with features of adult psychopathy (e.g., lack of guilt, deceitful), are at risk for exhibiting severe and protracted antisocial behaviors. However, no studies have examined changes that occur in interpersonal callousness (IC) from childhood to adolescence, and little is known about the influence of early child, social, and contextual factors on trajectories of IC. The current study examined distinct patterns of IC across childhood and adolescence and associations with early risk factors. Participants were an at-risk sample of 503 boys (56% African American) assessed annually from around ages 7-15. Analyses examined child (anger dysregulation, fearfulness), social (peer, family, maltreatment), and contextual (psychosocial adversity) factors associated with teacher-reported IC trajectories across childhood and adolescence. Using latent class growth analysis, five trajectories of IC were identified (early-onset chronic, childhood-limited, adolescent-onset, moderate, low). Approximately 10% of boys followed an early-onset chronic trajectory, and a roughly equal percent of youth followed childhood-limited trajectory (10%) or an adolescent-onset trajectory (12%) of IC across development. Specifically, half of the boys with high IC in childhood did not continue to exhibit significant levels of these features into adolescence, whereas an equal proportion of youth with low IC in childhood demonstrated increasing levels during the transition to adolescence. Boys in the early-onset chronic group were characterized by the most risk factors and were differentiated from those with childhood-limited and adolescent-onset IC only by higher conduct problems, fearlessness, and emotional abuse/neglect. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental models of IC and several avenues for early targeted interventions.

AB This article explores the relationship between toddlers' (age: 30-33 months) well-being (WB), play (PL), social-emotional competence (SC) and movement skills (MS). Two hypotheses were put forward for testing: (1) there is a significant positive correlation between WB, PL, SC and MS, and (2) toddlers' WB can be predicted from their PL, SC and MS. The participants were 1084 children. The Early Years Movement Skills Checklist, and three categories from the observation material 'Alle Med' were used to assess WB, PL and SC. The results confirm the first hypothesis and partly the second. A strong positive correlation between SC, PL and WB may reflect how interweaved these variables are, and that observed play competence becomes important in the judgement of toddlers' social competence and well-being. Totally, 73% of the variance in WB was explained by the predictor variables PL and SC, while MS did not emerge as a unique predictor indicating that toddlers' well-being is primarily dependent on observation of children's play and social-emotional competence.

I range behavior problems and psychiatric diagnoses in 25 girls referred for gender identity disorder (GID) in childhood (mean age: 8.88 years) at the time of follow-up in adolescence or adulthood (mean age: 23.2 Years). At follow-uP, three (12%) of the girls were judged to have persistent GID based on DSM-IV criteria. With regard to behavior problems at follow-up, 39.1% of the girls had a clinical range score on either the Child Behavior Checklist or Adult Behavior Checklist as rated by their mothers, and 333% had a clinical range score on either the Youth Self-Report or the Adult Self-Report. On either the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents or the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, the girls had, on average, 2.67 diagnoses (range: 0-10); 46% met criteria for three or more diagnoses. From the childhood assessment, five variables were significantly associated with a composite Psychopathology Index (P1) at follow-up: a lower IQ, living in a non-two-Parent or reconstituted family, a composite behavior problem index, and poor peer relations. At follow-up, degree of concurrent homoeroticism and a composite index of gender dysphoria were both associated with the composite P1. Girls with GID show a psychiatric vulnerability at the time of follow-up in late adolescence or adulthood, although there was considerable variation in their general well-being.

AB At-risk adolescents' comprehension of, and preferences for, the content of a text-message (SMS) delivered, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based depression prevention intervention was investigated using two qualitative studies. Adolescents with depressive symptoms and a history of peer violence were recruited from an urban emergency department. Forty-one participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis using deductive and inductive codes were used to capture a priori and emerging themes. Five major themes were identified: CBT-based messages resonated with at-risk adolescents; high levels of peer violence, comorbid symptoms, and prior exposure to the mental health system were variables affecting preferred content; participants endorsed emotional regulation messages, but found mindfulness content difficult to understand via SMS; cognitive awareness and restructuring content was most acceptable when framed by self-efficacy content; adolescent participants generated applicable CBT content in their own voices. Overall, CBT-informed content was able to be distilled into 160-character text messages without losing its comprehensibility.

AB Despite increasing interest in the prevalence and correlates of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) in adolescent populations, relatively few studies have examined NSSI among lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adolescents. The current study explored sexuality concerns and elevated emotion dysregulation as potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between sexual orientation and elevated non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). A community sample of 1,799 adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing NSSI, sexual orientation, sexuality concerns, and emotion regulation. Across the study, 20.6% of adolescents reported a history of NSSI. Adolescents who identify as mostly heterosexual, bisexual, and mostly homosexual were more likely to engage in NSSI than gay/lesbian, heterosexual, and asexual adolescents. Multiple mediation analysis showed that emotion regulation, but not sexuality concerns, mediated the relationship between sexual orientation and NSSI. The current study tested two theoretical pathways by which sexual orientation could predict NSSI engagement. Findings suggest that literature on general psychological processes, as well as group-specific minority stressors, can shed light on high rates of NSSI among LGB populations. Specifically, the challenges faced by LGB adolescents may undermine the development of emotion regulation. As such, this should be a key target of intervention with LGB adolescents engaging in NSSI.

AB This study examined the associations among chronic stress, activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), executive function, and coping with stress in at-risk and a comparison sample of adolescents. Adolescents (N=16; age 12-15) of mothers with (n=8) and without (n=8) a history of depression completed questionnaires, neurocognitive testing, and functional neuroimaging in response to a working memory task (N-back). Children of depressed mothers demonstrated less activation in the anterior PFC (APFC) and both greater and less activation than controls in distinct areas within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to the N-back task. Across both groups, activation of the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC; Brodmann area [BA9]) and APFC (BA10) was positively correlated with greater exposure to stress and negatively correlated with secondary control coping. Similarly, activation of the dACC (BA32) was negatively correlated with secondary control coping. Regression analyses revealed that DLPFC, dACC, and APFC activation were significant predictors of adolescents' reports of their use of secondary control coping and accounted for the effects of stress exposure on adolescents' coping. This study provides evidence that chronic stress may impact coping through its effects on the brain regions responsible for executive functions foundational to adaptive coping skills.

AB Internalizing disorders are common in individuals with ASD. Psychosocial interventions targeting these disorders in the ASD population have burgeoned in the last decade. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, modified for ASD, is the most frequently investigated model, although other interventions, including behaviour therapy, third-wave interventions, models targeting transdiagnostic constructs, and alternative interventions and treatment delivery methods are now emerging. This review provides a summary of the efficacy of these interventions in treating internalizing disorders in youth and adults with ASD. The barriers to accessing these treatments, which are experienced by many individuals with ASD and their families, as well as future research directions, are also discussed.

AB LGBTQ+ youth encounter pervasive stigma-related stress that requires effective coping skills. This study explored the coping patterns of LGBTQ+ youth participants (N = 30) in a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based coping skills training. Participants, 15-18 years old with a range of gender, sexual, racial and ethnic identities, completed a coping skills inventory (A-COPE) with 12 subscales at two time points. Based on the stigma-coping framework, coping skills were broadly classified as disengagement or engagement strategies. LGBTQ+ youth were most likely to utilize avoiding problems as a strategy to cope with stress, followed closely by being humorous, relaxing, and ventilating feelings. Notably, seeking professional and spiritual support were the least adopted coping strategies. Post-intervention, participants reported significant increases in the areas of primary control (solving family problems) and secondary control (seeking spiritual support, seeking diversion, engaging in demanding activities, and being humorous). The findings demonstrate the versatility of LGBTQ+ youth's coping strategies and show the potential of the AFFIRM intervention to promote engagement coping patterns among this population.

AB Previous prevention programmes have largely focused on the emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal. The present study is a feasibility trial that evaluates a prevention programme that teaches cognitive reappraisal, acceptance and problem-solving strategies. Ninety-six Year 10 high school students were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. All participants completed scales evaluating emotion regulation difficulties, depression, anxiety and anger at baseline, post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up. In addition, the intervention condition completed a workshop evaluation questionnaire at post-intervention that included qualitative items. Mixed models for repeated measures and content analysis were used to analyse the data. Results suggested there were no statistical differences between the conditions although effect sizes suggested a small advantage favouring the control condition. On the qualitative evaluation, however, most participants reported important benefits in relation to improved emotion regulation abilities. These contrasting results are discussed and suggestions made for future research.

AB Homeless girls are one of the world's most vulnerable sociocultural groups. Homeless girls experience forced labor victimization, sexual exploitation, abuse, discrimination and marginalization at higher rates than the general population. As a result, they often present internalized and externalized psychological disorders and lack functional problem solving, coping and emotion regulation skills, which can negatively affect mental health and well-being. Despite these serious disparities, few research studies have addressed homeless girls' mental health and well-being. Virtually no known research addressing the psychosocial differences between sub-groups of Mexican homeless girls, including girls that are at risk of homelessness and unhoused girls or girls housed in emergency shelters, exists to date. The aim of this study was to examine differences of psychosocial characteristics in homeless girls by subgroup. Working with nongovernmental organizations that serve homeless youth, a convenience sample of 90 Mexican girls between the ages of 11 and 18, including 45 emergency sheltered or unsheltered girls and a comparison group of 45 girls at risk of homelessness, were individually interviewed using psychometric instruments developed by the authors. Findings revealed that emergency sheltered or unsheltered homeless girls experience higher levels of depression, higher levels of dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies, lower indexes of subjective well-being, and experience negative emotions more intensely and frequently than the comparison at risk for homelessness group. This study is limited in its generalizability due to its purposive sampling method. Study implications highlight the need for specific interventions by sub-group to promote the mental health and well-being of homeless girls and girls at risk for homelessness.

AB One risk factor for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents is exposure to traumatic experiences, particularly child maltreatment. However, the mechanisms through which childhood maltreatment predicts NSSI are largely unknown. Emotion dysregulation (ED) is likely an important mechanism in this relationship. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between childhood maltreatment, ED, and NSSI in a sample of adolescent inpatients (n = 53). Results demonstrated that child physical and emotional maltreatment, but not child sexual abuse, was significantly associated with NSSI frequency. More specifically, ED mediated the relationship between child physical and emotional maltreatment and NSSI frequency. Findings support the importance of ED as a mediating factor in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and NSSI behaviors and highlight the need for teaching emotion regulation skills to youth affected by trauma.

AB The present study examined associations between boys' and girls' self-reported psychological adjustment and a wide spectrum of peer-rated behaviours in the school context using a sample of 463 Estonian early adolescents (M-age = 12.90). Although girls had more internalised problems and boys more externalised problems, the associations between adolescents' psychological adjustment and behaviour were not gender-specific. Among both boys and girls, hostility was positively associated not only with their peer-reported misbehaviour, but also with sociable behaviour and negatively with studiousness. Adolescents with negative self-esteem were perceived to exhibit high levels of self-centred competitive behaviour, misbehaviour and also sociable behaviour. Those with negative self-adequacy, on the contrary, were less likely to behave in a self-centred competitive and sociable manner. In general, the findings show that psychological maladjustment may appear not only in well-observed problematic behaviour but also in seemingly ordinary behaviour in school.

AB Although adolescents often struggle to regulate their anger, few studies have examined anger regulation within the period of adolescence. In view of this, this study explored potential sex and age differences in anger experience, expressions, and control among Grades 8-12 adolescents (n = 766) in Western Canada. Anger regulation was evaluated by the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Three separate multivariate analyses of variance and post hoc tests were performed. Results revealed that Grade 12 students experienced more anger than Grade 8 students. Furthermore, Grades 10-12 students engaged in greater levels of anger-expressive suppression compared with those in Grade 8; Grade 12 students also suppressed their anger more than Grade 9 students. Lastly, girls were less likely to control their outward anger as compared with boys. These results provide important implications for intervention efforts by suggesting nonlinear developmental patterns in anger experience and expressions as well as sex differences in anger control.

AB Objective: Although youth with autism have elevated rates of mental health problems compared to typically developing youth, little is known about the mental health services that they receive. The current study examines predisposing, enabling, and clinical need factors as they relate to mental health service use in youth with autism. Methods: The current study surveyed parents of 2337 children and adolescents with autism, compared their access to behavioral management and mental health treatment (MHT), and isolated the correlates of such receipt. Results: Children used behavioral management more than adolescents, whereas the opposite was true for MHT. Mental health treatment receipt was associated with caregiverrelated and mental health problems in both age groups, with routine health service use in children and with behavioral problems in adolescents. Behavioral management was correlated with caregiver-related services and behavioral problems in both age groups, and with sex and intellectual disability in adolescents. Conclusion: Clinical needs and caregiver service use are consistently associated with mental health care across ages, whereas the role of youth characteristics is particularly relevant when considering service use for adolescents.

No significant gender differences were found. Correlations showed positive associations among relational victimization, callous-unemotional traits, and hostile attribution bias. Multiple regression indicated that preadolescents with high callous and unemotional traits and hostile attribution bias who experienced physical aggression were more likely to be relationally victimized. Results emphasize the role of both personal and social-cognitive factors in relational victimization, and are discussed in terms of their practical implications.

AB Objective: In our study, it's aimed to evaluate the emotion recognition and regulation skills of adolescents with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to compare the results to healthy control cases. Methods: To our study, 63 ADHD diagnosed and 32 control cases with similar sociodemographic characteristics to patient group aged 11-18 years were included. 'Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version' (K-SADS-PL) was applied to all cases in order to psychiatric evaluation. In all cases Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and Adolescent Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale (T-DSM-IV-S), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and to evaluate social cognitive properties Faces Test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), The Unexpected Outcomes Test (UOT) and Comprehension Test are applied. Results: The scores of tests evaluating emotion recognition and regulation abilities in adolescents with ADHD were lower than control group. Conclusion: The better understanding of the problems in emotion recognition and regulation abilities of the adolescents with ADHD may be helpful in determining the required interventions (social skill training etc.) in this respect.

AB Assessing attachment in adolescents is important due to relations between insecurity and psychopathology. The child attachment interview (CAI) holds promise in this regard, but is time-consuming to code, which may render it inaccessible. The aim of this study was to develop computerized neural network models to predict attachment classifications on the CAI and to determine whether the models could achieve the CAI's benchmark qualification of 80% on reliability training cases. Four hundred and ninety interviews from inpatient adolescents served as model training and testing samples. The CAI's 30 standard reliability cases were treated as the independent holdout sample, in which the performance of the final models was evaluated against the 80% benchmark. Models demonstrated moderate accuracy and high correct classification rates, as compared to human coders. Performance was poorer when models were applied to the reliability training cases, but automated coding of the CAI holds promise for future development.

AB Research has not yet been deepened in the link between personality factors and risk of school refusal. Furthermore, previous studies fail to verify the direct relation between trait EI and the risk of school refusal. The present study examined personality traits, emotion regulation and trait EI for the contributory role they may play in predicting the risk of school refusal. The sample consisted of 311 participants, 112 males (36%) and 199 females (64%) with an average age of 14.19 (SD = .60), from a high school in the city of Messina (Sicily, Italy). Results show that the risk of school refusal is positively related to neuroticism and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, while it is negatively related to the extroversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness and trait EI. Moreover, trait EI can be considered as a strong incremental negative predictor of risk of school refusal over and above personality traits and emotion regulation.

AB Parent-teacher partnership is associated closely with adolescents' development. However, little is known about the association between parent-teacher partnership and Chinese high school students' development. Therefore, this study examines whether and how parent-teacher partnership (objective contacts and subjective relationship quality) relates to high school students' academic, career, and personal/social development among a national representative sample of 4,606 high school teachers from 61 high schools across 10 provinces of Mainland China. Both parent-teacher contacts and relationship were related to high school students' development across all three domains (i.e., academic, career, and personal/social development). Parent-teacher relationship was more closely related to students' developmental outcomes than parent-teacher contacts. Parent-teacher contacts were associated directly and indirectly with students' developmental outcomes via parent-teacher relationship and teacher-student relationship. Implications for future studies and practice were discussed.

The sample consisted of 252 university students in Lebanon (154 females), from 16 to 30years old. Results from hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for age and gender and in the presence of social and individual predictors) showed that the Self-control and Emotionality factors of trait Emotional Intelligence were significant negative predictors of Aggressive Behavior while controlling for age and gender and in the presence of social and individual predictors). Exposure to violence and openness to experience also predicted Aggressive Behavior. Implications for future research and limitations of the present study are discussed.

AB This pilot randomized clinical trial tested an emotion regulation enhancement to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with 29 college student problem drinkers with histories of complex trauma and current clinically significant traumatic stress symptoms. Participants received eight face-to-face sessions of manualized Internet-supported CBT for problem drinking with or without trauma-focused emotion regulation skills (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy [TARGET]). Both interventions were associated with sustained (at one-month follow-up) reductions in self-reported drinking frequency, drinking-related impairment, and heavy drinking in the past week, as well as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD symptoms, and improvement in self-reported emotion regulation. The enhanced intervention was associated with significantly greater sustained reductions in complex PTSD symptoms and resulted in medium/large effect size reductions in days of alcohol use (versus small effects by CBT). Emotion regulation enhancement of CBT for college student problem drinkers with interpersonal trauma histories warrants further investigation.

AB A shared consensus among researchers deals with the positive association between the ability to effectively regulate and manage one's emotion and the engagement in empathic behavior and morally desirable actions. This study was designed to investigate how dispositional reliance on suppression and reappraisal differently impacted on the cognitive and affective components of empathy and on social conduct, distinguishing among prosocial, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors. Two hundred nineteen middle adolescents were enrolled and fulfilled self-reports assessing emotion regulation strategies, empathy, and social behaviors. The results suggest that there are important distinctions among the emotion regulation strategies and the components of empathy as they relate to one another and to prosocial behavior and problem conduct. Specifically, cognitive reappraisal was related to prosocial behavior through empathic concern. While internalizing behavior was associated with emotion regulation strategies, externalizing behavior was only related to perspective-taking ability. Delimitations and practical implications were discussed.

AB Polyvictimization (PV) has been shown to be associated with psychosocial and behavioral impairment in community and high risk populations, including youth involved in juvenile justice. However, the mechanisms accounting for these adverse outcomes have not been empirically delineated. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociation are documented sequelae of PV and are associated with a wide range of behavioral/emotional problems. This study used a cross-sectional research design and bootstrapped multiple mediation analyses with self-report measures completed by a large sample of justice-involved youth (N=809, ages 12-19years old, 27% female, 46.5% youth of color) to test the hypothesis that PTSD and dissociation symptoms mediate the relationship between PV and problems with anger, depression/anxiety, alcohol/drug use, and somatic complaints after controlling for the effects of exposure to violence and adversities related to juvenile justice involvement. As hypothesized, PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship of PV with all outcomes except alcohol/drug use problems (which had an unmediated direct association with PV). Partially supporting study hypotheses, dissociation symptoms mediated the relationship between PV and internalizing problems (i.e., depression anxiety; suicide ideation). Implications are discussed for prospective research demarcating the mechanisms linking PV and adverse outcomes in juvenile justice and other high risk populations.

AB Several etiopathogenetic models have been conceptualized for the onset of Internet Addiction (IA). However, no study had evaluated the possible predictive effect of early emotion regulation strategies on the development of IA in adolescence. In a sample of N = 142 adolescents with Internet Addiction, this twelve-year longitudinal study aimed at verifying whether and how emotion regulation strategies (self-focused versus other-focused) at two years of age were predictive of school-age children's internalizing/externalizing symptoms, which in turn fostered Internet Addiction (compulsive use of the Web versus distressed use) in adolescence. Our results confirmed our hypotheses demonstrating that early emotion regulation has an impact on the emotional-behavioral functioning in middle childhood (8 years of age), which in turn has an influence on the onset of IA in adolescence. Moreover, our results showed a strong, direct statistical link between the characteristics of emotion regulation strategies in infancy and IA in adolescence. These results indicate that a common root of unbalanced emotion regulation could lead to two different manifestations of Internet Addiction in youths and could be useful in the assessment and treatment of adolescents with IA.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether equine-assisted social work (EASW) could affect self-stigmatisation and thereby counteract false identities in self-harming adolescents. Data were collected via interviews with nine female self-harming clients aged 15-21years and eight staff members. Interviews and video-recorded human-horse interactions with three staff members and four clients were analysed. The interviews were followed by further dialogue with participants while they viewed videos of their own EASW sessions. The analysis indicated that the horse had a calming effect on the clients; enabled them to free themselves of their preoccupations; provided real-time, non-verbal and non-judgmental feedback on their emotions; and increased feelings of trust, patience and empathy. The presence of a horse provided a moment of silence' for the clients, silencing their inner critic, and made them feel more authentic and better able to regulate their emotions. However, staff could counteract this safe' healing by being too focused on goals, making interpretations and lecturing and encouraging clients, thus making clients feel judged anyhow. EASW seemed to give clients the opportunity to break free from self-stigmatisation, which seemed to lower the barrier to change.

AB The present study aimed to evaluate the nomological network validity of the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) in its Italian translation, addressing distinct research questions in 3 independent samples of Italian participants comprising adolescent nonclinical participants (N = 393), adult nonclinical participants (N = 193), and adult outpatients with a personality disorder (PD) diagnosis who sought psychotherapy treatment (N = 59). In all 3 samples, the MASC proved to be a reliable measure of mentalizing ability, with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from .70 to .78. In both nonclinical adolescents and nonclinical adults, the MASC scores correlated significantly and meaningfully with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test scores. In nonclinical adults, the MASC scores showed significant (albeit modest) correlations with self-reported measures of attachment styles. Finally, in adult outpatients, the MASC "no theory of mind (ToM)" scores, which are specific errors that indicating nonmentalistic responses, correlated significantly with interview-based measures (Spearman r = .41, p < .01) and self-reported measures (Spearman r = .37, p < .01) of borderline personality disorder (BPD), as well as with measures of emotion dysregulation, (Spearman r = .37, p < .01). As a whole, these findings highlight the validity of the MASC as a measure of mentalization and are consistent with Fonagy and colleagues' (i.e., Bateman & Fonagy, 2004b; Fonagy, 1991) model of mentalization and its role in personality pathology.

AB Previous research has indicated that cognitive emotion regulation strategies contribute to the development and maintenance of emotional problems in adults and adolescents. However, there is a lack of longitudinal research with adolescent samples, hence knowledge of exactly how these strategies influence the development of emotional problems in adolescence is sparse. This study investigated maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation (cognitive avoidance and repetitive negative thinking) as a potential mediator in the development of anxiety and depressed mood over time in adolescence. Self-reported depressed mood, anxiety, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed during school hours in a sample of Swedish 10th graders (N=149; 53% girls), with follow-up assessments one and two years later. Repetitive negative thinking and cognitive avoidance formed a unidimensional factor of cognitive emotion regulation. Cognitive emotion regulation was found to mediate the development of both anxiety and depressed mood over time, lending support to the previous findings that cognitive emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive avoidance and repetitive negative thinking might act as transdiagnostic mechanisms in the development of emotional symptoms in adolescence. This suggests that maladaptive forms of cognitive emotion regulation could be important targets in prevention and treatment of emotional problems in adolescence.

AB Cyberbullying is one of the important negative issues among adolescents and youngsters. Victims of cyberbullying perpetration have been reported to suffer many psychological and emotional problems that can lead them as far to suicide. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of cyberbullying perpetration with gender, personality traits, chronotype, and sleep quality. Three hundred and fifty-three freshman and sophomore university students from Turkey (45.9% (n=162) female and 54.1% (n=191) male) completed a questionnaire that included Cyberbullying Scale, Big-5 Inventory, Composite Scale of Morningness, and Sleep Quality Scale. The most conspicuous result of the study was that chronotype and sleep quality were significant predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. Evening-type students had significantly higher scores on cyberbullying scale than neither-type students and morning-type students, and also neither-type students had higher scores on cyberbullying scale than morning-type students. Further, poorer sleep quality, being male, higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness were related to higher cyberbullying perpetration.

AB This systematic review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive and occupation-based interventions to improve self-regulation in children and youth who have challenges in processing and integrating sensory information. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guided the methodology. Five studies identified through a comprehensive database search met the inclusion criteria and were separated into categories of cognitive and occupation-based interventions. Articles that did not specifically measure sensory integration (SI) or processing challenges were omitted. Synthesis of the articles suggests that self-regulation (e.g., sensory processing, emotional regulation, executive functioning, social function) improved with cognitive and occupation-based interventions. Because the number of studies that measured sensory processing or SI challenges was limited, researchers are encouraged to include these measures in future research to understand the impact of a broader range of cognitive and occupation-based interventions.

AB People diagnosed with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) have been frequently reported to experience depression, anxiety, and hostility. Emotional regulation contributes to these mood symptoms. This study evaluated emotional regulation in subjects with IGD and examined relationships between emotional regulation, depression, anxiety, and hostility in young adults with IGD. We recruited 87 people with IGD and a control group of 87 people without a history of IGD. All participants underwent a diagnostic interview based on the IGD criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and they completed a questionnaire on emotional regulation, depression, anxiety, and hostility. We found that subjects with IGD were less likely to practice cognitive reappraisal and were more likely to suppress their emotions. Linear regression revealed the higher cognitive reappraisal and lower expressive suppression associated with depression, anxiety, and hostility among subjects with IGD. The emotional regulation strategies that characterize those with IGD could be contributing factors to the depression and hostility tendencies of these people. When treating patients with IGD, in addition to providing appropriate interventions to relieve depression and hostility, practitioners should effectively assess emotional regulation strategies and provide emotional regulation therapy to prevent a vicious cycle of negative emotions.

AB Background: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is hallmarked by persistent hypoketotic hypoglycemia in infancy. In the majority of all patients, CHI is caused by mutations in the KATP channel genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11, but other genes in the insulin-regulatory pathway have also been described. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia include an increased risk of seizures and intellectual disability. So far, controlled psychometric studies on cognitive, motor, speech, and social-emotional outcome of CHI patients are missing. Until now, neurodevelopmental long-term outcome in CHI patients has only been measured by questionnaires, self-, parental-, or caregiver-administered instruments. Methods: This is a prospective study of 60 patients (median age 3.3 years, range 3 months to 57 years): 48 with a diffuse, 9 with a focal, and 3 with an atypical histology. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed using standardized psychological tests and questionnaires. Results: 28 of 60 patients showed developmental delay (46.7%). 9 of 57 patients had cognitive deficits (15.8%), 7 of 26 patients had speech problems (26.9%), and 17 of 44 patients had motor problems (38.6%). In 5 of 53 patients, social-emotional problems were reported. Outcome and the underlying genetic defect were not correlated. Conclusions: Motor problems seem to be prominent in CHI patients. Despite a high incidence of developmental delay, a permanent cognitive defect was only detectable in 9 of 58 patients. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Purpose: The purpose of the study is to understand differences in child well-being related to parental substance use among children ages 6-12 who were investigated for maltreatment but not removed from their homes. Children with a substance-using parent in the home are compared to those without a substance-using parent in the home.
   Methods: Longitudinal data from waves 1 and 3 of the second National Study of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) are used. NSCAW II is a national sample of families with children and youth aged birth to 17.5 investigated by child protective services (CPS). A subset of the data (analyzed with domain analysis methods) is used for this study (n = 575). Eight well-being outcomes from four domains (cognitive development, physical health, psychological/behavioral development and social/emotional competence) are analyzed.
   Findings: We hypothesized that (among children investigated for maltreatment and not removed from home) children whose parents used substances would exhibit lower mean levels of well-being at thirty-six months follow-up compared to those whose parents did not use. Unexpectedly, we found no significant differences in well-being levels between children with parents in the home using substances and those without.
   Conclusions: Children with substance-using parents may be able to remain at home over an extended period after investigation, while maintaining well-being levels similar to children at home with parents not using substances. If an effective safety plan can be put in place, this option may provide a path to maintaining safety, permanency and well-being for such children without placement in out-of-home care.

AB Background: The relationship between psychological factors and obesity has become a hot topic in psychosomatic research. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies in Chinese adolescents with different weight status.
   Methods: Using stratified random cluster sampling, 700 and 321 adolescents were defined as adolescents with overweight status and obese status, respectively. One thousand and twenty-one adolescents with normal-weight status were also selected. All participants completed a general questionnaire and Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.
   Results: Adolescents in the obesity group obtained the highest scores on self-blame and rumination in three groups, and those from the obesity group obtained lower scores on acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal than those from normal group (ps<0.05). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a significant impact on BMI, accounting for 32.0% variance (p<0.001). Higher scores on self-blame and rumination were associated with higher BMI, but greater acceptance and positive refocusing were associated with lower BMI (ps<0.05).
   Conclusion: Self-blame, rumination, acceptance, and positive refocusing have considerable effects on BMI in Chinese adolescents. The causal relationship of CER strategies and BMI should be explained more accurately and thoroughly to prevent and intervene in cases of adolescent obesity.

AB Few studies have examined the effectiveness of outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in routine care settings for children and adolescents with mental disorders. This observational study examined changes in behavioral and emotional problems of adolescents with mental disorders during routine outpatient CBT delivered at a university outpatient clinic and compared them with a historical control group of youths who received academic tutoring of comparable length and intensity. Assessments were made at the start and end of treatment (pre- and post-assessment) using parent ratings of the German versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and self-ratings of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) scale. For the main analysis, 677 adolescents aged 11aEuro'21 years had complete data. Changes from pre- to post-assessment showed significant reductions in mental health problems on both parent- and self-ratings. Pre- to post-effect sizes (Cohen's d) were small-to-medium for the total sample (d = 0.23 to d = 0.62) and medium-to-large for those adolescents rated in the clinical range on each (sub)scale at the start of treatment (d = 0.65 to d = 1.48). We obtained medium net effect sizes (d = 0.69) for the CBCL and YSR total scores when patients in the clinical range were compared to historical controls. However, a substantial part of the sample remained in the clinical range at treatment end. The results suggest that CBT is effective for adolescents with mental disorders when administered under routine care conditions but must be interpreted conservatively due to the lack of a direct control condition.

AB Previous research suggested that separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is overrepresented among birth-assigned male children clinic-referred for gender dysphoria (GD). The present study examined maternally reported separation anxiety of birth-assigned male children assessed in a specialty gender identity service (N = 360). SAD was determined in relation to DSM-III and DSM-IV criteria, respectively. A dimensional metric of separation anxiety was examined in relation to several additional factors: age, ethnicity, parental marital status and social class, IQ, gender nonconformity, behavioral and emotional problems, and poor peer relations. When defined in a liberal fashion, 55.8% were classified as having SAD. When using a more conservative criterion, 5.3% were classified as having SAD, which was significantly greater than the estimated general population prevalence for boys, but not for girls. Dimensionally, separation anxiety was associated with having parents who were not married or cohabitating as well as with elevations in gender nonconformity; however, the association with gender nonconformity was no longer significant when statistically controlling for internalizing problems. Thus, SAD appears to be common among birth-assigned males clinic-referred for GD when defined in a liberal fashion, and more common than in boys, but not girls, from the general population even when more stringent criteria were applied. Also, the degree of separation anxiety appears to be linked to generic risk factors (i.e., parental marital status, internalizing problems). As such, although separation anxiety is common among birth-assigned male children clinic-referred for GD, it seems unlikely to hold unique significance for this population based on the current data.

AB Child maltreatment leads to deleterious effects in virtually every developmental domain, including cognitive, psychological, and behavioral functioning. Although difficulties with coping have been identified as contributing to these effects, less attention has been paid to the precise nature of maltreated children's coping difficulties, particularly in terms of the strategies they use to cope with negative emotions and how these strategies vary with age. We asked maltreated (n = 195) and comparison (n = 103) 10 to 17 year olds to describe emotional experiences and what strategies they used to cope with those emotions. Maltreated adolescents reported using more disengagement and antisocial strategies than did comparison adolescents. Differences between maltreated and comparison adolescents were consistent across age. Results have important implications for treatment and intervention efforts designed to improve coping strategies among vulnerable maltreated populations.

AB Emotion regulation difficulties influence the etiology and maintenance of binge eating and eating disorders, but differential associations between emotion dysregulation and objective binge eating (OBE) components have not been examined. We compared emotion dysregulation dimensions in women with OBEs (n = 27), overeating only (n = 25), loss of control (LOC) only (n = 32), or no pathological eating (n = 137). Women with OBEs had significantly more difficulty with overall emotion dysregulation, access to strategies, and impulse control when upset than other groups. Women with OBEs and women with overeating did not differ on poor emotional clarity, whereas women with OBEs and women with LOC did not differ on non-acceptance of emotions. The combination of overeating and LOC eating is associated with the greatest emotion dysregulation, but certain emotion regulation facets may differentially relate to overeating and LOC. Identifying emotion-related treatment targets for core eating disorder symptoms is important.

AB Emotional eating is associated with obesity and disordered eating in adolescents, and thus, is an important target for treatment. We developed a program called PEER (Preventing Emotional Eating Routines), which incorporates emotion regulation skills with behavioral weight loss and parenting techniques for adolescents who are overweight or obese (OW/OB) and their parent. This open label trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of the PEER program. Thirty adolescents who were OW/OB (86.7% female; mean age = 14.6 years (SD = 1.2); Body Mass Index (BMI) = 34.0 kg/m(2) (SD = 5.6); 33.3% White non-Hispanic) and their parent (66.7% biological mother) participated in a 4-month treatment and 3-month follow-up. The PEER program was well accepted. Initial efficacy showed significant decreases in emotional eating, and there were trends towards weight loss and a decrease in emotion dysregulation. This trial provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of the PEER program among adolescents who are OW/OB and their parent. Further treatment development and randomized controlled studies are needed.

AB This study grapples with what it means to be part of a cultural group, from a statistical modeling perspective. The method we present compares within- and between-cultural group variability, in behaviors in families. We demonstrate the method using a crosscultural study of adolescent development and parenting, involving three biennial waves of longitudinal data from 1296 eight-year-olds and their parents (multiple cultures in nine countries). Family members completed surveys about parental negativity and positivity, child academic and social-emotional adjustment, and attitudes about parenting and adolescent behavior. Variance estimates were computed at the cultural group, person, and within-person level using multilevel models. Of the longitudinally consistent variance, most was within and not between cultural groups although there was a wide range of between-group differences. This approach to quantifying cultural group variability may prove valuable when applied to quantitative studies of acculturation.

AB Reduced autobiographical memory specificity (AMS) has robust associations with psychopathology. As such, understanding the development of AMS (or its inverse, overgeneral autobiographical memory) and how it may be unique from other aspects of memory performance is important. In particular, it is unclear whether child AMS is distinct from autobiographical memory performance in other contexts, such as during mother-child reminiscing, and whether reduced AMS during early childhood is associated with emotional adjustment as found later in development. In this study, associations between children's AMS and memory performance during mother-child reminiscing were evaluated. Moreover, the contributions of each type of child memory performance to child internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined. Participants included 95 mother-child dyads drawn from a diverse, low-income community. Children's ages ranged from 3.5 years to 6years. Dyads participated in a joint reminiscing task about 4 past events, children participated in assessments of AMS, and mothers rated children's emotional adjustment. Path analysis results indicated that children's AMS was not significantly related to children's unique memory contributions during reminiscing. Child AMS was negatively associated with emotional symptoms, whereas child memory during reminiscing was not.

AB Management of type 1 diabetes in adolescence is a complex task requiring self-control within individual and interpersonal domains. This is similarly requisite for academic achievement. Grade point average (GPA) was examined as a barometer of diabetes management reflective of self-control in a challenging daily context. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (n=172) completed questionnaires on self-control, self-efficacy, parent/peer relationships, and adherence, while mothers reported GPA. Self-control, self-efficacy, and parent/peer relationships predicted GPA, adherence and HbA1c. GPA predicted HbA1c above and beyond adherence and self-control predictors. GPA may be a valuable indicator of individual and interpersonal self-control processes required for diabetes management.

AB Research has consistently found that expressing emotion related to distressing events promotes social adjustment (Rime, 2007, 2009), whereas suppression of negative emotion has social costs (e.g., Gross & John, 2003). However, prior research has largely failed to take into account the degree of relationship between the distressed individual and the person to whom the distressed individual is speaking, and the social norms of the population to which the distressed individual belongs. Considering these factors, the relationship between emotional expressivity and social adjustment may be more complicated than the emotional regulation literature would suggest. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between social adjustment and emotional expressivity toward friends and nonfriends in a sample of late adolescent males, through the lens of masculinity research that suggests that low emotional expressivity may be adaptive for males in certain contexts. Adolescent boys (N = 178) reported the degree to which they expressed emotion to friends and to nonfriends (which includes acquaintances and strangers). Results indicated that for these boys, emotional expressivity was associated with better social adjustment only when the expression of emotion occurred within the context of friendship. Additionally, boys who exhibited greater "expressive flexibility," expressing more to friends than nonfriends, reported the greatest social adjustment.

AB Background: Co-occurring problems are common in individuals with clinical autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but their relevance for impairment and contact with health services in ASD is largely unexplored.
   Aims: We investigated the extent of co-occurring problems in children with high ASD traits from a total population sample. We explored the contribution of co-occurring problems to impairment and service contact, and whether there were children without co-occurring problems in this group; as proxy for "ASD only".
   Methods and procedures: Children screening positive on the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) were used as proxy for ASD. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) were operationalised using symptom counts. A parent or teacher report above the 95th percentile counted as "problem" present for other symptom domains.
   Outcomes and results: 92% of ASSQ high-scorers had a minimum of two other problems. Emotional problems, ADHD symptoms and learning problems were the most commonly reported problems, also predicting impairment and contact with services.
   Conclusions and implications: Co-occurring problems were common in ASD screen positive children and contributed strongly to both impairment and to contact with services. Gender differences indicated that female symptoms were perceived as less impairing by parents and teachers. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extensive research exists on coping in children and adolescents. However, developmental issues have only recently started to receive more attention. The present study examined age differences and developmental changes in six coping strategies (social support seeking, problem solving, avoidant coping, palliative emotion regulation, anger-related emotion regulation, and media use) assessed by a coping questionnaire (German Stress and Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, SSKJ 3-8; Lohaus, Eschenbeck, Kohlmann, & Klein-He beta ling, 2006) in middle/late childhood and early adolescence. At the initial assessment, 917 children from grades 3 to 7 (age range 8-15 years) were included (cross-sectional sample). Three cohorts (grades 3-5 at baseline) were traced longitudinally over 1 1/2 years with four assessments (longitudinal sample: n = 388). The cross-sectional coping data showed significant effects for grade level in four coping strategies. Older children scored higher in problem solving and media use, and lower in avoidant coping. Seventh graders scored lower than fourth and fifth graders in social support seeking. Longitudinal data confirmed time effects and cohort effects indicating developmental changes. Increases over time were found for problem solving and media use; decreases were found for avoidant coping and anger-related emotion regulation. For social support seeking, an increase within the youngest cohort (grades 3-5) was found. Developmental trends (in cross-sectional and longitudinal data), with especially strong increases for problem solving or declines in avoidant coping in the youngest cohort, differed for the two studied stressful situations (social, academic) but were independent of the child's gender. To conclude, particularly in the age range of 9-11 years relevant developmental changes toward a more active coping seem to appear.

AB Prior research has shown that the increasing stressful experiences across childhood and adolescence are associated with impaired psychosocial adjustment. Thereby, girls in particular are faced with a higher number of stressful events in the transition to adolescence. Thus, evidence has been provided for an adverse, cost-intense coping pattern and decreased self-reported health-related quality of life (HrQoL) among girls. However, coping abilities have been found to moderate this demand-strain relationship, and increased maladaptive and decreased adaptive coping were related to the development of psychological symptoms. By contrast, there is little research on the effects of the type of stressful situation on coping and on the predictive effects of coping on HrQoL. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of gender and stress domain (interpersonal and academic stressors) on coping. In total, 1,087 children and adolescents aged 7-16 years were asked to complete the German Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents in the classroom setting. This questionnaire assesses two adaptive coping styles represented by emotion-focused coping (minimization and distraction/ recreation) and problem-focused coping (situation control, positive self-instructions, and social support) and a maladaptive coping style consisting of passive avoidance, rumination, resignation, and aggression. Moreover, the predictive effects of coping on HrQoL measured by the KIDSCREEN-27 were examined among a subsample of 442 pupils aged 9-16 years. In line with prior results, girls were characterized by a maladaptive coping pattern, showing decreased emotion-regulating strategies and positive self-instructions combined with increased maladaptive coping strategies. However, support-seeking was enhanced compared with boys. The main effects of the stress domain were ascertained in distraction, situation control, and aggression with an increased employment of coping strategies in response to interpersonal stressors. These results on situation-specific coping indicate the high relevance of interpersonal stressors for children and adolescents, who tend to apply a higher effort on interpersonal coping than on academic coping. The interaction effect on rumination indicated that girls employed more rumination in response to social stressors, supporting the notion that girls in particular are affected by interpersonal stressors and invest a higher effort to cope with these social stressors. Additionally, unfavorable influences of an increasing age on HrQoL were replicated, and physical and mental HrQoL was predicted by coping controlled for age, gender, chronic conditions, and mental stress reactivity. The results support the application of gender-and age-adjusted health-promoting interventions among children and adolescents. To improve HrQoL, modification of the coping strategies minimization, positive self-instructions, avoidance, and resignation is suggested.

AB Children from low-income families are at greater risk for poor social-emotional development and physical health and may be in need of intervention. This study examined the extent to which the Positive Action (PA) preschool lessons improved low-income children's social-emotional competence and health behaviors. Mixed findings emerged with regard to whether the lessons facilitated growth in child outcomes. Results showed positive effects of PA on children's directly assessed social problem solving skills and their parent-rated social-emotional competence and health behaviors. Unexpectedly, program effects on teacher ratings of social-emotional competence were in the opposite direction. These findings provide preliminary evidence that PA may be effective in promoting positive social-emotional and health behavior outcomes for children, particularly when outcomes are assessed directly and by parents.

AB Intervention research on adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is sparse. Many adults with ASD experience impaired emotion regulation (ER), which is thought to contribute to higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities among adults with ASD and indirect effects upon adaptive functioning, interpersonal relationships, and vocational status. The purpose of this study was to investigate feasibility and initial efficacy of an adapted mindfulness-based individual therapy targeting ER difficulties for adults with ASD. There is evidence for feasibility based on acceptable treatment fidelity and participant satisfaction ratings. Of nine participants, seven demonstrated improvement in at least one of the following domains; impulse control, access to ER strategies, and emotional acceptance. Further research is recommended, including additional timepoints and a clinical cutoff-derived sample.

Sixty-one individuals aged 14-24 years (M (age) = 18.19; SD (age) = 2.19) completed the ER Questionnaire, IU Scale-12, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Dimensional Anxiety Scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Autism-Spectrum Quotient-Short. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results indicated all key variables were associated with each other and IU mediated the relationships between ER and symptoms of anxiety and of depression. Findings have implications for the design of future interventions targeting affective disorders in ASD.

AB Recent attachment research suggests that children with avoidant attachment often underreport their psychological distress compared to their physiologic indicators of distress (neuroendocrine reactivity, startle response, event-related potentials). This pattern of behavior (referred to as psychobiological divergence) may confer risk for suboptimal coping behaviors, including substance use, sexual risk-taking, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), because individuals who are not aware of or cannot express their emotional needs may engage in maladaptive strategies to regulate their emotions. In the current pilot study (N = 45 youth), we investigate whether psychobiological divergence of neuroendocrine and self-reported reactivity in middle childhood prospectively predicts health risk behaviors (HRBs) in adolescence. The results revealed that divergence was significantly associated with adolescents' substance use and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), but not with their sexual behavior. Among adolescents currently reporting low levels of attachment security, divergence was associated with greater self-reported NSSI. Our results provide initial evidence that psychobiological divergence confers risk for substance use and NSSI in combination with current relational distress. We discuss the implications of our findings for adolescent development and clinical risk.

AB Objective: A considerable number of adolescents exhibit severe self-regulation deficits in affect and behavior, which are referred to as affective dysregulation (AD). AD may be conceptualized as a dimensional trait that, in its extreme form, resembles the diagnostic categories of severe mood dysregulation (SMD) or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Assuming a shared pathway of psychopathology in AD and SMD, similar underlying dysfunctional mechanisms in emotion processing, particularly emotion recognition (RECOG) and regulation (REGUL), may be postulated. Method: Adolescent inpatients with AD (CAD, N = 35), without AD (CCG, N = 28), and nonclinical controls (NCG; N = 28) were administered a morphed facial recognition task (RECOG). REGUL abilities, levels of irritability as well as depressive symptoms were also assessed. Results: We found no significant group differences in accuracy and thresholds for RECOG abilities. Patients with AD reported more dysfunctional REGUL strategies than did CCG and NCG. Both depression and AD, but not irritability, influenced the overall degree of maladaptive REGUL. Conclusion: The broad phenotype of AD does not involve the deficits in RECOG reported for adolescents with a narrow phenotype (SMD); regarding REGUL strategies, AD seems to be associated with specific impairments.

AB Greater parent-youth disagreement on youth symptomatology is associated with a host of factors (e.g., parental psychopathology, family functioning) that might impede treatment. Parent-youth disagreement may represent an indicator of treatment prognosis. Using data from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study, this study used polynomial regression and longitudinal growth modeling to examine whether parent-youth agreement prior to and throughout treatment predicted treatment outcomes (anxiety severity, youth functioning, responder status, and diagnostic remission, rated by an independent evaluator). When parents reported more symptoms than youth prior to treatment, youth were less likely to be diagnosis-free post-treatment; this was only true if the youth received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) alone, not if youth received medication, combination, or placebo treatment. Increasing concordance between parents and youth over the course of treatment was associated with better treatment outcomes across all outcome measures (ps<.001). How parents and youth co-report appears to be an indicator of CBT outcome. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB The author examined 2 distinctive aspects of emotion regulation in mathematics homework, including emotion management and cognitive reappraisal. Participants were 1,799 high school students from 46 classes in China. Two multilevel models were run, 1 with emotion management and another with cognitive reappraisal as the dependent variable. Both emotion management and cognitive reappraisal were positively associated with 5 individual-level variables (monitoring motivation, managing time, learning-oriented reasons, self-concept, and teacher feedback) and 1 class-level variable (self-concept). In addition, at the individual level, emotion management was associated negatively with adult-oriented reasons but positively with arranging the environment and prior mathematics achievement. Meanwhile, cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with parent education at the class level.

AB In adolescence, when establishing and maintaining satisfying social relationships is a key developmental task, chronic loneliness is related to a host of negative outcomes. This study aimed at examining motivational and regulatory factors related to chronic loneliness. Specifically, this study investigated chronically lonely adolescents' responses to hypothetical vignettes of social inclusion and exclusion, thereby focusing on (a) adolescents' willingness and motivation to approach social inclusion and (b) emotion regulation strategies to deal with social exclusion. A total of 730 adolescents (Mage = 15.43 years, 72% female) participated in this four-wave study with annual loneliness assessments and hypothetical vignettes of social inclusion and exclusion at the final wave. After each social inclusion vignette, participants rated their willingness to accept the invitation for social inclusion and five types of motivation to approach the situation. After each social exclusion vignette, participants rated nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Compared to individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were less likely to accept invitations for social inclusion and the quality of their motivation for accepting such invitations was lower. Further, they were more likely to employ maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. In sum, this study adds significantly to understanding the motivational and regulatory processes that differentiate chronically lonely adolescents from adolescents following other trajectories.

AB Best friend expected emotion socialization responses were examined as a potential explanation for the link between social anxiety and youths' friendship quality and dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER). A community sample of 202 young adolescents (X-age = 12.66; 52.5% girls, 75.7% White) within 101 same-sex, reciprocated best friend dyads completed measures of social anxiety, friendship quality, dysfunctional ER, and how they expected their friend to respond to their negative emotions. Social anxiety was related to lower expectations of support (i.e., reward, override) responses from friends, and for boys, to greater expectations of unsupportive (i.e., neglect, aggression) responses from friends. Lower expected support responses mediated the relation between social anxiety and socioemotional functioning for girls. For boys, greater expectations of unsupportive responses mediated the relation between social anxiety and socioemotional functioning. Findings indicate that social anxiety may disrupt emotion socialization processes within adolescent friendships with implications for youth socioemotional functioning.

AB A critical assumption of the CaR-FA-X model, that overgeneral memory is partly attributable to the functional avoidance of specific details about one's past experiences, has not been experimentally tested. Further, while it is assumed that the reinforcing properties of said avoidance leads to the emergence of an overgeneral recall style over time, this question has not been addressed developmentally. To explore these issues, two studies were conducted. In Study 1, 41 children and adolescents (M-age=12 years) were randomly assigned to recall overgeneral or specific negative memories on the Autobiographical Memory Test; participants later listened to their memories and provided pre- and post-tests of their emotional states at four time points: before and after memory generation and before and after memory exposure. In Study 2, 52 college-aged participants (M-age=19 years) completed the same protocol. Results indicated that children and adolescents in the overgeneral condition reported higher levels of positive affect relative to those in the specific condition, while recall condition did not impact adults' emotional states. These findings were not explained by differences in emotion regulation strategies or psychopathological symptoms. Implications for developmental models of autobiographical memory and emotion regulation are discussed.

AB This study primarily tests whether incarceration negatively affects cognitive functioning; namely, emotion regulation, cognitive control, and emotion recognition. As a secondary interest, we test protective effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy/mindfulness training (CBT/MT) intervention. Dormitories containing 197 incarcerated males aged 16 to 18 years were randomly assigned to either a CBT/MT program or an active control condition. A cognitive task was administered pretreatment and again 4 months later, upon treatment completion. Performance on all outcome variables was significantly worse at follow-up compared with baseline. There were marginally significant group by time interactions. While the control group performance significantly declined in both cognitive control and emotion regulation, the CBT/MT group showed no significant decline in either outcome. This is the first study to probe the effects of incarceration on these three processes. Findings suggest that incarceration worsens a known risk factor for crime (cognitive functioning), and that a CBT/MT intervention may help buffer against declines.

AB Objective: The aim of this article was to assess the effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) on emotion regulation (ER) in adolescents and to evaluate the relationships between non suicidal self-injury (NSSI), emotional eating, insomnia and emotion disregulation (ED).
   Method: Fifty two adolescents, aged 10-18 years, without who weren't diagnosed a psychiatric disease before abuse and completed 6-months of follow-up after abuse included the study. Control group consisted of 33 healthy voluntary participants without any known psychiatric disorders. Patients and volunteers who participated in the study were assessed with the Inventory of Statements About Self-injury (ISAS), Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia severity index (ISI), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
   Results: In our study, PSQI scores, DERS total scores and DEBQ emotional eating subscores were significantly higher in the CSA victims (In orderly; p = 0,034, p < 0.001, p = 0,023). 55.7% of the CSA victims reported self-injurious behavior, while 15.5% of healthy voluntary participants reporting self-injurious behavior. The CSA victims reporting NSSI had higher DERS scores than CSA victims without NSSI. (p = 0.024). The CSA victims with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CSA victims without PTSD had a positive correlation between DEBQ emotional eating subscores and DERS total scores (In orderly: r = 0.762, p = 0.031; r = 0.872, p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the PSQI scores and DERS scores in the CSA victims with PTSD (r = 0.827, p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: Further studies are needed to assess the relationship between self-injury, emotional eating, insomnia and ED, and to determine how sexual abuse effect the ER in a clinical sample of CSA.

AB AimTo implement and evaluate a health education programme based on the development of social and emotional competence in young children.
   BackgroundChildren's social and emotional skills play a key role in the adoption and maintenance of their lifestyles. Currently, a more comprehensive perspective dealing with these aspects is needed to promote healthy habits in children and develop effective health education programmes.
   DesignAn exploratory randomized controlled trial.
   MethodsA convenience sample of 30 children (5 and 6years old) will be recruited from a public school in Spain, with 15 participants in the experimental group and 15 in the control group. Participants in the experimental group will receive the first unit of the programme, consisting of developing emotional knowledge skills around daily health habits (eating, hygiene, sleep and physical exercise) using different game-based dynamics and an emotional diary, while those in the control group will continue with their usual school routine. Outcome measures include emotional knowledge ability, basic social skills and children's health profile. The perceived impact of the intervention by parents, acceptability (by parents and children) and feasibility of the programme will be also assessed. Data will be collected at baseline, postintervention and at 7-month follow-up.
   DiscussionThis study offers an innovative intervention aimed at improving children's healthy lifestyles from a holistic perspective by addressing social and emotional competence as one of the most influential aspects of children's development. This exploratory trial is an essential step to explore crucial aspects of the full-scale clinical trial.

DE Binge eating; binge drinking; emotion regulation; adolescence
AB This cross-sectional study examined binge eating and binge drinking behaviors exploring their association with the strategies of Emotion Regulation, such as Cognitive Reappraisal (CR) and Expression Suppression (ES). The sample consisted of 1004 Italian students (395 males and 609 females) attending high school. The average age of the students was 17.9 years (SD 1/40.8; range: 16-21). They completed self-report measures assessing binge behaviors and Emotion Regulation strategies. No differences resulted between adolescents assuming binge behaviors and no bingers as regards CR; conversely, adolescents engaging in binge eating and in both binge behaviors reported the highest levels of ES. Furthermore, both Emotion Regulation strategies were significant predictors of binge eating. The present study suggested that binge behaviors were strongly associated with adolescent's ability to evaluate and manage their emotions, so that adolescents may benefit from more precise and specific prevention and treatment approaches focused on training to use more adaptive and effective strategies to regulate their emotions.

AB The association between cognitive emotion regulation strategy use and adolescents' risk behavior has long been emphasized. To identify coping profiles of Chinese adolescents having unprotected sex and to examine the characteristics and associations among those subgroups, 541 adolescents (age, 14-19 years) were screened from secondary schools in 10 Chinese cities. By latent profile analysis (LPA), the participants were identified into three latent profiles: the low reaction profile (LRP, N = 70), the medium reaction profile (MRP, N = 369), and the high reaction profile (HRP, N = 102) based on nine subscales of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). By one-way analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that: the HRP has the highest level of using eight strategies and the lowest unprotected sex, meanwhile the LRP has the lowest level of using nine strategies and the highest unprotected sex among three groups (both p < .05). The low response coping was more prevalent among boys and younger students. It indicates that more active cognitive coping, using both adaptive and maladaptive strategies, may associate with less unprotected sex. The programs of enhancing active copying may be targeted in interventions aiming to reduce adolescent unprotected sex.

AB This study focused on the ability to experience a high ratio of positive to negative emotions in 807 Israeli adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (50% girls). While considering possible gender differences, we tested a model positing that adolescents' self-control skills would link to their positivity ratio and indirectly through perceived social support from parents and classmates. Parental support was significantly higher than classmate support, and girls scored significantly higher than boys on self-control skills and on both support sources. Self-control skills linked directly with positivity ratio and indirectly through parents' and classmates' support, with no gender differences found for the overall model. The study highlights the importance of prevention and treatment programs designed to impart adolescents with prosocial self-control skills, to improve their perceived availability of social support and consequently to increase their positivity ratio during this intense developmental period.

AB Introduction: This study investigated the relationship between four suspected risk factors affective dysregulation, conduct problems, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress and incident nonmedical prescription analgesic (NPA) use among college students.
   Methods: The sample was derived from 929 college students from a large, mid-Atlantic university who completed the third annual College Life Study assessment (Y-3) and were NPA use naive at baseline (Y-1). A series of logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictors of incident NPA use by Y-3. Separate models were developed to evaluate the association between the suspected risk factors and (a) NPA use relative to non-use of other drugs, inchiding nonmedical use of other drug classes, (b) NPA use relative to other drug use, and (c) other drug use relative to non-use. All models included gender, parental education level, and race/ethnicity.
   Results: Affective dysregulation was significantly associated with becoming an incident NPA user relative to both drug users without NPA use as well as non-users, after statistically controlling for demographic characteristics and other factors. Conduct problems in early childhood were positively related to both incident NPA use and other drug use without NPA use relative to non -users, after statistically controlling for demographic characteristics and other factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with NPA incidence at the bivariate level only.
   Conclusions: These findings extend previous research suggesting that NPA use might be related to deficits in regulating negative emotional states, and highlight possible markers for screening and intervention to prevent NPA use.

AB Background: The present study sought to better understand the unique profiles of late adolescents' affective functioning by exploring patterns of trait affect and cognitive affective regulation strategies. The study also examined whether these unique profiles significantly predicted depressive symptoms, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and well-being outcomes.
   Methods: Data from a sample of 590 late adolescents were examined (M = 19.14 years, SD = 1.41, 63% Female, 62% Caucasian, 38% African American/Biracial). Participants were followed for an average of 14 months (SD = 2.53) and completed measures of trait affect, cognitive affective regulation, depression, NSSI, and well-being. Data were examined using latent class analysis.
   Results: Five subgroups with unique patterns of affective functioning were identified. Late adolescents who reported above average levels of negative affect, dampening of positive affect, brooding, and reflection, coupled with below average levels of positive affect and positive rumination, were more likely to report having higher levels of depressive symptoms and greater engagement in NSSI during the one-year period prior to baseline. Similarly, the late adolescents fitting this profile also reported lower levels of well-being and were more likely to report engaging in NSSI at the follow-up.
   Limitations: Limitations include a narrow exploration of affective regulation strategies and the addition of key variables after the initiation of the larger study.
   Conclusions: These findings shed light on affective regulation factors relevant to the experience of depressive symptoms and NSSI, and the promotion of well-being.

AB Background: Child sexual abuse is associated with a plethora of devastating repercussions. A significant number of sexually abused children are likely to experience other forms of maltreatment that can seriously affect their emotion regulation abilities and impede on their development. The aim of the study was to test emotion regulation and dissociation as mediators in the association between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized and externalized behavior problems in child victims of sexual abuse.
   Methods: Participants were 309 sexually abused children (203 girls and 106 boys; Mean age = 9.07) and their non-offending parent. Medical and clinical files were coded for cumulative childhood trauma. At initial evaluation (T1), parents completed measures assessing children's emotion regulation abilities and dissociation. At Time 2 (T2), parents completed a measure assessing children's behavior problems. Mediation analyses were conducted with emotion regulation and dissociation as sequential mediators using Mplus software.
   Results: Findings revealed that cumulative childhood trauma affects both internalized and externalized behavior problems through three mediation paths: emotion regulation alone, dissociation alone, and through a path combining emotion regulation and dissociation.
   Limitations: Both emotion regulation and dissociation were assessed at T1 and thus the temporal sequencing of mediators remains to be ascertained through a longitudinal design. All measures were completed by the parents.
   Conclusions: Clinicians should routinely screen for other childhood trauma in vulnerable clienteles. In order to tackle behavior problems, clinical interventions for sexually abused youth need to address emotion regulation competencies and dissociation.

AB Background: The possibility of using biological measures to predict the trajectory of symptoms among adolescent psychiatric inpatients has important implications. This study aimed to examine emotion regulation ability (measured via self-report) and a hypothesized proxy in resting-state functional connectivity [RSFC] between the amygdala and frontal brain regions as baseline predictors of internalizing symptom recovery during inpatient care.
   Methods: 196 adolescents (61% female; Mage = 15.20; SD = 1.48) completed the Achenbach Brief Problem Monitor (BPM) each week during their inpatient care. RSFC (n = 45) and self-report data of emotion regulation (n = 196) were collected at baseline.
   Results: The average internalizing symptom score at admission was high (alpha(0) = 66.52), exceeding the BPM's clinical cut off score of 65. On average, internalizing symptom scores declined significantly, by 0.40 points per week (p = 0.004). While self-reported emotion regulation was associated with admission levels of internalizing problems, it did not predict change in symptoms. RSFC between left amygdala and left superior frontal gyrus was significantly associated with the intercept-higher connectivity was associated with higher internalizing at admission-and the slope-higher connectivity was associated with a more positive slope (i.e., less decline in symptoms). RSFC between the right amygdala and the left superior frontal gyrus was significantly, positively correlated with the slope parameter.
   Conclusions: Results indicate the potential of biologically-based measures that can be developed further for personalized care in adolescent psychiatry.

AB Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach.
   Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted.
   Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = -0.73; 95% CI [-1.42;-0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions (n = 100) compared to different control group interventions (n = 95).
   Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed.

AB Background: Self-esteem is fundamentally linked to mental health, but its' role in trajectories of psychiatric problems is unclear. In particular, few studies have addressed the role of self-esteem in the development of attention problems. Hence, we examined the role of global self-esteem in the development of symptoms of anxiety/depression and attention problems, simultaneously, in a clinical sample of adolescents while accounting for gender, therapy, and medication.
   Methods: Longitudinal data were obtained from a sample of 201 adolescents-aged 13-18-referred to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Trondheim, Norway. In the baseline study, self-esteem, and symptoms of anxiety/depression and attention problems were measured by means of self-report. Participants were reassessed 3 years later, with a participation rate of 77% in the clinical sample.
   Results: Analyses showed that high self-esteem at baseline predicted fewer symptoms of both anxiety/depression and attention problems 3 years later after controlling for prior symptom levels, gender, therapy (or not), and medication.
   Conclusions: Results highlight the relevance of global self-esteem in the clinical practice, not only with regard to emotional problems, but also to attention problems. Implications for clinicians, parents, and others are discussed.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious health risk behavior that forms the basis of a tentative diagnosis in DSM-5, NSSI Disorder (NSSID). To date, established treatments specific to NSSI or NSSID are scarce. As a first step in evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a novel treatment for adolescents with NSSID, we conducted an open trial of emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA): a 12-week, behavioral treatment aimed at directly targeting both NSSI and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion regulation difficulties.
   Methods: Seventeen girls (aged 13-17; mean = 15.31) with NSSID were enrolled in a study adopting an uncontrolled open trial design with self-report and clinician-rated assessments of NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors, emotion regulation difficulties, borderline personality features, and global functioning administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Measures of NSSI and emotion regulation difficulties were also administered weekly during treatment.
   Results: Ratings of treatment credibility and expectancy and the treatment completion rate (88%) were satisfactory, and both therapeutic alliance and treatment attendance were strong. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant improvements associated with large effect sizes in past-month NSSI frequency, emotion regulation difficulties, self-destructive behaviors, and global functioning, as well as a medium effect size in past-month NSSI versatility, from pre- to post-treatment. Further, all of these improvements were either maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Finally, change in emotion regulation difficulties mediated improvements in NSSI over the course of treatment.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of this treatment for adolescents with NSSID.

AB Objective: The demands of parenting are usually associated with some stress, and elevated levels of stress may affect the parent-child relationships and parenting practices. This is especially the case of families where children have special needs conditions or disorders, like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
   Method: This study examined parenting stress among mothers of children and adolescents with ADHD. The sample comprised 126 mothers of girls (36; 29%) and boys (90; 71%) aged 6-17 years old.
   Results: Mothers reported their own stress levels as well as the children and adolescents' variables (severity of their ADHD symptoms, conduct, and emotional problems) and family-contextual variables (negative impact on family's social life, impact on couple relationship, and perceived social support). Hierarchical multiple regression showed that (a) negative impact on social life and conduct problems were the strongest predictors of mother's stress. Bootstrap mediation analyses revealed that (b) the association between child and adolescent's ADHD and parenting stress was mediated by children's conduct problems and by negative impact on family's social life, and not by children's emotional problems nor by mother's perceived social support. The mediation analysis also suggested (c) a pathway from child/adolescent's ADHD through children's conduct problems and then through their negative impact on family's social life to mother's parenting stress.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that both child/adolescent's and family factors should be considered in the designing of interventions for reducing parenting stress in families of children and adolescents with ADHD.

AB Neural disruptions during emotion regulation are common of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Identifying distinct functional and effective connectivity patterns in GAD may provide biomarkers for their diagnoses. This study aims to investigate the differences of features of brain network connectivity between GAD patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess whether those differences can serve as biomarkers to distinguish GAD from controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was conducted on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 20 GAD patients with medicine-free and 20 matched HC, identifying nine highly reproducible and significantly different functional brain connectivity patterns across diagnostic groups. We then utilized Granger causality (GC) to study the effective connectivity between the regions that identified by HPM-ICA. The linear discriminant analysis was finally used to distinguish GAD from controls with these measures of neural connectivity. The GAD patients showed stronger functional connectivity in amygdala, insula, putamen, thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex, but weaker in frontal and temporal cortex compared with controls. Besides, the effective connectivity in GAD was decreased from the cortex to amygdala and basal ganglia. Applying the ICA and GC features to the classifier led to a classification accuracy of 87.5%, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 85.0%. These findings suggest that the presence of emotion dysregulation circuits may contribute to the pathophysiology of GAD, and these aberrant brain features may serve as robust brain biomarkers for GAD.

AB Emerging research in epigenetics has shown that there is variability in how environmental exposures "get under the skin" through mechanisms like DNA methylation to influence gene expression that may lead to differential adaptations to stress. This is the first study to examine prospectively the relationship between DNA methylation at birth and resilience to prenatal environmental stressors in several domains (conduct, hyperactivity, emotional problems, and global symptomatology) in middle childhood. We focused on DNA methylation in the vicinity of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene as it has been previously associated with impairments in social-cognitive processes that may underlie a wide range of childhood psychopathology. Participants were 91 youth exposed to pre- and postnatal adversity with established conduct problem trajectories drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Consistent with our hypothesis, OXTR DNA methylation was predictive of resilience in the conduct problems domain in middle childhood. DNA methylation profiles did not predict resilience in domains of emotional, hyperactivity, and global symptomatology, suggesting a potential role for OXTR in the development of conduct problems in particular. However, individuals who were resilient to conduct problems were also broadly resilient across multiple domains. Therefore, future research should elucidate the biological pathways between OXTR DNA methylation and gene expression and its relation to impairments in social behavior.

AB Early life stress (ELS) is a significant risk factor for the emergence of internalizing problems in adolescence. Beginning in adolescence, females are twice as likely as males to experience internalizing disorders. The present study was designed to examine sex differences in the association between ELS and internalizing problems in early pubertal adolescents, and whether and how corticolimbic function and connectivity may underlie these associations. Fifty-nine early pubertal males and 78 early pubertal females, ages 9-13 years (all Tanner Stage 3 or below) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they performed an emotion label task that robustly interrogates corticolimbic function. Participants were also interviewed about their experience of ELS. Females exhibited a positive association between ELS and internalizing problems, whereas males exhibited no such association. Whole-brain and amygdala region of interest analyses indicated that whereas females exhibited a positive association between ELS and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during implicit emotion regulation, males showed no such association. Activation in these regions was positively associated with internalizing problems in females but not males; however, activation in these regions did not mediate the association between ELS and internalizing problems. Finally, both boys and girls exhibited an association between ELS and increased negative connectivity between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala. Using a carefully characterized sample of early pubertal adolescents, the current study highlights important sex differences in the development of corticolimbic circuitry during a critical period of brain development. These sex differences may play a significant role in subsequent risk for internalizing problems.

AB Previous research revealed significant relations between the experience of childhood adversity (CA) and the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adulthood. However, it is still uncertain whether parental CA could have a transgenerational association with adolescent BPD. We investigated associations between parents' CA (antipathy, neglect, physical abuse) and BPD traits within a clinical adolescent sample and tested for mediating variables. The sample consists of 91 female inpatients, along with 84 mothers and 59 fathers. Adolescent BPD traits were assessed using the BPD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-II). Adolescent and parental CA and parental subclinical BPD traits were measured using validated self-report questionnaires (CECA.Q; PSSI). The findings revealed significant associations between parental CA and adolescent BPD traits, which were partially mediated by parental subclinical BPD traits and by paternal but not maternal CA. The results underline that early intervention of BPD must target the family environment, including fathers.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a highly comorbid disorder, and these comorbidities increase the impairment associated with BPD. For example, depression, which occurs in the majority of individuals with BPD, increases the likelihood of an individual with BPD to engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Little research, however, has investigated potential mechanisms of NSSI engagement in this population. The current study aimed to fill this gap by examining momentary experiences, levels of distress tolerance, and NSSI among 51 individuals meeting current diagnostic criteria for BPD and a comorbid depressive disorder. Using data from an ecological momentary assessment across 7 days, it was found that daily urges to hurt oneself and impulsive urges, but not daily negative affect or aggressive urges, predicted NSSI occurrence. Furthermore, low levels of distress tolerance was a stronger predictor of NSSI behavior than daily experiences. These findings have important implications with regard to state versus trait dispositions in NSSI engagement among those with BPD and depression.

AB Current research on how adolescents cope with bullying is primarily quantitative, examines youth in Grades 1 through 6, and neglects to specifically assess how victims of bullying cope with being bullied. The current qualitative study explored the coping strategies of 22 rural middle-and high-school youth victimized by bullying. Results indicated that youth report using an array of emotion focused coping strategies (an internal coping strategy that focuses on emotion regulation) and problem focused coping strategies (active behaviors that are aimed to decrease or eradicate the stressor). These coping strategies included help seeking, physical and verbal aggression, standing up for themselves, and prosocial bystander behavior. While the majority of coping strategies were similar between middle-and high-school participants, these groups reported utilizing verbal and physical aggression in different ways. Further, certain coping strategies, such as help seeking and lashing out with physical and verbal aggression, were utilized as both emotion-and problem-focused coping strategies. Implications are discussed.

AB Introduction
   Information on dietary intake, including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), for adults with disabilities is limited. Such information can inform interventions to prevent chronic disease and promote health among adults with disabilities. The objective of this study was to describe the associations between SSB consumption and disability among adults.
   Methods
   We examined data on adults aged 18 years or older in 23 states and the District of Columbia who participated in the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n = 150,760). Participants who reported a limitation in any activity caused by physical, mental, or emotional problems or who reported use of special equipment were considered to have a disability (n = 41,199). Participants were classified as daily SSB consumers (= 1 time/d) and non-daily SSB consumers (<1 time/d). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between daily SSB intake and disability after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. An interaction effect between disability and obesity status was tested to consider obesity status as a potential effect modifier.
   Results
   The prevalence of drinking SSBs at least once daily was significantly higher among adults with disabilities (30.3%) than among adults without disabilities (28.6%) (P = .01). After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among nonobese adults, the odds of daily SSB intake were significantly higher among adults with disabilities than among adults without disabilities (adjusted odds ratio = 1.27, P < .001). Among obese adults, daily SSB intake was not associated with disability status (adjusted odds ratio = 0.97; P = .58).
   Conclusion
   Our findings highlight the need for increased awareness of SSB consumption among adults with disabilities.

AB The Devereux Student Strengths Assessment Mini (DESSA-Mini; Naglieri, LeBuffe, & Shapiro, 2011/2014) was designed to overcome practical obstacles to universal prevention screening. This article seeks to determine whether an entirely strength-based, 8-item screening instrument achieves technical accuracy in routine practice. Data come from a district-wide implementation of a new social emotional learning (SEL) initiative designed to promote students' social-emotional competence. All students, kindergarten through Grade 8, were screened using the DESSA-Mini. A random 5 students per classroom received additional assessment. Concurrent and predictive criterion studies were conducted using the full DESSA as well as administrative records of serious disciplinary infraction. The DESSA-Mini showed excellent internal reliability, exceeding .90. Negligible to small differences were found between scores on the DESSA-Mini screen and the DESSA full assessment. Classification consistency between the DESSA-Mini and the DESSA was high (87%-94%) in routine practice, with sensitivity and specificity estimates exceeding Glascoe's (2005) standards. Finally, predictive validity of the DESSA-Mini was reliable; students screened as having a Need for SEL Instruction at the beginning of the year were 4.5 times more likely to have a record of serious disciplinary infraction at the end of the school year compared with those who were not identified (p < .001). These findings compare quite favorably with other instruments used in schools to screen entire student populations, in cases where such analyses have been conducted, and is consistent with a practice preference of identifying, but not overidentifying, students for accelerated preventative interventions for mental, emotional, and behavioral problems.

AB Obesity is an increasing problem in young people. Childhood obesity and overweight have increased rapidly on a global scale, and have tripled in the past 30 years, to affect approximately one in five children. Diets high in refined fats and sugar are a major contributor to the development of obesity, and the effects of such obesity inducing hypercaloric diets on brain function may contribute to the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with obesity. Anxiety disorders typically emerge in childhood and adolescence, and symptoms often continue into adulthood. Based on this symptomology, we consider anxiety-related behavioral consequences of hypercaloric diets across development. We review research on the effects of hypercaloric dietary manipulations across the lifespan on emotion regulation and the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin these processes. Cumulatively, the findings reveal that gestation and the juvenile/adolescent developmental periods may be early-life windows of vulnerability for developing anxiety in later life due to the augmented effects of these diets on neuroendocrine stress systems and the maturation of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation.

AB Objective: In the last two decades there has been a significant transformation regarding the use of new technologies. Despite growing acknowledgement concerning the different activities and functions of digital technologies, there remains a lack of understanding on how technology overuse may negatively impact both physical and psychosocial well-being. Although researchers have begun to explore the meaning and implications of excessive Internet use in non-clinical populations of children and adolescents, there is still little consistent knowledge on the topic.
   This study aimed to extend existing knowledge on the excessive use of the Internet among school-aged adolescents, focusing on its association with recurrent somatic symptoms, depressive risk and behavioral and emotional problems.
   Method: Two hundred and forty adolescents (51.9% females) aged between 10 and 15, participated in this study. Data was collected using the Children's Somatization Inventory, the Internet Addiction Test, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Youth Self Report and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Structural Equation Model analysis was used to analyse the data.
   Results: Approximately 21.8% of participants reported excessive Internet use based on Young's criteria. Higher levels of Internet use were associated with somatic and depressive symptoms as well as emotional and behavioral problems. Depressive Symptoms predicted both Internet Addiction (b = 0.304, p < 0.001) and Internalizing (b = 0.542, p < 0.001) and Externalizing problems (b = 0.484, p < 0.001). Internet Addiction also significantly predicted both Internalizing (b = 0.162, p = 0.02) and Externalizing problems (b = 0.183, p = 0.02). Finally, Structural Equation Modeling showed that the indirect effect of Depressive Symptoms (via Internet Addiction) on Internalizing or Externalizing problems were significant.
   Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify the mechanisms linking Internet use, somatic symptoms and adaptive functioning.

AB Chronic pain can lead to significant negative outcomes across many areas of life. Recently, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been identified as potentially effective tools for improved pain management among adolescents living with pain. This study aimed to explore the experience of adolescents who participated in an eight-week mindfulness group adapted for adolescents with chronic pain (MBI-A), and obtain their feedback and suggestions on group structure and content. A mixed method design was used employing qualitative data from focus groups and data from a satisfaction questionnaire. Focus group data were transcribed and analyzed using inductive simple descriptive content analysis. Of the total participants (n = 21), 90% (n = 19) provided feedback by completing satisfaction questionnaires and seventeen (n = 17) of those also participated across two focus groups. Analysis of the focus group transcripts uncovered six themes: mindfulness skills, supportive environment, group exercises (likes and dislikes), empowerment, program expectations, and logistics. Participants reported positive experiences in the MBI-A program, including support received from peers and mindfulness skills, including present moment awareness, pain acceptance, and emotion regulation. Group members suggested increasing the number of sessions and being clearer at outset regarding a focus on reduction of emotional suffering rather than physical pain.

AB In this study it was aimed to investigate the relationship between disordered eating attitude and early maladaptive schemas, emotion regulation difficulties, and perceived parenting styles in young women. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the mediation effect of early maladaptive schemas and emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between the perceived parenting styles and eating attitudes. The sample of this study consists of 773 female university students aged between 17-35. Eating Attitudes-Test (EAT-40), Young Schema Questionnaire- Short Form 3 (YSQ-SF3), Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were used. First, the sample was classified into two groups as "high risk group for developing eating disorder" (n = 92) and "low risk group for developing eating disorder" (ri = 80) according to the scores obtained from Eating Attitude Test. Analysis has shown that the high risk group perceive both their mother and father negatively, possess more severe early maladaptive schemas and face more difficulties in the emotion regulation except for awareness sub-dimension than the low risk group. In addition, with the whole sample (N = 773), it has been found that the emotional deprivition, self-sacrifice, unrelenting standards (high standards) schemas of early maladaptive schemas and difficulties of emotion regulation total score have served as disordered eating attitude predictors. Besides, it is understood from the analysis that these variables have a mediating role in the relationship between negative perceived maternal parenting and eating attitudes. It is considered that these findings will be a guide to prepare intervention studies.

AB The adolescent brain undergoes significant structural and functional development. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging in adolescents, it has been demonstrated that the prefrontal cortex, pertinent for executive control, demonstrates protracted development compared to limbic structures, active during emotion and reward processing. This asynchronous development creates a sensitive window during adolescence, in which many psychopathological disorders (i.e., mental health and substance use) emerge. This review outlines longitudinal studies that use magnetic resonance imaging to identify neurobiological predictors of emergent psychopathology (depression, anxiety, and substance use), during adolescence. Studies identifying neurobiological markers that predict onset and escalation of these disorders, as well as those that predict successful treatment outcomes are explored. An emphasis is placed on frontolimbic brain structures, a convergent neurobiological target for both emergent mental health issues and emergent substance use. The literature reviewed herein suggests that reduced volume and cortical thickness in frontolimbic regions, as well as reduced functional activation (particularly during task involving reward or emotional stimuli) in these regions, may serve as a neurobiological predictors of emergent psychopathology in adolescence. This knowledge is crucial, as it may be used to develop neurobiologically targeted prevention and intervention strategies for youth who are at-risk for developing these psychopathologies.

AB Objective: Although evidence-based treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exist, many youth fail to respond, and interventions tailored to the needs of specific subsets of patients are lacking. This study examines the efficacy of a family intervention module designed for cases of OCD complicated by poor family functioning.
   Method: Participants were 62 youngsters aged 8 to 17 years (mean age = 12.71 years; 57% male; 65% white) with a primary diagnosis of OCD and at least 2 indicators of poor family functioning. They were randomized to receive 12 sessions of individual child cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus weekly parent psychoeducation and session review (standard treatment [ST]) or the same 12 child sessions plus 6 sessions of family therapy aimed at improving OCD-related emotion regulation and problem solving (positive family interaction therapy [PFIT]). Blinded raters evaluated outcomes and tracked responders to 3-month follow-up.
   Results: Compared to ST, PFIT demonstrated better overall response rates on the Clinician Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I; 68% versus 40%, p = .03, phi = 0.28) and rates of remission (58% PFIT versus 27% ST, p = .01, phi = 0.32). PFIT also produced significantly greater reductions in functional impairment, symptom accommodation, and family conflict, and improvements in family cohesion. As expected, these shifts in family functioning constitute an important treatment mechanism, with changes in accommodation mediating treatment response.
   Conclusion: PFIT is efficacious for reducing OCD symptom severity and impairment and for improving family functioning. Findings are discussed in terms of personalized medicine and mechanisms of change in pediatric OCD treatment.

AB Background: Adolescent emotional responses and behaviors are often passed off as growth pangs and academic stress, thereby missing those that need deeper understanding and mental health interventions.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to understand mental health status among the school adolescents in Tezpur, Assam.
   Materials and methods: The present study was a cross sectional study that used convenience sampling in selection of the schools. A total of 10 schools were selected for the purpose of the study. 1403 Adolescents were selected for data analysis. Socio-Demographic Performa and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ] were administered to the participants.
   Results: The results indicated that five predictors (gender, education, family type, academic performance, socio economic status in the family) explained 9.79% of the variance (F = 5.040, P < 0.000) in total difficulty levels: (Academic performance; beta = 0.08; t = 3.15; P = 0.002) and (Socio economic status; beta = 0.07, t = 3.02, P = 0.003).
   Conclusion: In the study less than one tenth of the participants have some mental health issues and this calls for concern. Schools should have standing operation procedures in place to periodically screen adolescents for mental health related issues.

AB Few studies have examined differences in emotional problems and personality of traditional bullies and cyberbullies. The present study aimed to determine whether those engaged in cyberbullying differ in emotional problems, and personality from those engage in traditional bullying perpetration. An Argentinean sample of 898 high school students was recruited (56% female; mean age = 15.2 SD = 1.6). Adolescents completed measures of traditional bullying, cyberbullying, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and personality. A 6% were traditional bullies; 8%, cyberbullies; and 4% were involved in both forms; the remainders were non involved. Results indicated that cyberbullies showed less depression and anxiety than traditional bullies. Also, cyberbullies scored low in neuroticism and high in agreeableness compared to traditional bullies. The results suggest that cyberbullies are characterized by an emotional and personality profile different from traditional bullies. In the discussion we analyze the implications of these results.

AB This study examined whether measures of children's autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to social stress moderated the effect of parent emotion socialization on children's social and emotional adjustment. Sixty-one children (9-13 years) completed a peer rejection task while their respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSA-R) and skin conductance level reactivity (SCL-R) were assessed. Parents' report of supportive and non-supportive reactions to their child's negative emotions served as measures of emotion socialization. Measures of children's social and emotional adjustment included: teacher-rated peer rejection, aggression, and prosocial behavior and parent-rated aggressive/dysregulated behavior and emotion regulation skills. Measures of children's ANS reactivity moderated the effect of parent emotion socialization on children's adjustment. Supportive responses were more protective for children evidencing RSA augmentation whereas non-supportive responses were more detrimental for children evidencing low SCL-R. Thus children's ANS reactivity during social stress may represent a biological vulnerability that influences sensitivity to parent emotion socialization.

AB BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions improve a variety of clinical outcomes. Executive functioning (EF) and emotion dysregulation are among the proposed transdiagnostic mechanisms that such interventions are proposed to target. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of mindfulness meditation training on EF and emotion dysregulation in a sample of female adolescents with elevations in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms against a waitlist control condition.
   MethodThis study adopted a mixed 2 (treatment group, waitlist control group)x2 (pre-test, post-test) design. Adolescent females (13-15 years old) exhibiting elevations in ADHD symptoms according to multiple informants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness treatment group (n=15) or a waitlist control group (n=15).
   ResultsAmong EF laboratory tasks, planning and inhibition were higher in the treatment group relative to the control group with large effect sizes at post-treatment. The treatment group also exhibited lower scores in self-reported emotion dysregulation (total, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and impulse control difficulties) in comparison to the waitlist control group with large effect sizes at post-treatment. Within group pre-test and post-test comparisons indicated improvement on particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation only for the treatment group.
   ConclusionsMindfulness meditation training improved particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation in adolescent females with elevations in ADHD symptoms. Treatment development efforts should target clinical populations that exhibit difficulties in these transdiagnostic mechanisms.

AB The present study aimed to explore the cultural differences in social functioning and coping strategies in chronically ill adolescents. One hundred sixty-eight chronically ill adolescents (45.8 % girls), age 11 to 17 years from Romania (N = 78) and Republic of Moldova (N = 90) were recruited. Participants filled in self-assessment measures for social functioning problems and coping strategies. Results indicated cross-cultural differences in the studied factors: Moldavian adolescents reported more social functioning problems and higher use of maladaptive coping strategies, while using less adaptive strategies than Romanian counterparts. The associations between social functioning and maladaptive coping strategies were stronger for Romanian than Moldavian adolescents. Further, various coping strategies acted as important predictors for social functioning in the two country samples. Findings suggest that, while the direction of the relation between coping and social functioning in chronically ill adolescents is cultural invariant, the importance played by specific coping strategies in determining social functioning varies by cultural context. Therefore, clinical interventions aimed at improving the social functioning of chronically ill adolescents should take into account the reality of their cultural setting.

AB This article aims to review the concept of emotion dysregulation, focusing on issues related to its definition, meanings and role in psychiatric disorders. Articles on emotion dysregulation published until May 2016 were identified through electronic database searches. Although there is no agreement about the definition of emotion dysregulation, the following five overlapping, not mutually exclusive dimensions of emotion dysregulation were identified: decreased emotional awareness, inadequate emotional reactivity, intense experience and expression of emotions, emotional rigidity and cognitive reappraisal difficulty. These dimensions characterise a number of psychiatric disorders in various proportions, with borderline personality disorder and eating disorders seemingly more affected than other conditions. The present review contributes to the literature by identifying the key components of emotion dysregulation and by showing how these permeate various forms of psychopathology. It also makes suggestions for improving research endeavours. Better understanding of the various dimensions of emotion dysregulation will have implications for clinical practice. Future research needs to address emotion dysregulation in all its multifaceted complexity so that it becomes clearer what the concept encompasses.

AB Background: Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning, has emerged as a physiological indicator for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10-24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety.
   Methods: The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, Psychlnfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings.
   Results: In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms.
   Limitations: The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings.
   Conclusion: Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).

AB Regulating emotions well is critical for promoting social and emotional health among children and adolescents. Parents play a prominent role in how children develop emotion regulation. In 2007, Morris etal. proposed a tripartite model suggesting that parents influence children's emotion regulation through three mechanisms: children's observation of parents' emotion regulation, emotion-related parenting practices, and the emotional climate of the family. Over the past decade, we have conducted many studies that support this model, which we summarize here along with other research related to parenting and emotion regulation. We also discuss recent research on the effects of parenting on the neural circuitry involved in emotion regulation and highlight potential directions for research. Finally, we suggest how this research can aid prevention and intervention efforts to help families.

AB Research has shown high rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders among samples of youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Farrell et al., Psychiatry Res 199(2):115-123, 2012; Lewin et al., Psychiatry Res 178(2):317-322, 2010; POTS Team, J Am Med Assoc 292(16):1969-1976, 2004). Autism and autistic traits co-occur at high rates within clinical samples of youth with OCD (Ivarsson and Melin in J Anxiety Disord 22(6):969-978, 2008; Stewart et al. in Child Psychiatry Hum Dev 1-9, 2016). This study extends the literature by examining the relationship between ASD traits, family accommodation, and functional impairment in a sample of youth with OCD across a wide age range (n = 80; aged 7-17 years). Results indicated that autistic traits, as measured by the social responsiveness scale (SRS), were elevated in 32.5% of youth (based on a T-score of 66T and above) relative to typically developing youth, as well as youth with non-autism-related psychiatric disorders (Constantino and Gruber in Social responsiveness scale, Western Psychogical Services, Torrance, 2012). Furthermore, 27.5% of youth scored within a moderate range (66T-75T) and 5% of youth scored within a severe range (76T or higher) on the SRS, typical of children with ASD (Constantino and Gruber in Social responsiveness scale, Western Psychogical Services, Torrance, 2012). Additionally, ASD traits were associated with greater functional impairment above OCD severity. Furthermore, family accommodation mediated the relationship between ASD traits and functional impairment. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of clinical assessment and direction for further research.

AB This study examined the mediating role of child emotional dysregulation in the association between harsh parenting and Chinese adolescent problematic Internet use (PIU) and the moderating role of child forgiveness on this indirect association. Eight hundred and twenty eight middle school students with their parents were recruited as voluntary participants. Parents were required to report on their spouses' harsh parenting. And students were asked to report on their emotional dysregulation, tendency to forgive and their level of PIU. The results demonstrated that beyond the direct impact of harsh parenting on adolescent PIU, harsh parenting also indirectly contributed to adolescent PIU via the mediator of adolescents' emotional dysregulation. More importantly, we found that child forgiveness moderated the indirect relation of harsh parenting to adolescent PIU via child emotional dysregulation, with harsh parenting indirectly impacting PIU for only those adolescents with low levels of forgiveness. These results add to the current theoretical basis for preventing or intervening in the negative impact of negative parenting on adolescent PIU by ameliorating parental disciplinary strategies and/or fostering adolescent forgiveness toward parents who unjustly hurt them.

AB Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for psychopathology. Neurodevelopmental pathways underlying this risk remain poorly understood. A recent conceptual model posits that childhood adversity can be deconstructed into at least two underlying dimensions, deprivation and threat, that are associated with distinct neurocognitive consequences. This model argues that deprivation (i.e., a lack of cognitive stimulation and learning opportunities) is associated with poor executive function (EF), whereas threat is not. We examine this hypothesis in two studies measuring EF at multiple levels: performance on EF tasks, neural recruitment during EF, and problems with EF in daily life. In Study 1, deprivation (low parental education and child neglect) was associated with greater parent-reported problems with EF in adolescents (N = 169; 13-17 years) after adjustment for levels of threat (community violence and abuse), which were unrelated to EF. In Study 2, low parental education was associated with poor working memory (WM) performance and inefficient neural recruitment in the parietal and prefrontal cortex during high WM load among adolescents (N = 51, 13-20 years) after adjusting for abuse, which was unrelated to WM task performance and neural recruitment during WM. These findings constitute strong preliminary evidence for a novel model of the neurodevelopmental consequences of childhood adversity.

AB A growing body of research has highlighted the connection between parent-child positive behavioral synchrony and youth self-regulation; however, this association has yet to be the focus of a meta-analytic review. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aimed to estimate the magnitude of the relation between parent-child positive behavioral synchrony and youth self-regulation and to identify moderator variables that can explain the variability in the degree of this association across the extant literature. A thorough literature search of two major databases, in addition to scanning the reference sections of relevant articles, yielded a total of 10 peer-reviewed articles (24 effect sizes, 658 children) that were eligible for inclusion in the current meta-analysis. Results from the overall mean effect size calculation using a random-effects model indicated that parent-child positive behavioral synchrony was significantly, positively correlated with youth self-regulation and the effect size was medium. Children's ages at the time of synchrony and self-regulation measurements, as well as parent gender, served as significant moderator variables. Findings from the present meta-analysis can help to refine existing theoretical models on the role of the parent-child relationship in youth adjustment. Prevention and intervention efforts may benefit from an increased emphasis on building parent-child positive behavioral synchrony to promote youth self-regulation and thus children's overall well-being.

AB Background: Risky behaviors have been related to emotional regulation and attachment, which may constitute risk factors for developing an addictive behavior. However, there may also be differences between substance and non-substance-related addictions. Aims: This study aimed to examine the relationship of emotional regulation and attachment, with substance (alcohol and drug abuse), and non-substance-related addictions (gambling disorder, video game addiction, and problematic Internet use) in adolescents and emerging adults. The study also aimed to examine gender differences for such predictors. Methods: The sample comprised 472 students aged 13-21 years recruited from high schools and vocational education centers. Results: Findings demonstrated that emotion regulation was predictive of all addictive behaviors assessed in this study (alcohol and drug abuse, gambling disorder, video game addiction, and problematic Internet use), whereas attachment predicted non-substance-related addictions (gambling disorder, video game addiction, and problematic Internet use). In addition, gender differences were found, with females scoring significantly higher in maternal and peer attachment, whereas males scored significantly higher in gambling disorder and video game addiction. Conclusion: The findings may be useful for preventive and clinical interventions conducted with youth regarding addictive behaviors.

AB Coping plays a central role in the appearance and persistence of pathological gambling. Anxious and depressive symptomatology also influence pathological gambling and are related to coping. This study aimed to analyze pathological gamblers' coping strategies and styles, as well as associated anxious and depressive symptomatology. The study sample included 167 male pathological gamblers (mean age = 39.29 years) and 107 non-gamblers (mean age = 33.43 years). Measures of gambling, coping, and anxious and depressive symptomatology were used. Results showed that pathological gamblers' scored higher in all the maladaptive coping strategies, problem- and emotion-focused disengagement, and disengagement subscales. These subscales also correlated with pathological gambling, and anxious and depressive symptomatology. Pathological gamblers also scored higher in emotional expression and emotion-focused engagement, with no differences in the rest of the adaptive coping strategies. Coping was also found to predict pathological gambling and anxious and depressive symptomatology. It was found that coping mediated the relationship between pathological gambling and anxious symptomatology when controlling for the effect of age. Specifically, social withdrawal and disengagement stood out as mediators. These results provide practical information for use in clinical settings with people diagnosed with pathological gambling.

AB High rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and elevated levels of aggression are common among youth in inpatient psychiatric settings. Several models link trauma exposure to aggression through anomalous mental state reasoning. Some theoretical frameworks linking trauma to aggression specify that the over-attribution of hostile mental states contributes to the development of aggressive behavior whereas other theories suggest that an inhibition of mental state reasoning leads to aggressive behavior. Using a sample of inpatient adolescents, the current study examined relations between PTSD symptoms and four forms of aggression, exploring the role of both over- and under-mentalizing (i.e., hypo- and hypermentalizing) as mediators and gender as a moderator. The results suggest that hypermentalizing, but not hypomentalizing, mediates the relation between trauma and aggression, extending prior research related to inpatient adolescents for the first time. Evidence of moderated mediation was noted, such that this mediational relation was evident for females but not males. The current study offers support for differential underlying causes of aggression among males and females with PTSD symptoms.

AB Maternal emotion dysregulation (ED) plays a crucial role in the development of psychopathology in children. The current study aimed to investigate parenting stress as a mediator of the relationship between maternal emotion dysregulation and child startle potentiation, with child sex as a moderator. Mothers were interviewed to obtain self-report of maternal ED and parenting stress and child's dark-enhanced startle (DES) response was measured using electromyographic recordings of the eye-blink muscle during the delivery of acoustic probes. We found that maternal ED was positively correlated with both her parenting stress and her child's DES. A bootstrap analysis yielded a full mediation of the association between ED and child DES via parenting stress. Child sex was not a significant moderator of these relationships. These results suggest that maternal ED has important consequences for the intergenerational transmission of risk and also highlight the interaction of behavioral and biological mechanisms of risk.

AB Purpose Binge eating is a significant concern among college age women-both Caucasian and African-American women. Research has shown that social support, coping, and optimism are associated with engaging in fewer negative health behaviors including binge eating among college students. However, the impact of sources of social support (i.e., support from family, friends, and a special person), rumination, and optimism on binge eating as a function of race/ethnicity has received less attention. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between social support, rumination, and optimism and binge eating among Caucasian and American-American women, separately.
   Method Caucasian (n = 100) and African-American (n = 84) women from a university in the Mid-Atlantic US completed an online survey about eating behaviors and psychosocial health.
   Results Social support from friends was associated with less likelihood of binge eating among Caucasian women. Social support from family was associated with less likelihood of binge eating among African-American women, but greater likelihood of binge eating among Caucasian women. Rumination was associated with greater likelihood of binge eating among Caucasian and African-American women. Optimism was associated with less likelihood of binge eating among African-American women.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate similarities and differences in correlates of binge eating as a function of race/ethnicity.

AB Despite an increasing number of studies, there is still a lack of knowledge about the unique features that underlie the process in equine assisted social work (EASW). This study aimed to reveal, through qualitative methods, the dyads within the triad that become stronger during the process of EASW, as well as the effect of the participation of the horse on the relationship between the counselor and client. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with nine female self-harming clients aged 15-21 years and eight staff members. The interviews, together with video-recorded human-horse interactions with three staff members and four clients were analyzed, resulting in additional issues answered by these three staff members and four clients in a second interview. Critical dialogues between patterns and fragmentations in the narratives and video-recordings, as well as a dialogue with the participants while they were viewing videos of their own EASW sessions, led to the conclusion that adding a horse qualitatively changes therapeutic relationships in EASW. The different triads consist of different liaisons between actors in the triad, giving rise to unique combinations. The quality of the relationships depends on both the staff and the clients' attachment orientations. Further research is needed to investigate how the degree of emotional connection to the horse affects the impact that horses have on triads in EASW.

AB A study was designed with the aim of identifying different profiles of emotional regulation in a sample of university students, and analysing the differences among the identified profiles in relation to stressors perception and psychophysiological stress responses.
   The participants were 504 Spanish physiotherapy students (74% women), with a mean age of 21.06 +/- 3.74 years old, which answered the Difficulty Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the Academic Stress Questionnaire (stressors scale [ECEA] and response scale [RCEA]).
   Based on Cluster analysis, three emotional regulation profiles were identified: students with high emotional regulation profile, students with low emotional regulation profile and students with low emotional regulation but high scores in emotional attention profile.
   The results indicated statistically significant differences between the emotional regulation profiles in stress appraisals and psychophysiological responses. Succinctly, students with high emotional regulation profile perceived academic environment as less threatening and showed lesser scores in stress responses. Students with low emotional regulation profile and low emotional regulation but high emotional attention profile showed similar scores, with the exception of sleep disorders. Briefly, physiotherapy students who had higher scores on emotional control and acceptance, perceived the academic setting in a more adaptive way and reported fewer stress responses.

AB We measured skin conductance response (SCR) to escalating levels of a direct social threat from a novel, ecologically-relevant experimental paradigm, the Intruder Threat Task. We simultaneously evaluated the contribution of social symptom severity and behavioral movement. Children with AS group showed less psychophysiological reactivity to social threat than controls across all three phases of the experiment. In the AS group, greater social impairment was significantly associated with reduced SCR. However, movement activity predicted SCR while diagnosis did not. Research and treatment need to account for the complex interplay of emotional reactivity and social behavior in AS. Psychophysiology studies of AS should consider the impact of possible confounds such as movement.

AB Parent-adolescent conflict poses risk for youth maladjustment. One potential mechanism of this risk is that stress in the form of increased arousal during conflict interactions results in adolescents' impaired decision-making. However, eliciting consistent adolescent stress responses within laboratory-based tasks of parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., conflict discussion tasks) is hindered by task design. This limitation may stem from how conflict topics are assessed and selected for discussion. Within a sample of 47 adolescents (ages 14-17) and parents, we investigated whether a modified version of a conflict discussion task could elicit physiological (i.e., arousal) and behavioral (i.e., hostility) displays of adolescents' conflict-related stress responses. We assessed parent-adolescent conflict via structured interview to identify topics for dyads to discuss during the task. We randomly assigned dyads to complete a 5-min task to discuss either a putatively benign topic (i.e., control condition) or a conflict topic while undergoing direct assessments of continuous arousal. Trained raters coded dyad members' hostile behavior during the task. Adolescents in the conflict condition exhibited significantly greater levels of arousal than adolescents in the control condition. We observed an interaction between discussion condition and baseline conflict. Specifically, higher baseline conflict predicted greater hostile behavior for adolescents in the conflict condition, yet we observed the inverse relation for adolescents in the control condition. Our modified laboratory discussion task successfully elicited both physiological and behavioral displays of adolescent conflict-related stress. These findings have important implications for leveraging experimental paradigms to understand causal links between parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent psychopathology, and their underlying mechanisms.

AB Mental health promotion in schools is a key priority for national governments. The aim of this meta-aggregation is to synthesise the findings from universal, depression and/or anxiety, cognitive behavioural therapy and/or interpersonal therapy-based, programmes implemented in schools, which are focused on reducing depression and anxiety in student populations aged 8-17 years. Electronic databases were searched for published original qualitative studies which assess students' perceptions and experiences from participating in universal, school-based, depression and/or anxiety, prevention programmes. Extraction and synthesis of findings were assisted by NVivo qualitative data analysis software. The Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI QARI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Interpretative and Critical Research was used for assessing methodological quality of the included studies. The confidence of synthesised qualitative findings (ConQual) approach was followed for assessing the confidence in the estimates of syntheses output. Five studies from Australia, Sweden, and UK met the inclusion criteria. Modification in the structure and mode of implementation of universal prevention programmes is required in order to enhance programmes' applicability and impact. The study provides key practical recommendations to stakeholders and policy makers about the content, delivery, and implementation of school-based, universal, prevention programmes.

AB Purpose of Review This review aims to synthesize the most recent research on anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and discuss the relationship between these conditions and challenges for assessment. Furthermore, implications for treatment and future directions are discussed. Recent Findings Research suggests that anxiety disorders and OCD are highly prevalent in individuals with ASD. However, the significant overlap of ASD features with anxiety and OCD symptomology makes differential diagnosis of these disorders particularly challenging. Though several treatments for anxiety have been adapted for youth with ASD (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy), pharmacological treatments and treatments for adults are still marked undeveloped.
   Summary Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and OCD in ASD and some recent advances in assessment and treatment, research is needed to clarify the multifaceted relationship of these conditions and develop tailored assessment and treatment approaches appropriate for a full range of individuals with ASD.

AB The purpose of the study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Cyberbullying Test. The sample included 3,026 participants from the Basque Country (northern Spain), aged 12 to 18 years. Results confirmed high internal consistency and moderate temporal stability. Exploratory factor analysis yielded three moderately correlated factors (cyberobserver, cyberaggressor, and cybervictim). Confirmatory factor analysis ratified adequate model fit of the three factors. Convergent and discriminant validity were confirmed: (a) cybervictims use a variety of conflict resolution strategies, scoring high in neuroticism, openness, antisocial behavior, emotional attention, school-academic problems, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological disorders, anxiety, and psychosomatic complaints, and low in agreeableness, responsibility, self-esteem, and social adjustment and (b) cyberaggressors use many aggressive conflict resolution strategies, scoring high in neuroticism, antisocial behavior, school-academic problems, psychopathological and psychosomatic disorders, and low in empathy, agreeableness, responsibility, emotion regulation, and social adjustment. The study confirms the test's reliability and validity.

AB Research has shown a link between emotion regulation (ER) repertoire, the range of ER strategies an individual employs and the degree to which they rely on them, and well-being. However, this advancement is hindered by the lack of a single measurement tool capable of assessing multiple ER strategies on a common scale. The current paper reports on two studies utilizing the Regulation of Emotion Systems Survey (RESS), a new self-report measure allowing for variable- and person-centered analyses of six common ER strategies (Distraction, Rumination, Reappraisal, Suppression, Engagement, Arousal Control). Study 1 (n = 1582) included scale development, validation, and Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). Results showed the RESS is a valid, reliable, and effective measure. Three profiles were identified (Average, Suppression Propensity, Engagement Propensity). The Average group reported greater psychosocial functioning than the Suppression group. Study 2 (n = 100) LPA indicated 4 profiles (Average, Suppression Propensity, Engagement Propensity, Multi-strategy) and assessed the effects of emotionality. The Average group reported lower emotional awareness than the Engagement and Multi-Strategy groups. Profiles did not differ on frequency or intensity of emotions. Findings demonstrated the utility of the RESS and confirm the importance of ER repertoires to better understand connections between ER and well-being. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood neurodevelopmental disorder. Difficulties in the areas of emotion regulation and empathy were found in prior studies. Mother child attachment is important in the development of emotion regulation and empathy. We aimed to examine the relation emotional regulation and empathy skills in children with ADHD and emotion regulation and attachment properties in their mothers and to compare with healthy controls. Methods: The study group consisted of 61 children (8-12 years old) diagnosed with ADHD. The control group (87 children) comprised patients of other clinics at hospital and was matched for gender and age to the ADHD patients. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was used to diagnose ADHD and allowed comorbidities. We evaluated disorder severity at the time of assessment using the DuPaul Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale. All patients were treatment-naive. Emotional Regulation Checklist (ERC) and KA-SI empathy scale were used to examine children emotional regulation and empathy. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to indicate maternal emotional dysregulation status and Experiences in Close Relationship Scale-II was used to evaluate attachment properties in mothers. Results: Children with ADHD had statistical significant lower scores in the areas of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, total empathy score and emotion regulation and cases had statistical significant higher scores in emotion lability. Mothers of children with ADHD had higher scores in anxious and avoidant attachment styles and all subscales of DERS. The correlation between, ADHD symptoms, KA-SI Empathy, ERC, Attachment Scale, and DERS was evaluated by Pearson's correlation analysis. Negative correlation was found between both attention deficit and hyperactivity scores of Du Paul scale and affective, cognitive empathy scores of KA-SI Emphatic Tendency Scale and emotion regulation scores of ERC; a positive correlation was determined between attention deficit and hyperactivity scores of Du Paul scale, mothers' anxious and avoidant attachment andDERS total scores, and emotional lability scores of ERC. Discussion: Mother-child attachment and maternal emotion regulation skills have important roles in the emotion regulation and empathy skills of children. Better understanding of neuropsychologic development process of attachment, empathy and emotion regulation skills and their relations with each other may contribute to the treatment of children with ADHD.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the reciprocal relations between experiential avoidance, stressor, and psychological stress response (which consist of anger, depression, anxiety, helplessness, and physical complaints). In this study, 688 Japanese junior high school students (353 boys, 334 girls, 1 unidentified; mean age 13.28 years) completed three waves of questionnaires on experiential avoidance, stressor, and psychological stress response, with one-week intervals between measurement waves. Results from cross-lagged panel analyses showed that experiential avoidance predicted subsequent stressor and psychological stress response. Furthermore, the stressor and psychological stress response influenced by prior experiential avoidance affected subsequent occurrence of experiential avoidance. The findings suggest that reciprocal relations exist among the variables, and that the interaction between experiential avoidance and psychological stress was possible in adolescents.

AB Background: A recent review highlighted important relationships between combinations of movement behaviours (i.e., sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity) and health indicators among school-aged children and youth (aged 5-17 years). It is unclear whether similar relationships exist in younger children. Therefore, this review sought to examine the relationships between combinations of movement behaviours and health indicators in the early years (1.00 month to 4.99 years).
   Methods: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus were searched for relevant studies up to November 2016, with no date or study design limits. Included studies met the a priori-determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1.00 month to 4.99 years), intervention (combination of >= 2 movement behaviours [ i.e., sleep and sedentary behaviour; sleep and physical activity; sedentary behaviour and physical activity; and sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity]), comparator (various levels and combinations of movement behaviours), and health outcome/indicator (Critical: adiposity, motor development, psychosocial health/emotional regulation, cognitive development, fitness, and growth; Important: bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, and risks). For each health indicator, quality of evidence was assessed by study design using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
   Results: Ten articles (n = 7436 participants; n = 5 countries) were included. Across observational and experimental study designs, the most ideal combinations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity were: favourably associated with motor development and fitness among preschool-aged children (3.00 to 4.99 years); both favourably and not associated with adiposity among toddlers (1.10 to 2.99 years) and preschool-aged children; and not associated with growth among toddlers and preschool-aged children. The most ideal combinations of sleep and sedentary behaviour were favourably associated with adiposity among infants (1.00 month to 1.00 years) and toddlers. Quality of evidence ranged from "very low" to "moderate".
   Conclusions: The most ideal combinations of movement behaviours (e.g., high sleep, low sedentary behaviour, high physical activity) may be important for optimal health in the early years. Findings can help inform movement behaviour guidelines for the early years. Given the limited evidence, future research is needed to determine the ideal distribution of daily movement behaviours for optimal health throughout the early years.

AB Earlier research has identified a remarkable number of related factors to resilience during adolescence. Historically, theoretical treatments of resilience have been focused almost exclusively on psychosocial levels of analysis to derive explanatory models. However, there is insufficient understanding of the role of emotion regulation explaining competent functioning despite the experience of adversity (resilience), especially during adolescence. This study explores the relationship between both, emotional regulation abilities and strategies, and resilience in a sample of adolescents from suburbs high-schools (Jerez de la Frontera, Spain). The study also examines how using different emotional regulation strategies may help the development of resilience levels at this stage. Participants of the study were 164 adolescents ranging from 13 to 16 years old (M = 13.98; SD = 0.66). Emotion regulation was measured using the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ, Garnefski et al., 2001), and sections D and H of Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, a performance test (Emotion Regulation Ability sections, MSCEIT, Spanish version, Mayer et al., 2003). Resilience was evaluated with ERE (Educative Resilience Scale for children and adolescents, Saavedra and Castro, 2009). Verbal Intelligence (Yuste, 1997) and personality traits (Cattell and Cattell, 1986) were assessed as two independent variables. Results supported the idea that emotion regulation ability (MSCEIT, D and H sections, Extremera et al., 2006) is a significant predictor of adolescents' resilience. Moreover, cognitive regulation strategies, such as positive reappraisal, predicted perceived resilience among students. Sociability (A factor of HSPQ, sociability) also correlated with resilience levels. Hence, these results are promising, implying that emotion regulation ability may act as a helpful tool preventing adolescents from irrational risky behaviors, commonly assumed at this developmental stage.

AB Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is the direct deliberate destruction of bodily tissue, which is not socially sanctioned, and occurs without suicidal intent. NSSI is a common behaviour among young people within Aotearoa New Zealand, and internationally. About one-third to half of secondary school students have engaged in NSSI (Wilson et al., 2016; Garisch & Wilson, 2010), and whilst the figure among adolescents who attend mental health services in New Zealand remains unknown it is likely to be considerably higher. In spite of being a common behavioural concern among mental health clients, there is little empirical research on effective treatment. In particular, there is a paucity of research into effective treatment of adolescent NSSI; a gap that requires remedy given the high prevalence of NSSI and its association with many subsequent maladaptive outcomes, including suicide. The current paper provides background information on NSSI, information on the assessment of NSSI such as what to include in an assessment interview and possible psychometric instruments, and outlines common strategies and challenges in treatment with adolescents.

AB Objective. This study is a secondary analysis of outcomes examining risk behavior in the context of the naturalistic occurrence of parental monitoring and participation in an emotion regulation intervention over a 12-month period. Method: Early adolescents with mental health symptoms (N=420), ages 12-14 years, were recruited and randomized into either an Emotional Regulation (ER) or Health Promotion (HP) condition. Assessments included adolescent self-report of unsupervised time, substance use and sexual behavior at baseline, 6-months, and one year post-intervention. Analytic groups were formed by intervention condition (ER or HP) and baseline reports of unsupervised time (<= 1 x per week or >1 x per week of unsupervised time with opposite sex peers) resulting in a total of four groups. Logistic regression and time-to-event analyses were used to test differences in substance use and delay of sexual initiation between the groups. Results: Participation in the ER intervention in the presence of low unsupervised time was superior in reducing both substance use and sexual initiation than either factor alone; and either factor alone was more effective than the absence of both. Conclusion: Findings suggest that interventions targeting health risk behaviors, including substance use and sexual risk behavior, among early adolescents with mental health symptoms may be more effective when targeting both internal (e.g., emotional regulation) and external (e.g., unsupervised time spent with peers) protective factors. Limiting unsupervised time spent with peers through parental monitoring may serve to scaffold and reinforce early adolescent acquisition of effective emotion regulation which can be employed during emotionally arousing risk situations.

AB Background: Previous studies reported a high prevalence of depression among patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggested a relationship between ASD and suicidality. However, whether ASD independently increases the risk of attempted suicide regardless of depression has not been determined.
   Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5,618 adolescents aged 12-17 years and young adults aged 18-29 years with ASD (ICD-9-CM code: 299) and 22,472 age-and sex-matched controls were enrolled between 2001 and 2009 and followed to the end of 2011. Any suicide attempt was identified during the follow-up period.
   Results: Patients with ASD had a higher incidence of suicide attempts (3.9% vs 0.7%, P<.001) than did those without ASD. Both adolescents (HR = 5.79; 95% CI, 3.98-8.41) and young adults (HR = 5.38; 95% CI, 3.58-8.06) with ASD were more likely to attempt suicide in later life after adjusting for demographic data and psychiatric comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses after excluding the first year (HR = 4.52; 95% CI, 3.39-6.03) or first 3 years (HR = 3.36; 95% CI, 2.40-4.70) of observation showed consistent findings.
   Conclusions: Patients with ASD had an increased risk of suicide attempts compared with those without ASD. ASD was an independent risk factor of attempted suicide. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying pathophysiology between ASD and suicidality and to elucidate whether prompt intervention for ASD may reduce this risk.

TI Successes and challenges in developing trauma-informed child welfare
   systems: A real-world case study of exploration and initial

SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; OUTCOMES; MODEL; FRAMEWORKS; CARE
AB Trauma and behavioral health problems among children in foster care are significant and prevalent, affecting their well-being and permanency. Despite the wide scope and magnitude of social and emotional problems among youth in out-of-home care, few child welfare systems have an integrated service response into their routine procedures and practices. This paper describes three federally-funded statewide demonstration sites, which represent northeast, south, and Midwest regions of the U.S., and that aimed to implement trauma and evidence-informed initiatives. Applying implementation science frameworks, we share our experiences with three key stages of implementation: exploration, installation, and initial implementation. During the exploration stage, each state engaged community stakeholders in a comprehensive data mining process to define the needs of children in care and relevant gaps in the evidence-informed service array. To respond to trauma and behavioral health needs of children, these states' initiatives established implementation plans for screening, functional assessment, data-driven case planning, ongoing progress monitoring, and service array reconfiguration. Each state's distinct installation and initial implementation experiences are described as well their shared successes and challenges. While vast differences existed within the administrative and policy context of these three states, the study demonstrates both unique and common experiences of successes and setbacks. Across the exploration, installation, and initial implementation, these analyses revealed six themes of common successes to include collaboration, building consensus, conducting trainings, teaming, optimizing opportunity, and establishing data systems. Additionally, nine themes of common challenges were workforce, turf, client voice, data sharing, coaching and support for fidelity, time, competing priorities, momentum, and policies and leadership. Implications for practice, policy, and future research are discussed.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate the effectiveness of psychological therapy in reducing psychological distress for adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) and co-morbid mental health conditions in routine clinical practice. To explore the effect of individual characteristics and service factors on change in general distress.
   MethodIn a specialist psychological therapies service for adults with ASC, the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) self-report questionnaire of psychological distress is completed by clients at start and end of therapy. Change over time and reliable and clinical change was assessed for 81 of a total of 122 clients (66.4%). Factors which may influence change over time were explored using available clinical information.
   ResultsOverall, there was a significant reduction in CORE-OM score during therapy with a small effect size. Most clients showed an improvement in psychological distress over therapy (75.4% improved, with 36.9% of these showing reliable changes). Significant and comparable reductions from pre-therapy to post-therapy were seen across the sample, showing that individual differences did not mediate therapy effectiveness. CORE-OM scores mediate the association between age of ASD diagnosis and hours of therapeutic input required, with greater age at diagnosis and higher distress associated with longer therapy duration.
   ConclusionsOur preliminary findings suggest that psychological therapy may be effective in reducing general distress for clients with ASC and co-morbid mental health conditions and should be routinely offered. Individuals who are diagnosed with ASD in adulthood are likely to require a longer course of therapy when their general distress scores are high.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the link between neighborhood risk and adolescent antisocial behavior and whether this association was moderated by parent and peer relationships and characteristics. We also explored whether the moderating effects varied by age. The sample consisted of 206 adolescents (ages 10-18 years) from predominantly low-income, ethnic minority families. Results indicated that high levels of neighborhood violence and neighborhood danger were significantly related to high levels of antisocial behavior. The findings also showed that high levels of peer (but not parent) prosocial behavior and emotion regulation attenuated the links between neighborhood violence and antisocial behavior. Moreover, parent-adolescent (but not peer-adolescent) relationship quality served as a protective factor in the face of neighborhood violence and danger. In addition, little evidence of age differences in the moderating effects of parents and peers was found. Implications regarding the role of interpersonal relationships in the context of risk are discussed.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate whether response to lithium treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder can be predicted by changes in white matter microstructure in key cortico-limbic tracts involved in emotion regulation.
   MethodsEighteen clinically referred lithium-naive patients (mean age 15.5years) were administered clinical rating scales and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examinations at baseline and following 4weeks of lithium treatment. Clinical ratings were repeated following 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) ratings of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were classified as responders. Ten healthy volunteers received baseline and follow-up DTI examinations. Using the ENIGMA pipeline, we investigated the relationship between changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum hippocampus (CGH) and clinical response to lithium.
   ResultsPatients demonstrated significantly lower FA compared to healthy volunteers in the left and right CGH white matter at baseline. Following 4weeks of lithium treatment, FA in the left CGH increased in patients, but no significant changes in FA were observed among the untreated healthy volunteers. Lithium responders had a significantly greater increase in FA compared to non-responders. Moreover, baseline (pre-treatment) FA in the left CGH white matter significantly predicted week 8 overall CGI severity score, with post hoc analyses indicating that these effects were evident for both severity of depression and mania.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that response to lithium treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder is associated with normalization of white matter microstructure in regions associated with emotion processing.

TI Indicators of poorly controlled asthma and health-related quality of

SO ALLERGY AND ASTHMA PROCEEDINGS
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTCOMES; ADOLESCENTS; BURDEN
AB Background: Poorly controlled asthma has far-reaching effects on school-age children and their parents, but little is known about the national impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Objective: To examine HRQoL associated with asthma and indicators of poorly controlled asthma in the United States.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of HRQoL among school-age children (age range, 6-17 years) with asthma in the nationally representative 2007-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Indicators of poor asthma control included the following: exacerbation in the previous 12 months, use of more than three canisters of short-acting beta agonist in 3 months, and annual asthma-specific emergency department or inpatient visits. Health status and HRQoL instruments included the following: the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS), Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener (CSHCN), and self-perceived physical and mental health. Ordered logistic regression was used for ordered categorical variables, and logistic regression was used for binary variables. All regressions controlled for sociodemographics and other covariates.
   Results: There were 44,320 school-age children in the MEPS, of whom 5890 had asthma. School-age children with indicators of poorly controlled asthma had higher odds of feeling unhappy and/or sad or nervous and/or afraid, and of having problems with sports and/or hobbies and schoolwork on the CIS. Results from the CHQ showed that parents of school-age children with asthma and indicators of poorly controlled asthma had higher odds of worrying about their child's health and future. Results from the CSHCN showed that school-age children with asthma and indicators of poorly controlled asthma were more likely to have special health care needs. School-age children with asthma and indicators of poorly controlled asthma had higher odds of having poor perceived physical health.
   Conclusion: This nationally representative study provided novel information on the burden of poorly controlled asthma on emotional problems, school-related and activity limitations, general health status, and worry among school-age children and their families as measured by validated instruments.

AB Parenting interventions can reduce child maltreatment and improve child outcomes in high-risk settings, but little is known about mechanisms underlying effects. This study presents qualitative findings on mechanisms of change from a randomized trial of a parenting intervention in Liberia. Participants (N = 30) completed semi-structured interviews, and thematic content analysis was conducted from transcripts. Results suggest that learning about effects of violence on child development and discussing the value of empathy for children strengthened caregivers' sense of identity as nurturers and protectors. This in turn drove efforts to decrease harsh discipline. As a result, children expressed less fear, increasing opportunities for positive interactions; shared enjoyment maintained reduced harsh treatment. Caregivers also described recognizing that physical punishment was often ineffective and using new nonviolent discipline skills alongside emotion regulation skills to facilitate behavior change. Participants also described reduced couples conflict and more peaceful home environments associated with increased self-identification as role models.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly present with difficulty regulating negative emotions, which has been found to impact their behavioral and mental health. Little research has documented the strategies that children with ASD use to regulate their emotion to understand whether they use qualitatively different strategies to children without ASD, whether these are developmentally delayed, or both. Forty-four children with ASD and 29 typically-developing children (2-4 years) were given tasks designed to mimic everyday life experiences requiring children to manage low-level stress (e.g., waiting for a snack) and children's emotion regulation strategies were coded. Parents reported on their child's mental health, wellbeing, and self-development. The results suggest differences in using emotion regulation strategies in children with ASD, reflecting a delay, rather than a deviance when compared to those used by children without ASD. Only children with ASD relied on their family members for physical and communicative soothing; the typically developing children relied on people outside of their family for help regulating their emotion. More frequent approach/less frequent avoidance was related to a higher self-evaluation in both groups, but was only additionally related to higher self-recognition and autonomy in the ASD group. These findings help to identify important emotion regulation intervention targets for this population, including supporting communication with people outside of the family and independence. Autism Res2017, 10: 1808-1822. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
   Lay SummaryResults suggest that children with autism had more difficulty using communication strategies to manage stress only with people outside the family; they used these strategies with family members as often as children without autism. For all children, more task approach/less avoidance was related to children's higher self-evaluation. These findings suggest targeting communication with people outside of the family and personality development as appropriate intervention goals.

AB Objective: Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is a widespread phenomenon among adolescent psychiatric inpatients. It is also reported among delinquent adolescents detained in correctional facilities. While previous studies have addressed different functions of SIB within offender populations, here we investigate particular patterns of borderline personality pathology and psychopathology underlying SIB in both adolescent psychiatric inpatients and detainees. Method: Adolescent psychiatric inpatients and detainees were recruited consecutively. Participants completed self-reports on SIB, suicidal thoughts and behavior, borderline personality pathology, and general psychopathology. Predictors of lifetime SIB by group were analyzed. Results: Psychiatric inpatients (n = 77) and detainees (n = 50) did not differ with respect to lifetime SIB (57.14% versus 54.00%), whereas SIB within the past year did (67.53% versus 14 %; chi 2((1)) = 6.158, p = .013). Psychiatric inpatients reported greater emotional problems (t((125)) = 5.109, p < .0001) and greater borderline personality pathology. Those with lifetime SIB were characterized by greater emotional problems and borderline personality pathology, independent of their group. Results from regression analyses suggest no group-specific predictors of lifetime SIB. Conclusions: Although psychiatric inpatients endorse greater psychopathological distress, lifetime SIB among adolescent psychiatric inpatients and detainees is associated with similar patterns of psychopathology and borderline personality pathology.

AB OBJECTIVE: Peer victimization is a common antecedent of poor social and emotional adjustment. Its relationship with objectively measured academic performance is unclear. In this study we aimed to quantify the cross-sectional associations between peer victimization and academic performance in a large population sample of children.
   METHODS: Eight-to 9-year-old children were recruited from a stratified random sample of primary schools in Australia. Academic performance was measured on a national achievement test (1 year of learning equals 40 points). Physical and verbal victimization were measured according to child self-report.
   RESULTS: Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analyses were conducted. For female children, verbal victimization was associated with poorer academic performance on writing (beta = 17.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.2 to 6.2) and grammar/punctuation (beta = 20.8; 95% CI, 40.1 to 1.6). Physical victimization was associated with poorer performance on numeracy (male children: = 29.0; 95% CI, 53.8 to 4.1; female children: beta = 30.1; 95% CI, 56.6 to 3.5), and writing (female children: beta = -21.5; 95% CI, 40.4 to -2.7). Verbal and physical victimization were associated with poorer performance on reading (male children: beta = -31.5; 95% CI, -59.9 to -3.1; female children: beta = -30.2; 95% CI, -58.6 to -1.8), writing (female children: beta = 25.5; 95% CI, 4-2.8 to -8.2), spelling (female children: beta = -32.3; 95% CI, -59.6 to -4.9), and grammar/punctuation (female children: beta = -32.2; 95% CI, -62.4 to -2.0).
   CONCLUSIONS: Children who were physically victimized were 6 to 9 months behind their non-victimized peers on measures of academic performance. There are growing reasons for education systems to invest in the prevention of bullying and promotion of positive peer relationships from the earliest years of school.

AB The present investigation examined the role of anxiety symptom severity in the relation between emotional nonacceptance and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed adolescents admitted for acute psychiatric care at an inpatient state hospital (N = 50; 52.0% women; 44% white; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [0.51] years; range, 12-17 years). Anxiety symptom severity partially accounted for the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD total symptoms, and fully accounted for the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD symptom cluster severity, even after controlling for covariates. Reverse model testing provided confidence in the direction of hypothesized effects. These findings add to a body of literature underscoring the detrimental effect of nonaccepting reactions to negative emotions in the context of PTSD and provide preliminary support for a possible underlying role of anxiety symptom severity in the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD symptoms.

AB Self-harm refers to the purposeful destruction of bodily tissue without suicidal intention and for purposes that are not socially sanctioned. Little is known about the associations between a history of self-harm, mood symptoms, and functioning in adults with different types of mood disorders. Lifetime histories of self-harm, current mood symptoms, global functioning, and affective traits were collected on 142 adults with mood disorders. The prevalence of lifetime self-harm was higher in patients with bipolar disorder compared with patients with a unipolar depressive disorder. Self-harm was also more strongly linked to impulsivity in individuals with bipolar disorder compared with unipolar depressive disorder. Across both diagnoses, histories of self-harm were related to lower levels of current global functioning, more severe depressive symptoms, and high self-reported emotional dysregulation and neuroticism. Findings indicate that self-harm is a potent prognostic variable for symptoms, global functioning, and personality functioning in individuals with mood disorders.

AB While most research on the development of antisocial and criminal behavior has considered nonviolent and violent crime together, some evidence points to differential risk factors for these separate types of crime. The present study explored differential risk for nonviolent and violent crime by investigating the longitudinal associations between three key child risk factors (aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation) and two key adolescent risk factors (parent detachment and deviant peer affiliation) predicting violent and nonviolent crime outcomes in early adulthood. Data on 754 participants (46% African American, 50% European American, 4% other; 58% male) oversampled for aggressive-disruptive behavior were collected across three time points. Parents and teachers rated aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation in fifth grade (middle childhood, age 10-11); parents and youth rated parent detachment and deviant peer affiliation in seventh and eighth grade (early adolescence, age 12-14) and arrest data were collected when participants were 22-23 years old (early adulthood). Different pathways to violent and nonviolent crime emerged. The severity of child dysfunction in late childhood, including aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation, was a powerful and direct predictor of violent crime. Although child dysfunction also predicted nonviolent crime, the direct pathway accounted for half as much variance as the direct pathway to violent crime. Significant indirect pathways through adolescent socialization experiences (peer deviancy) emerged for nonviolent crime, but not for violent crime, suggesting adolescent socialization plays a more distinctive role in predicting nonviolent than violent crime. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This article considers an integrative approach to individual music therapy with a primary aged child with conduct difficulties. A synopsis of music therapy literature with this population is given, potential social and cultural influences are discussed and the complexities surrounding possible diagnosis are explored. Presenting behaviours are considered in light of the impact of the attachment relationship on regulation. A case study explores how consideration of a child's capacity to symbolise can support the development of play, musical play and emotional regulation.

AB BackgroundThe link between types and severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and trait emotional intelligence (TEI) is still underinvestigated, especially in children. We aimed to examine the relationship between TEI and ADHD symptoms in a sample of Egyptian children.
   MethodThe study included 50 children with ADHD, who were compared on the basis of their TEI and contrasted with 25 matched healthy controls. They were subjected to the Arabic version of the following scales: Connors scale 3rd edition, parent rating form, Kiddie-Schedule for affective disorders and Schizophrenia present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), Stanford Binet intelligence scale, 4th edition and Trait Emotional Intelligence Child form (TEI) and a semistructured clinical data sheet for sociodemographic data.
   ResultsUsing TEI scale, the control group was shown to have higher scores in TEI than cases, there was a high significant difference with regards to eight of nine TEI facets together with the TEI global score. Moreover, the control group significantly outperformed ADHD children with mixed and hyperactive subtypes on TEI global score in all facets except for adaptability. Meanwhile, the inattentive group performed significantly poorer than those in the control group on TEI global score, adaptability, emotional expression, self-motivation and emotion regulation facets. Trait Emotional Intelligence was negatively correlated with four of ADHD symptom groups assessed by Connors test, namely; impulsivity, cognitive, social problem, and emotional liability symptoms. However, Impulsivity was negatively correlated with all the domains of TEI except for adaptability and emotional expression. On the other hand, oppositional symptoms did not show a significant correlation with any of the TEI facets.
   ConclusionsTrait emotional intelligence is highly impaired in children with ADHD and emotional deficits are corner stone features of that disorder, low impulsivity facet of TEI is highly correlated with social problems and poor peer relations.

AB A multiperspective approach is beneficial for obtaining reliable and multifaceted pictures of child behaviour problems. The goal of the present study is to examine interrater agreement on school-based effort avoidance between children receiving child welfare services, parents, and social workers. Given previous findings, interrater agreement is expected to be low. Self-reported data on school-based effort avoidance were gathered for children and adolescents in child welfare services. Additionally, social workers (using the Teacher-Report Checklist for social and learning behaviour) and parents (using the parallel version of the self-rating questionnaire on school-based effort avoidance) were asked to complete an external assessment tool to compare children's perspectives with the ratings of significant adults. The results confirmed significant discrepancies between parents' and children's ratings on effort avoidance tendencies. Furthermore, there were only small to moderate correlations between children's self-ratings and the adults' assessments; however, the consensus between adults was higher than the interrater agreement between children and social workers. Discrepancies in ratings from multiple informants underline the importance of integrating multiple perspectives, especially children's perspectives, in the diagnostic process in order to plan and adapt appropriate care and treatment.

AB Background: Originating in the 1960s, the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) comprises a family of instruments for assessing problems and strengths for ages 11/2-90+ years.
   Purpose: To provide an overview of the ASEBA, related research, and future directions for empirically based assessment and taxonomy.
   Content: Standardized, multi-informant ratings of transdiagnostic dimensions of behavioral, emotional, social, and thought problems are hierarchically scored on narrow-spectrum syndrome scales, broad-spectrum internalizing and externalizing scales, and a total problems (general psychopathology) scale. DSM-oriented and strengths scales are also scored. The instruments and scales have been iteratively developed from assessments of clinical and population samples of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Items, instruments, scales, and norms are tailored to different kinds of informants for ages 11/2-5, 6-18, 18-59, and 60-90+ years. To take account of differences between informants' ratings, parallel instruments are completed by parents, teachers, youths, adult probands, and adult collaterals. Syndromes and Internalizing/Externalizing scales derived from factor analyses of each instrument capture variations in patterns of problems that reflect different informants' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analyses have supported the syndrome structures in dozens of societies. Software displays scale scores in relation to user-selected multicultural norms for the age and gender of the person being assessed, according to ratings by each type of informant. Multicultural norms are derived from population samples in 57 societies on every inhabited continent. Ongoing and future research includes multicultural assessment of elders; advancing transdiagnostic progress and outcomes assessment; and testing higher order structures of psychopathology.

AB Students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are attending postsecondary programs at unprecedented rates. Transitions are especially challenging for students with ASD, yet little is known about critical transitions during the college experience. Using the College Adjustment Program Evaluation Scales (CAPES), we examined student and parent perspectives across five dimensions: Student Life, Emotional Adjustment, Independent Living Skills, Inter personal Relationships, and Self-Advocacy. Sixteen participants-eight students and eight parents, completed the CAPES at the end of fall semester of year one and the end of spring semester year two. Student and parent CAPES ratings were uniformly positive with some differences. We found large effect sizes across dimensions and significant differences in Student Life, Independent Living, and Interpersonal Relationships with parent ratings higher than student ratings. An item analysis revealed specific challenges and skills salient to the results. Implications for supports for students with ASD, higher education practices, and transition research are discussed.

AB The display of antisocial behaviors in children and adolescents has been of interest to criminologists and developmental psychologists for years. Exposure to social adversity is a well-documented predictor of antisocial behavior. Additionally, measures of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, including heart rate variability (HRV), pre-ejection period (PEP), and heart rate, have been associated with antisocial behaviors including rule-breaking and aggression. Social neuroscience research has begun to investigate how neurobiological underpinnings affect the relationship between social adversity and antisocial/psychopathic behavior in children and adolescents. This study investigated the potential mediating effects of ANS activity on the relationship between social adversity and antisocial behavior in a group of 7- to 10-year-old children from the community (N = 339; 48.2% male). Moderated multiple mediation analyses revealed that low resting heart rate, but not PEP or HRV, mediated the relationship between social adversity and antisocial behavior in males only. Social adversity but not ANS measures were associated with antisocial behavior in females. Findings have implications for understanding the neural influences that underlie antisocial behavior, illustrate the importance of the social environment regarding the expression of these behaviors, and highlight essential gender differences.

AB Despite increased depression in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), effective prevention approaches for this population are limited. A mixed methods pilot randomised controlled trial (N = 29) of the evidence-based Resourceful Adolescent Program-Autism Spectrum Disorder (RAP-A-ASD) designed to prevent depression was conducted in schools with adolescents with ASD in years 6 and 7. Quantitative results showed significant intervention effects on parent reports of adolescent coping self-efficacy (maintained at 6 month follow-up) but no effect on depressive symptoms or mental health. Qualitative outcomes reflected perceived improvements from the intervention for adolescents' coping self-efficacy, self-confidence, social skills, and affect regulation. Converging results remain encouraging given this population's difficulties coping with adversity, managing emotions and interacting socially which strongly influence developmental outcomes.

AB Studies have shown that child development is negatively affected by prenatal depression. A dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the pregnant woman, passed to the fetus, is one discussed key mechanism. Studies, investigating primary-school age children, have found effects on antisocial behavior. Effects on internalizing symptoms were not found, but the analysis did not distinguish between anxiety and depression symptoms. Additionally, until now, no objective test data operationalizing social-emotional competencies have been included. The present study examined: 1.Whether the effects on child externalizing symptoms could be replicated; 2. If there are specific effects on child internalizing symptoms, separated for anxiety and depression; and 3. Are child clinical symptoms reflected in reductions in social-emotional competencies. A sample of 61 prenatally depressed and 143 prenatally not-depressed women and their 6-9 year old children were compared, controlling for key confounders in both the perinatal period and in middle childhood. Children of prenatally depressed mothers had more antisocial behavior and depression symptoms reported by their mothers. The prediction of antisocial behavior scores tended to be more significant for boys than for girls. Child anxiety symptoms were primarily explained by current maternal depressive symptoms. Children of prenatally depressed mothers also showed a reduction in social-emotional competencies, specifically regarding the ability to interpret complex social situations. This study showed that, even in a non-clinical sample, there are distinct effects of prenatal depression on child externalizing and internalizing symptoms which are accompanied by reductions in specific social-emotional competencies. These results emphasize that treatment for depressed pregnant women and/or early support for affected families is worthwhile. Additional work is required to identify the underlying biological mechanisms.

AB Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a developmental disorder characterized by serious and persistent social impairment, especially stressful interactions with parents. Although previous studies demonstrated associations between parent mental health and children's ODD symptoms, less attention has been paid to integrating both parent and child risk factors. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the associations among parent emotion regulation, child emotion regulation, parental depression, and child depression in Chinese children with ODD. A total of 234 children with ODD ranging in age from 6 to 13 years, along with their fathers or mothers, completed questionnaires. Results indicated that: (1) Parent emotion regulation, parental depression and child emotion regulation were significantly correlated with children's depressive symptoms. (2) Parent emotion regulation was related to children's depression indirectly through parental depression and child emotion regulation. (3) Child emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between parent emotion regulation and child depression, and also fully mediated the relationship between parental and child depression. These findings highlight the need to improve parent emotion regulation and pay attention to parental mental health, because both risk factors may exacerbate their children's emotion regulation difficulties and further associate the high level of depressive symptoms among children with ODD.

AB Drawing on the cognitive information-processing model of aggression and the general aggression model, we explored why adolescents become addicted to online games and how their immersion in online games affects school violence perpetration (SVP). For this purpose, we conducted statistical analyses on 1,775 elementary and middle school students who resided in northern districts of Seoul, South Korea. The results validated the proposed structural equation model and confirmed the statistical significance of the structural paths from the variables; that is, the paths from child abuse and self-esteem to SVP were significant. The levels of self-esteem and child abuse victimization affected SVP, and this effect was mediated by online game addiction (OGA). Furthermore, a multigroup path analysis showed significant gender differences in the path coefficients of the proposed model, indicating that gender exerted differential effects on adolescents' OGA and SVP. Based on these results, prevention and intervention methods to curb violence in schools have been proposed.

AB Purpose: Violence against children increases in adolescence, but there is a research and practice gap in research-supported child abuse prevention for the adolescent years. A pilot program for low-resource settings was developed in collaboration with nongovernmental organizations, government, and academics in South Africa, using research-supported principles.
   Method: This study used a pre-post design to test initial effects of a 10-session parenting program with 60 participants (30 caregiver-adolescent dyads) in high-poverty rural South Africa. Areas requiring further testing and adaptation were also identified.
   Results: Pre-post findings show medium to large program effects in reducing child abuse and adolescent problem behavior, as well as large effects in improvements of positive parenting, and perceived parent and adolescent social support.
   Discussion: There is potential to reduce child abuse, improve parenting, and reduce adolescent problem behavior in rural South Africa through parenting programs. Further development, testing and longer term follow-up are required to ascertain potential for scale-up.

AB Prosocial behavior involves attempting to improve others' welfare and plays a central role in cooperative social relationships. Among the manifold processes that contribute to prosocial development is the quality of children's attachment to their caregivers. Often, researchers have investigated the link between secure attachment and broad indices of prosociality. Recent theory and research, however, suggest that children's prosocial behavior is multifaceted, with distinct correlates and developmental trajectories characterizing specific prosocial behaviors. We offer a theoretical model of the role of parent-child attachment in the development of prosocial behavior, first broadly, and then with regard to comforting, sharing, and helping, specifically. Further, we review the empirical work on this topic from infancy through adolescence. Overall, evidence supports an association between secure attachment and prosociality, broadly defined, but results vary across comforting, sharing, and helping. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and outline directions for future research examining the role of attachment in shaping the diversity of prosocial behaviors across development.

AB The current study evaluated the effects of preschoolers' attachment status on their awareness concerning emotion regulation strategies. A total of 212 children between 3 and 5 years participated in this study and completed two self-report tasks. The first was the Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT), which assessed children's internal working models concerning parent-child attachment; the second evaluated children's ability to generate emotion regulation strategies in relation to three negative emotions (anger, sadness, and fear). Statistical analyses involved a mixed models multilinear regression approach controlling for age and gender. The results consistently revealed that the insecure avoidant group was significantly less likely than securely attached children to generate both comforting and self-regulatory strategies. Surprisingly, the insecure ambivalent group showed no deficits across measured outcomes. When the analyses were conducted separately for each negative emotion, findings for co-regulatory strategies for fear, and self-regulatory strategies for anger also suggested that avoidantly attached children exhibited the lowest levels of awareness compared with children from the secure attachment group. These findings stress the importance of children's attachment status, and implicitly, the quality of the parent-child interactions for children's awareness of emotion regulation strategies related to negative emotions.

AB Previous work has established that caregiver and child temperamental characteristics are associated with child compliance. Given the critical role that parents play in this process, and that children of teen mothers are at risk for poorer developmental outcomes, it is important to understand the development of compliance in the context of at-risk parenting such as adolescent motherhood. The current study examined child compliance (Wave 5; W5) as a mediator of the association between adolescent mothers' social competence (Wave 4; W4) and children's behavioral and academic outcomes (Wave 6; W6), and whether this mediation varied depending on children's effortful control (W4) in a sample of 204 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers (M-age at W4=19.94, SD=.99) and their children (M-age at W4=36.21 months, SD=.45). Adolescent mothers reported on their own social competence and their children's effortful control and externalizing problems; compliance was assessed using observational methods; and academic readiness was assessed using standardized developmental assessments. Findings based on structural equation modeling revealed that adolescent mothers' social competence was positively related to children's compliance among children with high effortful control, but not among those with low effortful control. Moreover, child compliance mediated the longitudinal association between adolescent mothers' social competence and child externalizing problems and academic readiness. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering the role of child temperament in understanding how adolescent mothers' social competence is subsequently associated with children's social and academic adjustment.

AB This study examined the development of self-regulation during early childhood and the reciprocal relations between self-regulation and maternal sensitivity. Data (N=1,364) were drawn from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD SECCYD). Children's situational and committed compliance were assessed in the laboratory at 24 and 36 months, delay of gratification at 54 months, self-control at 54 months and kindergarten age, and maternal sensitivity was observed at 24, 36, and 54 months. Self-regulation was characterized to progress from situational compliance to committed compliance and then to fully self-motivated regulation. Findings also suggest that the development of self-regulation reflects an ongoing transactional process in which child self-regulation and maternal sensitivity mutually influence each other.

AB Using parallel-process latent growth curve modeling, we examine developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and identify early risk factors for behavior problems among 329 child welfare involved children followed from age 2 years to 5 years. Data are drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II. On average, internalizing behavior problems remained stable, while externalizing behavior problems decreased over time. Higher initial levels of internalizing behavior problems were associated with higher initial levels of externalizing behavior problems. Rates of change also had positive cross-domain relationships. Child neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), insecure caregiver-child attachment, and caregiver mental health problems were associated with higher initial levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Exposure to IPV, out-of-home care, and caregiver drug use predicted rates of change in behavior problems. Our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive assessment and treatment for co-occurring internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in young children involved in the child welfare system. Results also indicate the need for identifying and addressing early risk factors to prevent early onset and continued development of behavior problems in high-risk children.

AB Although childhood shyness is presumed to predict mental health problems in adulthood, no prospective studies have examined these outcomes beyond emerging adulthood. As well, existing studies have been limited by retrospective and cross-sectional designs and/or have examined shyness as a dichotomous construct. The present prospective longitudinal study (N = 160; 55 males, 105 females) examined shyness trajectories from childhood to the fourth decade of life and mental health outcomes. Shyness was assessed using parent- and self-rated measures from childhood to adulthood, once every decade at ages 8, 12-16, 22-26, and 30-35. At age 30-35, participants completed a structured psychiatric interview and an experimental task examining attentional biases to facial emotions. We found 3 trajectories of shyness, including a low-stable trajectory (59.4%), an increasing shy trajectory from adolescence to adulthood (23.1%), and a decreasing shy trajectory from childhood to adulthood (17.5%). Relative to the low-stable trajectory, the increasing, but not the decreasing, trajectory was at higher risk for clinical social anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders and was hypervigilant to angry faces. We found that the development of emotional problems in adulthood among the increasing shy trajectory might be explained in part by adverse peer and social influences during adolescence. Our findings suggest different pathways for early and later developing shyness and that not all shy children grow up to have psychiatric and emotional problems, nor do they all continue to be shy.

AB Mounting research supports that co-rumination, the tendency to seek peer support by engaging in extensive negatively focused discussion, is a risk factor for adolescent psychopathology. It is unclear, though, how this interpersonal tendency develops. Parental responses to adolescents' negative affect likely shape how youth utilize peer relationships to regulate distress, as they shift to reliance on peer support during this developmental stage. For example, nonsupportive parental responses may fail to instill healthy regulation strategies, resulting in ineffective forms of peer support, such as co-rumination. Conversely, high levels of supportive parental responses to adolescents' negative affect may motivate youth to also express more negative affect with peers, leading to co-rumination. Eighty-nine healthy adolescents (9-17) and their mothers completed surveys and a support-seeking interaction. Only supportive maternal responses, including maternal affection, were associated with adolescents' co-rumination. These analyses indicate that some forms of parental support are associated with adolescents' tendency to co-ruminate.

AB We provide the first validation data on the Spanish version of the Brief Problem Monitor-Parent form (BPM-P), a recently developed abbreviated version of the 120-item Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6 to 18 (CBCL/6-18) in young schoolchildren. Parents of a community sample of 521 children aged 6-8 answered the CBCL/6-18 yearly, and the 19 BPM-P items were examined; parents also provided different measures of psychopathology. Confirmatory factor analysis of the expected 3-factor model (attention, externalizing, and internalizing) showed adequate fit (root mean square error of approximation, RMSEA <= .057), and measurement invariance across sex and age was observed. Internal consistency for the derived scores was satisfactory (omega >= .83). Concurrent validity with the equivalent scale scores of the original full CBCL/6-18 (r >= .84) and convergent validity with parents' ratings of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores (r >= .52) were good. BPM-P scores at age 7 showed good predictive accuracy for discriminating the use of mental health services (OR >= 1.12), functional impairment (B <= -1.25), and the presence of the corresponding disorders diagnosed with an independent clinical interview, both cross-sectionally at age 7 and longitudinally at age 8 (OR >= 1.24). The BPM-P provides reliable and valid scores as a very brief follow-up and screening tool for assessing behavioral and emotional problems in young schoolchildren.
   Public Significance Statement
   This study provides evidence on validity and reliability of the Brief Problem Monitor-Parent (BPM-P) scores in 6- to 8-year-old children. Given the shortness of the questionnaire, it can be used with psychometric guarantees as a brief follow-up and screening tool for monitoring children's functioning and responses to interventions in young schoolchildren.

AB Many studies have suggested the co-occurrence of eating disorders and alcohol use disorders but in which extent binge eating (BE) and other disordered eating symptoms (DES) are associated with the severity of binge drinking (BD) remains unknown. We conducted a online cross-sectional study among 1,872 French students. Participants were asked their age, gender, tobacco and cannabis use status. They completed the Alcohol Use Questionnaire (AUQ), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and UPPS impulsive behavior questionnaire. BD score was calculated using the AUQ. Three items of the EDE-Q were used to construct a BE score. The predictors of the BD score were determined using a linear regression model. Our results showed that the BE score was correlated with the BD score (beta(0) = 0.051 +/- 0.022; p = 0.019), but no other DES was associated with BD, including purging behaviors. The severity of BD was also correlated with younger age, male gender, tobacco and cannabis use, and with the 'positive urgency,' 'premeditation,' and 'sensation seeking' UPPS subscores (R-2 of the model: 25%). Within DES, BE appeared as an independent determinant of the BD severity. This is in line with the recent hypothesis that BE is not a subtype of DES, but more a general vulnerability factor of emotional dysregulation, which could be shared by different behavioral and addictive disorders.

AB Offspring from multiplex, alcohol-dependent families are at heightened risk for substance use disorders (SUDs) in adolescence and young adulthood. These high-risk offspring have also been shown to have atypical structure and function of brain regions implicated in emotion regulation, social cognition, and reward processing. This study assessed the relationship between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) volumes obtained in adolescence and SUD outcomes in young adulthood among high-risk offspring and low-risk controls. A total of 78 participants (40 high-risk; 38 low-risk) from a longitudinal family study, ages 8-19, underwent magnetic resonance imaging; volumes of the amygdala and OFC were obtained with manual tracing. SUD outcomes were assessed at approximately yearly intervals. Cox regression survival analyses were used to assess the effect of regional brain volumes on SUD outcomes. The ratio of OFC to amygdala volume significantly predicted SUD survival time across the sample; reduction in survival time was seen in those with smaller ratios for both high-risk and low-risk groups. Morphology of prefrontal relative to limbic regions in adolescence prospectively predicts age of onset for substance use disorders.

AB Despite the flourishing in recent years in applications of positive psychology in the field of education, there is a paucity of research investigating positive psychology interventions for preschool children. The present study examined the effects of a positive psychology-based intervention conducted in Israel on children's subjective well-being, mental health and learning behaviors. Twelve preschool classrooms of 3-6.5 year-olds were randomly assigned to a positive psychology intervention condition or a wait-list control condition. In the intervention condition, during one school year, 160 children experienced eight modules of basic concepts in positive psychology that were adapted to the developmental characteristics of young children and were compared to 155 children in demographically similar control classrooms. Children were administered a pre-test and post-test of subjective well-being measures. In addition, children's mental health and emotional well-being were measured by parental questionnaires. Preschool teachers completed questionnaires concerning children's learning behaviors. The findings showed significant increases in subjective well-being and positive learning behaviors among the intervention participants, with no significant changes in the control group. The results highlight the potential of positive psychology interventions for increasing subjective well-being and a positive approach to learning at young ages.

AB Background: Young men are consistently less likely to seek help for mental health problems than their female peers. This is particularly concerning given the high rates of suicide among male adolescents. The school system has been identified as an ideal setting for the implementation of prevention and early intervention programs for young people. The current trial aims to determine the effectiveness of the Silence is Deadly program in increasing positive help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and suicide among male secondary school students.
   Methods: This study is a two-arm, cluster-randomised, controlled trial that will compare the Silence is Deadly program to a wait-list control condition. Eight Australian high schools will be recruited to the trial, with male students in grades 11 and 12 (16 to 18 years of age) targeted for participation. The program is an innovative male-tailored suicide prevention intervention, comprising a presentation that emphasises role-modelling and legitimises help-seeking for personal and emotional problems, and a brief video that features celebrity athletes who counter existing male norms around help-seeking and encourage communication about personal and emotional issues. The program also includes a discussion of how to help a friend in distress and ends with a question and answer session. The primary outcome measure for the current study is help-seeking intentions. Secondary outcomes include help-seeking behaviour, help-seeking attitudes, help-seeking stigma, mental health symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Data will be collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Primary analyses will compare changes in help-seeking intentions for the intervention condition relative to the wait-list control condition using mixed-effects repeatedmeasures analyses that account for clustering within schools.
   Discussion: If proven to be effective, this targeted help-seeking intervention for adolescent males, which is currently only delivered in one jurisdiction, could be more widely delivered in Australian high schools. The Silence is Deadly program has the potential to significantly contribute to the mental health of young men in Australia by improving help-seeking for suicidality and mental health problems, allowing this population to better access treatment and support sooner.

AB Consistent across time and cultures, men and male adolescents older than 14 years of age appear underrepresented in mood disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek psychological help. The much higher rate of suicide amongst males suggests that depression in men might be underreported. One of the core human motives is to seek acceptance by others and avoid rejection. Rejection Sensitivity (RS) has been conceptualized as the cognitive- affective processing disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely respond to cues of rejection in the behavior of others. RS has been previously linked with the onset and course of depression, but-as-yet-has not been investigated longitudinally in a clinical population. We investigated the predictive role of RS to symptom deterioration 6 months after end-of-treatment in 72 male inpatients with depressive spectrum disorder. The BDI was administered at intake, end-of-treatment and 6 month follow-up. RS scores were obtained at intake. Rejection Sensitivity had additional predictive power on BDI scores at 6 months follow-up controlling for BDI scores at end-of-treatment (Delta R-2 = .095). The results are discussed in terms of the importance of targeting RS during treatment, and highlight the fact that therapeutic follow-up care is paramount. Future research should investigate possible mediators of the RS-relapse-to-depression association, such as self-blame, rumination, neuroticism, pessimism, emotion dysregulation, and low self-esteem.

TI MENSTRUAL HYGIENE- KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE AMONG ADOLESCENT SCHOOL GIRLS
   IN RURAL AREAS OF PUNJAB
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
LA English
DT Article
DE Menstrual Hygiene; Menstruation; Adolescent Girls
AB BACKGROUND
   As per WHO, individuals of 10-19 years age are considered as adolescents. They constitute over 21.4% of the population in India. Menstruation is a phenomenon unique to girls which not only has physical but lot of psychological impact. The psychosocial and emotional problems associated with menarche are of considerable magnitude. Basics of menstrual hygiene and importance of proper care at menstruation needs to be emphasised to avoid reproductive tract infections and infertility later on.
   The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge and the practices of menstrual hygiene among rural school going adolescent girls.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   The present study was undertaken among adolescent school going girls in rural area of Ludhiana district, Punjab. The study was conducted in July 2015 on 197 school going girls. A predesigned, pretested and structured questionnaire was used in the study. The data collection technique was a personal interview of all the study subjects.
   RESULTS
   Most of the girls, 104 (52.79%), were in the age group between 14 - 16 years. Out of 197 girls, only 33 (16.75%) of the girls were aware of menstruation before menarche. More than three fourth of the girls were not aware of the cause and source of bleeding. Most of the girls, 118 (59.89%), were having regular periods. Duration in 164 (83.24% of) girls was between 5 -7 days. The major source of information about menstruation for them was found to be their mother and sister (67%). A majority, 184 (93.4%), of them had knowledge about the use of sanitary pads. 95 (48%) girls were using 3 pads per day. During menstruation, washing perineal area with soap and water (79, 40.20%), clipping of pubic hairs (136, 69%) and taking bath daily (150, 76%) appeared to be satisfactory. About half of the girls felt menstruation is a stressful condition, felt fatigued and was affecting their concentration and results in class. About one fourth of the girls needed to take holiday from school.
   CONCLUSION
   Strengthening of menstrual hygiene programmes targeting school teachers, parents and adolescents is the need of the day in India. Reproductive tract infections and infertility is a major health issue because of poor menstrual hygiene.

AB The current study explored the relations between interparental conflict, parental attachment, and emotion regulation among 404 undergraduates (322 females, 88.9% Caucasians). Data were collected through online survey. Results from conditional process analyses demonstrated that intensity of interparental conflict positively predicted late adolescents' emotion regulation whereas low resolution of interparental conflict negatively predicted emotion regulation when parental attachment was considered. Frequency of interparental conflict was not associated with parental attachment or emotion regulation. In addition, parental attachment partially mediated the relations between intensity and low resolution of interparental conflict, and late adolescents' emotion regulation. The findings supported the emotional security theory and highlighted intensity and low resolution of interparental conflict as significant contributors of late adolescents' emotion regulation, and identified parental attachment as a mechanism between the relations. Implications of the study and future research directions were discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a growing body of evidence linking fish consumption and n-3 LCPUFAs to mental health. Still, the results from randomized trials with n-3 LCPUFAs show conflicting results, and it is possible that the combined effect of several nutrients in fish may explain the observed associations. To aim of the present study was to investigate if school meals with fatty fish three times per week for 12 weeks could alter mental health in a sample of typically developing adolescents. In the Fish Intervention Studies-TEENS (FINS-TEENS), adolescents from eight secondary schools (n=425) in Norway, were randomized to receive school meals with fatty fish, meat or n-3 LCPUFA supplements. Mental health was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the differences between the groups were assessed with linear mixed effect models, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline and dietary compliance. The results showed no effects of school meals with fatty fish compared to similar meals with meat or n-3 LCPUFAs on the adolescents' self-reported symptom scores for mental health. Among adolescents scoring above the SDQ cut-offs (high-scorers), the fish-improved less than the meat group in the self-reported symptom scores for total difficulties-and emotional problems. However, the findings should be regarded as preliminary, as the analyses for the high-scorer group were underpowered. In conclusion, serving school meals with fatty fish did not alter mental health in a typically developing sample of adolescents. It is possible that serving healthy school meals with meat is more beneficial than similar meals with fatty fish in adolescents scoring high on mental health problems. However, the results should be seen as preliminary, as the dietary compliance in the fish group was low and the analyses in the high score group underpowered. Thus, further studies should investigate the associations between fish consumption and adolescents' mental health.

AB Background: Although substantial evidence suggests that maternal work hours may have a negative effect on children's cognitive development, the link between maternal work hours and children's affect remains unclear. Some studies have observed that non-daytime maternal work hours are associated with more emotional problems among children. However, few studies have focused on the effects of maternal work hours on workdays and non-workdays. Therefore, this study separately investigated the relation between maternal work hours on workdays and on non-workdays and explored the mediating role of the frequency of mother-child communication (FMCC) and the moderating role of maternal education.
   Method: Using cluster sampling, this study selected 879 students in grades 4-6 at two primary schools in the Hebei and Shandong provinces in China and their mothers as the study subjects. A multi-group structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the relations between maternal work hours, FMCC and children's affect and the moderating effect of maternal education.
   Results: (1) Non-college-educated mothers' work hours on workdays negatively predicted FMCC, but there was no such effect for college-educated mothers; (2) non-workday work hours of all employed mothers negatively predicted FMCC; (3) the FMCC of all employed mothers positively predicted children's positive affect; (4) the FMCC of college-educated mothers negatively predicted children's negative affect although there was no such relation for non-college-educated mothers; (5) there was a significant mediating effect of FMCC on the relation between maternal work hours and children's affect only for non-college-educated mothers; and (6) the workday work hours of non-college-educated mothers positively predicted children's negative affect, but this correlation was negative for college-educated mothers.
   Conclusion: Maternal work hours have a marginally significant negative effect on children's affect through FMCC only for non-college-educated mothers. Compared with non-college-educated mothers, college-educated mothers more easily compensate for the loss of communication opportunities caused by increased work hours on workdays, and children with college-educated mothers benefit more from this communication. However, compensating for the loss of communication opportunities caused by increased work hours on non-workdays is difficult for all employed mothers.

AB Mindfulness-based interventions constitute a promising option to address anxiety and depression in elementary school students. This study evaluated the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention on anxiety and depression in elementary school students with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression disorder. A single-subject experimental A-B-A design was used. Participants were three elementary school students from grades three and four, along with their teacher. Anxiety and depression were measured on 10 occasions at baseline, during the intervention, and at follow-up. Primary hypotheses were tested using a univariate single case multilevel modeling strategy and visual analysis. Following intervention, 2 participants reported improvements on anxiety and depression, while their teachers reported deteriorating scores on these variables. Results from this n-of-1 trial design is consistent with other work suggesting caution with regard to the overall impact and efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as a universal treatment option for youth. Future research is warranted.

AB Background: Resiliency is a very important component in chronic diseases like cancer. Therefore, investigating factors affecting resiliency seems to be necessary. The current study investigates the relationship between cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) and resiliency, on one hand, and the CERS role in predicting resiliency, on the other hand, among the studied population.
   Methods: In a correlational method, 121 patients with advanced cancer, who have hospitalized in January 2015 to July 2015 in ALA cancer prevention and control center, were selected. Instruments include the Garnefski-Alt cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire and Connor-Davidson resilience inventory. Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis with SPSS 20.
   Results: Findings indicate that regression model is significant and CERS can predict 95% of resiliency in the level of 99%. Also, adaptive strategies can explain resiliency's changes (62%) more than maladaptive strategies (40%) in this group. In the regression model, more use of refocus on planning, putting in to perspective, acceptance and positive refocusing as well as less use of catastrophizing, positive reappraisal, self-blame, and other-blame can predict resilience strongly. Among these strategies, catastrophizing and refocus on planning were common strategies contributing to resilience.
   Conclusions: These findings suggested that emotion regulation strategies chosen by patients with advanced cancer can effect on their resiliency's status. This issue might help us to determine potential targets for applying psychotherapeutic interventions based on CERS education in order to improve resiliency in this group.

AB Both empirical and theoretical data would seem to suggest that patients with borderline personality organization (BPO; e.g., O. F. Kernberg, 2004b) show severe problems with emotional regulation that arise due to dysfunctions in intrapsychic representation and emotional-relational processing. The research presented here examines emotional-relational processing from 2 points of view-from that of referential activity (RA) and through the process of narrative processing. A major goal of the 2 presented studies was to explore the referential and narrative processes in BPO. Study 1 compares BPO with a general group of higher personality organization, Study 2 with specified groups (neurotic personality organization [NPO] and integrated personality organization [IPO]). We hypothesized that people with BPO (in their utterances) would show lower emotional-relational processing that might manifest in higher RA processes. The RA indices (concreteness, specificity, and imagery) were significantly higher in the BPO group for narratives about negative emotional-relational situations. No intergroup differences were observed for narratives about positive emotional-relational conditions (Study 1). Moreover, when lexical indices were used, the concreteness index was higher in a statistically significant way for BPO, in comparison with NPO, and the imagery index was significantly higher in BPO than in the IPO group (Study 2). From the experience-processing point of view, results in the BPO group revealed verbal access to emotional experiences but without the reflection stage, where arousal would have connected to meaning. Taking the structure of the representation into account, the disturbance in emotional-relational processing might be explained by a splitting within the intrapsychic representation.

AB Emotion suppression may lead to ironic increases in emotional experience. More important, suppression is a transactional process, creating stress and disrupting interactions for the suppressor and those in social interactions with individuals who are suppressing emotion. However, no research has examined the behavioral consequences of emotion suppression in close relationships. We examine the possibility that emotion suppression will predict eating behaviors as a secondary emotion regulatory strategy among 1,556 parent-adolescent dyads (N = 3,112), consistent with evidence suggesting that suppression influences eating at the individual-level. Actor-partner interdependence models and structural equation modeling demonstrate that one's own emotion suppression was associated with emotional eating; greater consumption of hedonic-low nutrient, high energy dense-foods; and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (actor effects). One's partner's emotion suppression was also independently associated with one's own emotional eating; lower consumption of fruits and vegetables; and greater consumption of hedonic foods (partner effects), although this association was most consistent for adolescents' suppression and parents' eating (compared with the converse). These analyses suggest that dyadic emotion regulatory processes have implications on eating behavior. Moreover, analyses suggest that emotion suppression has potential implications on eating behaviors of others within close relationships with a suppressor, consistent with the notion that emotion regulation is a transactional process. These findings suggest that interventions to improve eating habits of parents and their adolescent children should consider dyadic emotion regulatory processes.

AB Introduction As smartphones are widely distributed nowadays, mental health apps seem to be a promising treatment tool. First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described.
   Methods and analysis 30 adolescents with AN aged 12-19 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months.
   Ethics and dissemination Results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial was approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.338.15.

AB Rumination in response to stress (stress-reactive rumination) has been linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms in adolescents. However, no work to date has examined the neural mechanisms connecting stress-reactive rumination and adolescent depressive symptoms. The present work attempted to bridge this gap through an fMRI study of 41 adolescent girls (M-age = 15.42, SD = 0.33) - a population in whom elevated levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, and social stress sensitivity are displayed. During the scan, participants completed two tasks: an emotion regulation task and a social stress task. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we found that positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the emotion regulation task mediated the association between stress-reactive rumination and depressive symptoms. These results suggest that stress-reactive rumination may interfere with the expression and development of neural connectivity patterns associated with effective emotion regulation, which may contribute, in turn, to heightened depressive symptoms.

AB Peer victimization is a widespread phenomenon especially prevalent in early adolescence. This study investigates the prevalence of peer victimization and its association with mental health problems and impact on everyday life, and the possible mediating effect of parental and peer support. Data are based on a cross-sectional health survey (N = 9,707) among adolescents (10-13 years) and their parents (N = 8,210). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure mental health problems, as well as impact on everyday life. Approximately, 17.6% of boys and 15.3% of girls reported being peer victimized. Both genders had higher symptoms of emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity than non-peer victimized adolescents. Boys had higher symptoms of emotional problems than girls. All symptom scales were strongly associated with perceived impact on everyday life. Peer and parental support buffer mental health problems among the victimized. Study indicates the importance of interventions strengthening peer support among victimized early adolescents.

AB Aims: The use of emotion regulation strategies can reduce the intensity of negative emotional experiences. Event related potentials (ERPs), specifically the late positive potential (LPP), are known to be sensitive to this modulation in adults. This is the first study to explore the neural correlates of expressive suppression in adolescents. We sought to replicate previous findings from emotion regulation studies with adult populations, show that the LPP can be modulated by expressive suppression in healthy adolescents, and examine the influence of age on LPP changes.
   Method: ERPs of 53 healthy adolescents (12-17 years old) performing an emotion regulation task (expressive suppression) were recorded.
   Results: Expressive suppression altered the LPP in adolescents with both increases and decreases noted depending on time window and recording site. The LPP during expressive suppression was decreased with increasing age.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that 1) the LPP is an effective tool to study processes associated with emotion regulation in adolescents, and 2) expressive suppression, in terms of its neural indicators, seems to become more effective with age. The nature and utility of expressive suppression as a specific form of emotion regulation in adolescents are discussed.

AB This study validated a Chinese adaptation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CCA), a self-report instrument that evaluates two emotion regulation (ER) strategies, based on the process model of ER. The ERQ-CCA was evaluated using a sample of 1381 Chinese children aged between 7 and 12 years. The internal consistencies of the two factors indicated adequate reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed good support as the structure proved to be identical with that of the original instrument. Multigroup CFA supported an invariant factor solution of the ERQ-CCA across several demographic variations (gender, age, registered permanent residence and migrant status) in different groups. Test-retest correlations over a 2-month period were calculated using a subsample of children (N = 70). Convergent validity was evaluated in relation to the model dimensions of the ERQ-CCA, Chinese version of the Children'sDepression Inventory, and Chinese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents. Results indicated that the ERQ-CCA has generally satisfactory reliability and validity in investigating the use of two ER strategies during the middle childhood developmental period.

AB We recently reported that the serotonin transporter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR moderates the relation between stress exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity. This gene-environment interaction (GxE) has been previously tied to the processing of emotional stimuli, which is increasingly recognized to be a key factor in ADHD-related impairment. The executive control and default mode brain networks play an important role in the regulation of emotion processing, and altered connectivity of these networks has also been associated with ADHD. We therefore investigated whether resting-state connectivity of either of these networks mediates the relation of 5-HTTLPR and stress exposure with ADHD severity. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, genetic, and stress exposure questionnaire data was available for 425 adolescents and young adults (average age 17.2 years). We found that 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers showed a more negative relation between stress exposure and connectivity of the executive control network than L-allele homozygotes, specifically in the pre/postcentral gyrus, striatum, and frontal pole. In the default mode network, we found a positive association between the GxE and supramarginal gyrus connectivity. Connectivity of either network did not significantly mediate the effect of this GxE on ADHD. Opposite effects of stress exposure on connectivity in the executive and default mode networks may contribute to findings that stress exposure is associated with lowered cognitive control and heightened levels of rumination and worrying, for S-allele carriers but not L-allele homozygotes. When combined, these effects on connectivity of both networks may relate to the emotional problems seen in individuals with ADHD.

AB Understanding if adoptees present a higher risk of developing psychological problems, compared to non-adopted peers, is a research topic that has aroused considerable interest. This paper reviews research results focusing on the psychological adjustment in intercountry and domestic adopted adolescents. Two hundred and fifty-eight publications were initially identified in different data-bases but, due to previously defined inclusion criteria, only twelve studies, published between January 2004 and June 2016, were analyzed. Results indicate that, when compared to non-adopted peers, these adoptees showed more psychological problems, namely in externalized behaviors, and a higher attendance at mental health services. A considerable relationship was found between the age at adoption and the likelihood of the development of behavioral and emotional problems. Nevertheless, the relevance of taking into account adoption related variables in order to understand the variability of adoptees' psychological adjustment is also underlined. This systematic review draws attention to the need for further studies in this topic resorting to more complex research designs which will allow for the identification of different pathways that may lead to (mal) adaptive functioning, psychological (mal) adjustment and the wellbeing of adolescent adoptees.

AB This study evaluated the role of psychiatric morbidity in relation to a history of suicidal behavior, with a particular focus on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Suicidality and psychiatric diagnoses were assessed in 370 incarcerated male juvenile delinquents from Northern Russia using the semi-structured K-SADS-PL psychiatric interview. A lifetime history of suicidal ideation only (24.7 %) and suicidal ideation with suicide attempts (15.7 %) was common. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the role of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. A history of suicidal ideation and of suicide attempts were associated with higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and with the number of comorbid psychiatric disorders. An ADHD diagnosis was associated with an increased risk for both suicidal ideation and for suicide attempts. The comorbidity of ADHD with drug dependence further increased the risk for suicidal ideation, while ADHD and alcohol dependence comorbidity increased the risk for suicide attempts. Our findings highlight the importance of adequately detecting and treating psychiatric disorders in vulnerable youths, especially when they are comorbid with ADHD.

AB This study examined the relationship between childhood physical abuse and adolescent suicidal ideation in Hong Kong, China. Emotional competence and resilience were investigated as possible moderators of the relationship between physical abuse and suicidal ideation. A cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling was conducted and a total of 268 valid self-administered questionnaires were completed by the participating university students. The results indicate that physical abuse in childhood is significantly associated with greater suicidal ideation among young people at university. Higher levels of emotional competence and resilience are shown to moderate the relationship between physical abuse and suicidal ideation. To decrease Chinese adolescent suicidal ideation arising out of childhood physical abuse, preventative measures are suggested; these involve enhancing adolescents' emotional competence and resilience by providing training for children and young people who are at risk. The results also suggest that there should be programs that encourage adolescents with a history of childhood physical abuse to join training groups to enhance their emotional competence and resilience in the context of Chinese communities.

AB Background: The rated severity of child mental health problems depends on who is doing the rating, whether child, carer or clinician. It is important to know how these ratings relate to each other.
   Aims: To investigate to what extent clinicians' views are associated with carers' and young people's views in routine care in the United Kingdom.
   Method: Ratings of clinician and parent/child viewpoints from a large Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) sample (ns 1773-47,299), as measured by the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) respectively, were analysed. The parent SDQ added value score (AVS), which adjusts for regression to the mean and other non-treatment change, was also included in the analyses.
   Results: Small-to-medium correlations were found between family and clinician ratings; however, ratings diverged for the lowest-function CGAS bands. Regression analyses showed that prosocial ratings from both child and parent contributed to clinician ratings. Knowing child-reported emotional problem severity made parent ratings of emotions irrelevant to clinician judgements. There was a positive association between SDQ AVS and CGAS; as hypothesised, CGAS showed more change than the SDQ AVS, suggesting that clinicians over-estimate change.
   Conclusion: This study shows the importance of multi-informant data gathering and the integration of multiple views by clinicians when monitoring outcomes.

AB The aim of this is to describe psychopathology, functioning and symptom dimensions accounting for subthreshold manifestations and developmental status in child and adolescent offspring of parents with bipolar disorder ("high-risk offspring"). The study population comprised 90 high-risk offspring (HR-offspring) and 107 offspring of community control parents (CC-offspring). Direct clinical observations and parental and offspring reports based on selected standardized clinical scales were used to assess offspring threshold and subthreshold diagnoses, symptoms and functioning. All outcomes were compared between the whole HR-offspring and CC-offspring samples and then by developmental status. After controlling for potential confounders, HR-offspring showed significantly poorer adjustment for childhood (r = 0.18, p = 0.014) and adolescence (r = 0.21, p = 0.048) than CC-offspring, as well as more emotional problems (r = 0.24, p = 0.001) and higher depression scores (r = 0.16, p = 0.021). As for differences in lifetime categorical diagnoses (threshold and subthreshold) between HR-offspring and CC-offspring, the prevalence of disruptive disorders was higher in pre-pubertal HR-offspring (OR 12.78 [1.45-112.42]), while prevalence of mood disorders was higher in post-pubertal HR-offspring (OR 3.39 [1.14-10.06]). Post-pubertal HR-offspring presented more prodromal (r = 0.40, p = 0.001), negative (r = 0.38, p = 0.002), manic (r = 0.22, p = 0.035) and depressive (r = 0.23, p = 0.015) symptoms than pre-pubertal HR-offspring, as well as more peer relationship problems (r = 0.31, p = 0.004), poorer childhood adjustment (r = 0.22, p = 0.044) and worse current psychosocial functioning (r = 0.27, p = 0.04). Externalizing psychopathology is more prevalent in pre-pubertal HR-offspring, while depressive and prodromal symptoms leading to functional impairment are more prominent in post-pubertal HR-offspring. Developmental approaches and dimensional measures may be useful for identifying children at high risk of developing bipolar disorder and help guide specific preventive strategies.

AB Objective: This study utilized a novel multisystem approach to investigate the effect of observed parental behavior on the relationship between biological mechanisms associated with disease processes (i.e., autonomic physiology and immune response) among their adolescent children. Method: Thirty-three adolescents (23 males), aged 11-13, and their parents participated in a laboratory session in which adolescents provided baseline measures of autonomic (sympathetic) activity, and adolescents and 1 parent participated in a laboratory based dyadic conflict resolution interaction task. This included 3 male parent/male adolescent dyads, 20 female parent/male adolescent dyads, 3 male parent/female adolescent dyads, and 7 female parent/female adolescent dyads. Approximately 3 years later, adolescents provided a salivary measure of C-Reactive Protein (sCRP) to index inflammation. Results: Analyses revealed a positive association between sympathetic activity and sCRP, as well as a moderating role of positive parental behavior in this relationship, such that the association between sympathetic activity and sCRP was greater among adolescents whose parents displayed shorter duration of positive affect. Conclusions: Overall findings indicate parental behavior may influence the association between adolescent sympathetic activity and inflammatory processes. These findings have important implications for understanding the impact of psychosocial factors on biological mechanisms of disease.

AB In England, clinicians and professional organisations report that higher numbers of adolescents with more severe psychosocial difficulties are accessing specialist services. A lack of national data on patterns of access to specialist services means there is limited information to inform policy. We examined whether severity of psychosocial difficulties in adolescents accessing mental healthcare has changed over time. Adolescents seen in specialist child mental healthcare in 2009 vs. 2014 were matched on demographics and problem types using propensity score matching; final sample N = 2776 adolescents. We found: 1) stability over time in overall severity of difficulties, 2) an increase in severity of young women's emotional problems, and 3) a decrease in adolescents' conduct problems. The findings suggest the intriguing possibility that the criteria for accessing mental healthcare are not universally rising, but rather the patterns in access to specialist services may mirror epidemiological changes in severity of psychosocial difficulties in the population.

AB We examined the relation of interpersonal and media exposure to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among 340 university students in the southeastern United States (73.5% female, M age = 19.38 years, SD = 1.15). We also assessed interactions and main effects of each exposure and emotion dysregulation in relation to NSSI, testing the social learning hypothesis of NSSI. Most participants endorsed medium to high levels of exposure to NSSI via media sources. More than one-third of participants were somewhat or very familiar with someone who engaged in NSSI. Almost half reported occasional or frequent conversations about NSSI. Both exposure forms were significantly related to NSSI history. However, hurdle regression analyses revealed that interpersonal exposure and emotion dysregulation, but not media exposure, were significantly associated with NSSI history and frequency. We did not find evidence for an emotion dysregulation-by-interpersonal-exposure interaction. We discuss implications for theoretical models of NSSI, limitations, and future directions.

AB Not all youth exposed to hostile marital interactions develop negative responses to marital conflict. Cooperative marital conflict has long been considered as an important way of managing conflict and may serve as an important context in which hostility might convey during marital interactions. In light of little prior attention placed on the positive side of conflict processes, the main and moderating effects of cooperative marital conflict on youth responses to marital conflict were examined in a sample of 416 2-parent families using a multimethod, 2-year prospective design. Cooperative marital conflict was associated with decreases in youth emotional dysregulation, perceived threat, and behavioral dysregulation, and increases in constructive family representations and coping efficacy. As a specific dimension of cooperation, effective conflict resolution was associated uniquely with elevated youth coping efficacy, and decreased emotional and behavioral dysregulation; marital warmth was associated uniquely with increased constructive family representations. Significant interactions between marital hostility and marital cooperation also were found. These findings highlight the importance of examining cooperation above and beyond hostility in studies of marital conflict in order to better understand youth development during early adolescence.

AB Objective: Persistent irritability and behavior outbursts in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) are associated with severe impairment in childhood and with negative adolescent and adult outcomes. There are no empirically established treatments for DMDD. This study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy adapted for preadolescent children (DBT-C) with DMDD.
   Method: Children 7 to 12 years old with DMDD (N = 43) were randomly assigned 1:1 to DBT-C or treatment as usual (TAU). The 6 domains of feasibility included recruitment, randomization, retention, attendance, participants' satisfaction, and therapist adherence. Blinded raters assessed participants at baseline, after 8, 16, 24, and 32 weeks, and at 3-month follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome was the positive response rate on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Improvements in behavior outbursts and angry/irritable mood were assessed by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale.
   Results: Mean number of participants randomized per month was 2.53 2.72. Participants in DBT-C (n = 21) attended 89% of sessions compared with 48.6% in TAU (n = 22). Eight TAU participants (36.4%) dropped out compared with none in DBT-C. Parents and children in DBT-C expressed significantly higher treatment satisfaction than those in TAU. The rate of positive response was 90.4% in DBT-C compared with 45.5% in TAU, despite 3 times as many participants in TAU receiving psychiatric medications. Remission rates were 52.4% for DBT-C and 27.3% for TAU. Improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Therapists showed adherence to DBT-C.
   Conclusion: DBT-C demonstrated feasibility in all pre specified domains. Outcomes also indicated preliminary efficacy of DBT-C.

AB We examined the relationship between bully victimization experience and depression in rural adolescents and analyzed the moderating roles of peer support and active coping in male and female students. The sample comprised N = 755 adolescents (376 females) with a mean age of 13.52 years. Through structural model and multi-group analysis, the results indicated: (1) a significant gender difference on the positive association between bullying victimization and depression; (2) peer support had a directly negative effect on depression among all boarding adolescents; and (3) significant moderating effect of active coping on the association between victimization and depression, without significant gender difference. We discuss enhancing active coping and peer support as a prevention strategy to reduce adverse mental health outcomes in adolescents due to bullying victimization.

AB Many individuals in the general population experience psychotic-like experiences in the absence of a psychotic disorder. The degree of psychological distress associated with these experiences is a key predictor of clinical outcomes. One factor that may influence the degree of distress from psychotic-like experiences is emotion regulation. Although it has been demonstrated that emotion regulation deficits are present in psychotic disorders, the association between emotion regulation and subclinical psychotic-like experiences is not well understood. Here, we examined the associations between frequency of and distress from psychotic-like experiences and several key components of emotion regulation: difficulties with emotion regulation; emotion regulation self efficacy; and emotion regulation strategy use. Difficulties with emotion regulation and maladaptive patterns of emotion regulation strategy use were associated with the frequency of both positive and negative psychotic-like experiences. In addition, results suggest that habitual acceptance use and reappraisal self-efficacy may serve as protective factors against the distress associated with psychotic-like experiences.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent during late adolescence and young adulthood. There is some evidence of a link between NSSI and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), but little is known about the association between BPD traits and the various functions that maintain NSSI. The main purpose of this study was to explore the association between borderline personality traits and NSSI functions in a sample of college students. We also compared NSSI functions in college students who engaged in NSSI to those in an age-matched sample of BPD patients. This study included a total of 238 college students and 36 BPD patients. Participants were asked to complete a number of clinical measures. In the non-clinical sample, BPD features were more pronounced in the presence of NSSI, and we observed a differential relationship between NSSI functions and psychopathological BPD-traits. The NSSI clinical variables most strongly associated with BPD were frequency, variety of methods and severity, but not age of onset. Our results provide new information on the relationship between BPD and NSSI in young adults, and could be used to improve the early detection of vulnerable BPD-individuals and in planning NSSI treatment.

AB Seclusion and restraint are commonly used by residential staff to control unsafe behaviors of youths with disabilities and complex trauma histories. This pilot study examined the effect of a nonrestraining cushion as a calming device and wellness tool in a setting that prohibits supportive physical contact, to see to what extent the cushion might help these youths to better regulate their emotional distress and unwanted behaviors. Volunteers used the cushion for 15 minutes over 24 sessions. Nine students completed the study and reported reduction in anxiety and agitation, and a soothing feeling with residual effects to their daily routines. This pilot study suggests that the use of a nonrestraining, deep-pressure cushion may simulate a secure holding effect for young people with emotional dysregulation. The cushion is a safe and healing wellness tool that empowers youths and provides programs with an alternative to seclusion and restraint.

AB Among adolescents, depressive symptoms commonly co-occur with social anxiety, with social anxiety often developmentally preceding depressive symptoms. Thus, evidence-based assessments of adolescent social anxiety should be augmented with assessments of depressive symptoms using measures that can be administered across developmental transitions (e.g., adolescence into adulthood).
   The widely used self-report measure, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), was designed to assess depressive symptoms among adolescents and adults. Yet, scarce work exists on the psychometric properties of BDI-II self-reports among adolescents, and we know of no prior study that tested the properties of BDI-II parent reports.
   We examined the BDI-II within a mixed clinical/community sample of 89 adolescents and their parents, who each provided BDI-II reports about the adolescent. Further, adolescents completed self-reports and parents provided reports of adolescents on measures of adolescent trait social anxiety and other associated features of adolescent depressive symptoms (e.g., parent-adolescent conflict; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms). Adolescents self-reported their state arousal within a 20-min mock social interaction period.
   Parent-adolescent dyads displayed low-to-moderate correspondence between their BDI-II reports. Further, adolescents' and parents' BDI-II reports related to measures of associated features of adolescent depressive symptoms, and established cut scores on the BDI-II significantly distinguished adolescents on these same features. Adolescents' BDI-II reports predicted adolescents' self-reported arousal within social interactions and distinguished adolescents on referral status.
   Adolescents and parents can provide psychometrically sound reports on the BDI-II. These findings have important implications for evidence-based assessments of adolescent depressive symptoms, when clinically assessing adolescent social anxiety.

AB This study examined the mediating role of perceived severity of trauma and rumination in the relationship between traumatic experiences and PTSD, and assessed the moderated role of resilience in this mediating process. Nine hundred and fifty-one adolescents were selected to complete a self-report questionnaire involving rainstorm -related experiences, perceived severity of trauma, rumination, resilience, and PTSD. The results found that rainstorm-related experiences had a positive effect on PTSD by perceived severity of disaster, or by rumination via perceived severity of disaster. Resilience buffered the relationship between rainstorm-related experiences and PTSD, but did not buffer the relation of rainstorm-related experiences to perceived severity of disaster and rumination. These findings indicated that rainstorm-related experiences may have an indirect effect on PTSD via cognitive activities, and these indirect paths were not buffered by resilience. A buffering effect only occurred in the direct paths from rainstorm-related experiences to PTSD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of internalizing symptoms among 541 children who were involved with the child welfare system and examined child maltreatment characteristics, including types, level of harm, and timing, as predictors of internalizing trajectory patterns. Secondary longitudinal research was conducted using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being-I, collected from 1999 to 2007 in the United States. Three distinct trajectory groups were identified: high decreasing; low increasing; and low stable Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and more severe levels of harm from maltreatment predicted membership in two maladaptive groups compared to the low stable group. The findings of the study suggest the importance of providing a thorough assessment of the type and severity of maltreatment experiences and continued monitoring of internalizing symptoms for children with child welfare involvement.

AB Purpose of Review PTSD in youth is common and debilitating. In contrast to adult PTSD, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of pediatric PTSD, nor how neurodevelopment may be altered. This review summarizes recent neuroimaging studies in pediatric PTSD and discusses implications for future study.
   Recent Findings Pediatric PTSD is characterized by abnormal structure and function in neural circuitry supporting threat processing and emotion regulation. Furthermore, crosssectional studies suggest that youth with PTSD have abnormal frontolimbic development compared to typically developing youth. Examples include declining hippocampal volume, increasing amygdala reactivity, and declining amygdalaprefrontal coupling with age.
   Summary Pediatric PTSD is characterized by both overt and developmental abnormalities in frontolimbic circuitry. Notably, abnormal frontolimbic development may contribute to increasing threat reactivity and weaker emotion regulation as youth age. Longitudinal studies of pediatric PTSD are needed to characterize individual outcomes and determine whether current treatments are capable of restoring healthy neurodevelopment.

AB Poor physiological self-regulation has been proposed as a potential biological vulnerability for adolescent suicidality. This study tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of parasympathetic stress responses on future suicide ideation. In addition, drawing from multilevel developmental psychopathology theories, the interplay between parasympathetic regulation and friendship support, conceptualized as an external source of regulation, was examined. At baseline, 132 adolescent females (M age = 14.59, SD = 1.39) with a history of mental health concerns participated in an in vivo interpersonal stressor (a laboratory speech task) and completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms and perceived support within a close same-age female friendship. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured before and during the speech task. Suicide ideation was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months follow-up. The results revealed that females with greater relative RSA decreases to the laboratory stressor were at higher risk for reporting suicide ideation over the subsequent 9 months. Moreover, parasympathetic responses moderated the effect of friendship support on suicide ideation; among females with mild changes or higher relative increases in RSA, but not more pronounced RSA decreases, friendship support reduced risk for future suicide ideation. Findings highlight the crucial role of physiological and external regulation sources as protective factors for youth suicidality.

AB Both research and popular media reports suggest that adolescent mental health has been deteriorating across societies with advanced economies. This study sought to describe the trends in self-reported symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety among Icelandic adolescents.
   Data for this study come from repeated, cross-sectional, population-based school surveys of 43 482 Icelandic adolescents in 9th and 10th grade, with six waves of pooled data from 2006 to 2016. We used analysis of variance, linear regression and binomial logistic regression to examine trends in symptom scores of anxiety and depressed mood over time. Gender differences in trends of high symptoms were also tested for interactions.
   Linear regression analysis showed a significant linear increase over the course of the study period in mean symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood for girls only; however, symptoms of anxiety among boys decreased. The proportion of adolescents reporting high depressive symptoms increased by 1.6% for boys and 6.8% for girls; the proportion of those reporting high anxiety symptoms increased by 1.3% for boys and 8.6% for girls. Over the study period, the odds for reporting high depressive symptoms and high anxiety symptoms were significantly higher for both genders. Girls were more likely to report high symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood than boys.
   Self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood have increased over time among Icelandic adolescents. Our findings suggest that future research needs to look beyond mean changes and examine the trends among those adolescents who report high symptoms of emotional distress.

AB Objective: To examine gender differences in disordered eating behaviors (DEB) and body dissatisfaction in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. While evidence shows that female youth with type 1 diabetes are more prone to DEB compared to their peers without diabetes, little is known about male adolescents. Method: In a national online survey, adolescents (13-19 years) with type 1 diabetes for similar to 1 year completed the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), and the Body Mass Index Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) and items on binge eating and insulin omission. Results: About 477 adolescents (mean age 16 years; 62% females) completed the DEPS-R and 431 the BMI-SMT. The DEPS-R total score was higher for females than males, with scores for females increasing with age. BMI, HbA1c, insulin omission, and binge-eating frequency were associated moderately with DEPS-R for both genders. On the BMI-SMT, 88% of females wanted to be thinner. Of the males, 76% reported body dissatisfaction; however, only 43% expressed a desire for thinness with the remainder desiring a larger body size. DEPS-R was positively associated with the discrepancy between perceived actual and ideal body size for both genders. Discussion: A large proportion of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, particularly females reported engaging in DEB. Similarly, high rates of body dissatisfaction were reported, though ideal body shape preferences differed by gender. Given the high levels of self-reported DEB and gender-based patterns of body dissatisfaction, future research needs to examine the effectiveness of routine screening of DEB and consider implementation of stepped care approaches.

AB Youth and adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience academic and social impairment and engage in risky behaviors. Emotion dysregulation (ED) is associated with ADHD and may contribute to these impairments and behaviors. Although many measures of ED exist, little is known about the physiological bases of ED, in the context of ADHD. In a large sample of children (M (age) = 9.01 years; 62% male) with (n = 48) and without (n = 56) ADHD, we examined (1) the correspondence between parent-reported ED and heart rate variability (HRV) - a psychophysiological marker of parasympathetic engagement and (2) whether parent-reported ED is predicted by HRV above and beyond ADHD. For both aims, we tested both dichotomous and continuous indices of parent-reported ED. Results indicated (1) a dichotomous index of parent-reported emotion regulation was associated with HRV and (2) this index was predicted by HRV above and beyond ADHD. Together, findings indicate that the correspondence between ED and HRV depends on the specific manifestation of ED that is considered (emotion regulation vs. lability/negativity) and the way in which ED is conceptualized (dichotomous vs. continuous).

AB Affective and interpersonal instability, both core features of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), have been suggested to underlie non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is the method of choice when investigating dynamic processes. Previously no study addressed affective and interpersonal instability in daily life of adolescents engaging in NSSI. Female adolescents with NSSI (n = 26) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 20) carried e-diaries on 2 consecutive weekends and were prompted in hourly intervals to rate their momentary affective state and feelings of attachment towards their mother and best friend. The majority of participants in the NSSI group also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for BPD (73%). Squared successive differences were calculated to quantify instability. Adolescents with NSSI reported less positive affect, t ((44)) = 6.94, p < 0.01, lower levels of attachment to the mother, t ((44)) = 5.53, p < 0.01, and best friend, t ((44)) = 4.36, p < 0.01. Both affective, t ((44)) = -5.55, p < 0.01, and interpersonal instability, mother: t ((44)) = -4.10, p < 0.01; best friend: t ((44)) = -4.57, p < 0.01, were significantly greater in adolescents engaging in NSSI. In the NSSI group, the number of BPD criteria met was positively correlated with affective instability, r = 0.40, p < 0.05, and instability of attachment to the best friend, r = 0.42, p < 0.05, but not instability of attachment towards the mother, r = 0.06, p = 0.79. In line with previous work in adults, NSSI is associated with affective and interpersonal instability assessed by EMA in adolescents. Preliminary findings highlight the association of affective and interpersonal instability with diagnostic criteria for BPD. Clinical implications and avenues for further research are discussed.

AB Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine whether sleep moderates the associations between family-related stress and depressive symptoms and negative affect outcomes during adolescence. We combined traditional survey measures of stress and depressive symptoms with daily assessments of stress and negative affect to examine whether sleep differentially impacts the link between chronic and acute experiences of stress and affect.& para;& para;Methods: Participants were 316 adolescents from ethnically diverse backgrounds. Primary caregivers and adolescents reported on stressful family events during the past 12 and 3 months, respectively. Adolescents also reported on their daily experiences of family demands for 15 days and wore actigraph watches for the assessment of sleep during the first eight nights.& para;& para;Results: Regression analyses revealed that more stressful family events were related to more depressive symptoms. This relation was stronger among adolescents with lower sleep efficiency. The same pattern emerged for the relation between daily family demands and negative affect aggregated across the 15 days. Daily-level analyses indicated that daily negative affect was related to daily family demands when sleep efficiency was higher than usual, but only among European American adolescents.& para;& para;Conclusions: These findings suggest that chronic experiences of lower sleep efficiency, but not sleep duration, may render adolescents more vulnerable to the negative effects of family stress on emotional adjustment. A more complex picture emerged for the role of prior night's sleep in the day-to-day variation in negative affect reactivity to family stress. (C) 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Although nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) peaks in adolescence, a significant proportion of young people continue to self-injure into emerging adulthood. Yet, little is known about factors prospectively associated with persistent NSSI. Using data from a 3-year longitudinal study (n = 1466), we compared 51 emerging adults (67.3% female; average age, 20.0 years) who continued to self-injure from adolescence and 50 emerging adults (83.7% female; average age, 20.3 years) who had ceased NSSI, on a broad range of psychosocial factors. More frequent NSSI, use of a greater number of methods, specific NSSI functions, academic and emotional distress, and lack of perceived emotion regulatory capability differentiated emerging adults who continued with NSSI and those who had ceased the behavior. Further, the relationships between social support, life satisfaction, and NSSI were mediated by perceived ability to regulate emotion. Findings from this study point to the role of personal belief in the ability to effectively regulate emotion in the cessation of NSSI. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objectives: This study aims to supplement the limitations of the preliminary study and expand the use of the Child-Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale by providing standardized T-scores for measuring function in different areas, as well as guidelines for their interpretation.
   Methods: The Child-Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale and Korean-Child Behavior Checklist were administered to a total of 623 individuals, including 467 parents of emotionally and behaviorally disturbed elementary school students, 45 parents of emotionally and behaviorally disturbed middle school adolescents and 111 parents of elementary school students with developmental disorders, as well as to a control group consisting of 186 parents of mainstream elementary school children in the Seoul metropolitan area.
   Results: In contrast to the preliminary study, the emotional domain was disassociated into two factors, negative affect and emotion regulation, and the coefficient of determination for misconduct was increased significantly. Also, the overall reliability and validity of the ChildAdolescent Functional Assessment Scale were similar to those in the preliminary study, and the item structure was consistent. This study provides standardized T-scores of function in different areas based on the revised scale, and provides guidelines for their interpretation.
   Conclusion: The Child-Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale can assist the Child Global Assessment in Functioning in providing the information necessary for case management and treatment planning by comparing the impairment severity in each area of functioning, and also determining changes in behavior and function after treatment interventions. On the other hand, this scale has yet to clearly distinguish between rebellious behavior and misconduct. Further research is necessary to provide standards for more diverse age groups and for its utilization.

AB Classrooms in Peace (Aulas en Paz) is an elementary school-based multicomponent program for prevention of aggression and promotion of peaceful relationships. Inspired by international programs and socio-emotional research, it includes (1) a classroom universal curriculum, (2) parent workshops and home visits to parents of the 10% most aggressive children, and (3) extracurricular peer groups of two aggressive and four prosocial children. Activities seek to promote socio-emotional competencies such as empathy, anger management, creative generation of alternatives, and assertiveness. A 2-year quasi-experimental evaluation was conducted with 1154 students from 55 classrooms of seven public schools located in neighborhoods with the presence of youth gangs, drug cartels, and high levels of community violence in two Colombian cities. Despite several implementation (e.g., about half of the activities were not implemented) and evaluation (e.g., randomization problems, large number of missing data, and changes between treatment and control groups) challenges, positive results were found in prosocial behavior and in reduction of aggressive behavior, according to teacher reports, and in assertiveness and reduction of verbal victimization, according to student reports. Furthermore, implementation cost (25 US dollars per student per year) was very low compared to other programs in developed countries. This study shows that the Classrooms in Peace program has an important potential to generate positive results and highlights the challenges of implementing and evaluating prevention programs in highly violent environments.

AB Background: The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Short Form for Adolescents (DAPP-SF-A) is an age-adapted version of the DAPP Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). The psychometric properties of this questionnaire were established by Tromp and Koot. However, norming data are currently available exclusively for Dutch adolescents.
   Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide community-based norming data for the DAPP-SF-A in Flemish adolescents and separately for boys and girls. The second aim was to compare the Flemish norms with the Dutch norms.
   Method: The sample consisted of 425 adolescents (52% girls), aged 16 to 21 years (mean, 18.6; SD, 1.16), from the general Flemish population. In 2012, all respondents completed the DAPP-SF-A and the Youth Self-Report as a part of the longitudinal Flemish Study on Parenting, Personality, and Development.
   Results: Internal consistency reliabilities of the lower-order dimensions were acceptable to good (a ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, median=0.85, mean item-rest correlations ranged from 0.44 to 0.67). The lower-order dimensions showed distinctive mean patterns for boys and girls, with higher scores for girls on Affective Instability and Insecure Attachment [effect sizes (d) were both -0.35] and higher scores for boys on all lower-order dimensions of Dissocial Behavior, Inhibitedness, and three lower-order dimensions of Emotional Dysregulation (d ranged from 0.21 to 0.79). The comparison of the Flemish scores with the Dutch scores showed substantial inter-cultural differences (d ranged from 0.13 to -1.78).
   Conclusions: The DAPP-SF-A shows satisfactory reliability in a Flemish community-based sample of adolescents. Furthermore, given the differences between boys and girls, the use of gender-based norms seems appropriate. Finally, substantial differences with the Dutch general population norms warrant the use of separate norms in Flemish adolescents.

AB The rate of concussions in adolescents has risen over the last decade, resulting in cognitive and emotional problems. Neurologists recommend cognitive and physical rest during the recovery period, followed by a transitional return-to-classroom protocol. The purpose of the study was to develop and test an instrument that explores the beliefs and roles of school nurses in concussion care management. The instrument was a cross-sectional descriptive survey based on the theory of planned behavior, using Qualtrics (R). The psychometric properties of the instrument were assessed through exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal rotation. The reliability of the instrument was assessed for internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's . Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin for sample adequacy was .8; Cronbach's strong (.851).

AB Psychological inflexibility (PI) refers to the overarching and nonadaptive avoidance of thoughts and feelings. PI is a transdiagnostic process that is present in numerous psychopathologies, such as anxiety and mood disorders, addictive behaviors, and chronic pain, as presented by American adults and adolescents. Despite the high rates of depression and depressed mood among Spanish and Latino adolescents and the observed relation between PI and adjustment problems at this age, an instrument assessing PI in Spanish-speaking adolescents is lacking. In this study, we assessed the psychometric properties of a Spanish adaptation of the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth with 483 students from Spain (mean age 13.89 years). The Spanish Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth proved to be a two-factor psychometrically sound instrument. Total PI scores correlated positively with depression and negatively with satisfaction with life. The predictive validity results showed cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance to be two interrelated but distinct processes that characterize PI.

AB Background: Autism is generally associated with poor functional outcome but little is known about predictors of quality of life, especially during early adulthood. This study was conducted to assess subjective quality of life during early adulthood in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and its relation with self-regulating abilities. Individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who progressed into post-secondary higher education (N=75) were compared to a typical peer control group (N=28) based on behavioral self-report questionnaires. The results indicated that individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder reported significantly lower subjective quality of life than typical controls (p<0.001, effect size (d)=1.84). In addition, individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder reported more problems with emotion processing (p<0.05, effect size (d)=0.79) and daily executive functioning (p<0.001, effect size (d)=1.29) than controls. A higher level of executive functioning problems was related to lower quality of life in the high-functioning autism spectrum disorder group, but no significant relation between level of emotion processing and subjective quality of life became apparent in the regression analysis. Our findings show that even in high-functioning young adults with autism, executive functioning, emotion processing, and subjective quality of life are low compared to typically developing peers. Furthermore, these results emphasize the importance of targeting executive functioning problems in individuals with autism to improve subjective quality of life.

AB Anxious youth may experience altered positive affect (PA) relative to healthy youth, perhaps because of greater sensitivity to social experiences. Altered PA may be especially evident during the transition to adolescence, a period in which positive social events increase in salience and value. The current study evaluated whether anxious youth show differences in baseline PA, rate of return to baseline, and variability around baseline PA and tested whether these differences would depend on social context and anxiety subtype. Participants were 176 9- to 14-year-old youth, including 130 clinically anxious (with Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and/or Separation Anxiety Disorder) and 46 healthy youth. Youth reported their current PA, peak PA in the past hour, and social context in natural settings using ecological momentary assessment. Hierarchical linear models showed that both socially anxious and other anxious youth showed greater variability of PA relative to healthy youth. Youth with other anxiety disorders showed higher peak PA to a positive event relative to healthy youth. Feeling close to a friend was associated with higher peak PA, especially for socially anxious youth. Socially anxious youth showed significantly lower peak PA relative to both healthy and other anxious youth when interacting with a less close peer, but similar levels to these youth when interacting with a close friend. These findings suggest that clinically anxious youth may more sensitive to positive events and social interactions than healthy youth. Findings provide potential treatment targets for anxious youth, including applying regulatory strategies to positive events.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) benefit from parent involvement in their therapy, and there is evidence that this involvement may improve parent functioning as well. We examined changes in parent mental health, parenting, and expressed emotion, following participation in a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy for 57 children with ASD. Post-intervention, improvements occurred in the treatment group in parent depression and emotion regulation, compared to waitlisted parents. Treatment effects also occurred across all parents in depression, emotion regulation, perceptions of their children and mindful parenting. Though preliminary, these results have implications for intervention development and evaluation by focusing on parent outcomes in child treatment.

AB The early identification of ruminative processes in children and early adolescents is particularly important to prevent the development of a stable ruminative style in later stages of development. The present study first aimed at validating a child-friendly tool, Kid Rumination Interview (KRI), to be used in a sample aged 7-12 years (n = 100; 50% females). Second, we hypothesized that maternal depression, family functioning and participants' emotion regulation skills would be associated with children' levels of rumination. Factor analysis on KRI scores yielded two main factors: personal life-related rumination and school-related rumination. Older and female participants showed higher tendencies to ruminate about school issues compared to their younger and male counterparts. A low-to-moderate correlation emerged between school-related rumination and child/early adolescent's emotion regulation capacities. Mothers' depressive rumination and mothers' depressive symptoms were positively associated with children/early adolescents' rumination about personal life and rumination about school issues. Conversely, an adequate and positive family functioning was negatively correlated with both school-related rumination and rumination about personal life. Hierarchical regression analyses pointed to a crucial role of maternal rumination and familiar rigidity in both types of rumination. Personal life-related rumination was also specifically predicted by maternal depression and family enmeshment, whereas school-related rumination was significantly associated with children/early adolescents' emotional control and gender. Overall, the KRI appears as a promising tool to assess rumination in children/early adolescents. Results suggests partially different pathways to specific forms of ruminative thoughts.

AB The current study examines the relation between distress tolerance, perceived stress, and internalizing symptoms across adolescence. Participants included 331 youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5 years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions, including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand the emergence of internalizing symptomology.

AB This study examined the independent and interactive contributions of maternal depression and youth stress responses to trajectories of youth depression in adolescence. Youths (n = 165, M age = 12.43, SD = 1.18) and their maternal caregivers participated in a 4-year longitudinal study. Mothers and youths were administered diagnostic interviews assessing depression, and youths provided reports of their responses to peer stress. Consistent with an interactive model, adaptive responses to stress (high effortful engagement and low involuntary disengagement) buffered the effect of maternal depression on initial levels and trajectories of youth depression, with gender differences emerging. Consistent with a dual-risk model, maternal depression and maladaptive responses to stress (high effortful disengagement and involuntary engagement) contributed additive risks such that youths displayed the highest levels of depression when they were exposed to maternal depression and showed maladaptive stress responses. This research provides novel evidence that responses to stress contribute to individual differences in depression among offspring of depressed mothers, and suggests that responses to stress are an important target for efforts to promote resilience in at-risk youth.

TI FKBP5 moderation of the relationship between childhood trauma and

AB Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as rumination and catastrophizing, are transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology. PK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) has been found to moderate the relationship between stressful life events and various psychiatric disorders. Given the cross-disorder moderation effect of FKBP5 at the diagnostic level, the aim of the current study was to examine whether the relationship between exposure to childhood trauma and transdiagnostic maladaptive emotion regulation processes would also be moderated by genetic FKBP5 variation in a community sample of adolescents, We hypothesized that adolescent carriers of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype composed of rs9296158, rs3800373, rs1360780, and rs9470080, that has been associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders in adulthood, would also show higher levels of rumination and catastrophizing. Participants included 1345 genotyped adolescents (M-age = 13.95, 64.2% female; 100% European Caucasians of Portuguese descent) who completed self-report measures on exposure to childhood trauma and emotion regulation strategies. Genotypes of rs9296158, rs3800373, rs1360780, and rs9470080 were used to estimate the CATT haplotype (carriers versus non-carriers). Consistent with our hypotheses and previous findings, adolescent CATT haplotype carriers with higher levels of childhood trauma endorsed higher levels of both rumination and catastrophizing compared to non-carriers. Given the association of these maladaptive emotion regulation processes and psychiatric disorders, the findings suggest possible psychological mechanisms why FKBP5 haplotype carriers exposed to childhood trauma are more vulnerable to developing a psychiatric disorder later in life.

AB This study examines possible bidirectional relationships between emotion regulation and motives related to consuming palatable foods during adolescence. Participants included 79 adolescents (96% African American) who took part in Waves 2 and 3 of the Coping with Violence Study. The youth were recruited from four public middle schools serving low income, urban communities in Birmingham, AL. Participants completed self-report measures of emotion regulation and indicated different motives for consuming tasty foods and drinks at both waves. Results demonstrate that poorer emotion regulation at Wave 2 predicted more frequent endorsement of eating motives related to coping and conforming at Wave 3. Eating motives at Wave 2 were not associated with changes in emotion regulation at Wave 3. The results suggest that emotion regulation problems in adolescence may contribute to obesity and related negative outcomes through greater consumption of unhealthy food for coping and social conformity reasons.

AB The current research aims to investigate the multiple mediation of loneliness and negative affects in the relationship between adolescents' social anxiety and depressive symptoms. Study participants, selected through convenience sampling, consisted of a total of 263 students, including 155 females (59%) and 108 males (41%), attending various high schools in a city in the mid Black Sea Region. Participant students' ages ranged between 14 and 18, with an average age of 15.05 (SD-=.90). Data for the current study were collected through the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents, UCLA Loneliness Scale Short Form, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Adolescents, Depression Scale for Children, and Personal Information Form. Current research data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, and an approach based on Ordinary Least Squares Regression, and the Bootstrap Method. The current study findings indicated that loneliness and negative affects, both separately and together, mediated the relationship between social anxiety and depressive symptoms. No significant difference was found in the comparison conducted to reveal the more powerful mediating variable in terms of mediation effect. In addition, it was found that the model overall was significant and it explained 44% of the total variance in depressive symptoms. A discussion about and interpretation of findings obtained in the current study were included along with suggestions for relevant practitioners.

AB Interpersonal Acceptance-Rejection theory (IPARTheory) provides a good theoretical framework to explain the parenting dimensions that influence children's social, cognitive and emotional adjustment. This theory develops one main dimension, warmth-rejection, where warmth would be one pole of the dimension and rejection the opposite one. Besides, the theory has also defined behavioral control dimension with two poles: permissiveness-strictness. In the context of this theory, our study was conducted with a sample of Spanish parents to (a) examine whether parental perceived acceptance-rejection was related to parental behavioral control; (2) analyze how behavioral control dimension worked in acceptance-rejection theory; and (3) examine whether there were differences in the relations obtained between fathers and mothers. We have to conclude that control behavior correlates positively with warmth behaviors. Fathers' and mothers' correlations among these dimensions show that parents can develop certain control behaviors but that they are compatible with affection conducts.

AB Background: Heavy and/or harmful alcohol use while in college is a perennial and significant public health issue. Despite the plethora of cross-sectional research suggesting deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain, there is a lack of literature investigating the longitudinal effects of alcohol consumption on the adolescent brain. We aim to probe the longitudinal effects of college drinking on gray matter change in students during this crucial neurodevelopmental period.
   Methods: Data were derived from the longitudinal Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students (BARCS) study of whom a subset underwent brain MRI scans at two time points 24 months apart. Students were young adults with a mean age at baseline of about 18.5 years. Based on drinking metrics assessed at both baseline and followup, subjects were classified as sustained abstainers/light drinkers (N = 45) or sustained heavy drinkers (N = 84) based on criteria established in prior literature. Gray matter volumetric change (GMV-c) maps were derived using the longitudinal DARTEL pipeline as implemented in SPM12. GMV-c maps were then subjected to a 1 -sample and 2 -sample t -test in SPM12 to determine within- and between group GMV-c differences in drinking groups. Supplementary between -group differences were also computed at baseline only.
   Results: Within -group analysis revealed significant decline in GMV in both groups across the 2 year followup period. However, tissue loss in the sustained heavy drinking group was more significant, larger per region, and more widespread across regions compared to abstainers/light drinkers. Between group analysis confirmed the above and showed a greater rate of GMV-c in the heavy drinking group in several brain regions encompassing inferior/medial frontal gyrus, parahippocampus, and anterior cingulate. Supplementary analyses suggest that some of the frontal differences existed at baseline and progressively worsened.
   Conclusion: Sustained heavy drinking while in college was associated with accelerated GMV decline in brain regions involved with executive functioning, emotional regulation, and memory, which are critical to everyday life functioning. Areas of significant GMV decreases also overlapped largely with brain reward and stress systems implicated in addictive behavior.

AB There are a growing number of studies on structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that IGD adolescents and adults had reduced gray matter volume in regions associated with attention motor coordination executive function and perception. Adolescents with IGD showed lower white matter (WM) integrity measures in several brain regions that are involved in decision- making, behavioral inhibition, and emotional regulation. IGD adolescents had also disruption in the functional connectivity in areas responsible for learning memory and executive function, processing of auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli and relay of sensory and motor signals. IGD adolescents also had decreased functional connectivity of PFC- striatal circuits, increased risk- taking choices, and impaired ability to control their impulses similar to other impulse control disorders. Recent studies indicated that altered executive control mechanisms in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be a predisposition for developing IGD. Finally, patients with IGD have also shown an increased functional connectivity of several executive control brain regions that may related to comorbidity with ADHD and depression. The behavioral addiction model argues that IGD shows the features of excessive use despite adverse consequences, withdrawal phenomena, and tolerance that characterize substance use disorders. The evidence supports the behavioral addiction model of IGD by showing structural and functional changes in the mechanisms of reward and craving (but not withdrawal) in IGD. Future studies need to investigate WM density and functional connectivity in IGD in order to validate these findings. Furthermore, more research is required about the similarity in neurochemical and neurocognitive brain circuits in IGD and comorbid conditions such as ADHD and depression.

AB Background: Long-term effects of neglect in early life are still widely unknown. Diversity of outcomes can be explained by differences in genetic risk, epigenetics, prenatal factors, exposure to stress and/or substances, and parent-child interactions. Very common sub-threshold presentations of children with history of early trauma are challenging not only to diagnose but also in treatment.
   Case presentation: A Caucasian 4-year-old, adopted at 8 months, male patient with early history of neglect presented to pediatrician with symptoms of behavioral dyscontrol, emotional dysregulation, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, obsessions with food, and attachment issues. He was subsequently seen by two different child psychiatrists. Pharmacotherapy treatment attempted included guanfacine, fluoxetine and amphetamine salts as well as quetiapine, aripiprazole and thioridazine without much improvement. Risperidone initiated by primary care seemed to help with his symptoms of dyscontrol initially but later the dose had to be escalated to 6 mg total for the same result. After an episode of significant aggression, the patient was admitted to inpatient child psychiatric unit for stabilization and taper of the medicine.
   Conclusions: The case illustrates difficulties in management of children with early history of neglect. A particular danger in this patient population is polypharmacy, which is often used to manage transdiagnostic symptoms that significantly impacts functioning with long term consequences.
